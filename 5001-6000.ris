AB  - BackgroundEvidence-based psychotherapies available to treat patients with bipolar disorders (BD) are limited. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) may target several common symptoms of BD. We conducted a systematic review on the efficacy of DBT for mood symptoms in patients with BD. The systematic search used key words related to DBT and BD in Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases from 1980 to April 1st, 2022. We included studies that enrolled patients with a BD I or II diagnosis (DSM or ICD), age 12 and older who received a DBT-based intervention. Studies reviewed were clinical trials including observational studies that reported at least one outcome related to BD mood symptoms or severity. We did not exclude based upon psychiatric or physical co-morbidity.ResultsWe screened 848 abstracts and reviewed 28 full texts; 10 publications with 11 studies met our pre-determined eligibility criteria. All but one were feasibility pilot studies and most included participants in all mood states except for mania. The studies provided preliminary evidence suggesting these interventions may be effective for improving several core symptoms of BD. Overall, all the studies consistently supported that DBT-based interventions are feasible and acceptable for patients with BD.ConclusionDBT may be an effective treatment for BD; however, the confidence in this conclusion is limited by the small sample sizes, heterogeneity, and high risk of bias in all published trials. Larger well-designed RCTs are now required to establish the effectiveness of DBT in BD.

AB  - Sleep disorders are common among pregnant females. However, its association with postpartum depression (PPD) is unknown. We aimed to assess if sleep disorders during pregnancy increase the risk of PPD by a systematic review. The databases of PubMed, CENTRAL, ScienceDirect, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for studies reporting the association between any type of sleep disorder during pregnancy and the risk of PPD. Effect sizes were pooled in a random-effects model. Sixteen studies with data of 12,614 women were included. Meta-analysis indicated that sleep disorders during pregnancy resulted in a statistically significant increased risk of PPD (OR: 2.36 95% CI: 1.72, 2.32). The overall result had high heterogeneity (I-2 = 84%). Sub-group analysis based on study location (Asian vs Western), sample size (> 500 vs < 500), depression scale, and PPD assessment time did not change the results. However, we found that only poor sleep quality but not insomnia was associated with PPD. The risk was also increased only with sleep disorders measured in the 3rd trimester but not for the 1st and 2nd trimesters. Evidence suggests that sleep disorders during pregnancy may increase risk of PPD. The risk is high for sleep disorders occurring in the 3rd trimester. Based on these findings, there is a need for thorough screening and subsequent corrective measures to ensure adequate and quality sleep among pregnant females.

AB  - Background: Forced displacement is associated with elevated risk for poor psychosocial wellbeing, yet there remains a lack of clarity around the effectiveness of commonly implemented psychosocial support interventions focused on preventing disorder and promoting wellbeing. This study aimed to synthesize the literature on evaluations of psychosocial support interventions for populations affected by forced displacement.Methods: We searched for peer reviewed and gray literature in seven databases (PubMed, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, SocIndex, PsychInfo, PILOTS), fifteen organizational websites, and via solicitation through multiple networks. Various study designs were included, with the criteria that they report an evaluation of a psychosocial intervention delivered to populations affected by forced displacement, and included quantitative or qualitative data on psychosocial outcomes. Records were screened independently by two reviewers at both title/abstract and full-text review; data was double-extracted and study quality assessed, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Meta-analyses for seven outcomes were conducted on a subset of 33 studies.Results: We identified 162 reports. Over half (55%) used a single-group study design, with fewer using non-random (19%) or randomized (21%) comparisons. Study designs incorporating comparison conditions were less likely to report positive findings than single-group studies. In the meta-analyses, a moderately strong overall effect was found for psychosocial wellbeing (ES:-0.534, 95% CI: [-0.870,-0.197], p=.005); small effects on both internalizing (ES:-0.152, 95% CI: [-0.310, 0.005], p= .057) and externalizing (ES:-0.249, 95% CI: [-0.515, 0.016], p=.064) problems were promising but not conclusive. Subgroup analysis suggested differential impacts on internalizing problems for adults (improvement; ES:-0.289, 95% CI: [-0.435,-0.143], p=.001) and children (worsening; ES: 0.129, 95% CI: [.054, 0.204], p=.002). Other subgroup analyses showed little meaningful variation by context, population, or intervention characteristics.Conclusion: Pragmatic, field-driven program evaluations are dominated by single-group designs with significant risk of bias. Findings from controlled studies are promising but highlight a need for more rigorous research to support causal inference, align outcomes with theories of change, improve measurement of more positive or wellbeing-focused outcomes, examine subgroup differences, and report potentially negative impacts.

AB  - BackgroundStructured care pathways (SCPs) consist of treatment algorithms that patients advance through with the goal of achieving remission or response. These SCPs facilitate the application of current evidence and adequate treatment, which potentially benefit patients with mood disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an updated synthesis of SCPs for the treatment of depressive disorders and bipolar disorder (BD).MethodPubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched through June 2022 for peer-reviewed studies examining outcomes of SCPs. Eligibility criteria included being published in a peer-reviewed journal in the English language, reporting of intervention used in the SCP, and having quantitative outcomes. Studies Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess quality of RCTs.ResultsThirty-six studies including 15,032 patients were identified for qualitative synthesis. Six studies included patients with BD. The studies were highly heterogeneous in design, outcome measures, and algorithms. More than half of the studies reported superiority of SCPs over treatment as usual, suggesting that the standardized structure and consistent monitoring inherent in SCPs may be contributing to their effectiveness. We also found accumulating evidence supporting feasibility of SCPs in different settings, although dropout rates were generally higher in SCPs. The studies included were limited to being published in peer-reviewed journals in English language. The heterogeneity of studies did not allow quantitative evaluation.ConclusionsThe findings of our study suggest that SCPs are equally or more effective than treatment as usual in depression and BD. Further studies are required to ascertain their effectiveness, particularly for BD, and to identify factors that influence their feasibility and success.

AB  - SignificanceThe data shows a limited number of public health interventions tailored to address and reduce postpartum depression in this marginalized population. The recommendations included in the review highlight the need for public health professionals to develop programs to support African American women during the postpartum period.
   Objective The literature review reports on programs and interventions that address postpartum depression (PPD) in African American women. African American women are at a higher risk of developing PPD compared to white women. The review will highlight and recommend approaches that may render positive outcomes in the future for this population.Methods A systematic scoping literature review was conducted using Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, APA PsycArticles, APA PsychInfo, PubMed, Social Services Abstracts, and Social Work Abstracts. Keywords used in the search included "postpartum depression," "African American," and "interventions OR programs OR therapy OR treatment." Fourteen studies were selected, analyzed, and included in the review.ResultsGroup psychosocial, individual psychosocial, internet-based, and integrated care interventions were included. While many articles noted within group changes in depression symptoms, fewer studies documented between group differences. Studies that investigated subsamples of "high risk" participants or those that used "culturally tailored" approaches showed promise.ConclusionThe literature review yielded some examples of programs/interventions that target postpartum depression in African American women; however, results were mixed. More research is needed to confirm the most effective interventions to address postpartum depression in African American women.

AB  - Since the beginning of medical science, much research have focused on the psychopathological effects of traumatic experiences. Despite in past centuries the scientific literature on mental health has been mainly focused on the harmful effects of traumatic occurrences, more recently the idea of "post-traumatic growth" emerged, on the basis of a growing interest in the characteristics of resilience and possible positive consequences of trauma. In this framework, increasing attention is now being paid to the psychological meaning of PTG, with a consistent number of psychopathological and epidemiological studies on this subject, but limited literature focused on neurobiological correlates or eventual biomarkers of this condition. The present work aimed to summarize and review the available evidence on neurobiological correlates of PTG and their psychological and clinical meaning. Results highlighted a variety of biochemical and neurobiological differences between PTG and non-PTG individuals, partially corroborating findings from earlier research on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, although promising, findings in this field are still too limited and additional studies on the neurobiological correlates of traumatic experiences are needed in order to gain a better understanding of the subject.

AB  - Empirical evidence indicates a significant bidirectional association between mental disorders and physical diseases, but the prospective impact of men-tal disorders on clinical outcomes of physical diseases has not been comprehensively outlined. In this PRISMA- and COSMOS-E-compliant umbrella review, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Joanna Briggs Institute Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, up to March 15, 2022, to identify systematic reviews with meta-analysis that examined the prospective association between any mental disorder and clinical outcomes of physical diseases. Primary outcomes were disease-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were disease-specific incidence, functioning and/or disability, symptom severity, quality of life, recurrence or progression, major cardiac events, and treatment-related outcomes. Additional inclusion criteria were further applied to primary studies. Random effect models were employed, along with I-2 statistic, 95% prediction intervals, small-study effects test, excess significance bias test, and risk of bias (ROBIS) assessment. Associations were classified into five credibility classes of evidence (I to IV and non-significant) according to established criteria, complemented by sensitivity and subgroup analyses to examine the robustness of the main analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a new package for conducting umbrella reviews (). Population attributable fraction (PAF) and generalized impact fraction (GIF) were then calculated for class I-III associations. Forty-seven systematic reviews with meta-analysis, encompassing 251 non-overlapping primary studies and reporting 74 associations, were included (68% were at low risk of bias at the ROBIS assessment). Altogether, 43 primary outcomes (disease-specific mortality: n=17; all-cause mortality: n=26) and 31 secondary outcomes were investigated. Although 72% of associations were statistically significant (p<0.05), only two showed convincing (class I) evidence: that between depressive disorders and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure (hazard ratio, HR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.26-1.65), and that between schizophrenia and cardiovascular mortality in patients with cardiovascular diseases (risk ratio, RR=1.54, 95% CI: 1.36-1.75). Six associations showed highly suggestive (class II) evidence: those between depressive disorders and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (HR=2.84, 95% CI: 2.00-4.03) and with kidney failure (HR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.31-1.51); that between depressive disorders and major cardiac events in patients with myocardial infarction (odds ratio, OR=1.52, 95% CI: 1.36-1.70); that between depressive disorders and dementia in patients with diabetes mellitus (HR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.77-2.52); that between alcohol use disorder and decompensated liver cirrhosis in patients with hepatitis C (RR=3.15, 95% CI: 2.87-3.46); and that between schizophrenia and cancer mortality in patients with cancer (standardized mean ratio, SMR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.41-2.15). Sensitivity/subgroup analyses confirmed these results. The largest PAFs were 30.56% (95% CI: 27.67-33.49) for alcohol use disorder and decompensated liver cirrhosis in patients with hepatitis C, 26.81% (95% CI: 16.61-37.67) for depressive disorders and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus, 13.68% (95% CI: 9.87-17.
   58) for depressive disorders and major cardiac events in patients with myocardial infarction, 11.99% (95% CI: 8.29-15.84) for schizophrenia and cardiovascular mortality in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and 11.59% (95% CI: 9.09-14.14) for depressive disorders and all-cause mortality in patients with kidney failure. The GIFs confirmed the preventive capacity of these associations. This umbrella review demonstrates that mental disorders increase the risk of a poor clinical outcome in several physical diseases. Prevention targeting mental disorders - particularly alcohol use disorders, depressive disorders, and schizophrenia - can reduce the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes in people with physical diseases. These findings can inform clinical practice and trans-speciality preventive approaches cutting across psychiatric and somatic medicine.

AB  - The neurobiological mechanism of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is poorly understood. The inhibition of GABA neurons, especially in the amygdala, is crucial for the precise regulation of the consolidation, expression, and extinction of fear conditioning. The GABAergic system is involved in the pathophysiological process of PTSD, with several studies demonstrating that the function of the GABAergic system decreases in PTSD patients. This paper reviews the preclinical and clinical studies, neuroimaging techniques, and pharmacological studies of the GABAergic system in PTSD and summarizes the role of the GABAergic system in PTSD. Understanding the role of the GABAergic system in PTSD and searching for new drug targets will be helpful in the treatment of PTSD.

AB  - Simple Summary For millennia, humankind has had a symbiotic relationship with different bacterial species, called the microbiota. Our microbiota can affect the homeostasis, the health status and the various functions of our body. In this paper, correlations between gut microbiota (GM) and several neurodegenerative processes will be analyzed. We focus our analysis on the possible alterations to the GM (dysbiosis) and their consequences on the human nervous system. Generally, there is an exchange of molecules between the bacterial and the nervous cell populations. An alteration of this communication can evolve into a range of pathological conditions. The present analysis covers the different altered molecular mechanisms and the pathological states observed in conjunction with them. The knowledge of these mechanisms could lead to the development of new therapeutic targets that could counteract neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The microbiome research field has rapidly evolved over the last few decades, becoming a major topic of scientific and public interest. The gut microbiota (GM) is the microbial population living in the gut. The GM has many functions, such as maintaining gut homeostasis and host health, providing defense against enteric pathogens, and involvement in immune system development. Several studies have shown that GM is implicated in dysbiosis and is presumed to contribute to neurodegeneration. This review focuses mainly on describing the connection between the intestinal microbiome alterations (dysbiosis) and the onset of neurodegenerative diseases to explore the mechanisms that link the GM to nervous system health, such as the gut-brain axis, as well as the mitochondrial, the adaptive humoral immunity, and the microvesicular pathways. The gut-brain communication depends on a continuous bidirectional flow of molecular signals exchanged through the neural and the systemic circulation. These pathways represent a possible new therapeutic target against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Progress in this context is desperately needed, considering the severity of most neurodegenerative diseases and the current lack of effective treatments.

AB  - Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in most neurological disorders and can have a major impact on the patient's disability and quality of life. However, mostly due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and the complexity of the underlying comorbidities, depression can be difficult to diagnose, resulting in limited recognition and in undertreatment. The early detection and treatment of depression simultaneously with the neurological disorder is key to avoiding deterioration and further disability. Although the neurologist should be able to identify and treat depression initially, a neuropsychiatry team should be available for severe cases and those who are unresponsive to treatment. Neurologists should be also aware that in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, different depression symptoms could develop at different stages of the disease. The treatment options for depression in neurological diseases include drugs, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and somatic interventions, among others, but often, the evidence-based efficacy is limited and the results are highly variable. Here, we review recent research on the diagnosis and treatment of depression in the context of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and strokes, with the aim of identifying common approaches and solutions for its initial management by the neurologist.

AB  - Many people suffer from chronic conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, or depression. The use and development of meditation interventions to offer complementary psychological treatment for such patients is increasing, as is criticism of research on this topic. Therefore, the aim of the present rapid review and meta-analysis is to investigate the effects of meditation interventions in randomized controlled trials of clinical populations on perceived stress and well-being. A search was conducted in MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, CINAHL, PsycArticles, and PSYNDEX between July 2013 and April 13, 2021. Three-level random effect models were estimated. Based on 316 effect sizes, small effects of meditation interventions were found (stress: g = 0.18; well-being: g = 0.25) largely paralleling findings of a previous meta-analysis. An important limitation is the potentially high risk of bias for individual studies. Overall, meditation interventions appear to be beneficial for complementary treatment of chronic clinical conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) diving is a popular water activity. In our review, we collect data concerning cognitive function impairment in recreational, technical and saturation diving. Cognitive functions such as alertness, memory and decision making seem to be crucial for divers' safety. More research should be conducted to clearly define the degrees of diving influence on cognitive functions. We present the collected data following division into acute and chronic effects of diving on cognitive functioning. In addition, we describe high-pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS) as deep dives are becoming commonplace. Our summary gathers the available data concerning impaired cognitive functioning in diving. There is a need for more research to be performed to allow further conclusions to be made in this field. Scuba diving as a recreational activity is becoming increasingly popular. However, the safety of this activity, especially in the out-of-comfort zone, has been discussed worldwide. The latest publications bring conclusions regarding negative effects on cognitive functions. We compare the acute and chronic effects of diving on cognitive functioning depending on the type of dive performed, including recreational, technical and saturation diving. However, the results of research show that acute and chronic effects on cognitive functions can be negative. While acute effects are reversible after the ascent, chronic effects include white matter lesions in magnetic resonance imaging scans. We believe that more investigations should be performed to determine the chronic effects that could be observed after a few months of observations in a group of regular, intense divers. In addition, publications referring to technical divers are very limited, which is disquieting, as this particular group of divers seems to be neglected in research concerning the effects of diving on cognitive functions.

AB  - ObjectivesStudies have demonstrated an association between doctors' perceived working conditions, and their psychological well-being and patient care. However, few have examined inter-relationships among these three domains, and even fewer using longitudinal designs. Using meta-analytical structural equation modelling, we tested longitudinal relationships among doctors' perceived working conditions, their psychological well-being and patient care. We further tested if doctors' psychological well-being mediates the relationship between perceived working conditions and patient care. MethodsWe carried out a systematic review using Academic Search Premier, Business Source Premier, PsycInfo, PsycArticles and Medline for the 20-year period between January 2000 and the start of the pandemic (January 2020). We included studies with practising doctors as participants, and that reported a quantifiable bivariate effect size between at least two of the three constructs of interest-perceived working conditions (ie, job demands, job resource), psychological well-being (ie, emotional exhaustion, work engagement) and patient care (ie, clinical care, patient safety). We pooled relationship effect sizes using random-effects meta-analysis, before testing for indirect effects using two-stage structural equation modelling. ResultsTwenty-three samples from 11 countries representing 7275 doctors were meta-analysed. The results indicated that job resources predicted work engagement (rho=0.18; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.24) and emotional exhaustion (rho=-0.21; 95% CI -0.31 to -0.11), while job demands predicted emotional exhaustion (rho=0.27; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.36). Better clinical care was also associated with higher levels of job resources (rho=0.16; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.29), and lower levels of emotional exhaustion (rho=-0.21; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.12) and job demands (rho=-0.27; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.10). Both factors of the work environment were associated with clinical care through doctors' emotional exhaustion, but there were insufficient studies to test the indirect effects for work engagement or patient safety. ConclusionOur results demonstrate the need for a systems perspective to address working conditions to support both doctors' psychological well-being and patient care. Interventions should target doctors' job resources as they are more strongly associated with psychological well-being. However, given that job demands were strongly associated with emotional exhaustion, and in turn, clinical care, there is a need to better manage doctors' workload, conflict and pressure to support the current psychological well-being crises among this occupational group.

AB  - IntroductionNearly 40% of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have been found to experience cognitive impairment in at least one domain. Cognitive impairment associated with MDD is disproportionately represented in patients that have not fully returned to psychosocial functioning. As awareness regarding cognitive dysfunction in MDD patients grows, so does the interest in developing newer treatments that specifically address these deficits.MethodIn the present study, we conduct a systematic review of controlled randomized clinical trials that used cognitive training and remediation interventions for improving cognitive functions and reducing symptom severity in adult patients with MDD. We selected studies published before March 2022 using search databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google scholar. For conducting the meta-analysis, standard differences in means with the random effect model and with a 95% confidence interval of change in outcome measures from baseline to post-intervention between the cognitive rehabilitation and the control groups were calculated.ResultsThe database search resulted in identifying 756 studies of interest, which ultimately 15 studies with 410 participants in the cognitive rehabilitation group and 339 participants in the control group were included. The meta-analysis of the data extracted from these studies, shows a moderate and significant effect on the executive function (d = 0.59 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.93) p-value = 0.001, I-2 = 15.2%), verbal learning (d = 0.45 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.78) p-value = 0.007, I-2 = 0.00%), and working memory (d = 0.41 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.64) p-value < 0.001, I-2 = 33%) of MDD patients. Although, there were no significant difference between intervention and control group in attention (d = 0.32 (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.66) p-value = 0.058, I-2 = 0.00%) or depressive symptoms.ConclusionThis systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that cognitive rehabilitation is an effective intervention for the executive function, verbal learning, and working memory of MDD patients. Due to the importance of these neuropsychological deficits in day-to-day life and the core symptoms of MDD, cognitive rehabilitation should be considered an important part of treating MDD. Further research in this area and concentrated on these particular deficits is warranted.

AB  - Objective: This study presents the proportion of adults with intellectual disability using psychotropic medications including antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, and psychostimulants. Methods: A search was performed in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus up to 31 December 2021. Articles were included if they reported the proportion of adults with intellectual disability using psychotropic medications. Frequency of use was estimated using a random effects meta-analysis. Meta-regression analysis was used to assess the association between study-level characteristics and variability in estimates, when heterogeneity was considerable. Results: Twenty-four articles were included in pooled analysis. The pooled prevalence of psychotropic medications was 41% (95% confidence interval: 35-46%). Pooled prevalences of subclasses were as follows: antipsychotics 31% (27-35%), antidepressants 14% (9-19%), anxiolytics 9% (4-15%), hypnotics/sedatives 5% (2-8%), and psychostimulants 1% (1-2%). Heterogeneity was considerable between studies, except for psychostimulants. There was no significant association between assessed characteristics and variability in prevalence estimates. Conclusion: Two-fifths of adults with intellectual disability were prescribed psychotropic medications. Antipsychotics and antidepressants were used by one-third and one-seventh of adults, respectively. There was considerable variability between studies, and further investigation is required to determine the source of variability. More studies are needed to better characterise prescribed psychotropic medications, including effectiveness and adverse effects, to ensure appropriate use of these drugs.

AB  - Accumulation of microplastics (MPs) in soil is a serious environmental concern. Addition of exogenous MPs can alter structure and physicochemical properties of and material transport in soil. MPs are particularly toxic to earthworms, which are soil ecosystem engineers, and exacerbate ecological risks; however, there is a lack of comprehensive and in-depth analyses of how MPs exhibit toxicity to/towards earthworms. In this study, we report a bibliometric analysis of 77 peer-reviewed papers published before December 2021 to systematically analyze how the addition of exogenous MPs contributes to earthworm toxicity and clarify the historical development and research hotspots in this field. We found that first, polyethylene and polystyrene are the most common materials used to study the toxic effects of MPs on earthworms. Second, the toxic mechanisms of MPs on earthworms mainly involve histopathological damage and oxidative stress, as well as serving as carriers of complex pollutants (e.g., heavy metals and organic pollutants) through combined adsorption-desorption. Third, oxidative stress is the typical reaction process of MPs toxicity in earthworms. When the content of MPs in soil exceeds 0.1%, earthworm growth is affected, and oxidative stress is induced, resulting in neural and DNA damage. Based on published studies, the prospects for future research on the ecological risks posed by MPs to earthworms have also been discussed. Overall, our findings help clarify the ecological risk of soil MPs toxicity to earthworms, reveal the mechanism of their toxic effects, and provide a theoretical basis for future studies focusing on establishing a healthy and ecologically sustainable soil environment.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a distinctive clinical syndrome with several causes and clinical manifestations. Aside from an infectious cause, PD is a rapidly developing neurological disorder with a global rise in frequency. Notably, improved knowledge of molecular pathways and the developing novel diagnostic methods may result in better therapy for PD patients. In this regard, the amount of research on ceRNA axes is rising, highlighting the importance of these axes in PD. CeRNAs are transcripts that cross-regulate one another via competition for shared microRNAs (miRNAs). These transcripts may be either coding RNAs (mRNAs) or non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). This research used a systematic review to assess validated loops of ceRNA in PD. The Prisma guideline was used to conduct this systematic review, which entailed systematically examining the articles of seven databases. Out of 309 entries, forty articles met all criteria for inclusion and were summarized in the appropriate table. CeRNA axes have been described through one of the shared vital components of the axes, including lncRNAs such as NEAT1, SNHG family, HOTAIR, MALAT1, XIST, circRNAs, and lincRNAs. Understanding the multiple aspects of this regulatory structure may aid in elucidating the unknown causal causes of PD and providing innovative molecular therapeutic targets and medical fields.

AB  - Informal caregivers of individuals affected by psychotic disorder can play a key role in the recovery process. However, little research has been conducted on the lived experiences of carers and family members. We conducted a bottom-up (from lived experience to theory) review of first-person accounts, co-written between academics and experts by experience, to identify key experiential themes. First-person accounts of carers, relatives, and individuals with psychosis were screened and discussed in collaborative workshops involving individuals with lived experiences of psychosis, family members, and carers, representing various organizations. The lived experiences of family members and carers were characterized by experiential themes related to dealing with the unexpected news, the search for a reason behind the disorder, living with difficult and negative emotions, dealing with loss, feeling lost in fragmented healthcare systems, feeling invisible and wanting to be active partners in care, struggling to communicate with the affected person, fighting stigma and isolation, dealing with an uncertain future, and learning from one's mistakes and building resilience and hope. Our findings bring forth the voices of relatives and informal carers of people with psychosis, by highlighting some of the common themes of their lived experiences from the time of the initial diagnosis and throughout the different clinical stages of the disorder. Informal carers are key stakeholders who can play a strategic role, and their contributions in the recovery process merit recognition and active support by mental health professionals.

AB  - Background: Shared decision making (SDM) is a health communication model promoting patient-centered care that has not been routinely utilized in mental health. Inconsistent definitions, models, measurement tools, and lack of sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of SDM interventions are potential contributors to the limited use of SDM in mental health. Aims: (1) Provide the first systematic analysis of global development trends and challenges of SDM research; (2) clarify the meaning, role, and measurement of SDM in mental health; (3) create a theoretical framework for key effective SDM components to guide future development and implementation of SDM interventions.
   Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was conducted in CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Included reviews focused on SDM interventions for prevention and/or treatment of mental illness in adults. A narrative synthesis was performed to capture the range of interventions, populations, measurement tools, comparisons, and outcomes.
   Results: 10 systematic reviews of SDM in mental health were included with 100 nested studies spanning from 2006 to 2020. All reviews focused on dyadic and psychopharmacological decision-making. Primary outcomes of SDM in mental health interventions include treatment satisfaction, medication adherence, symptom severity, quality of life, and hospital readmissions. Participant-related factors unique to SDM in mental health, such as stigma and mental capacity, were not reported.
   Conclusions: The current landscape of SDM in mental health is overwhelmingly disconnected from the needs and experiences of potential end-users; clients, clinicians, and family members. Most SDM interventions and tools were adapted from physical health and are mainly geared to psychopharmacological decision-making. The SDM in Mental Health Framework (SDM-MH), developed here, expands the scope of decisions to non-psychopharmacological discussions, diversifies the pool of SDM participants and settings, and offers potential primary target outcomes of SDM in mental health to reduce heterogeneity across studies.

AB  - Objectives: This systematic review aims to strengthen the relationship between architecture and neuroscience by classifying data measurement techniques in the field of neuroarchitecture with a focus on the most practical and common methodological approaches. It classifies data recording techniques in different architectural categories (e.g., interior, urban, built environment). Backgrounds: With regard to urban life developments and technological breakthroughs, studies of human interactions with environments have been expanding in recent years. Additionally, recent advances in neuroscience have allowed architects to find out more about human experiences in built environments, but there are few valid frameworks about what methodologies and instruments are more common to conduct experimental tasks in this interdisciplinary field. Methods: Twenty-eight experimental studies were selected based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses literature search extension (PRISMA) systematic review protocol and a comprehensive analysis. The task-space of selected articles was categorized into three subfields, namely, "interior design," "urban design," and "building design" based on environments and their stimuli. As for this context-based categorization, recording techniques and methodology were distinguished for each subfield division. Results: More than 50% of the studies were incorporated in the first two categories, and the EEG recording was the most frequently employed neuroimaging technique thanks to the technical efficacy of its setup and the high temporal resolution of its electrophysiological signals. Conclusion: In this study, a summary of techniques and methodological approaches applied in the field is provided in a nut shell, and a general framework of instruments is presented to help scholars to carry out more practical research in the future leading to designing built environments more efficiently.

MethodsThis research included 10 randomized studies searching four major databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library, with a total sample size of 467. Moreover, they were examined for quality and possible publication bias. ResultsCognitive bias modification (CBM) had statistically significant results, g = -0.64, 95% CI = [-0.97-0.32]. The interpretation of cognitive bias modification shows the highest effect size, g = -1.45, 95% CI = [-2.05-0.88]. When the training place is located in the laboratory, the training effect is significant, g = -1.11, 95% CI = [-1.62-0.61]. The difference is statistically significant when the training environment was changed to home, g = -0.28, 95% CI = [-0.51-0.05]. CBM has a statistical effect on moderate-to-severe depression, g = -0.70, 95% CI = [-1.04-0.36]. ConclusionWe found that CBM had a moderate therapeutic effect on depression, whether the setting was at home or in the lab. Especially when the interpretation of cognitive bias modification (CBM-I) was used, we got the highest effect value. Furthermore, CBM has a statistical effect on moderate-to-severe depression.

AB  - Introduction Comprehensive evidence on prevalence and incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms (PTSS) in people with chronic somatic diseases (CD) is lacking.Objective To systematically and meta-analytically examine prevalence and incidence of PTSD and PTSS in people with CD compared with people without CD.Methods MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched from inception (1946) to June 2020. Studies reporting point, 12-month, lifetime prevalence, or 12-month incidence of PTSD and PTSS in people with CD were selected and reviewed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed by a combination of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration for non-comparative studies. Pooled estimates were calculated using random effects meta-analyses. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.Results Data were extracted from studies reporting on point prevalence (k = 60; n = 21,213), 12-month prevalence (k = 3; n = 913), and lifetime prevalence (k = 6; n = 826). 12-month incidence estimates were not available. The pooled estimate for the point prevalence of PTSD (k = 41) across CD was 12.7% (95% CI, 8.6 to 18.4%) and 19.6% regarding PTSS (13.2 to 28.1%; k = 24). Individuals with cerebrovascular disorder (k = 4) showed the highest pooled point prevalence for PTSD (23.6%, 95% CI, 16.8 to 32.0%), those with cardiovascular diseases the lowest (6.6%, 1.9 to 20.9%; k = 5). The pooled 12-month prevalence of PTSD (k = 3) was 8.8% (95% CI, 5.5 to 13.5%) and the lifetime prevalence (k = 6) was 12.1% (7.6 to 18.5%). Pooled estimates of PTSD prevalence in people with compared to those without CD showed an odds ratio of 9.96 (95% CI, 2.55 to 38.94; k = 5).Conclusion Post-traumatic stress disorder and PTSS are common and substantially higher in people with compared to those without CD. Earlier detection and treatment of this comorbidity might improve mental and physical health, reduce the incidence of further diseases, and reduce mortality.

AB  - Objectives:Administration of antidepressant drugs - principally selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - may induce clinically significant 'apathy' which can affect treatment outcomes adversely. We aimed to review all relevant previous reports. Methods:We performed a PUBMED search of English-language studies, combining terms concerning psychopathology (e.g. apathy) and classes of antidepressants (e.g. SSRI). Results:According to certain inclusion (e.g. use of DSM/ICD diagnostic criteria) and exclusion (e.g. presence of a clinical condition that may induce apathy) criteria, 50 articles were eligible for review. Together, they suggest that administration of antidepressants - usually SSRIs - can induce an apathy syndrome or emotional blunting, i.e. a decrease in emotional responsiveness, to circumstances which would have triggered intense mood reactions prior to pharmacotherapy. The reported prevalence of antidepressant-induced apathy ranges between 5.8 and 50%, and for SSRIs ranges between 20 and 92%. Antidepressant-induced apathy emerges independently of diagnosis, age, and treatment outcome and appears dose-dependent and reversible. The main treatment strategy is dose reduction, though some data suggest the usefulness of treatment with olanzapine, bupropion, agomelatine or amisulpride, or the methylphenidate-modafinil-olanzapine combination. Conclusion:Antidepressant-induced apathy needs careful clinical attention. Further systematic research is needed to investigate the prevalence, course, aetiology, and treatment of this important clinical condition.

AB  - The intensity and frequency of wildfires is increasing globally. The systematic review of the current evidence on long-term impacts of non-occupational wildfire exposure on human health has not been performed yet. To provide a systematic review and identify potential knowledge gaps in the current evidence of long-term impacts of non-occupational exposure to wildfire smoke and/or wildfire impacts on human health. We conducted a systematic search of the literature via MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus from the database inception to July 05, 2022. References from the included studies and relevant reviews were also considered. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and a validated quality assessment framework were used to evaluate the quality of observational studies. Study results were synthesized descriptively. A total of 36 studies were included in our systematic re-view. Most studies were from developed countries (11 in Australia, 9 in Canada, 7 in the United States). Studies predominantly focused on mental health (21 studies, 58.33%), while evidence on long-term impacts of wildfire exposure on health outcomes other than mental health is limited. Current evidence indicated that long-term impacts of non-occupational wildfire exposure were associated with mortality (COVID-19 mortality, cardio-vascular disease mortality and acute myocardial disease mortality), morbidity (mainly respiratory diseases), mental health disorders (mainly posttraumatic stress disorder), shorter height of children, reduced lung function and poorer general health status. However, no significant associations were observed for long-term impacts of wildfire exposure on child mortality and respiratory hospitalizations. The population-based high-quality evi-dence with quantitative analysis on this topic is still limited. Future well-designed studies considering extensive wildfire smoke air pollutants (e.g., particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen oxides) and estimating risk coefficient values for extensive health outcomes (e.g., mortality, morbidity) are warranted to fill current knowledge gaps.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) offers unique and powerful tools for mental health practitioners to improve evidence-based psychological interventions and diagnoses. Indeed, by detecting and analyzing different biosignals, it is possible to differentiate between typical and atypical functioning and to achieve a high level of personalization across all phases of mental health care. This narrative review is aimed at presenting a comprehensive overview of how ML algorithms can be used to infer the psychological states from biosignals. After that, key examples of how they can be used in mental health clinical activity and research are illustrated. A description of the biosignals typically used to infer cognitive and emotional correlates (e.g., EEG and ECG), will be provided, alongside their application in Diagnostic Precision Medicine, Affective Computing, and brain-computer Interfaces. The contents will then focus on challenges and research questions related to ML applied to mental health and biosignals analysis, pointing out the advantages and possible drawbacks connected to the widespread application of AI in the medical/mental health fields. The integration of mental health research and ML data science will facilitate the transition to personalized and effective medicine, and, to do so, it is important that researchers from psychological/ medical disciplines/health care professionals and data scientists all share a common background and vision of the current research.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore overall prevalence of burnout among physicians during early and late COVID-19 pandemic and geographical differences in burnout.Methods: This review was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42022327959). A comprehensive search of several databases, including Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, and Scopus, spanning from December 2019 to May 2022 was conducted. Eligible studies included physicians or medical professionals including physicians that worked directly or indirectly with COVID-19 patients, whilst reporting burnout outcomes using a validated scale. Literature that did not include physicians or did not occur in a hospital setting were excluded. Literature including medical students were also excluded.Results: Forty-five observational studies were included, all of which were cross-sectional studies. The pooled estimate of overall prevalence of burnout was 54.60% (95% CI: 46.7, 62.2). Mean emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment was found to be 22.06% (95% CI: 18.19, 25.94), 8.72 (95% CI: 6.48, 10.95) and 31.18 (95% CI: 27.33, 35.03) respectively. Frontline workers displayed higher rates of burnout than second-line healthcare workers (HCW) (OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.37). Studies from the early pandemic period reported burnout prevalence of 60.7% (95% CI: 48.2, 72) compared to a prevalence of 49.3% (95% CI: 37.7, 60.9) from the late pandemic period. Geographically, burnout was highest amongst Middle East and North Africa (MENA) studies (66.6%, 95% CI: 54.7, 78.5), followed by Europe (48.8%, 95% CI: 40.3, 57.3) and then South America (42%, 95% CI: -0.4, 84.4). Lastly, burnout prevalence overall (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.36, 1.67) emotional exhaustion (MD = -0.36, 95% CI: -4.64, 3.91), depersonalization (MD = -0.31, 95% CI: -1.80, 1.18), and personal accomplishment (MD = 0.55, 95% CI: -0.73, 1.83) were found comparable between physicians and nurses.Conclusion: COVID-19 has had significant consequences on HCW burnout. Further research is needed to examine early signs of burnout and to develop effective coping strategies.

AB  - This article aims to review the literature on family functioning in the field of autism. The search was conducted in August 2021 in PubMed, PsycINFO, and PubPsy and sixty-two articles were included. Studies were published in English between 1980 and 2021 and provided quantitative data from validated measures of family functioning in families with an official diagnosis of autism. Results showed that family functioning appeared more problematic for families of autistic children than non-autistic ones. Difficulties were correlated with more caregiver demand and less resources. Interventional results varied. The findings highlight the importance of considering family functioning when providing care for autistic children and their families. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.Prospero registration number: CRD42022297696.

AB  - BackgroundSmoking is a substantial and avoidable risk for physical disability and premature death. Despite a declining tobacco use in the community of developed countries, smoking remains abundant in people with mental disorders. This narrative review highlights the epidemiology, consequences and treatment options of tobacco use disorder (TUD) and nicotine dependence (ND) in people with bipolar disorder (BD). MethodsThe authors conducted a Medline literature search from 1970 to November 2022 using MeSH terms "bipolar disorder" x "smoking" or "nicotine" or "tobacco" that retrieved 770 results. Search results were complemented by additional literature retrieved from examining cross references and by hand search in text books. Finally, 92 references were considered as essential and selected for the educational purpose of this review. Summary of findingsLifetime and point prevalence of smoking in people with BD is in the range of 45-70% and thus about 2-3 times more frequent in BD than in community samples. Smoking, TUD and ND have a detrimental impact both on mental and physical health as well as mortality in people with BD. In the absence of large controlled studies in comorbid BD and TUD or ND, pharmacological treatment follows the individual guidance for each disorder. Community-based psychosocial interventions for TUD and ND appear to be suitable in people with BD, too, as well as Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) or Acceptance and Commitment (ACT) based psychotherapies. ConclusionsSmoking is a modifiable risk factor causing increased risks both for mental and physical health in BD, and deserves more attention in treatment. More treatment research into pharmacological and psychosocial interventions in comorbid BD and TUD or ND are still needed to deliver evidence-based recommendations to physicians.

AB  - Neurological motor disorders (NMDs) such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins that trigger cell death of specific neuronal populations in the central nervous system. Differential neuronal loss initiates the impaired motor control and cognitive function in the affected patients. Although major advances have been carried out to understand the molecular basis of these diseases, to date there are no treatments that can prevent, cure, or significantly delay the progression of the disease. In this context, strategies such as gene editing, cellular therapy, among others, have gained attention as they effectively reduce the load of toxic protein aggregates in different models of neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, these strategies are expensive and difficult to deliver into the patients' nervous system. Thus, small molecules and natural products that reduce protein aggregation levels are highly sought after. Numerous drug discovery efforts have analyzed large libraries of synthetic compounds for the treatment of different NMDs, with a few candidates reaching clinical trials. Moreover, the recognition of new druggable targets for NMDs has allowed the discovery of new small molecules that have demonstrated their efficacy in pre-clinical studies. It is also important to recognize the contribution of natural products to the discovery of new candidates that can prevent or cure NMDs. Additionally, the repurposing of drugs for the treatment of NMDs has gained huge attention as they have already been through clinical trials confirming their safety in humans, which can accelerate the development of new treatment. In this review, we will focus on the new advances in the discovery of small molecules for the treatment of Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. We will begin by discussing the available pharmacological treatments to modulate the progression of neurodegeneration and to alleviate the motor symptoms in these diseases. Then, we will analyze those small molecules that have reached or are currently under clinical trials, including natural products and repurposed drugs.

AB  - Objective: Co-prevalence and incidence of depression and/or anxiety with stroke and myocardial infarction are currently unclear. This paper explores the relationships, as these are important comorbidities affecting patient outcomes.Methods: A systematic search across five databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane) was con-ducted for observational studies reporting co-prevalence of depression or anxiety with stroke or myocardial infarction. We used random-effects models in all meta-analyses and evaluated heterogeneity using I2.Results: This analysis included 48 studies with a total of 57,342 patients. In patients with depression, the pooled prevalence of stroke was 5.9% (95% CI = 5.53-6.37). In patients with myocardial infarction, the pooled prev-alence of anxiety and depression was 9.1% (95% CI = 7.07-11.40, I2 = 85.6%) and 25.9% (95% CI = 18.46-34.12, I2 = 99.1%), respectively, and the pooled cumulative incidence of depression at one year was 20.5% (95% CI = 18.36-22.79). The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with stroke was 13.5% (95% CI = 7.67-22.66, I2 = 96.9%) and 23.0% (95% CI = 17.93-28.99, I2 = 96.7%), respectively. The pooled cumulative incidences of depression at two weeks, three months, six months, and one year, were 29.1% (95% CI = 26.60-31.81), 17.0% (95% CI = 10.74-25.92, I2 = 98.0%), 7.4% (95% CI = 6.52-8.49), and 9.1% (95% CI = 3.71-20.79, I2 = 99.8%), respectively.Conclusions: This meta-analysis outlines the co-morbid burden between depression/anxiety and stroke/ myocardial infarction. Future research should be done to evaluate the effectiveness of screening anxiety/ depression in myocardial infarction/stroke.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the beneficial effects of melatonin supplementation on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration and clinical depressive disorder. Methods: A comprehensive electronic search was conducted of Medlin, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google scholar, from database inception to January 20, 2021. Studies were eligible if they: (1) were a clinical trial; (2) enrolled adults; (3) assessed the effect of melatonin supplementation on serum concentration of BDNF or depression score. Overall effects, as weighted mean difference (WMD), were calculated for concentration of BDNF and depression score. Results: Melatonin supplementation yielded no significant effect on BDNF concentration (WMD: -5.61; 95% CI: -14.10, 2.88; I-square: 85.6%), but improved depression by decreasing the score (WMD: -0.76; 95% CI: -1.12, -0.4; I-square: 88.0%). Due to high heterogeneity between studies, subgroup analysis for gender, duration and dose in BDNF studies and duration, age, dose, continent and Questionnaire type in depression studies, was utilised. The subgroup analysis showed that melatonin supplementation had a significant decreasing effect on BDNF levels in doses <= 10 mg/day, with more than 4 weeks of duration, and in men. Conclusion: The present study revealed that melatonin supplementation has a decreasing effect on depression in all duration of studies and doses subgroup and in age more than 65 years in depression studies but heterogenicity of the included studies, did not allow a definitive conclusion. There is limited evidence for effects of melatonin on serum BDNF. Implications for practice: Melatonin is a safe and effective supplement for depressive patients.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise intervention, and analyze exercise intervention strategies for adolescent depression through a meta-analysis of RCTs. Methods: Accordance to PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Medline, EBSCO, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and CNKI were searched for eligible records. Peer-reviewed studies were included if they met the following criteria: population (mean age of 10-18 years), intervention (physical activity, sport, or exercise), and outcomes (depression, adherence, ITT, dropout, adverse events, follow-up report). The protocol of this systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022321683). Effect sizes calculations and methodological quality of exercise intervention (TESTEX scale) were carried out. The certainty of evidence was assessed by GRADE framework. Results: Thirteen randomized controlled trials were eligible for this review, which comprised a total of 433 adolescents. Compared with the control treatment, the effect of exercise on adolescent depression was moderate (SMD = -0.65, 95%CI: -1.03 to -0.27, p < 0.01). Heterogeneity was substantial (T-2 = 0.30, I-2 = 67%, p < 0.01). The moderating effect analysis showed that exercise intervention characteristics (organization form, exercise frequency, exercise intensity, exercise type, and single exercise session duration) of included studies varied greatly revealing multiple factors that may impact the antidepressant effect of exercise on adolescent depression (I-2 > 50%, p < 0.05). Three studies show that the positive effect of exercise on reducing depression in adolescents remained 40 weeks after the intervention. Moreover, owing to the included studies contained methodological limitations, the certainty of evidence was reduced to moderate level. Conclusion: This study shows that exercise intervention has a moderate and sustained positive effect on adolescent depression. Our results recommended that adolescents with depression undertake moderate to high intensity group mixed exercise for more than 12 weeks, 20 to 60 min/time, more than 3 times/week. Additionally, our study also shows that the antidepressant effects remained for a long time after the end of exercise interventions. However, following the GRADE framework, we rated the certainty of evidence the primary meta-analysis as moderate evidence due to some limitations of included studies. Therefore, rigorous studies are still needed to verify the results.

AB  - Background: Given the likelihood of progressive illness in bipolar disorder (BD), it is important to understand the benefits and risks of interventions administered early in illness course. We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions in the early course of BD I or II. Methods: We completed a systematic search on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL and Google Scholar from 1/1/1979 till 14/9/2022. We included controlled trials examining intervention effects on symptomatic, course, functional and tolerability outcomes of patients in the 'early course' of BD I or II. We classified patients to be in early course if they (a) were seeking help for the first time for a manic episode, (b) had a lifetime history of up to 3 manic episodes, or (c) had up to 6 lifetime mood episodes. Evidence quality was assessed using the GRADE approach. Results: From 4135 unique publications we included 25 reports representing 2212 participants in 16 randomized studies, and 17,714 participants from nine non-randomized studies. Available evidence suggested that in early illness course, lithium use was associated with lower recurrence risk compared with other mood stabilizers. Mood stabilizers were also associated with better global functioning, compared with the use of antipsychotics in the medium term. While summative findings regarding psychological therapies were limited by heterogeneity, family-focused and cognitive-behavioral interventions were associated with reduced recurrence risk or improved symptomatic outcomes. There was some evidence that the same pharmacological interventions were more efficacious in preventing recurrences when utilized in earlier rather than later illness course. Conclusions and recommendations: While there are promising initial findings, there is a need for more adequately powered trials to examine the efficacy and tolerability of interventions in youth and adults in early illness course. Specifically, there is a compelling need to compare the relative benefits of lithium with other pharmacological agents in preventing recurrences. In addition to symptomatic outcomes, there should be a greater focus on functional impact and tolerability. Effective pharmacological and psychological interventions should be offered to those in early course of BD, balancing potential risks using shared decision-making approaches.

AB  - Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterised by marked impairment to one's physical health and social functioning, as well as high rates of chronicity and comorbidity. This literature review aims to summarise existing academic research related to the symptom profile of BN, the costs and burden imposed by the illness, barriers to the receipt of care, and the evidence base for available psychological treatments. As a consequence of well-documented difficulties in accessing evidence-based treatments for eating disorders, efforts have been made towards developing innovative, diverse channels to deliver treatment, with several of these attempting to harness the potential of digital platforms. In response to the increasing number of trials investigating the utility of online treatments, this paper provides a critical review of previous attempts to examine digital interventions in the treatment of eating disorders. The results of a focused literature review are presented, including a detailed synthesis of a knowledgeable selection of high-quality articles with the aim of providing an update on the current state of research in the field. The results of the review highlight the potential for online self-help treatments to produce moderately sized reductions in core behavioural and cognitive symptoms of eating disorders. However, concern is raised regarding the methodological limitations of previous research in the field, as well as the high rates of dropout and poor adherence reported across most studies. The review suggests directions for future research, including the need to replicate previous findings using rigorous study design and methodology, as well as further investigation regarding the utility of clinician support and interactive digital features as potential mechanisms for offsetting low rates of engagement with online treatments.

AB  - Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by functional brain deficits, as documented by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies.Aims: In recent years, some studies used machine learning (ML) approaches, based on rs-fMRI features, for classifying MDD from healthy controls (HC). In this context, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the results of these studies.Design: The studies research was performed on 3 online databases, examining English-written articles published before August 5, 2022, that performed a two-class ML classification using rs-fMRI features. The search resulted in 20 eligible studies.Results: The reviewed studies showed good performance metrics, with better performance achieved when the dataset was restricted to a more homogeneous group in terms of disease severity. Regions within the default mode network, salience network, and central executive network were reported as the most important features in the classification algorithms. Limitations: The small sample size together with the methodological and clinical heterogeneity limited the generalizability of the findings.Conclusions: In conclusion, ML applied to rs-fMRI features can be a valid approach to classify MDD and HC subjects and to discover features that can be used for additional investigation of the pathophysiology of the disease.

AB  - Climate Change (CC) imposes important global health risks, including on mental health (MH). They are related mostly to psychological suffering caused by climate-related events and to the heat-vulnerability caused by psychiatric disorders. This growing burden may press MH services worldwide, increasing demand on public and private systems in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. According to PRISMA, two independent reviewers searched four databases for papers published before May 2022 that associated climate-related events with healthcare demand for psychiatric conditions. Of the 7432 papers retrieved, we included 105. Only 29 were carried out in low- and middle-income countries. Twelve related the admission numbers to (i) extreme events, while 93 to (ii) meteorological factors-mostly heat. Emergency visits and hospitalizations were significantly higher during hot periods for MH disorders, especially until lag 5-7. Extreme events also caused more consultations. Suicide (completed or attempted), substance misuse, schizophrenia, mood, organic and neurotic disorders, and mortality were strongly affected by CC. This high healthcare demand is evidence of the burden patients may undergo. In addition, public and private services may face a shortage of financial and human resources. Finally, the increased use of healthcare facilities, in turn, intensifies greenhouse gas emissions, representing a self-enforcing cycle for CC. Further research is needed to better clarify how extreme events affect MH services and, in addition, if services in low- and middle-income countries are more intensely demanded by CC, as compared to richer countries.

AB  - Environmental noise affects our daily functioning in many ways, and the cognitive, motivational, and emotional effects of noise are intertwined. Our task performance under noisy conditions depends on our ability to cope with the noise and our cognitive resources. The process of (failed) coping may wear us out cognitively, lead to learned helplessness, and, consequently, alter the motivation to persist in a task. The direct effect of irrelevant sounds on cognitive functioning in children is relatively well-established, however, the research on the framework of learned helplessness is limited when it comes to children. Learned helplessness can give more insight into effects of environmental noise on learning and child development and how the effects of short-term and long-term exposure interact. A systematic literature review is performed to assess to what extent the current evidence addresses the (interaction) effects of the sound environment on cognition and learned helplessness as measured by motivation in children and young adults up to the age of 21. The search resulted in 8 included papers that addressed both cognition and learned helplessness in their research. The included papers study children between 8-13 years old and show evidence for a relation between environmental noise, cognition, and helplessness individually, but none study a possible interaction. Based on the individual study designs, it could be hypothesized that cognitive fatigue may play a role in the interaction. Studies that conducted motivation tasks after cognitive tasks found stronger effects than those that conducted tasks in a random order. More research is needed using the same methods in different age groups to further assess the interaction between cognition and learned helplessness in relation to the sound environment.

AB  - ObjectiveUp to 10% of the general population experiences persistent somatic symptoms (PSS). Numerous studies in a variety of health domains are dedicated to identifying factors that are associated with PSS onset. The present study aimed to provide an overview of predictors for PSS onset in the general population and the related health domains.MethodsA systematic search was performed identifying longitudinal cohort studies that examined factors associated with PSS onset in the general population. Included studies measured potential predictors before PSS onset and were categorized according to the dynamic biopsychosocial model. Four levels of evidence were discerned for predictors, based on the number of studies and percentage of consistent findings.ResultsIn the 154 articles eligible for analysis, 27 PSS subtypes were studied, with primary focus on fibromyalgia (25.0%) and irritable bowel syndrome (23.3%). Of the >250 predictors of PSS onset, 46 were investigated more than once and showed consistent results. Strong evidence identifies biological (e.g., infections, body weight-related metrics), psychological (e.g., sleep problems, psychopathology), interpersonal (life events, childhood/interpersonal stress), contextual (employment), and health behavioral (health care utilization) predictors.ConclusionsThe results provide strong evidence for factors from all dynamic biopsychosocial domains, although interpersonal and health behavioral factors are relatively under investigated. Thus, evidence suggests that reduction of predictors of PSS onset to a specific factor/domain may be too restrictive. There is no evidence that this differs per PSS subtype. Exploring all domains and measuring common factors across subtypes are essential to improve the clinical course of PSS.

AB  - Background: We aimed to evaluate the effect of dignity therapy on the dignity, distress, and quality of life of terminally-ill adult patients.Methods: All randomized controlled trials published prior to Jan 2021 were searched through database, includKMBASE, KoreaMed, NDSL, and RISS. The RoB 2 was used to assess risk of bias. Effect sizes, Hedge's g and Higgins I2-statistics were used for meta-analysis.Results: We finally identified 10 studies for a systematic review, and eight studies out of them were selected for a meta-analysis. Overall, 776 participants were included in the meta-analysis. There were significant differences between with and without dignity therapy groups in dignity and anxiety (SMD = -0.3805, Cl = -0.5606, -0.2004; SMD = -0.1932, Cl = -0.3774, -0.0090, respectively) while there was no significant difference in quality of life and depression (SMD=0.4678, Cl = -0.0989, 1.0345; SMD= -0.0513, Cl= -0.2461, 0.1434, respectively).Conclusion: Dignity therapy may be effective for terminally ill patients on dignity and anxiety. We suggested further empirical studies with dignity therapy and repetitive meta-analysis in the future due to heterogeneity of the studies.

AB  - Self-compassion refers to being supportive toward oneself when experiencing suffering or pain-be it caused by personal mistakes and inadequacies or external life challenges. This review presents my theoretical model of self-compassion as comprised of six different elements: increased self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness as well as reduced self-judgment, isolation, and overidentification. It discusses the methodology of self-compassion research and reviews the increasingly large number of empirical studies that indicate self-compassion is a productive way of approaching distressing thoughts and emotions that engenders mental and physical well-being. It also reviews research that dispels common myths about self-compassion (e.g., that it is weak, selfish, self-indulgent or undermines motivation). Interventions designed to increase self-compassion, such as compassion-focused therapy and mindful self-compassion, are discussed. Finally, the review considers problematic issues in the field, such as the differential effects fallacy, and considers limitations and future research directions in the field of self-compassion research.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that negatively affects functioning; however, the relationship between cognitive appraisals and illness-related beliefs and adaptation indices remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this review was to assess the relationship between cognitive appraisals, illness beliefs and indicators of adaptation to life with a chronic disease, such as the severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life.Methods: A database search was carried out between May 13 and 18, 2022, with no time restrictions. Thirty studies (5 related to cognitive appraisals, 25 related to illness beliefs) were identified.Results: The studies identified in the review were of satisfactory quality. An analysis of the articles allowed for a meta-analysis focusing on the relationship between the belief related to illness consequences and the severity of depressive symptoms, which gave an overall correlation estimate of 0.50 [0.44-0.56].Conclusion: Both cognitive appraisals and illness beliefs are related to indicators of rheumatoid arthritis adap-tation, such as depressive symptom severity, anxiety and acceptance levels. Further longitudinal research would be crucial in further elucidating the impact of cognitive factors on adjustment level and its trajectories over time.Clinical trial registration: Review was pre-registered at https://osf.io/gd9cw (DOI:http://10.17605/OSF.

AB  - Background:Depression in the elderly requires different treatment options because therapies that are commonly used for depression in younger patients show different effects later in life. Treatment options for late-life depression (LLD) are summarized in this article. Methods:A literature search in Medline/PubMed performed in June 2020 identified 83 relevant studies. Results:Pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be an effective first-line treatment in LLD, but >50% of elderly patients do not adequately respond. Switching to other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or augmenting with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics is often effective in achieving a therapeutic benefit. Severely depressed patients with a high risk of suicidal behavior can be treated with electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy provides a measurable benefit alone and when combined with medication. Limitations:LLD remains an underrepresented domain in research. Paucity of data concerning the effect of specific therapies for LLD, heterogeneity in the quality of study designs, overinterpretation of results from meta-analyses, and discrepancies between study results and guideline recommendations were often noted. Conclusions:Treating LLD is complex, but there are several treatment options with good efficacy and tolerability. Some novel pharmaceuticals also show promise as potential antidepressants, but evidence for their efficacy and safety is still limited and based on only a few trials conducted to date.

AB  - Urban residents have a higher risk of hypertension and psychological stress than rural residents. Aside from medical interventions, understanding how to control hypertension and alleviate the stress of urban populations has become a public concern. As an alternative medical measure, forest therapy has shown the effects of normalizing blood pressure (BP) and reducing stress increasingly in recent literature, but this is still inconclusive. In order to systematically verify forest therapy's effects on the BP and mental stress of urban residents, we conducted meta-analyses to assess the changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and salivary cortisol concentration (SCC; a stress biomarker) between the forest therapy group and urban control group. We searched 4 online databases, and 21 studies on BP involving 2270 participants and 13 studies on SCC involving 1786 participants were included. Through the meta-analysis, the mean difference and confidence interval (CI) estimates indicated that forest therapy significantly reduced participants' SBP -3.44 (95% CI -5.74, -1.14), DBP -3.07 (95% CI -5.59, -0.54), and SCC -0.07 (95% CI -0.10, -0.04), as compared with urban control. Yet, there was substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 72.87-88.59%) among these studies. We also found that each prediction interval (PI) for SBP (95% PI -13.30, 6.42), DBP (95% PI -15.54, 9.41), and SCC (95% PI -0.18, 0.05) were all much wider than the CIs and contained values above 0. This means that forest therapy may reduce SBP, DBP, and SCC on average, but may not exclude adverse results. Meta-regression analyses showed that participants' age and baseline SBP levels determined the heterogeneity among SBP studies. After forest therapy, older participants and those with higher baseline SBP levels had greater SBP-lowering effects. Among DBP studies, the primary source of heterogeneity was participants' baseline DBP levels; participants with higher baseline DBP levels had greater DBP reduction. In subgroup analyses, we discovered that longer-term forest therapy programs (>= 20 min) resulted in a greater reduction in BP and SCC than shorter-term forest therapy programs (<20 min). Additionally, seated viewing, walking, or multi-session programs in forests were observed to have similar effects on reducing BP and SCC. Despite extensive analyses, the study did not identify any sources of heterogeneity among forest therapy programs for lowering SCC levels. Overall, we conclude that forest therapy programs have beneficial therapeutic effects on urban residents' physio-psychological health through lowering BP and relieving stress (reducing SCC). This finding provides solid evidence of the contribution of forest therapy to urban residents' health and wellbeing.

AB  - Amongst individuals with a mental health disorder, a comorbid diagnosis of cannabis use disorder (CUD) is associated with numerous adverse consequences, including more severe symptom profiles, poorer treatment response, and reduced psychosocial functioning. Contingency management (CM), a method to specifically reinforce target behavior attainment (e.g., substance use abstinence), may provide an effective intervention in treating cannabis use in patients with a dual diagnosis of CUD and a mental health disorder. A systematic search examining the effects of CM on cannabis use, clinical, cognitive, and psychosocial outcomes in patients with a mental health disorder on PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases up to November 2022 was performed. Six studies met inclusion criteria for our review. We found CM to be efficacious in producing cannabis use reductions and abstinence amongst individuals with a psychotic-spectrum or major depressive disorder. Additional longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes, other psychiatric populations, and longer follow-up periods are needed to evaluate the sustained effects of CM.

AB  - Introduction: From Occupational Therapy, social participation is considered one of the areas of vital importance in the lives of people with schizophrenia. Therefore, when there is a limitation in participation in this occupational area, it is necessary to generate intervention strategies that favor and enable access to them. Objectives: Know the effectiveness of different interventions in the occupational area "social participation" in users with schizophrenia. Method: A bibliographic search was carried out in three databases in the health and social field: Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria for the selection of articles were: People between 18 and 65 years old with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, published in the last 10 years in English, Spanish and Portuguese, excluding opinion articles and articles with less than 10 participants in the intervention. A total of 13 studies were selected. All papers were evaluated according to a cheklist.Results: The most effective intervention has been the ACT, with results of; improvement in symptomatic remission of 43.98 pints, comparing with control group; in terms of hospital readmissions, 19.05%; Regarding social functionality, it has had an improvement of 11.36 points; Finally, regarding the quality of life, there has been an improvement of 1.40 points.Conclusions: Social participation is essential in the psychosocial rehabilitation process of a user with schizophrenia. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) has shown significantly better results compared to Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR). We must take the results obtained with caution due to the study's limitations, where the little scientific evidence available on this stands out.

AB  - Urban residency is associated with exposure to environmental factors, which can influence health in many ways. Neuroscientific research, as well as Public Health research, aim towards broadening evidence in the field of Urban Health. However, it is unclear whether the association between urban living and mental illnesses is causal rather than explainable by other selective effects. This review seeks to gather information on the current evidence regarding urban living and neurological outcomes to demonstrate how Public Health and Neuroscience could complement each other in the field of Urban Health. A scoping review was conducted in four electronic databases according to the PRISMA-statement guidelines. 25 empirical studies were included. Outcomes such as schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, social and cognitive functioning were scrutinised. Evidence was found for alteration of brain functioning and brain structure. Most studies researching cognitive functioning or cognitive decline displayed possible protective effects of urban living compared to rural living. The different study designs in Public Health and Neuroscience could profit from each other. Although the comparability of studies is limited by the inconsistent assessments of urbanity. Synergies and potentials to combine aspects of Public Health and Neuroscience in the field of Urban Health to improve population health became apparent.

AB  - Objective:This meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and schizo-phrenia (SCZ)1, and investigate the susceptible population and the lag characteristics of different pollutants.Methods:A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, andCNKI for relevant literature published up to 28 Feb 2022. Meta-analysis was performed separately to investigate theassociation of ambient particulates (diameter <= 2.5 mu m(PM2.5)2,2.5 mu m<diameter<10 mu m(PMC)3,<= 10 mu m(PM10)4) and gaseous pollutants (nitrogen dioxide (NO2)5, sulfur dioxide (SO2)6, carbon monoxide (CO)7)withSCZ.Relative risk (RR)8per 10 mu g/m3increase in air pollutants concentration was used as the effect estimate. Subgroupanalyses were conducted by age, gender, country, median pollutant concentration, and median temperature.Results:We identified 17 articles mainly conducted in Asia, of which 13 were included in the meta-analysis. Increasedrisk of SCZ was associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5(RR: 1.0050, 95 % confidence interval (CI)9: 1.0017, 1.0083), PMC(1.0117, 1.0023, 1.0211), PM10(1.0047, 1.0025, 1.0070), NO2(1.0275, 1.0132, 1.0420), and SO2(1.0288, 1.0146, 1.0432) exposure. Subgroup analyses showed that females may be more susceptible to SO2andNO2, and the young seem to be more sensitive to PM2.5and PM10. Gaseous pollutants presented the immediate risk,and particulates showed the delayed risk.Conclusions:The present meta-analysis suggests that short-term exposure to PM2.5,PMC,PM10,SO2,andNO2exposuremay be associated with an elevated risk of SCZ

AB  - Background: Lithium is widely evidenced for its neuropsychiatric benefits. Advantages of 'sub-therapeutic' doses are increasingly being reported, which is apposite given enduring concerns around adverse effects of 'thera-peutic' doses. We aimed to synthesise all available evidence from interventional studies investigating low-dose lithium (LDL) across neuropsychiatric outcomes.
   Methods: Electronic databases were systematically searched to include studies where a group of adult humans were treated with LDL (similar to serum level <= 0.6 mmol/L), where data describing a neuropsychiatric outcome were reported either before and after treatment, and/or between lithium and a comparator.
   Results: 18 articles were examined and grouped according to outcome domain (cognition, depression, mania, and related constructs e.g., suicidality). Significant benefits (versus placebo) were identified for attenuating cognitive decline, and potentially as an adjunctive therapy for people with depression/mania. Across studies, LDL was reported to be safe.
   Conclusions: Despite the paucity and heterogeneity of studies, LDL's apparent pro-cognitive effects and positive safety profile open promising avenues in the fields of neurodegeneration, and augmentation in affective disor-ders. We urge future examinations of LDL's potential to prevent cognitive/affective syndromes.

AB  - Affective computing is a rising interdisciplinary field of research spanning the areas from artificial intelligence, natural language processing to cognitive and social sciences. Potential applications comprise of man-machine interaction, healthcare, entertainment, teaching, marketing and many more. Despite the increasing number of papers published in the domains of affective computing, emotion recognition, and human-computer interaction (HCI), there are still gaps in the comprehensive literature review that covers all relevant studies in a single study, which this review attempts to address. As a result, this study provides a systematic literature review (SLR) on existing modalities (unimodals) for emotion recognition, emotion models, and trends in relevant studies by selecting articles published from January 2010 to June 2021. To ensure the retrieval of all relevant studies, a review protocol is used that includes both automatic and manual searches. Based on the research questions, the final 129 papers are reviewed and relevant information is extracted. This SLR provides future research directions to assist novice researchers and practitioners in more efficiently utilizing affective computing techniques.

AB  - Excessive masticatory muscle activity is generally present in awake bruxism, which is related to increased anxiety and stress. It has been hypothesized that biofeedback could potentially manage awake bruxism, however, its effectiveness has not been empirically analyzed in a systematic manner. Therefore, this systematic review was designed to determine the effectiveness of biofeedback compared to other therapies in adults with awake bruxism. Extensive searches in five databases looking for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included biofeedback to manage awake bruxism were targeted. The risk of bias (RoB) assessment was conducted using the Cochrane RoB-2 tool. Overall, four studies were included in this systematic review, all of which used the electromyographic activity of the masticatory muscles during the day and night as the main endpoint. Auditory and visual biofeedback could reduce the excessive level of masticatory muscle activity in a few days of intervention. The majority of the included studies had a high RoB and only one study had a low RoB. The standardization of the biofeedback protocols was also inconsistent, which makes it difficult to establish the ideal protocol for the use of biofeedback in awake bruxism. Thus, it is proposed that future studies seek to reduce methodological risks and obtain more robust samples.

AB  - Simple Summary Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by movement problems and accompanied by behavioral changes such as depression and anxiety. It is a multifactorial condition that is affected by genetic alterations and environmental factors that progressively lead to the death of specialized neurons. This systematic review discusses the attractive hypothesis that gut intestinal dysbiosis is an initial step of a process that leads to Parkinson's. Gut microbiota alterations and their metabolites can cause intestinal inflammation, but they can also alter gut-brain communication and the brain barrier. This can lead to brain inflammation and the deterioration of brain cells, a process called neurodegeneration. Understanding the role of gut microbiota in the progression of Parkinson's could be a key element for research toward therapeutic approaches that could delay and even cure the disease. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with motor, physical and behavioral symptoms that can have a profound impact on the patient's quality of life. Most cases are idiopathic, and the exact mechanism of the disease's cause is unknown. The current hypothesis focuses on the gut-brain axis and states that gut microbiota dysbiosis can trigger inflammation and advances the development of Parkinson's disease. This systematic review presents the current knowledge of gut microbiota analysis and inflammation based on selected studies on Parkinson's patients and experimental animal models. Changes in gut microbiota correlate with Parkinson's disease, but only a few studies have considered inflammatory modulators as important triggers of the disease. Nevertheless, it is evident that proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the gut, the circulation, and the brain before the development of the disease's neurological symptoms and exacerbate the disease. Increased levels of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-17A and interferon-gamma can correlate with altered gut microbiota. Instead, treatment of gut dysbiosis is accompanied by reduced levels of inflammatory mediators in specific tissues, such as the colon, brain and serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Deciphering the role of the immune responses and the mechanisms of the PD-associated gut microbiota will assist the interpretation of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's and will elucidate appropriate therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression have long been considered the two most important emotion regulation strategies. Increasingly, studies have found that mindfulness has a relationship with them. However, the magnitude and direction of the relationship between them have yet to reach a consistent conclusion. To this end, a three-level meta-analysis was used to explore the relationship between mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression. Thirty-six studies were included in the meta-analysis through a literature search, including 36 samples with 83 effect sizes and a total of 12,026 subjects. The three-level random effects model showed that mindfulness was positively correlated with cognitive reappraisal to a low to moderate degree but was not correlated with expressive suppression. The moderating effect analysis showed that the relationship between mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal was slightly closer in males than in females. The study found a relatively stable positive relationship between mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal, an adaptive emotion regulation mode, while the relationship with expressive suppression was insignificant. The finding supported the affect regulation training model and also shed light on potential areas for future studies.

AB  - Background Music therapy is an emerging and useful methodology to improve the quality of life of children and adolescents with cancer. Objectives The objective of this scoping review was to examine the available literature and offer an analysis of the relevance of music therapy in paediatric oncology. We considered the effects of music therapy on children and adolescents with cancer as well as the perception of this population, their families, music therapists, and health professionals regarding the music therapy sessions conducted. Finally, we analysed the characteristics of the distinct types of music therapy interventions reported in the literature. Methods In this review, we applied the methodology proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. After performing a comprehensive academic literature database search, 522 articles were identified of which, 27 met the inclusion criteria. Results The results shed light on the use of music therapy as a means to facilitate self-esteem, to improve the physical, emotional, and cognitive aspects related to disease and, to a lesser extent, alleviate their physiological symptoms. Both children and adolescents with cancer were represented in the academic literature. The most prevalent findings described in these studies were the benefits of music therapy in terms of improved psychological well-being and social relationships in this population. Conclusions Music therapy interventions are generally well received, not only by children and adolescents with cancer, but also by their families, music therapists, and health professionals. Nevertheless, several gaps were identified in some of the studies we considered, including a lack of specificity regarding the results obtained or music therapy intervention methods used.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a great interest in utilizing technology in mental health research. The rapid technological development has encouraged researchers to apply technology as a part of a diagnostic process or treatment of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs). With the large number of studies being published comes an urgent need to inform clinicians and researchers about the latest advances in this field. Here, we methodically explore and summarize findings from studies published between August 2019 and February 2022. A search strategy led to the identification of 4108 records from PubMed and APA PsycInfo databases. 221 quantitative studies were included, covering a wide range of technologies used for diagnosis and/or treatment of NDDs, with the biggest focus on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The most popular technologies included machine learning, functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging, and neurofeed-back. The results of the review indicate that technology-based diagnosis and intervention for NDD population is promising. However, given a high risk of bias of many studies, more high-quality research is needed.

AB  - "Attachment and Biobehavioural Catch-Up" (ABC) is a 10 session home visiting program, grounded in attachment theory. It aims to improve child emotion regulation, attachment and behavioral outcomes through changing caregivers' attachment related behaviors. There is increasing evidence with respect to the effectiveness of ABC in producing positive child outcomes, but the intervention's direct effect on parent outcomes remains unclear. This review examined the association of ABC with attachment related parent outcomes. The PubMed, EMBASE, PyschINFO and SCOPUS databases were searched for relevant studies in August 2021, and again in April 2022. The eligibility criteria for included studies were (1) infants aged 0-27 months at time of the ABC intervention, (2) "at risk" parents, (3) controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals and (4) utilized a measure of attachment related parent outcomes. Eleven eligible studies were included. The findings showed ABC had a significant small to medium effect on a variety of attachment related parent outcomes among parents presenting with multiple psychosocial risk factors. "Sensitivity" was measured most frequently, with small to medium main effect sizes recorded at follow-up, compared to controls. Implications for the clinical effectiveness of the ABC program in community settings are discussed. Future research should clarify who ABC is most effective for and how it compares to similar interventions.

AB  - There are a number of key features which make olfaction difficult to study; subjective processes of odor detection, discrimination and identification, and individualistic odor hedonic perception and associated odor memories. In this systematic review we explore the role functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has played in understanding olfactory perception in humans. fNIRS is an optical neuroimaging technique able to measure changes in brain hemodynamics and oxygenation related to neural electrical activity. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, results of this search found that generally the majority of studies involving healthy adult subjects observed increased activity in response to odors. Other population types were also observed, such as infants, individuals with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dysosmia. fNIRS coverage heavily favored the prefrontal cortex, temporal and parietal regions. This review finds that odor induced cortical activation is dependent on multiple factors, such as odorant type, gender and population type. This review also finds that there is room for improvement in areas such as participant diversity, use of wearable fNIRS systems, physiological monitoring and multi-distance channels.

AB  - Background: The impact of screen time on mental health, including depression, has attracted increasing attention from not only children and adolescents but also the elderly. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of cohort studies to evaluate the association between screen time and depression risk. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched for cohort studies up to May 2022, and the reference lists of the included studies were also retrieved. A random-effect model was used to estimate the combined effect size. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Potential publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Begg's and Egger's tests. Results: The final analysis included 18 cohort studies with a combined total of 241,398 participants. The pooled risk ratio (RR) was 1.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.14), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 82.7%, P < 0.001). The results of subgroup analyses showed that the pooled RRs varied according to geographic locations, gender, age group, screen time in the control group, depression at the baseline, and whether the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. No obvious evidence of publication bias was found. Conclusion: This study indicates that screen time is a predictor of depressive symptoms. The effects of screen time on depression risk may vary based on the participant's age, gender, location, and screen time duration. The findings could have important implications for the prevention of depression.

AB  - Psychiatric symptoms frequently predate or complicate neurological disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases. Symptoms of bipolar spectrum disorders (BSD), like mood, behavioral, and psychotic alterations, are known to occur - individually or as a syndromic cluster - in Parkinson's disease and in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Nonetheless, due to shared pathophysiological mechanisms, or genetic predisposition, several other neurological disorders show significant, yet neglected, clinical and biological overlaps with BSD like neuroinflammation, ion channel dysfunctions, neurotransmission imbalance, or neurodegeneration. BSD pathophysiology is still largely unclear, but large-scale network dysfunctions are known to participate in the onset of mood disorders and psychotic symptoms. Thus, functional alterations can unleash BSD symptoms years before the evidence of an organic disease of the central nervous system. The aim of our narrative review was to illustrate the numerous intersections between BSD and neurological disorders from a clinical-biological point of view and the underlying predisposing factors, to guide future diagnostic and therapeutical research in the field.

AB  - Objective: Psychological morbidity among transplant recipients may negatively impact post-transplantation outcomes. Our objectives were to compute pooled incidence and prevalence estimates for depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms among adults who underwent liver transplant. Methods: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, PubMed Central, CINAHL, and Google Scholar were carried out from inception to October 2022 to identify observational studies conducted among adult liver transplant recipients which measured depression, anxiety, and/or insomnia. We used the Joanna-Briggs tool for study quality appraisal. Results: Sixty-five studies (pooled N = 12,183) provided data for meta-analysis. The one-year pooled point prevalence rate for depressive symptoms was 25% (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]: 20% to 30%; I2 = 94%; 37 studies; N = 6088) while that of anxiety and insomnia symptoms were 29% (95% CI: 21% to 38%; I2 = 96%; 28 studies; N = 4016) and 28% (95% CI: 16% to 43%; I2 = 98%; 14 studies; N = 1834), respectively. The findings remained robust across subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Most included studies had low or moderate risk of bias. Conclusions: Depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms are commonly prevalent following liver trans-plantation. Our findings, though limited by high heterogeneity across analyses, have important implications for screening, management, and prevention of psychological morbidity in this group. Systematic review registration: This protocol was submitted for registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD 42021276008).

The study was preregistered at Prospero (CRD42021283931). We included randomised controlled and pre-post trials assessing physical activity as an intervention for OCD. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool and the RoB2 tool.ResultsThe analysis included 6 trials (N = 92); 2 were RCTS and 4 were pre-post design studies. A random-effects meta-analysis of pre-post data identified a large reduction of OCD symptoms following exercise (g = 1.33 [95%CI 1.06-1.61]; k = 6). Exercise was also associated with significant pre-post reductions in anxiety (g = 0.71 [95%CI 0.37-1.05; k = 4) and depression (g = 0.57 [95%CI 0.26-0.89]; k = 2). Risk of bias was moderate-high in uncontrolled trials on the ROBINS-I and RCTs showed 'some concerns' on the RoB2.ConclusionExercise was associated with a large pre-post reduction of OCD symptoms; however, few trials were of robust quality and all were at risk of bias. Further well-powered and better quality RCTs are required to assess the role of exercise as an intervention for OCD.

AB  - The study aimed to determine how a teacher's competency at the university level related to professional commitment and job satisfaction. This systematic review intends to determine physical education teachers' competency and job satisfaction. One of the main objectives of physical education programs is to increase various activities of the student, especially physical activities and participation in it. Students who participate in physical activities feel a variety of emotions, and these may enhance their mental and physical well-being. The study concerns the teachers' satisfaction in effectively influencing and teaching the students. Job satisfaction refers to teachers' feelings and positive attitudes toward their work. The five components of job satisfaction are pay, promotion, supervision, co-workers, and work itself. Job satisfaction is broken down into these five components. Work as a teacher is one of the most important components of a teacher's or teacher's success at work and one of the key criteria for the school's achievement. Electronic libraries were explored, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, Bing Academic, and Cochrane. Appropriate keywords were used for searching the literature. By applying certain inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final studies were selected for evaluation. The study's findings showed that physical education instructors had high levels of teaching competence and moderate levels of job satisfaction. The findings demonstrated that job satisfaction and competency rise when degree levels rise, and relatedness, skill, and autonomy self-motivation ensue. Students' motivation for physical education was greatly influenced by the teachers' support, motivation, and mastery climate. The self-determination theory positively enhances physical education from the teacher's perspective on PE, increasing instruction effectiveness.

AB  - Background: There is a fundamental need for health systems, health managers, and policymakers to identify effective components of suicide prevention strategies (SPS) and programs in primary healthcare (PHC) settings. Accordingly, this systematic review aimed to identify and summarize effective and significant evidence on suicide prevention in PHC setting. We systematically searched the published literature in English from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, PsychoINFO, and Embase up to 31 July 2022. The study searched all records reporting effective and significant strategies and programs on suicide prevention in PHC settings. A content analysis approach was carried out to extract major components of suicide prevention strategies in PHC settings. Results: A total of 10 records (8 original articles and 2 reports) with 1,199,986 samples were included. In all the included articles, SPS decreased suicide rates. The majority of studies were conducted among the general population. The content analysis approach emerged five major components to SPS in PHC setting: (1) training and educating healthcare providers, (2) screening and suicide risk assessment, (3) managing depression symptoms and mental disorders, (4) managing suicide attempters and at-risk cases, and (5) prevention strategies at the general population. Conclusions: This review provided reliable evidence for health systems to develop SPS in PHC and practitioners who are eager to provide brief and effective contact interventions for suicide risk to well-serve their patients.

AB  - Adaptation and aftereffect are well-known procedures for exploring our neural representation of visual stimuli. It has been reported that they occur in face identity, facial expressions, and low-level visual features. This method has two primary advantages. One is to reveal the common or shared process of faces, that is, the overlapped or discrete representation of face identities or facial expressions. The other is to investigate the coding system or theory of face processing that underlies the ability to recognize faces. This study aims to organize recent research to guide the reader into the field of face adaptation and its aftereffect and to suggest possible future expansions in the use of this paradigm. To achieve this, we reviewed the behavioral short-term aftereffect studies on face identity (i.e., who it is) and facial expressions (i.e., what expressions such as happiness and anger are expressed), and summarized their findings about the neural representation of faces. First, we summarize the basic characteristics of face aftereffects compared to simple visual features to clarify that facial aftereffects occur at a different stage and are not inherited or combinations of low-level visual features. Next, we introduce the norm-based coding hypothesis, which is one of the theories used to represent face identity and facial expressions, and adaptation is a commonly used procedure to examine this. Subsequently, we reviewed studies that applied this paradigm to immature or impaired face recognition (i.e., children and individuals with autism spectrum disorder or prosopagnosia) and examined the relationships between their poor recognition performance and representations. Moreover, we reviewed studies dealing with the representation of non-presented faces and social signals conveyed via faces and discussed that the face adaptation paradigm is also appropriate for these types of examinations. Finally, we summarize the research conducted to date and propose a new direction for the face adaptation paradigm.

AB  - Genome-wide studies related to neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases have pointed to the role of epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs. DNA methylation machinery controls the dynamic regulation of methylation patterns in discrete brain regions. Objective: This review aims to describe the role of DNA methylation in inhibiting and progressing neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic approaches.Methods: A Systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted for all qualified studies from 2000 to 2022.Results: For the current need of time, we have focused on the DNA methylation role in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and the expression of genes involved in neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's, Depression, and Rett Syndrome. Finally, it appears that the various epigenetic changes do not occur separately and that DNA methylation and histone modification changes occur side by side and affect each other. We focused on the role of modification of DNA methylation in several genes associated with depression (NR3C1, NR3C2, CRHR1, SLC6A4, BDNF, and FKBP5), Rett syndrome (MECP2), Alzheimer's, depression (APP, BACE1, BIN1 or ANK1) and Parkinson's disease (SNCA), as well as the co-occurring modifications to histones and expression of non-coding RNAs. Understanding these epigenetic changes and their interactions will lead to better treatment strategies. Conclusion: This review captures the state of understanding of the epigenetics of neurological and neurodegen-erative diseases. With new epigenetic mechanisms and targets undoubtedly on the horizon, pharmacological modulation and regulation of epigenetic processes in the brain holds great promise for therapy.

AB  - Major depressive disorders are prevalent conditions with limited treatment response and remission. Pharma-cogenomics tests including CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genomic variants provide the most reliable actionable approach to guide choice and dosing of antidepressants in major depression to improve outcomes. We carried out a meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses of randomised controlled trials evaluating pharmacogenomic tests with CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms in major depression. A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines to search several electronic databases. Logarithmically transformed odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) for improvement, response and remission were calculated. A random -effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were subsequently carried out. Twelve randomised controlled trials were included. Pharmacogenomic tests in the treatment of depression were more effective than treatment as usual for improvement (OR:1.63, CI: 1.19-2.24), response (OR: 1.46; CI: 1.16-1.85) and remission (OR: 1.85; CI: 1.23-2.76) with no evidence of publication bias. Remission was less favourable in recent studies. The results are promising but cautious use of pharmacogenomics in major depression is advisable. PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42021261143.

Thus, a meta-analysis in this study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between daytime napping and depression. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched up to February 2022, and the reference lists of the included studies were also retrieved. A random-effects model was used to estimate the combined effect size. Results: Nine studies with 649,111 participants were included in the final analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.31) with a significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 91.3%, P for heterogeneity < 0.001), and the results demonstrated an increased risk of depressive symptoms among daytime nappers. Visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's and Begg's tests identified no obvious evidence of publication bias. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates that daytime naps are a predictor of depression. The effects of daytime napping on depression may vary depending on the characteristics of people, the pattern of naps, and the individual's sleep experience. The findings may have significant implications for future research on depression.

AB  - BackgroundTheories of the intergenerational transmission of depression emphasize alterations in emotion processing among offspring of depressed mothers as a key risk mechanism, raising questions about biological processes contributing to these alterations. The objective of this systematic annual research review was to examine and integrate studies of the associations between maternal depression diagnoses and offspring's emotion processing from birth through adolescence across biological measures including autonomic psychophysiology, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), event-related potentials (ERP), and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MethodsThe review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 standards. A systematic search was conducted in PsycInfo and PubMed in 2022 for studies that included, 1) mothers with and without DSM-defined depressive disorders assessed via a clinical or diagnostic interview, and 2) measures of offspring emotion processing assessed at the psychophysiological or neural level between birth and 18 years of age. ResultsFindings from 64 studies indicated that young offspring of mothers with depression histories exhibit heightened corticolimbic activation to negative emotional stimuli, reduced left frontal brain activation, and reduced ERP and mesocorticolimbic responses to reward cues compared to offspring of never-depressed mothers. Further, activation of resting-state networks involved in affective processing differentiate offspring of depressed relative to nondepressed mothers. Some of these alterations were only apparent among youth of depressed mothers exposed to negative environmental contexts or exhibiting current emotional problems. Further, some of these patterns were observable in infancy, reflecting very early emerging vulnerabilities. ConclusionsThis systematic review provides evidence that maternal depression is associated with alterations in emotion processing across several biological units of analysis in offspring. We present a preliminary conceptual model of the role of deficient emotion processing in pathways from maternal depression to offspring psychopathology and discuss future research avenues addressing limitations of the existing research and clinical implications.

AB  - Background: The previous meta-analysis indicated that physical exercise could play a crucially therapeutic role in reducing perinatal depression symptoms in women. However, the efficacy varies across different exercise types, forms, intensities, and duration. Aim: The purpose of this study was to review and evaluate the effects of different types, forms, intensities, and duration of exercise for improving perinatal depressive symptoms.DesignA systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Randomized controlled trials until December 2021 were searched from seven databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. The risk of bias in eligible trials was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. When high heterogeneity was tested, we used random-effects models. A funnel plot was used to assess the publication bias. This review was performed under the PRISMA guidelines, Consensus on Exercise Reporting (CERT) checklist and Cochrane Handbook. The certainty of the body of evidence was assessed using the GRADE method. Results: Of 1,573 records, 20 trials were identified in this study. The results of this review revealed that women with perinatal depression symptoms gained benefits from physical exercise [OR = 0.62, 95% CI (0.45, 0.86), P = 0.004; MD = -0.57, 95% CI (-0.83, -0.30), P < 0.0001]. Type of walking [SMD = -1.06, 95% CI (-1.92, -0.19), P < 0.00001], form of "Individual + group-based "exercise [SMD = -0.91, 95% CI (-0.80, -0.03), P = 0.04], intensity of >= 150 min per week [SMD = -0.84, 95% CI (-1.53, -0.15), P = 0.02], and >= 12 weeks duration [SMD = -0.53, 95% CI (-0.75, -0.31), P < 0.00001] seemed to generate more prominent improvement on perinatal depression symptoms. Conclusion: Physical exercise showed a significant effect on reducing perinatal depressive symptoms. This meta-analysis provides an important update on exercise's efficacy in treating perinatal depression. Further higher quality and large-scale trials are needed to substantiate our findings.

KW  - Multiple disadvantage model
AB  - How climate change is uniquely affecting Indigenous health remains a very less explored area in the existing research literature. The imperative of inclusive climate action to protect indigenous health multiplies manifolds due to their unique vulnerabilities owing to predominant dependence on natural resources and multiple disadvantages faced. The current article attempted to add to the evidence pool regarding climate change impacts on the indigenous population by systematically collecting, processing, and interpreting data as a scoping literature review for effective and inclusive climate policymaking. Twenty-Nine articles of varied study designs were identified employing a systematically organized search strategy using PubMed (Field, MeSH, and advanced search) and Google scholar; relevant data were extracted for further analysis. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were followed. Changing climate scenarios had both direct and indirect health-related impacts on indigenous health, and altered the epidemiological triad for various health-related events, causing the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases, and increased prevalence of chronic diseases and mental disorders. An expanded framework was developed showcasing the variability of climate change events, multiple disadvantages, and its impacts on indigenous populations. Few studies also reported a wide range of adaptation responses of indigenous peoples towards climate change. It was substantiated that any climate-change mitigation policy must take into account the trials and tribulations of indigenous communities. Also, due to the complexity and large variability of the impacts and differences in mitigation capabilities, policies should be contextualized locally and tailored to meet the climate need of the indigenous community.

AB  - In this article, we review research in psychology and other related social science fields that has adopted an honor framework to examine intrapersonal, interpersonal, and intergroup processes taking a culture-comparative or individual differences approach. In the sections below, we will first review research on the role of honor in interpersonal processes focusing primarily on interpersonal aggression including in close relationships, non-aggressive ways of responding to threats (e.g., forgiveness), and reciprocity. Next, we move onto reviewing research on the role of honor in intrapersonal processes, specifically in the domains of emotional responses to honor-threatening situations, mental, and physical health. Finally, we review research emerging from social and political psychology and political science that have utilized the honor framework to understand and explain group processes and intergroup relations at different level of analyses (e.g., social groups, nations). Given the limited space, our goal was to emphasize major and emerging areas of research on honor and provide food for thought for future research.

AB  - Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel are at high risk for adverse mental health outcomes during disease outbreaks. To support the development of evidence-informed mitigation strategies, we conducted a scoping review to identify the extent of research pertaining to EMS personnel's mental health during disease outbreaks and summarized key factors associated with mental health outcomes. We systematically searched three databases for articles containing keywords within three concepts: EMS personnel, disease outbreaks, and mental health. We screened and retained original peer-reviewed articles that discussed, in English, EMS personnel's mental health during disease outbreaks. Where inferential statistics were reported, the associations between individual and work-related factors and mental health outcomes were synthesized. Twenty-five articles were eligible for data extraction. Our findings suggest that many of the contributing factors for adverse mental health outcomes are related to inadequacies in fulfilling EMS personnel's basic safety and informational needs. In preparation for future disease outbreaks, resources should be prioritized toward ensuring adequate provisions of personal protective equipment and infection prevention and control training. This scoping review serves as a launching pad for further research and intervention development. (c) 2022 Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB  - Background: Participants are allowed to stay on their prescribed psychotropic medication in most trials examining psychological interventions for adult post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objectives: We aimed to conduct the first meta-analysis investigating the potential influence of such concurrent medication on efficacy. Method: To this end, we searched Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PTSDpubs from inception to April 21, 2022, for trials meeting the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trial (RCT), (2) PTSD as primary treatment focus, (3) interview-based PTSD baseline rate & GE;70%, (4) N & GE; 20, (5) mean age & GE;18 years. Trials were excluded when intake of psychotropics was not (sufficiently) reported. Results: Most published trials did not report on the intake of psychotropic medication. A total of 75 RCTs (N = 4,901 patients) met inclusion criteria. Trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) was the most well-researched intervention. Short-term efficacy of psychological treatments did not differ by the proportion of participants taking concurrent psychotropic medication during psychological treatment in all but one analysis. In trials comparing TF-CBT and active control conditions at posttreatment, TF-CBT was more effective when most participants were concurrently medicated (g = 0.87, 95% CI 0.53-1.22) rather than unmedicated (g = 0.27; 95% CI 0.01-0.54, p = 0.017), with younger age (b(1) = -0.04, p = 0.008) and higher proportion of females (b(1) = 0.01, p = 0.014) being associated with higher efficacy only in trials with high proportions of medicated participants. No differences in efficacy by proportions of participants taking concurrent psychotropic medication were found at follow-up. Conclusions: Results suggest that psychological interventions are effective for PTSD irrespective of concurrent intake of psychotropics.

AB  - Introduction: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurrent distressing thoughts and repetitive behaviors, or mental rituals performed to reduce anxiety. Recent neurobiological techniques have been particularly convincing in suggesting that cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortico (CSTC) circuits, including orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum regions (caudate nucleus and putamen), are responsible for mediation of OCD symptoms. However, it is still unclear how these regions are affected by OCD treatments in adult patients. To address this yet open question, we conducted a systematic review of all studies examining neurobiological changes before and after first-line psychological OCD treatment, i.e., cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods: Studies were included if they were conducted in adults with OCD and they assessed the neurobiological effects of CBT before and after treatment. Two databases were searched: PsycINFO and PubMed for the time frame up to May 2022. Results: We obtained 26 pre-post CBT treatment studies performed using different neurobiological techniques, namely functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Positron emission tomography (PET), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), 5-HT concentration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), Electroencephalography (EEG). Neurobiological data show the following after CBT intervention: (i) reduced activations in OFC across fMRI, EEG, and rCBF; (ii) decreased activity in striatum regions across fMRI, rCBF, PET, and MRI; (iii) increased activations in cerebellum (CER) across fMRI and MRI; (iv) enhanced neurochemical concentrations in MRS studies in OFC, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum regions. Most of these neurobiological changes are also accompanied by an improvement in symptom severity as assessed by a reduction in the Y-BOCS scores. ConclusionL: Cognitive-behavioral therapy seems to be able to restructure, modify, and transform the neurobiological component of OCD, in addition to the clinical symptoms. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to frame the OCD spectrum in a dimensional way.

AB  - IntroductionThe mental health crisis has caused widespread suffering and has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Marginalized groups are especially affected, with many concerns rooted in social determinants of mental health. To stem this tide of suffering, consideration of approaches outside the traditional biomedical model will be necessary. Drawing from task-sharing models of mental health care that have been pioneered in low-resource settings, community-initiated care (CIC) represents a potentially promising collection of approaches. This landscape analysis seeks to identify examples of CIC that have been implemented outside of the research context, with the aim of identifying barriers and facilitators of scale up. MethodsA narrative review approach was used for this landscape analysis in which the PubMed database was searched and further supplemented with Google Scholar. Promising programs were then discussed over multiple rounds of meetings with the research team, consisting of collaborators with varied experiences in mental health. Using the selection criteria and feedback derived from group meetings, a final list of programs was identified and summarized according to common characteristics and features. ResultsThe initial PubMed search yielded 16 results, supplemented by review of the first 100 entries in Google Scholar. Through 5 follow-up meetings among team members, consensus was reached on a final list of 9 programs, which were grouped into three categories based on similar themes and topics: (1) approaches for the delivery of psychosocial interventions; (2) public health and integrative approaches to mental health; and (3) approaches for addressing youth mental health. Key facilitators to scale up included the importance of sustainable financing and human resources, addressing social determinants and stigma, engaging diverse stakeholders, leveraging existing health infrastructure, using sustainable training models, ensuring cultural relevance and appropriateness, and leveraging digital technologies. DiscussionThis landscape analysis, though not an exhaustive summary of the literature, describes promising examples of efforts to scale up CIC outside of the research context. Going forward, it will be necessary to mobilize stakeholders at the community, health system, and government levels to effectively promote CIC.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to public health problems, including depression. There has been a significant increase in research on depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little attention has been paid to the overall trend in this field based on bibliometric analyses. Methods: Co-Occurrence (COOC) and VOSviewer bibliometric methods were utilized to analyze depression in COVID-19 literature in the core collection of the Web of Science (WOS). The overall characteristics of depression during COVID-19 were summarized by analyzing the number of published studies, keywords, institutions, and countries. Results: A total of 9,694 English original research articles and reviews on depression during COVID-19 were included in this study. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom were the countries with the largest number of publications and had close cooperation with each other. Research institutions in each country were dominated by universities, with the University of Toronto being the most productive institution in the world. The most frequently published author was Ligang Zhang. Visualization analysis showed that influencing factors, adverse effects, and coping strategies were hotspots for research. Conclusion: The results shed light on the burgeoning research on depression during COVID-19, particularly the relationship between depression and public health. In addition, future research on depression during COVID-19 should focus more on special groups and those at potential risk of depression in the general population, use more quantitative and qualitative studies combined with more attention to scale updates, and conduct longitudinal follow-ups of the outcomes of interventions. In conclusion, this study contributes to a more comprehensive view of the development of depression during COVID-19 and suggests a theoretical basis for future research on public health.

AB  - Background: Smoke from wildfires is a growing public health risk due to the enormous amount of smoke-related pollution that is produced and can travel thousands of kilometers from its source. While many studies have documented the physical health harms of wildfire smoke, less is known about the effects on mental health and well-being. Understanding the effects of wildfire smoke on mental health and well-being is crucial as the world enters a time in which wildfire smoke events become more frequent and severe. We conducted a scoping review of the existing information on wildfire smoke's impact on mental health and well-being and developed a model for understanding the pathways in which wildfire smoke may contribute to mental health distress. Methods: We conducted searches using PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google, Scopus, and ProQuest for 1990-2022. These searches yielded 200 articles. Sixteen publications met inclusion criteria following screening and eligibility assessment. Three more publications from the bibliographies of these articles were included for a total of 19 publications. Results: Our review suggests that exposure to wildfire smoke may have mental health impacts, particularly in episodes of chronic and persistent smoke events, but the evidence is inconsistent and limited. Qualitative studies disclose a wider range of impacts across multiple mental health and well-being domains. The potential pathways connecting wildfire smoke with mental health and well-being operate at multiple interacting levels including individual, social and community networks, living and working conditions, and ecological levels. Conclusions: Priorities for future research include: 1) applying more rigorous methods; 2) differentiating between mental illness and emotional well-being; 3) studying chronic, persistent or repeated smoke events; 4) identifying the contextual factors that set the stage for mental health and well-being effects, and 5) identifying the causal processes that link wildfire smoke to mental health and well-being effects. The pathways model can serve as a basis for further research and knowledge synthesis on this topic. Also, it helps public health, community mental health, and emergency management practitioners mitigate the mental health and well-being harms of wildfire smoke.

AB  - This review examined the effects of private and communal participatory prayer on pain. Nine databases were searched. Six randomized controlled trials were included. For private prayer, medium to large effects emerged for 67% to 69% of between-group comparisons; participants in the prayer condition reported lower pain intensity (0.59 < d < 26.17; 4 studies) and higher pain tolerance (0.70 < d < 1.05; 1 study). Pre- to post-intervention comparisons yielded medium to large effects (0.76 < d < 1.67; 2 studies); pain intensity decreased. Although firm conclusions cannot be made because meta-analysis was based on only two studies, the analysis suggested prayer might reduce pain intensity (SMD = - 2.63, 95% CI [- 3.11, - 2.14], I = 0%).

AB  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and similar psychoactive drugs have been used in psychotherapy since 1949, when the first clinical study with lower-dose LSD showed therapeutically relevant effects. This caused an intense interest among psychotherapists and researchers, alike, on an international scale. In 1960, the use of serial lower-dose LSD/psilocybin sessions in a psychoanalytical framework, which was dominant at the time, was named "psycholytic therapy". Psycholytic therapy was usually conducted in clinical environments, on both an inpatient and outpatient basis. Psycholytic therapy was developed and established over a 15-year period on the European continent, where it was used at 30 clinical treatment centers and by more than 100 outpatient psychotherapists. Psycholytic approaches were employed minimally in North America, where the psychedelic approach (use of one or two high-dose sessions for "personality-transforming mystical experiences") became the dominant method in use. The leading figure in psycholytic therapy was Professor Hanscarl Leuner in Germany, who laid the ground with his uniquely fine grained analysis of the LSD reaction in a 1962 monograph. He was central in establishing and distributing psycholytic therapy in Europe and abroad. The article provides comprehensive background information and outlines the essential features of psycholytic therapy. Evidence for the efficacy of psycholytic therapy is reviewed and a case for the inclusion of the psycholytic approach in the field of substance-assisted psychotherapy is made.

AB  - This systematic scoping review synthesizes the recommended approaches for providing culturally safe family violence interventions to Indigenous peoples in health care and social service settings. A total of 3783 sources were identified through our electronic database searches, hand-searching of Indigenous-focused journals, and backward and forward citation chaining. After screening those sources in duplicate, 28 papers were included for synthesis in June 2020. Forward citation chaining of these 28 included articles in June 2022 identified an additional 304 possible articles for inclusion; following the screening of those 304 articles, an additional 6 were retained in the review. Thus, a total of 34 articles were included for data extraction and narrative synthesis. Initial results were presented to members of the Six Nations of the Grand River Youth Mental Wellness Committee, and their feedback was incorporated into our inductive organization of findings. Our findings represent three thematic areas that reflect key recommendations for health care and social service provision to Indigenous families for whom family violence is a concern: (1) creating the conditions for cultural safety; (2) healing at the individual and community level; and (3) system-level change. These findings demonstrate the need to center Indigenous peoples and perspectives in the development and implementation of cultural safety approaches, to acknowledge and address historically contingent causes of past and present family violence including colonization and related state policies, and to transform knowledge and power relationships at the provider, organization, and government level.

Despite Gardner's rejection of SI, the proliferation of SI models and research supporting the advantages of SI across a wide field of endeavors, and correlation with neurological structures and genetic indicators strongly support its validity as an intelligence. This article reviewed key models of SI, and studies supporting its adaptability and biological correlates. Puzzling results in some areas warrant exploration, especially the degree to which various models converge and the extent to which a single SI model may be truly universal.

AB  - Introduction: The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) is a commonly used scale of mental wellbeing focusing entirely on the positive aspect of mental health. It has been widely used in a broad range of clinical and research settings, including to evaluate if interventions, programmes or pilots improve wellbeing. We aimed to systematically review all interventions that used WEMWBS and evaluate which interventions are the most effective at improving wellbeing. Methods: Eligible populations included children and adults, with no health or age restrictions. Any intervention study was eligible if the wellbeing outcome was measured using the 7 or 14-item WEMWBS scale assessed both pre- and post-intervention. We identified eligible intervention studies using three approaches: a database search (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PyschInfo and Web of Science from January 2007 to present), grey literature search, and by issuing a call for evidence. Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of standardised mean differences in the intervention group were used to summarise intervention effects on WEMWBS score. Results: We identified 223 interventions across 209 studies, with a total of 53,834 participants across all studies. Five main themes of interventions were synthesised: psychological (n = 80); social (n = 54); arts, culture and environment (n = 29); physical health promotion (n = 18); and other (n = 28). Psychological interventions based on resilience, wellbeing or self-management techniques had the strongest effect on wellbeing. A broad range of other interventions were effective at improving mental wellbeing, including other psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy, psychoeducation and mindfulness. Medium to strong effects were also seen for person-centred support/advice (social), arts-based, parenting (social) and social prescribing interventions. However, a major limitation of the evidence was that only 75 (36%) of studies included a control group. Conclusions: WEMWBS has been widely used to assess wellbeing across a diverse range of interventions, settings and samples. Despite substantial heterogeneity in individual intervention design, delivery and groups targeted, results indicate that a broad range of intervention types can successfully improve wellbeing. Methodological changes, such as greater use of control groups in intervention evaluation, can help future researchers and policy makers further understand what works for mental wellbeing.

AB  - There is an increasing focus on the role of complexity in public health and public policy fields which has brought about a methodological shift towards computational approaches. This includes agent-based modelling (ABM), a method used to simulate individuals, their behaviour and interactions with each other, and their social and physical environment. This paper aims to systematically review the use of ABM to simulate the generation or persistence of health inequalities. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (1 January 2013-15 November 2022) were searched, supplemented with manual reference list searching. Twenty studies were included; fourteen of them described models of health behaviours, most commonly relating to diet (n = 7). Six models explored health outcomes, e.g., morbidity, mortality, and depression. All of the included models involved heterogeneous agents and were dynamic, with agents making decisions, growing older, and/or becoming exposed to different health risks. Eighteen models represented physical space and in eleven models, agents interacted with other agents through social networks. ABM is increasingly contributing to our understanding of the socioeconomic inequalities in health. However, to date, the majority of these models focus on the differences in health behaviours. Future research should attempt to investigate the social and economic drivers of health inequalities using ABM.

AB  - BackgroundAlcoholism is a serious social, economic and public health problem. Alcoholism can affect the gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and it can be fatal, costing the healthcare system huge amounts of money. Despite the availability of cognitive-behavioural and psychosocial therapies, alcoholism has a high recurrence rate and a dismal prognosis, with a wide inter-individual variation. As a result, better or adjuvant therapies that improve or facilitate alcoholism therapy are required. We conducted a systematic review to look into the published studies that reported the effectiveness of non-pharmacological neurofeedback (NF) interventions in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUDs).MethodsPubMed, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library, Science Direct and Clinicaltrial.gov were searched until 4 April 2022. Original articles of any design reporting on the use of NF approaches in the treatment of AUDs were included. Information related to study design, participants, control group, neuromodulation therapy, number of sessions and key findings of the study were extracted. The Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies was used to assess the quality of studies.ResultsA total of 20 research articles (including 618 participants) were retrieved and included for qualitative analysis. The sample size ranged from 1 (case report) to 80, with years of publication ranging from 1977 to 2022. Nine of the 20 articles included in the study were conducted in the United States, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, India, the Netherlands and South Korea. Out of the 20 studies included, 8 (40%) had a moderate risk of bias, while the other, i.e. 60% had a low risk of bias. The effectiveness of various neurological treatments in the treatment of AUDs was established in these 20 studies. There have been 11 studies on EEG NF training, three studies on real-time FMRI NF, two studies each on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and one study each on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and theta burst stimulation (TBS). These alternative neurological therapies have been demonstrated to lower alcohol cravings and consumption temporarily, reduce anxiety and depression scores, reduce relapse rates and increase control of brain activity.ConclusionsThe use of various neuromodulation approaches to the treatment of AUD shows promise. However, more research with larger sample size is required.

AB  - The evidence regarding the benefits of yoga for treating psychological trauma is well-established; however, there is a paucity of qualitative reviews exploring this topic. The purpose of this rapid review is to gain a deeper understanding of the impact that yoga can have on people with a history of psychological trauma and to reveal barriers and facilitators to the uptake of yoga in this cohort, from a qualitative perspective. The Ovid(EMBASE), Ovid(MEDLINE), PsycINFO, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched using key terms. The systematic search generated 148 records, and 11 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria. The following main impacts of yoga on participants were identified: feeling an increased sense of self-compassion; feeling more centred; developing their coping skills; having a better mind-body relationship; and improving their relationships with others. The main barriers were also identified: concerns initiating yoga; time and motivational issues; and the costs and location of classes. The main facilitator was the feeling of safety generated in the trauma-informed yoga classes. This review suggests that yoga offers great potential in the field of trauma recovery. Despite this, more high-quality research with rigorous methodologies is called for to allow this field to advance.

AB  - Eating disorders (EDs) are common among children and adolescents and are characterized by excessive concerns for physical appearance, distorted body image, and fear of gaining weight. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the follow-up of EDs from adolescence to adulthood, analyzing persistence, relapses, and associated comorbidities. We searched scientific articles in PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Embase through two research strings, one for quantitative outcomes (recovery/persistence, relapse, and remission) and one for the other outcomes (psychiatric and medical comorbidities, substance use, and social-relational complications). From a total of 8043 retrieved articles, we selected 503 papers after exclusion of duplicates and title/abstract screening. After a full-text evaluation, we included 16 studies eligible for this review. We performed a meta-analysis describing the quantitative results, and we created a narrative synthesis for the qualitative outcomes. Results: Our results confirm that EDs can persist in early adulthood in 40.7% of cases with a relapse percentage of 24.5%. Individuals with an ED more frequently present with an empathy deficit and comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders. EDs are chronic and complex disorders, more frequent in females. In most cases, EDs reduce the autonomy of individuals who present many difficulties in affirming their independence from parental family.

KW  - DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
AB  - The physical impacts of overtraining, sport specification, and burnout are well documented in the literature; however, the state of the student-athlete's (SA's) mental health is something that needs to be investigated more comprehensively. Literature on SA mental health has gained prevalence within the last 5 years. The combination of pressure from sport and academics, as well as the stigmatization of clinical mental health treatment, can have a significant effect on the SA's psyche. This review explores the prevalence of mental health conditions (MHCs) in high school and collegiate SAs. This includes signs and symptoms of mental health diagnoses to include substance-and alcohol-related addictive disorders and risk factors of such. A systematic review of the CINAHL, ERIC, SPORTDiscus, APA PsycINFO, and Rehabilitation & Sports Medicine resource databases was con-ducted. The initial search yielded 855 results. Following double screening, 22 studies were included, all of which were deemed medium to high quality. The findings indicate an alarming presence of MHCs ranging from risk factors of alcohol use and major depressive disorders among SAs. There was a high prevalence of mental health issues among SAs who are Black, Indigenous, people of color (BIPOC), and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer (LGBTQ). In most cases, participation in competitive athletics (varsity) did not contribute to additional MHCs for SAs. Sport psychologists should play a role in mental health programming within athletic departments. Athletic departments should develop proactive, targeted strategies to address MHCs for SAs.

AB  - Objective: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on rumination among patients with depression and their efficacy across countries and year of publication and control conditions. Methods: Web of Science Core Collection, Medline, BIOSIS Citation Index, KCI-Korean Journal Database, SciELO Citation Index, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched to include randomized controlled trials of MBIs for depressive rumination that met the criteria. The Rumination Scale was used as the primary outcome indicator; Depression, mindfulness, and anxiety indexes were selected as the secondary outcome indicators. An evaluation of bias risk was conducted to identify possible sources of bias based on methodological and clinical factors. RevMan5.3 software was used to perform a meta-analysis of the extracted data. Results: Nineteen studies with 1138 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that MBIs could significantly reduce rumination levels in patients with depression (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.58, -0.34; p < 0.001), notably improve depression (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI: -0.83, -0.32; p < 0.001), enhance mindfulness ability (SMD = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.32; p < 0.001), and reduce the anxiety of patients with depression (SMD = -0.45, 95% CI: -0.62, -0.27; p < 0.001). MBIs conducted in Asia improved rumination better than studies in Europe and North America (SMD = -2.05 95% CI: -4.08, -0.01; p < 0.001) but had no greater effect than behavior activation on depression. The interventions carried out in the past 5 years were significantly better than earlier studies in improving mindfulness levels (SMD = 2.74; 95% CI: 0.81, 4.66; p = 0.005). Conclusions: MBIs are effective in the treatment of depression as they produce pleasant improvement in rumination and depression, decrease the degree of anxiety, and enhance mindfulness levels compared to controls. In newer forms of MBIs, regional differences need to be considered when designing the intervention program. More large, high-quality randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm the conclusion that the effectiveness of MBIs has differences in terms of the trial area and year of publication.

KW  - ANXIETY
AB  - Background: Depression is a serious risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Improving depression can alleviate cardiac symptoms and improve quality of life. Studies have shown that acupuncture has a positive effect on depression and CVD. This systematic review and meta-analysis wilt evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of depression complicated with CVD.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and China Biomedical Literature databases. Randomized controlled trials of acupuncture vs. standard care or sham acupuncture or antidepressants were included. The retrieval time is from database construction to 07 April 2022. We used the "risk of bias" tool of Cochrane Collaboration, and the Review Manager (RevMan.) Version 5.4.1 for statistics analysis. Primary outcomes included Hamilton scale for depression (HAMD), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the effective rate of depression. Secondary outcomes included frequency of angina pectoris and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for angina pain.
   Results: A total of 2,366 studies were screened based on the search strategy. Twelve eligible studies with a total of 1,203 participants have been identified. The result showed that acupuncture reduced the HAMD score [weighted mean difference (WMD): -3.23; 95% confidence interval (CI): -5.38 to -1.09; P = 0.003] and the SDS score (WMD: -185; 95% CI: -2.14 to -156; P < 0.00001) in patients with depression complicated with CVD. Acupuncture also improved the effective rate of depression (risk ratio: 115; 95% Cl: 1.03 to 1.29; P = 0.01). The result also showed that acupuncture reduced the attack frequency of angina pectoris (WMD: -4.54; 95% CI: -5.96 to -3.11; P < 0.00001) and the VAS score for angina pain (WMD: -0.72; 95% CI: -106 to -0.38; P < 0.0001). This article reviewed the significant advantages of acupuncture for depression and the superiority of acupuncture over no-intervention therapy, antidepressant therapy, and psychotherapy in reducing angina frequency and pain intensity in patients with CVD.
   Conclusion: This systematic review suggested that acupuncture was a good complementary and alternative therapy for CVD complicated with depression. Considering the limitations of the included research literature, it is still necessary to perform multi-center, Large-sample, and double-blind high-quality studies to provide higher-level evidence in the later stage.

AB  - The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex, multilayered, and not fully understood, resulting in a lack of effective disease-modifying treatments for this prevalent neurodegenerative condition. Symptoms of PD are heterogenous, including motor impairment as well as non-motor symptoms such as depression, cognitive impairment, and circadian disruption. Aging and stress are important risk factors for PD, leading us to explore pathways that may either accelerate or protect against cellular aging and the detrimental effects of stress. Cortisol is a much-studied hormone that can disrupt mitochondrial function and increase oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, which are recognized as key underlying disease mechanisms in PD. The more recently discovered klotho protein, considered a general aging-suppressor, has a similarly wide range of actions but in the opposite direction to cortisol: promoting mitochondrial function while reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Both hormones also converge on pathways of vitamin D metabolism and insulin resistance, also implicated to play a role in PD. Interestingly, aging, stress and PD associate with an increase in cortisol and decrease in klotho, while physical exercise and certain genetic variations lead to a decrease in cortisol response and increased klotho. Here, we review the interrelated opposite actions of cortisol and klotho in the pathogenesis of PD. Together they impact powerful and divergent mechanisms that may go on to influence PD-related symptoms. Better understanding of these hormones in PD would facilitate the design of effective interventions that can simultaneously impact the multiple systems involved in the pathogenesis of PD.

AB  - Aim: The current paper aims to review mandibular flexure and its clinical implications in the field of oral rehabilitation. Mandibular flexure is a deformity of the mandible, which occurs during jaw movements. Methods and Materials: An electronic database search was conducted using the PRISM model, with a total of 49 articles included. Results: Mandibular flexure affects various stages of oral rehabilitation treatments. Effects of mandibular flexure are more significant in periodontal patients, and in implant-supported restorations, compared to natural teeth, due to differences in the force absorption by the periodontal ligament. Various adjustments must be made to the prosthodontic framework to enable long-term survival of the restorative treatments. Conclusions: Dental practitioners should pay attention to the following: (1) digital impressions are preferred over conventional; (2) mouth opening should be kept to a minimum (as possible, up to 10-20 mm) while also avoiding any anterior movements of the mandible (protrusion); (3) the number of abutment teeth should be kept to a minimum; (4) structures in the lower jaw should be splitted; (5) non-rigid connectors should be used to reduce the effort exerted; (6) in periodontal patients, the preference is for short-span restorations and non-rigid connectors; (7) in implant-supported restorations, it is preferable to divide the framework into two or three segments, utilizing rigid materials with a low elastic modulus. There is no agreement in the literature about the preferred location of the implants in the jaw.

AB  - Purpose To identify and summarise extant knowledge about patient ethnicity and the use of various types of restrictive practices in adult mental health inpatient settings.Methods A scoping review methodological framework recommended by the JBI was used. A systematic search was conducted in APA PsycINFO, CINAHL with Full Text, Embase, PubMed and Scopus. Additionally, grey literature searches were conducted in Google, OpenGrey and selected websites, and the reference lists of included studies were explored.Results Altogether, 38 studies were included: 34 were primary studies; 4, reviews. The geographical settings were as follows: Europe (n = 26), Western Pacific (n = 8), Americas (n = 3) and South-East Asia (n = 1). In primary studies, ethnicity was reported according to migrant/national status (n = 16), mixed categories (n = 12), indigenous vs. non-indigenous (n = 5), region of origin (n = 1), sub-categories of indigenous people (n = 1) and religion (n = 1). In reviews, ethnicity was not comparable. The categories of restrictive practices included seclusion, which was widely reported across the studies (n = 20), multiple restrictive practices studied concurrently (n = 17), mechanical restraint (n = 8), rapid tranquillisation (n = 7) and manual restraint (n = 1).Conclusions Ethnic disparities in restrictive practice use in adult mental health inpatient settings has received some scholarly attention. Evidence suggests that certain ethnic minorities were more likely to experience restrictive practices than other groups. However, extant research was characterised by a lack of consensus and continuity. Furthermore, widely different definitions of ethnicity and restrictive practices were used, which hampers researchers' and clinicians' understanding of the issue. Further research in this field may improve mental health practice.

AB  - Agriculture, the world's most dominant land use type, burdens freshwater biodiversity with a multitude of stressors such as diffuse pollution and hydromorphological alteration. However, it is difficult to directly link agricultural land use with biota response as agricultural stressors can also originate from other causes. Also, there is evidence for positive and negative effects of agriculture on organisms, agricultural impact differs strongly with the biological metric and study region considered and agricultural impact differs among practice and type, which in turn affects different organism groups with varying severity. Against this background, our study aimed at assessing, if agricultural land use has a consistent effect on river biota. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, which yielded 43 studies and 76 relationships between agriculture and aquatic organism groups. The relationships were subjected to a meta-analysis using Hedge's g to calculate the standardized mean difference of effects. Overall, we detected a medium to strong effect g = - 0.74 of agricultural land use on freshwater biota, only marginally influenced by study design, river type and region. Strong differences in biota response could be observed depending on the biological metric assessed, with ecological quality indices of agricultural impairment performing best. Sensitive taxa declined with agricultural impact, while tolerant taxa tended to benefit. In addition, the biota response differed among agricultural types and practices and organism group, with macroinvertebrates showing the strongest effect. Our results quantify the effects of agriculture on riverine biota and suggest biological metric types for assessing agricultural impact. Further research is needed to discriminate between agricultural types and account for intensity.

AB  - Background:Meditation is associated with health benefits; however, there are reports that it may trigger or exacerbate psychotic states. In this review, we aim to collate case reports of psychotic disorders occurring in association with meditative practice and to discuss the relationship between psychosis and meditation. Methodology:We performed case-based analysis of all the existing studies published in English language using PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL and Google Scholar with the search terms; 'Psychosis' OR 'Psychotic Symptoms' OR 'Schizophrenia' AND 'Meditation.' Results:A total of 19 studies and 28 cases were included in the review. The patients described had an age range of 18-57 years; there was equal distribution of males and females. The diagnoses included acute psychosis in 14 cases, schizophrenia in 7 cases, mania with psychotic symptoms in 3 cases, and schizoaffective disorder in 1 case. The types of meditation described were Transcendent, Mindfulness, Buddhist Meditation like Qigong, Zen, and Theraveda, and others like Bikram yoga, Pranic Healing, and Hindustan Type meditation. Of the 28 cases reported, 14 patients had certain precipitating factors like insomnia, lack of food intake, history of mental illness, stress, and psychoactive substance use. Conclusion:There are case reports of psychotic disorder arising in association with meditative practice; however, it is difficult to attribute a causal relationship between the two. At the same time, there is a body of research describing the beneficial effect of meditative practice in clinical settings for patients with psychotic disorders. Appropriately designed studies are needed to further investigate the relationship between meditative practice and psychosis.

AB  - In this review of emotion, emotional intelligence (EI) and creativity, we look at the various ways that these topics can be explored together using the seven Cs of Creativity as a structuring framework. The seven Cs of creativity are: creators, creating, collaborations, contexts, creations, consumption and curricula, representing the different facets of creativity research. The question of emotion and creativity has a long historical lineage, which has led up to the study of intelligent and dynamic aspects of emotion and their impact on creativity. Previous and emerging work on EI, related emotional aspects and creativity offer promising ways to advance this field of research. However, we show that some aspects of creativity and EI are less explored than others. We offer several implications for the direction of future work.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic and multi-systemic autoimmune disease, which has a deleterious impact on patients' psychological well-being. This paper aims to review the existing literature on empirical research on psychological outcomes of SLE and psychological interventions to improve well-being in SLE patients. A search of significant English language articles was conducted in PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and ResearchGate databases. Titles and abstracts were screened for the relevant terms, including "systemic lupus erythematosus", "childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus", "juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus", "lupus nephritis", and their respective synonyms along with "depression", "anxiety", "fatigue", "medical adherence", "health-related quality of life", "self-management" or "intervention". The articles were evaluated by independent reviewers and the lists of eligible publications were compared whilst disagreements were settled by discussion. Of the 59 publications sought for retrieval, 35 papers were shortlisted based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. They were classified according to their content and the methodology applied. Research topics including "anxiety and depression in SLE" and "self-management interventions for SLE patients" were identified and are presented in this review. As the prognosis and life expectancy of SLE patients are improving, further research on the psychological outcomes of SLE and the evidence-based psychological interventions to improve patients' well-being are justified.

AB  - This work presents the current state of knowledge about the possible contributory influence of the electromagnetic field on the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. Up-to-date literature indicates both favourable and adverse effects of electromagnetic exposure on human health, making it difficult to come to valid and unambiguous conclusions. The epidemiological data analysis from the World Health Organization statistics shows a substantial rise in neurological mortality compared with rises in total populations in developed countries over a mere 15-year period. The largest of the analysed countries produced odds ratios of >100%. The contribution of electromagnetic exposure to the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is still undoubtedly open to discussion, and it requires further in-depth research to assess the action mechanism of electromagnetic fields in neurodegenerative diseases. The limitations of research published hitherto and the problem of drawing unequivocal conclusions are also in focus.

AB  - An increasing body of evidence has linked greenspace and various health outcomes in children and adolescents, but the conclusions were inconsistent. For this review, we comprehensively summarized the measurement methods of greenspace, resultant health outcomes, and potential mechanisms from epidemiological studies in children and adolescents (aged <= 19 years). We searched for studies published and indexed in MEDLINE and EMBASE (via Ovid) up to April 11, 2022. There were a total of 9,291 studies identified with 140 articles from 28 countries finally assessed and included in this systematic review. Over 70% of the studies were conducted in highly urbanised countries/regions, but very limited research has been done in low-and middle-income countries and none in Africa. Measures of greenspace varied. Various health outcomes were reported, including protective effects of greenspace exposure on aspects of obesity/overweight, myopia, lung health, circulatory health, cognitive function, and general health in children and adolescents. The associations between greenspace exposure and other health outcomes were inconsistent, especially for respiratory health studies. We pooled odds ratios (OR) using random-effects meta-analysis for health outcomes of asthma (OR = 0.94, 95%CI: 0.84 to 1.06), allergic rhinitis (OR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.25), and obesity/overweight (OR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.84 to 0.98) with per 0.1 unit increase in normalized difference in vegetation index (NDVI). These associations have important implications for the assessment and management of urban envi-ronment and health in children and adolescents.

AB  - Background:No consensus on whether physical activity (PA) is related to physical and mental health among pediatric population remains has been reached to date. To further explore their association, our study assessed the effect of PA on physical and mental health of children and adolescents through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies (RCTs). Methods:Several databases(Web of science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central register of controlled trials, CINAHL) were searched from inception to 1st, December 2020 without language restrictions. Results:38,236 records were identified primitively and 31 included studies with 1,255 participants eventually met our inclusion criteria, all of which exhibited a relatively low-moderate risk of bias of overall quality. In regard to mental health, the administration of PA, compared with the control group, led to moderate improvements in Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD)[Standard mean difference (SMD) = -0.50, Confidence interval(CI): -0.87, -0.14)] and depression(SMD = -0.68, CI: -0.98, -0.38) among children and adolescents. Similarly, significant result was observed in obesity (SMD = -0.58, CI: -0.80, -0.36). No significant differences were observed in Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (SMD = -0.29, CI: -0.59, 0.01). Conclusion:Altogether, PA may have a beneficial effect on children and adolescents with ASD, depression and obesity; nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence to confirm its efficacy in ADHD. More large-scale population based randomized controlled trials are needed to explore more reliable evidence between them.

AB  - COVID-19 is a major threat to public safety, and emergency public health measures to protect lives (e.g., lockdown, social distancing) have caused widespread disruption. While these measures are necessary to prevent catastrophic trauma and grief, many people are experiencing heightened stress and fear. Public health measures, risks of COVID-19 and stress responses compound existing inequities in our community. First Nations communities are particularly at risk due to historical trauma, ongoing socio-economic deprivation, and lack of trust in government authorities as a result of colonization. The objective of this study was to review evidence for trauma-informed public health emergency responses to inform development of a culturally-responsive trauma-informed public health emergency framework for First Nations communities. We searched relevant databases from 1/1/2000 to 13/11/2020 inclusive, which identified 40 primary studies (and eight associated references) for inclusion in this review. Extracted data were subjected to framework and thematic synthesis. No studies reported evaluations of a trauma-informed public health emergency response. However, included studies highlighted key elements of a "trauma-informed lens, " which may help to consider implications, reduce risks and foster a sense of security, wellbeing, self- and collective-efficacy, hope and resilience for First Nations communities during COVID-19. We identified key elements for minimizing the impact of compounding trauma on First Nations communities, including: a commitment to equity and human rights, cultural responsiveness, good communication, and positive leadership. The six principles guiding trauma-informed culturally-responsive public health emergency frameworks included: (i) safety, (ii) empowerment, (iii) holistic support, (iv) connectedness and collaboration, (v) compassion and caring, and (vi) trust and transparency in multi-level responses, well-functioning social systems, and provision of basic services. These findings will be discussed with First Nations public health experts, together with data on the experiences of First Nations families and communities during COVID-19, to develop a trauma-integrated public health emergency response framework or "lens " to minimize compounding trauma for First Nations communities.

AB  - Background Depression is a worldwide disease. CBT-based self-help treatment allows patients with mild to moderate depression symptoms to improve their depression or to bridge the waiting- or pandemic period until they receive further clinical treatment. Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the efficacy, acceptability and improvement in quality of life of computer-delivered and/or internet-based CBT self-help interventions with minimal guidance (up to 10 min) for depression. The second aim was to compare the effectiveness of reducing depression symptoms at post-treatment of treatment by the type of minimal guidance: (1) e-mail, (2) telephone calls, (3) e-mail and telephone together, or (4) face-to-face. Methods The Cochrane depression, anxiety, and neurosis review group's specialized register electronic searches, grey literature, reference lists and correspondence were used to search for published and unpublished RCTs that reported efficacy of computer- and/or internet-based CBT self-help treatments for depression with minimal guidance up to 10 min per week. Methodological quality of included studies was evaluated with Cochrane Collaboration tools for assessing risk of bias. The meta-analysis was accomplished using the RevMen software. Results In total, 2809 study abstracts were checked for eligibility. Out of these, 19 studies (21 samples) with a total of 3226 participants were included. The results showed that concerning efficacy, the treatment group is superior to the control group with a medium to large effect size of 0.65. Also, treatment groups with combined guidance by e-mail and telephone calls together had greater effects (SMD -0.76) than groups with other types of minimal guidance (guided by e-mail SMD -0.63; guided face to-face SMD - 0.66; guided by telephone calls SMD -0.49). Findings showed also, that iCBT with minimal guidance had small but statistically significant effect size of 0.28 in improving quality of life. Moreover, there were higher drop-out rates in the treatment condition (RR 1.36) than in the control groups. Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis support the efficacy of computer- and/or internet-based CBT self-help programs with minimal weekly guidance up to only 10 min for improving depression symptoms at post-treatment for adults. In addition, the results are pointing towards two practical implications. Firstly, depressed persons can use self-help treatment with minimal guidance at home to improve their symptoms or to bridge the waiting time - or pandemic period - before they receive professional face-to-face treatment. Secondly, it can help clinicians to make the decision about using CBT-based self-help treatments for patients that do not need urgent professional treatment, or to combine it with face-to-face therapy.

AB  - Background It has been shown that ketamine can improve suicidality and depression. Evidence for other dimensions of psychopathology is lacking. We undertook a systematic review to investigate the effect of ketamine on cognition, anxiety, quality of life, and social functioning in adults with psychiatric disorders. Methods PubMed (Medline), Scopus, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched up to April 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ketamine [or its S (+) enantiomer] reporting data on cognition, anxiety, quality of life, social functioning in adults with psychiatric disorders were included. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used for summarizing continuous outcomes. Results Twenty-two reports were included in the final selection, of which 20, corresponding to 1,298 participants, were included in the quantitative synthesis. Affective disorders were the predominant diagnostic category. Median follow-up time was 21 days. The evidence was rated moderate to very low. In most trials, ketamine was administered intravenously or as adjuvant to electro-convulsant therapy (ECT). Only 2 trials of intranasal esketamine were identified. The effect of ketamine on depression was confirmed (SMD: -0.61 [95% CI: -1.06; -0.16]). Furthermore, by pooling results of 6 RCTs, ketamine may be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.42 [95% CI: -0.84; 0.003]), particularly when administered not within ECT (5 trials; SMD: -0.58 [95% CI: -1.07; -0.09]). However, there was moderate heterogeneity of results. Patients treated with ketamine also had an improvement in social functioning (SMD: -0.31 [95% CI: -0.52; -0.10]), although the estimate was based only on 2 studies. No difference to comparators was found with respect to cognition and quality of life. Conclusion Alongside the antidepressant effect, ketamine may also improve anxiety and social functioning in adults with affective disorders.

AB  - Purpose This systematic review aimed to synthesise all quantitative literature on the association between social class and the effectiveness of interventions for mental health disorders. Methods Systematic literature searches (inception-March 2021) were conducted across 7 databases, and all quantitative studies meeting inclusion criteria, examining the impact of social class on access to treatment, or intervention effectiveness, or the impact of treatment on social mobility, were synthesised narratively. Results Evidence suggests that lower social class may be associated with reduced access to primary and secondary mental health care and increased likelihood of access via crisis services, and patients of lower social class may not benefit from all mental health interventions, with reduced effectiveness. While limited, there was some indication that psychosocial interventions could encourage increased employment rates. Conclusion Social class is associated with the effectiveness of psychological interventions, and should be considered when designing new interventions to prevent barriers to access and improve effectiveness.

AB  - Epidemiological studies report high levels of anxiety and depression amongst adolescents. These psychiatric conditions and complex interplays of biological, social and environmental factors are important risk factors for suicidal behaviours and suicide, which show a peak in late adolescence and early adulthood. Although deaths by suicide have fallen globally in recent years, suicide deaths are increasing in some countries, such as the US. Suicide prevention is a challenging global public health problem. Currently, there aren't any validated clinical biomarkers for suicidal diagnosis, and traditional methods exhibit limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) is budding in many fields, including in the diagnosis of medical conditions. This review paper summarizes recent studies (past 8 years) that employed AI tools for the automated detection of depression and/or anxiety disorder and discusses the limitations and effects of some modalities. The studies assert that AI tools produce promising results and could overcome the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. Although using AI tools for suicidal ideation exhibits limitations, these are outweighed by the advantages. Thus, this review article also proposes extracting a fusion of features such as facial images, speech signals, and visual and clinical history features from deep models for the automated detection of depression and/or anxiety disorder in individuals, for future work. This may pave the way for the identification of individuals with suicidal thoughts.

AB  - Objective To conduct a scoping review of published literature examining the influence of health storylines from fictional television programs on viewers. Data Source We performed literature searches in Medline, PsycINFO, and Mass Media Complete in October 2021, and examined bibliographies of included articles and conducted forward searching using Web of Science with included articles. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Selected studies were required to be original research published in English, involve exposure to fictional television programming by individuals not in the medical field, and assess associations between exposure and health-related outcomes. Data Extraction Article screening and data abstraction were performed by two independent researchers using DistillerSR (Cohen's kappa range: .73-1.00). Data Synthesis We analyzed and qualitatively described the data using methods of scoping reviews described by PRISMA-ScR. Results Of 5,537 unique records identified, 165 met inclusion criteria. The most frequently studied program was ER (n = 22, 13.3%). Most studies had adult participants (n = 116, 70.3%) and used quantitative methods (n = 136, 82.4%). The most frequently examined health topics were sexual behavior (n = 28, 17.0%) and mental health (n = 28, 17.0%). Exposure had a positive influence on viewers' health-related outcomes in 28.5% (n = 47) of studies. Conclusion Health storylines on fictional television influence viewers. Future research could address gaps identified in this review to further elucidate the influence of this programming on health promotion and disease prevention.

AB  - The semi-sessile, ectothermic, amphibious mollusc Pila globosa receives less attention for studying its environmental aspects. Its ecological role, ecotoxic and physiological responses to environmental factors including pollution and during dormant periods such as hibernation and estivation to understand key information about many cellular metabolic events need to be revealed. We reviewed the ecotoxic and physiological responses of P. globosa to various abiotic and biotic stressors such as heavy metals, organophosphorous, carbamate and butachlor in relation its adaptation to energy expenditure, fat metabolism in the dormant period, desiccation, etc. The responses analysed in terms of oxidative stress, respiratory and antioxidant enzymes, carbohydrate metabolism and activities of neurotransmitter enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase to better understand the connection between environmental factors and metabolic events in P. globosa. Articles published in the English language from 1952 to July of 2022 in PubMed, Google search engine and AGRICOLA that describes any of the above-mentioned search terms in P. globosa were included in the review article. Articles not containing any of the above terms were excluded. The 41 results were found in PubMed and 10 results from AGRICOLA and about 80 filtered articles from Google, totaling about 80 articles published until July 2022 were included in this review. The varied enzymatic activities observed in this organism under the exposure to various chemicals imply their possible use as biomarkers of eco-toxicological studies in freshwater and grassland ecosystems, for example, alleviated body carbohydrate and protein contents are up to 32% and 37% during aestivation and hibernation, respectively. Similarly, activities of enzymes such as adenosine monophosphate deaminase, adenosine deaminase, succinic dehydrogenase, cytochrome-c-oxidase, and glutamate dehydrogenase are downregulated by 75.5%, 62.6%, 54%, 59%, and 62%, respectively, during above inactive periods. Acetylcholinesterase enzyme is found to be the most susceptible enzyme to be downregulated by 225%, 130%, 64%, 198%, 96.08% in this snail under exposure to environmental pollutants such as phorate (30 mg/L), formothion (37.5 mg/L), trichlorfon (2.5 mg/L), aldicarb (120 mg/L) and butachlor (100 mu moles), respectively. In conclusion, P. globosa can serve as a reliable ectothermic model for comparative ecotoxicological studies in grassland and freshwater environmental monitoring.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis occurs mainly in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Evidence supports the critical role of adult neurogenesis in various conditions, including cognitive dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several factors can alter adult neurogenesis, including genetic, epigenetic, age, physical activity, diet, sleep status, sex hormones, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders, exerting either pro-neurogenic or anti-neurogenic effects. Compelling evidence suggests that any insult or injury to the CNS, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), infectious diseases, or neurodegenerative disorders, can provoke an inflammatory response in the CNS. This inflammation could either promote or inhibit neurogenesis, depending on various factors, such as chronicity and severity of the inflammation and underlying neurological disorders. Notably, neuroinflammation, driven by different immune components such as activated glia, cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, can regulate every step of adult neurogenesis, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival of newborn neurons, maturation, synaptogenesis, and neuritogenesis. Therefore, this review aims to present recent findings regarding the effects of various components of the immune system on adult neurogenesis and to provide a better understanding of the role of neuroinflammation and neurogenesis in the context of neurological disorders, including AD, PD, ischemic stroke (IS), seizure/epilepsy, TBI, sleep deprivation, cognitive impairment, and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. For each disorder, some of the most recent therapeutic candidates, such as curcumin, ginseng, astragaloside, boswellic acids, andrographolide, caffeine, royal jelly, estrogen, metformin, and minocycline, have been discussed based on the available preclinical and clinical evidence.

AB  - Nine hundred and seventy million individuals across the globe are estimated to carry the burden of a mental disorder. Limited progress has been achieved in alleviating this burden over decades of effort, compared to progress achieved for many other medical disorders. Progress on outcome improvement for all medical disorders, including mental disorders, requires research capable of discovering causality at sufficient scale and speed, and a diagnostic nosology capable of encoding the causal knowledge that is discovered. Accordingly, the field's guiding paradigm limits progress by maintaining: (a) a diagnostic nosology (DSM-5) with a profound lack of causality; (b) a misalignment between mental health etiologic research and nosology; (c) an over-reliance on clinical trials beyond their capabilities; and (d) a limited adoption of newer methods capable of discovering the complex etiology of mental disorders. We detail feasible directions forward, to achieve greater levels of progress on improving outcomes for mental disorders, by: (a) the discovery of knowledge on the complex etiology of mental disorders with application of Causal Data Science methods; and (b) the encoding of the etiological knowledge that is discovered within a causal diagnostic system for mental disorders.

AB  - BackgroundThe balance between neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of kynurenine pathway (KP) components has been recently proposed as a key element in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) and related mood episodes. This comprehensive overview explored the link of KP with symptom severity and other clinical features of BD.MethodsWe searched Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo electronic databases for studies assessing the association of peripheral and/or central concentrations of KP metabolites with putative clinical features, including symptom severity and other clinical domains in BD.ResultsWe included the findings of 13 observational studies investigating the possible variations of KP metabolites according to symptom severity, psychotic features, suicidal behaviors, and sleep disturbances in BD. Studies testing the relationship between KP metabolites and depression severity generated mixed and inconsistent findings. No statistically significant correlations with manic symptoms were found. Moreover, heterogeneous variations of the KP across different clinical domains were shown. Few available studies found (a) higher levels of cerebrospinal fluid kynurenic acid and lower of plasma quinolinic acid in BD with psychotic features, (b) lower central and peripheral picolinic acid levels in BD with suicide attempts, and (c) no significant correlations between KP metabolites and BD-related sleep disturbances.ConclusionsAn imbalance of KP metabolism toward the neurotoxic branches is likely to occur in people with BD, though evidence on variations according to specific clinical features of BD is less clear. Additional research is needed to clarify the role of KP in the etiopathogenesis of BD and related clinical features.

AB  - Purpose: This meta-analysis was to critically evaluate the effects of Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) on the symptoms of anxiety and depression in cancer patients.Methods: Eight Chinese and English databases (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO) were systematically searched from the inception of databases to May 2022 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). According to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias and extract data from included studies. All analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.4.Results: Thirteen qualified studies were included in the meta-analysis, twelve of which reported the effect of ICBT on anxiety in 2079 cancer patients; thirteen of the studies reported the effect of ICBT on depression in 2179 patients. The meta-analysis indicated that ICBT was effective in improving anxiety [SMD = -0.37, 95%CI (-0.62, -0.12), P < 0.01, I2 = 86%] and depression [SMD = -0.27, 95%CI (-0.44, -0.09), P < 0.01, I2 = 72%] symptoms in cancer patients, especially those undergoing anti-cancer treatment. Therapist-guided ICBT was more effective than self-directed ICBT. ICBT lasting for <= 12 weeks could relieve anxiety and depressive symptoms of cancer patients. ICBT with number of modules >= 5 had a small effect on anxiety and depression relief while ICBT with number of modules <5 was found to be ineffective.Conclusions: ICBT lasting for <= 12 weeks, especially therapist-directed, helps relieve the anxiety and depressive symptoms of cancer patients. The ideal number of modules for ICBT and its long-term efficacy need to be validated by more studies of higher-quality.

AB  - Patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) who exercise report better quality of sleep, but there is a need for more conclusive evidence. This systematic review sought to gather data only from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at how physical activity affects the quality of sleep in patients with MDD. Three e-databases (Web of Sciences, Scopus, and PubMed) were searched for relevant RCTs in January 2021. Ten RCTs (768 participants) with a total of 24 articles were deemed eligible, including RCTs with clinically diagnosed MDD. Across the studies, physical activity was found to improve sleep quality among people with MDD. However, the limitations of this systematic review include the few available trials, the small number of samples with clinically diagnosed MDD patients, and the wide range of exercise modalities. The physical activity enhanced sleep quality in people with MDD, especially in RCTs with 150 min per week moderate intensity interventions. Although more RCTs are required to examine the effects of physical activity among people with MDD, these findings are clinically useful.

AB  - Mental health problems in school-aged youth are a risk factor for poor outcomes in adulthood. Although these poor outcomes are well established, most youth with mental health problems continue to experience barriers to receiving appropriate services. Tier 2 interventions are sometimes provided to students who are at risk of developing a mental illness. The aim of this scoping review was to synthesize the peer-reviewed research regarding Tier 2 mental health interventions in primary and secondary school settings. A systematic search of published research was conducted in CINAHL, Education Research Complete, Embase, ERIC, Medline, PsycINFO and SocINDEX electronic databases. This scoping review followed a two-level screening process where articles were screened in duplicate by two blinded reviewers. A total of 288 articles were included in this scoping review. Tier 2 mental health interventions in schools have significantly increased since 1965, increasing to about 24 research publications per year. Interventions mainly targeted youth with behavioural problems (51.04%), social difficulties (21.88%), emotional problems (20.49%), and substance abuse (18.06%). Tier 2 interventions were administered by teachers (58.33%) and most often delivered in a group setting (42.01%). This scoping review demonstrated that Tier 2 mental health interventions in schools are gaining prominence in the literature and primarily target children with externalizing behavioural problems. The flexibility of Tier 2 interventions allows them to be implemented in a variety of settings and treat several symptoms making them ideal for broad-based mental health support in schools.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic review was to locate and synthesise existing peer-reviewed quantitative and qualitative evidence regarding the relationship between social connection and suicide among newcomers, immigrants, and asylum seekers. Systematic searches were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines using Web of Science and Pubmed. Search terms included those related to (1) social isolation and loneliness, (2) suicide and suicidal ideation, and (3) newcomer, immigrant, and asylum-seeking populations. Inclusion was limited to studies that were published in English and conducted between January 2001 and July 2021 in core anglosphere countries (Canada, United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland). All potentially eligible articles were screened at two stages: First, we reviewed title and abstracts to omit obviously irrelevant studies and second, we reviewed the full text of each candidate article. Our initial search yielded 136 results. A total of 108 unique results were included for screening; 12 of which were eligible for inclusion in this review. Studies were categorized into 2 themes based on the methodologies of the articles found: qualitative perspectives of immigrants and newcomers; quantitative assessment of the risk of suicide burden and impact of social support and engagement on health and wellbeing of newcomers. Both types of studies highlight a social (dis)connection as an important determinant of mental health and suicide risk among immigrant populations in core anglo-sphere countries, highlighting the continued importance of community programs and funding to support inclusion and community-development among newcomer, immigrant, and asylum-seeking populations.

AB  - Employee alcohol and other drug use can negatively impact the workplace, resulting in absenteeism, reduced productivity, high turnover, and worksite safety issues. As the workplace can influence employee substance use through environmental and cultural factors, it also presents a key opportunity to deliver interventions, particularly to employees who may not otherwise seek help. This is a systematic review of workplace-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of problematic substance use. Five databases were searched for efficacy, effectiveness and/or cost-effectiveness studies and reviews published since 2010 that measured use of psychoactive substances (i.e., alcohol, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, and stimulants) as a primary or secondary outcome, in employees aged over 18. Thirty-nine articles were identified, 28 describing primary research and 11 reviews, most of which focused solely on alcohol use. Heterogeneity between studies with respect to intervention and evaluation design limited the degree to which findings could be synthesized, however, there is some promising evidence for workplace-based universal health promotion interventions, targeted brief interventions, and universal substance use screening. The few studies that examined implementation in the workplace revealed specific barriers including lack of engagement with e-health interventions, heavy use and reluctance to seek help amongst male employees, and confidentiality concerns. Tailoring interventions to each workplace, and ease of implementation and employee engagement emerged as facilitators. Further high-quality research is needed to examine the effectiveness of workplace substance use testing, Employee Assistance Programs, and strategies targeting the use of substances other than alcohol in the workplace.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) is a major monoamine neurotransmitter in the brain and has essential roles in higher functions of the brain. Malfunctions of dopaminergic signaling have been implicated in various mental disorders such as addiction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), and schizophrenia. The pathogenesis of PD and schizophrenia involves the interplay of mitochondrial defect and DA metabolism abnormalities. This article focuses on this issue in schizophrenia. It started with the introduction of metabolism, behavioral action, and physiology of DA, followed by reviewing evidence for malfunctions of dopaminergic signaling in patients with schizophrenia. Then it provided an overview of multiple facets of mitochondrial physiology before summarizing mitochondrial defects reported in clinical studies with schizophrenia patients. Finally, it discussed the interplay between DA metabolism abnormalities and mitochondrial defects and outlined some clinical studies showing effects of combination therapy of antipsychotics and antioxidants in treating patients with schizophrenia. The update and integration of these lines of information may advance our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, phenomenology, and treatment of schizophrenia.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the efficacy of psychotherapy on symptoms of functional dyspepsia, anxiety, depression and quality of life. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Emcare, Ovid Nursing, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Informit Health Collection and ClinicalTrials.gov on 2 July 2021. Randomised controlled trials that compared psychotherapy to non-psychotherapy interventions in adults with functional dyspepsia were included. Meta-analyses were conducted (using Hedges's g) under random effects models. Overall, 1,575 records were identified after duplicates were removed, with nine randomised controlled trials (n = 786) included. Preliminary meta-analyses showed that psychotherapy outperformed control conditions at post-test and follow-up on functional dyspepsia symptom severity and anxiety symptoms, but no differences emerged for depressive symptoms. The qualitative synthesis showed psychotherapy's promise in improving quality of life in functional dyspepsia. Psychotherapy might have a small to moderate effect on functional dyspepsia symptoms and anxiety at short- and long-term. However, conclusions are limited by the small number of trials with a high risk of bias.

AB  - Background: Physical activity (PA) is considered a favorable preventive intervention for postpartum depression (PPD), but evidence defining a corresponding dose-response relationship is lacking. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the protective effects of PA on PPD and define a potential dose-response relationship between them. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from 1968 to May 2022. Only randomized control trials (RCTs) and prospective studies were considered, and the PICOS tool was used to identify eligible articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Effect-size estimates were unified as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We calculated the ORs and their 95% CI for studies that did not report them using the Practical Meta-Analysis Effect Size Calculator. Results: A total of 23 studies were eligible, including 14 RCTs and 9 prospective cohort studies. The overall analysis showed a statistically significant positive association between PA and PPD prevention (adjusted OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.61-0.87; P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated that studies conducted in Europe demonstrated a significant correlation between PA and reduced PPD risk (adjusted OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.95, P = 0.004). Concerning PA type, sports activity was associated with relieving PPD symptoms (adjusted OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.00, P < 0.001), while work (adjusted OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.37-2.97, P = 0.065) and household activities (adjusted OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.89-1.52, P = 0.986) contributed to a greater risk of PPD. Our dose-response analysis revealed a reverse J-shaped trend between ascending PA duration and PPD incidence. Conclusion: This meta-analysis identified PA as a potential intervention to reduce the risk of PPD. The dose-response analysis revealed that at least 90 min of PA per week could efficiently decrease the risk of PPD.

AB  - Maternal depression negatively impacts child mental health and is a well-known risk factor for child psychopathology. However, maternal depression treatment and child mental health treatment are rarely integrated. The purpose of this review was to assess the impact of maternal depression on child mental health treatment, including (1) how treatment of maternal depression affects child mental health outcomes, (2) the impact of maternal depression on children receiving mental health care, and (3) emerging models that address maternal depression in primary-care pediatrics and child mental health settings. A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed and PsycInfo. Initial search yielded 224 records, and after exclusion, 29 papers were reviewed. Effective treatment of maternal depression is associated with a significant decrease in child psychiatric symptoms. Maternal depression negatively affects child mental health treatment in that there is a high rate of untreated mental illness among mothers of psychiatrically ill children, and maternal depression impedes effective child mental health treatment. Current models to address maternal depression in child settings include screening in pediatric primary care, psychotherapy for depressed mothers of psychiatrically ill children, and emerging models that integrate maternal and child mental health treatment. Effective treatment of maternal depression significantly improves child mental health and should be better integrated into child treatment. Opportunities to improve care include more robust screening for parental mental illness, supports to refer parents to psychiatric care, and on-site services for parents. Such interventions hold promise, but require significant support from a multidisciplinary team.

AB  - As the world population ages, the burden of age-related health problems grows, creating a greater demand for new novel interventions for healthy aging. Advancing aging is related to a loss of beneficial mutualistic microbes in the gut microbiota caused by extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as diet, sedentary lifestyle, sleep deprivation, circadian rhythms, and oxidative stress, which emerge as essential elements in controlling and prolonging life expectancy of healthy aging. This condition is known as gut dysbiosis, and it affects normal brain function via the brain-gut microbiota (BGM) axis, which is a bidirectional link between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the central nervous system (CNS) that leads to the emergence of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we reviewed the role of the gut microbiome in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as provided a comprehensive review of recent findings from preclinical and clinical studies to present an up-to-date overview of recent advances in developing strategies to modulate the intestinal microbiome by probiotic administration, dietary intervention, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and physical activity to address the aging process and prevent neurodegenerative diseases. The findings of this review will provide researchers in the fields of aging and the gut microbiome design innovative studies that leverage results from preclinical and clinical studies to better understand the nuances of aging, gut microbiome, and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Objective: Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of ADHD, but associations between risk factors and ADHD symptom severity in affected children remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes evidence on the association between familial factors and symptom severity in children with ADHD (PROSPERO CRD42020076440). Method: PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for eligible studies. Results: Forty-three studies (N = 11,123 participants) were meta-analyzed. Five additional studies (N = 2,643 participants) were considered in the supplemental review. Parenting stress (r = .25), negative parenting practices (r = .19), broken parental partnership (r = .19), critical life events (r = .17), parental psychopathologies (r = .14-.16), socioeconomic status (r = -.10), and single-parent family (r = .10) were significantly associated with ADHD symptom severity. Conclusion: These results suggest that psychosocial familial factors show small but significant associations with symptom severity in children with ADHD. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Objective To appraise and synthesize evidence on the effects of health coaching as the primary intervention on cardiometabolic health among middle-aged adults. Data Source Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, and the Cochrane library) were searched from inception until July 2021. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials published in English, reporting health coaching aimed to promote behavioral changes for improving cardiometabolic health among middle-aged adults were included. Studies on health coaching as secondary intervention were excluded. Data Extraction Two reviewers selected the articles, appraised the study quality, and extracted data independently. All kinds of outcomes related to cardiometabolic health, including health behaviors, psychological and physiological outcomes, were included. Data Synthesis Meta-analysis was performed if three or more studies reported the same outcomes. Narrative synthesis was performed if pooling of data for meta-analysis was not feasible. Results Eight studies were reviewed. Most studies involved substantial risk of bias. The majority of the participants were women (99.1%). Meta-analysis showed a small but significant effect of health coaching on increasing physical activity (SMD = .34, 95% CI = .08-.60, p = .01, I-2 = 0%); however, its effect on perceived barriers to physical activity and depressive symptoms was nonsignificant. Narrative synthesis yielded inconsistent results on diet, smoking, anxiety, goal achievement and self-efficacy for behavioral change, physiological outcomes, and metabolic syndrome severity, and nonsignificant effects on alcohol consumption, sleep quality, perceived benefits of physical activities, and cardiovascular symptoms. Conclusions Health coaching has significant effects on increasing physical activity among middle-aged adults; however, its effects on health behaviors and risk factors related to cardiometabolic health are inconclusive. Further efforts are warranted to examine how health coaching can improve cardiometabolic health among middle-aged adults.

AB  - Positive mental health and mental health literacy are two main concepts to ensure an individual and social state of mental health and well-being. A scoping review of the scientific literature published in the field of health sciences was conducted to identify the relationship between mental health literacy and the positive mental health of family caregivers. A research expression was used to search for articles in health databases, respecting the main topics of the Participants/Concept/Context (PCC) framework. A total of eight articles were included from the 2830 initially identified using the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) process. It was noticeable that none of the studies related positive mental health and mental health literacy of caregivers. Nevertheless, it was possible to identify predictors of mental health and self-efficacy, such as burden and a lack of information about and support in the process of care. Caregivers' quality of life, self-esteem and confidence are also important positive mental health predictors that are closely related to health literacy. The knowledge of these factors can contribute to the reduction in negative determinants of mental health of caregivers and the resolution of strategies to meet caregivers' needs.

AB  - The associations between Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence and depression levels have been synthesized from observational studies. However, a systematic review with meta-analysis including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this relationship in adults with depressive disorders remains lacking. This protocol was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis for Protocols statement. MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases will be systematically searched to identify studies published from database inception up to 30 September 2022. The inclusion criteria will comprise RCTs reporting pre-post changes in depression status (symptoms or remission) after a MD intervention compared to a control condition in adults over 18 years with depressive disorders. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using the DerSimonian random-effects model. This study protocol determines the methodological approach for the systematic review and meta-analysis that will summarize the available evidence on the efficacy of MD interventions on depressive symptoms in adults with depressive disorders. The findings from this review may have implications for public mental health programs. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentation, and infographics. No ethical approval will be required since only published data will be used. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022341895.

AB  - Background: Behavioral and emotional dyscontrol commonly occur following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Neuroimaging and electrophysiological correlates of dyscontrol have not been systematically summarized in the literature to date. Objective: To complete a system-atic review of the literature examining neuroimaging and electrophysiological findings related to behavioral and emotional dyscontrol due to TBI. Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-An-alyses-compliant literature search was conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Scopus databases prior to May 2019. The database query yielded 4392 unique articles. These articles were narrowed based on specific inclusion criteria (e.g., clear TBI definition, statistical analysis of the relationship between neuroimaging and dyscontrol). Results: A final cohort of 24 articles resulted, comprising findings from 1552 patients with TBI. Studies included civilian (n = 12), military (n = 10), and sport (n = 2) samples with significant variation in the severity of TBI incorporated. Global and region-based structural imaging was more frequently used to study dyscontrol than functional im-aging or diffusion tensor imaging. The prefrontal cortex was the most common neuroanatomical region associated with behavioral and emotional dyscontrol, followed by other frontal and temporal lobe findings. Conclusions: Frontal and temporal lesions are most strongly impli-cated in the development of postinjury dyscontrol symp-toms although they are also the most frequently investigated regions of the brain for these symptom categories. Future studies can make valuable contribu-tions to the field by (1) emphasizing consistent defini-tions of behavioral and emotional dyscontrol, (2) assessing premorbid dyscontrol symptoms in subjects, (3) utilizing functional or structural connectivity-based imaging techniques, or (4) restricting analyses to more focused brain regions.

Despite the increased risk, some members of the familial high-risk population remain healthy, that is, resilient. Defining the structural and functional brain alterations associated with vulnerability or resilience could lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD. This study aimed to review the current literature and discuss the association between brain alterations and vulnerability or resilience to MDD in people with familial risk.MethodsA literature search on MRI studies investigating structural and functional alterations in populations at familial risk for MDD was performed using the PubMed and SCOPUS databases. The search was conducted through June 13, 2022.ResultsWe reviewed and summarized the data of 72 articles (25 structural MRI, 35 functional MRI, 10 resting-state fMRI, one structural/functional MRI combined, and one structural/functional/resting-state fMRI combined). These findings suggested that resilience in high-risk individuals is related to the amygdala structure, frontal lobe activity, and functional connectivity between the amygdala and multiple frontal regions.ConclusionResilient and vulnerable individuals exhibit structural and functional differences in multiple frontal and limbic regions. However, further systematic longitudinal research incorporating environmental factors is required to validate the current findings.

AB  - Introduction: Several studies have demonstrated that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) commonly show reductions in heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Thus, interventions for the improvement of low HRV may be advantageous in treating MDD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the improvement effects of current clinical treatments on low HRV in patients with MDD.Methods: Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CNKI databases were searched for relevant literature. Interventional studies of patients with confirmed MDD, which included baseline and post-intervention data and at least one HRV parameter as an outcome indicator, were included for meta-analysis.Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the review. Several studies affirmed the role of psychotherapy in improving low HRV in patients with MDD showing a significant increase in high-frequency and low-frequency power after psychotherapy in the meta-analysis. However, both pharmacotherapy studies and physiotherapy studies included in the meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity.Limitations: The main limitation of this study was the relatively small samples for the meta-analysis, and more high-quality randomized controlled trials in this field are wanted.Conclusions: Psychotherapy was effective for improving low HRV in patients with MDD. However, the effect of pharmacotherapy or physical therapy on low HRV in MDD remains unclear. Regarding research methods, it is necessary to formulate and standardize operational guidelines for future HRV measurements.

AB  - Executive function is among the most affected cognitive dimensions in depression. Physical exercise may improve executive function (e.g., working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility), although this is without consensus on adults with depression. Through this systematic review, we aim to elucidate the effects of physical exercise programs on executive functions in adults with depression. The literature search was performed in four relevant electronic databases, combining keywords and medical subject headings, from inception until September 2022. Controlled interventions, involving adults with depression, and reporting working memory, inhibition, and/or cognitive flexibility pre-post-intervention data, were considered includable. Results from meta-analyses included effect size (ES, i.e., Hedges' g) values reported with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs), with p set at <= 0.05. Seven studies were included, including 202 men and 457 women (age: 21.0-51.2 years; mild-moderate depression). For working memory, a small favoring effect was observed in the experimental groups compared with controls (ES = 0.33, 95%CI = 0.04-0.61; p = 0.026; I-2 = 64.9%). For inhibition, physical exercise had a small favoring non-significant effect compared with controls (ES = 0.28, 95%CI = -0.17-0.74; p = 0.222; I-2 = 72.4%). Compared with the control group, physical exercise had a trivial effect on cognitive flexibility (ES = 0.09, 95%CI = -0.21-0.39; p = 0.554; I-2 = 68.4%). In conclusion, physical exercise interventions may improve working memory behavioral measures in adults with mild-to-moderate depression when compared with active and passive control conditions. However, the reduced number of available high-quality studies precludes more lucid conclusions.

AB  - (1) Background: Approximately one-third of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) do not experience sustained remission with current treatments. Presently, astrocytes, i.e., glial cells that act as key regulators of neuroinflammation, have been a target for therapeutic development. Research regarding their role in the neuropathology of BD is limited. We conducted a scoping review on evidence linking astrocytes to the pathology of BD. (2) Methods: The search was conducted in MEDLINE for studies published from inception to August 2022. Studies of interest were data-extracted and reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols. (3) Results: Overall, 650 publications were identified, of which 122 full texts were evaluated and 12 included. Four were in vitro, seven were ex vivo, and one study was both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro investigations focused on plasma levels of neuroinflammatory biomarkers S100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Ex vivo investigations were post-mortem brain studies assessing astrocytes in regions of interest (i.e., anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) using phosphorylated GFAP and ASCT-1. The in vivo and in vitro study evaluated morphological and chemical variations of YKL-40 between cohorts. (4) Conclusions: Reports indicate an association between astrocyte dysfunction and BD although larger studies are required to validate this association.

AB  - Objective: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) resemble epileptic seizures but are not due to underlying epileptic activity and in some cases coexist alongside epilepsy. We described the clinical characteristics of pa-tients with PNES as reported in the literature from the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated differences between patients with a diagnosis made immediately before the pandemic (pPNES) and those newly diagnosed during it (nPNES).Methods: A systematic search with individual patient analysis of PNES cases published since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak was performed. Differences between pPNES and nPNES were analyzed using Chi-square or Fisher exact test.Results: Eleven articles were included, with 133 patients (106 pPNES and 27 nPNES). In the pPNES group, PNES frequency increased during the pandemic in 20/106 patients, whereas in 78/106, the frequency remained stable or decreased. nPNES was associated with higher risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and epilepsy diagnosis, whereas psychiatric comorbidities were less frequent.Conclusions: During the pandemic, most patients with pPNES remained stable or improved, whereas nPNES was associated with a lower burden of psychiatric comorbidities. These intriguing findings suggest that, at least in some patients, the COVID-19 pandemic may not necessarily lead to worsening in the frequency of PNES and quality of life.

AB  - Background: Schizoaffective psychosis is a severe and chronic psychiatric disorder defined by the presence of mood symptoms, like mania and/or depression and schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and/or delusions. Aims: We aim to find out whether there is a correlation between schizoaffective psychosis and being homeless. Method: To do so, a literature search was carried out in the PubMed platform in April 2022, using the keywords 'schizoaffective' and 'homeless'. Results: In this review, 28 articles from this search were included. Intrinsic characteristics, rates of psychiatric readmission, prediction of homelessness, medication noncompliance, and substance use were explored, as they were the main themes of the results. Conclusions: The homeless population suffers from great diagnostic variability and the diagnosis schizoaffective psychosis is still evolving contributing to such diagnostic and treatment difficulties. Their frequent visits to the healthcare services, especially emergency room leads to consequent interaction with multiple healthcare professionals, resulting in a myriad of diagnoses, with clinical remission and therapeutic goals not being attained. More studies are necessary for a better evaluation of this super difficult population.

AB  - Background: There is a growing interest in understanding the impact of video games in the clinical field, given that their excessive use could be associated with health issues. Particularly, gaming disorder (GD) is considered as an addictive behavioral disorder. Clinicians widely recognize the comorbidity of gaming and psychotic disorders (PDs). Furthermore, association between addictive (i.e., substance use disorders) and PDs are well recognized by clinicians. It seems of high interest to explore GD among people with PDs. To this day, little is known about the consequences of GD in vulnerable populations. Objectives: The aim of this scoping review was to summarize the available research on the comorbidity between GD and PD and to identify the knowledge gaps in this field. Methods: We used Levac's six-stage methodology for scoping review. Two-hundred and forty-two articles from seven databases were identified. Eight articles respected our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: No available study has assessed the prevalence or incidence of GD among patients with PDs. The cases reported highlight the possibility that excessive video gameplay or abrupt gaming disruption could trigger psychosis in some patients. Conclusion: The results highlight a significant lack of knowledge concerning PDs associated with GD as only a few reported cases and one empirical study exposed the potential association between those conditions.

AB  - This study examined the association between resilience and psychological distress in healthcare workers, the general population, and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Science Direct, and Nursing and Allied Health databases. Included articles examined healthcare workers (e.g., physicians and nurses), the general population, and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies of exposure to other infectious diseases related to epidemics or pandemics (e.g., SARS and MERS) were excluded. This study was performed following the Cooper matrix review method and PRISMA guidelines, followed by a meta-analysis of study results using R version 4.1.2. A random effect model was used for the pooled analysis. This study was registered with PROSPERO (registration No. CRD42021261429). Based on the meta-analysis, we found a moderate negative relationship between overall resilience and psychological distress (r = -0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.45 to -0.38, p < 0.001). For the subgroup analysis, a moderately significant negative relationship between overall resilience and psychological distress was found among healthcare workers (r = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.44 to -0.33, p < 0.001), which was weaker than in the general population (r = -0.45, 95% CI: -0.50 to -0.39, p < 0.001) and in patients (r = -0.43; 95% CI: -0.52 to -0.33; p < 0.001). This association was robust, although the heterogeneity among individual effect sizes was substantial (I-2 = 94%, 99%, and 74%, respectively). This study revealed a moderate negative relationship between resilience and psychological distress in healthcare workers, the general population, and patients. For all these populations, interventions and resources are needed to improve individuals' resilience and ability to cope with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future disease outbreaks.

AB  - Background Similar to the side effects of cancer treatment, financial toxicity (FT) can affect the quality of life of patients, which has attracted increasing attention in the field of oncology. Despite the fact that the estimated prevalence and risk factors of FT are widely reported, these results have not been synthesized. Objectives This review is aimed to systematically assess the prevalence and risk factors of self-reported FT. Design Systematic review and meta-analyses. Data Sources A computer search of English literature was conducted using databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, and reference lists of the qualified articles were also included between January 2010 and September 2021. Observational studies that reported the prevalence or risk factors of FT using subjective measures were included. Methods The systematic review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The risk of bias was assessed by the NIH observational cohort and cross-sectional study quality assessment tool. The data were extracted by two reviewers and listed in a descriptive table for meta-analyses. Results In the 22 studies available for meta-analyses of pooled prevalence of FT, the result was estimated to be 45% (95% CI: 38% to 53%, I-2 = 97.3%, P < 0.001) based on a random-effects model. The pooled analysis identified 9 potential risk factors of FT (7 in beta and 8 in OR): low income (OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.72 to 3.24, I-2 = 3.1%, P < 0.001), greater annual OOP (beta = -4.26, 95% CI: -6.95 to -1.57, I-2 = 0%, P = 0.002), younger age (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.56 to 2.54, I-2 = 0%, P < 0.001), no private insurance (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.37, I-2 = 0%, P < 0.001), unmarried (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.25, I-2 = 53,3%, P < 0.001), nonwhite (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.33 to 1.85, I-2 = 0%, P < 0.001), advanced cancer (beta = -4.74, 95% CI: -6.90 to -2.57, I-2 = 0%, P < 0.001), unemployed (beta = -2.90, 95% CI: -5.71 to -0.63, I-2 = 75,7%, P < 0.001), more recent diagnosis (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.57, I-2 = 0%, P < 0.001). Conclusion This systematic review reported a pooled prevalence of self-reported FT of 45%. Low income, greater annual OOP (Out of pocket), younger age, unmarried, unemployed, nonwhite, no private insurance, advanced cancer, and more recent diagnosis constituted risk factors for self-reported FT. The research on risk factors for FT can provide a theoretical basis for medical staff to evaluate and intervene in the FT among cancer survivors.

AB  - Background Depression is among the common mental health problems in late-life and an important public health problem. Studies from both middle- and high-income countries have shown that depression is more common among older people than in adolescents. Many older people with depression are overlooked, and fewer efforts are made to mitigate their suffering. Despite depression being a major public health problem among older adults, its overall magnitude, and its main predictors were not determined for the development of appropriate measures. Hence, the objective of this study was, therefore, to estimate the overall prevalence of depression and identify its predictors among older adults in Ethiopia. Methods Available articles were searched by means of different databases using the PRISMA guideline. The quality of the included studies was assessed using a JBI quality appraisal tool. STATA version 14.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA) statistical software was used to analyze the eligible studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Cochran's Q and the I-2 test were used to assess heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias was evaluated by using Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots. Result In this meta-analysis, we included 11 articles that assessed 6521 older adults. The overall prevalence of depression among older adults in Ethiopia was 41.85 (33.52, 50.18). The finding was higher in the Oromia region with a prevalence of 48.07% (95% CI: 35.62, 60.51). The finding also demonstrated that being female (AOR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.17, 2.63), no formal education (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03, 3.19), with chronic diseases (AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.00-6.06), and no social support (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.83) were found to be independent predictors of depression in older Ethiopian adults. Conclusion Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that almost two out of five older adults had depression. Female sex, no formal education, having chronic diseases, and no social support were the independent predictors of depression among older adults in Ethiopia. The study emphasizes that depression among older adults in Ethiopia calls for appropriate screening and interventions to reduce the occurrence and its overwhelming consequences.

AB  - Trauma and toxic stress are growing public health concerns with increasing risks to morbidity and mortality. Trauma informed care is an organizational response that challenges providers to adapt principled based approaches that seek to reduce adverse effects of care and support healing. However, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence on how trauma informed care is implemented in systems. A preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis-compliant scoping review based on Arksey, and O'Malley's five steps model was conducted. Four databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase and PsychINFO were searched for English articles published since 2000. Studies were included if they reported on trauma informed care delivered by services that support adults and there was some reference to implementation or organizational implications. Of 1099 articles retrieved, 22 met the inclusion criteria. Findings suggest that trauma informed care is being implemented in a range of human services, including at the city/state level. While implementation research is still at an early stage in this field, the findings elucidate several challenges when implementing this approach across systems of care. An ecological lens is used to present findings at the macro, mezzo, and micro level, and these are further discussed with reference to practice, policy, and research.

AB  - Background: Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) and alcohol, tobacco, or nicotine use are frequently associated conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stressful situation globally and has worsened mental health conditions and addictions in the population. Our systematic review explores the links between PTSSs and (1) alcohol use and (2) tobacco or nicotine use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 2020 and 16 December 2021. We included studies published in English concerning adults or adolescents. Included articles dealt simultaneously with the COVID-19 pandemic, PTSSs, and alcohol, tobacco, or nicotine use. The reports included were cross-sectional, longitudinal, or cohort studies. We categorized the reports according to the population explored. Our main outcomes are the impacts of PTSSs on (1) alcohol use and (2) tobacco and nicotine use and their relation to COVID-19-related stressors (worries, exposure, lockdown, and infection, either of self or relatives). Results: Of the 503 reports identified, 44 were assessed for eligibility, and 16 were included in our review, encompassing 34,408 participants. The populations explored were the general population, healthcare workers, war veterans, patients with substance use disorders, and other vulnerable populations. Most studies were online surveys (14) with cross-sectional designs (11). Every study explored alcohol use, while only two assessed tobacco use. In most populations explored, a high level of PTSSs was associated with alcohol use increase. COVID-19-related stress was frequently correlated with either high PTSSs or alcohol use. In healthcare workers, PTSSs and alcohol use were not associated, while COVID-19 worries were related to both PTSSs and alcohol use. Discussion: 1. PTSSs and increased alcohol use are frequently associated, while COVID-19 worries might trigger both conditions and worsen their association. Alcohol use increase may represent either an inadequate way of coping with PTSSs or a vulnerability amid the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to PTSSs. As most studies were cross-sectional online surveys, longitudinal prospective studies are needed to ascertain the direction of the associations between these conditions. These studies need to be sufficiently powered and control for potential bias and confounders. 2. Our review highlighted that research about PTSSs and tobacco or nicotine use is scarce.

AB  - Thyroid hormone (TH) augmentation, although commonly used for major depression, is sparingly used for bipolar disorder (BD) after the failure of mood-stabilizing agents. While the exact mechanisms of thyroid hormone action in BD remains unclear, central thyroid hormone deficit has been postulated as a mechanism for rapid cycling. This systematic review-conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines-of eight studies synthesizes the evidence for TH augmentation in BD. A systematic search of the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCT), open-label trials, and observational studies of levothyroxine (LT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) for BD. Open-label studies of high dose LT4 augmentation for bipolar depression and rapid cycling showed improvement in depression outcomes and reduction in recurrence, respectively. However, an RCT of high-dose LT4 did not show benefit in contrast to placebo. An RCT comparing LT4, T3, and placebo showed benefit only in rapid-cycling bipolar women. A meta-analysis could not be completed due to significant differences in study designs, interventions, and outcomes. Our systematic review shows mixed evidence and a lack of high-quality studies. The initial promise of supratherapeutic LT4 augmentation from open-label trials has not been consistently replicated in RCTs. Limited data are available for T3. The studies did not report significant thyrotoxicosis, and TH augmentation were well tolerated. Therefore, TH augmentation, especially with supratherapeutic doses, should be reserved for highly treatment-resistant bipolar depression and rapid-cycling BD.

AB  - Law enforcement officers routinely face unpredictable scenarios that may threaten the public, their colleagues, or themselves. In such situations, officers may be required to use firearms, with shooting accuracy becoming crucial. This literature review aimed to identify, synthesize, and report on research investigating factors that affect marksmanship in law enforcement personnel. A systematic search of seven databases was undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) approach. From an initial 5396 identified studies, 23 met the eligibility criteria. The key findings from these papers were: (1) physical exertion does not appear to decrease shooting performance, especially at close range (<10 m); (2) tactical load carriage does not appear to decrease shooting performance; in fact, it has been reported by officers as improving performance (likely due to training specificity); (3) the physical capability of officers may be of importance, notably grip strength, which the volume of evidence suggests is positively correlated with marksmanship; (4) anxiety imparted through high-stress scenarios negatively impacts shooting performance, but training under stress may counteract this factor, albeit for a short period. Together, these factors appear to have a trainability component where increased specific and realistic training can improve shooting accuracy, time, and precision, especially in high-stress situations.

KW  - COVID-19 pandemic
KW  - CONSEQUENCES
AB  - Occupational burnout is particularly common among nurses due to their work being associated with stress, showing understanding, compassion, and commitment, along with the simultaneous need to maintain the necessary emotional distance. The aim of this review was to assess the occurrence and characterization of burnout among nurses working within neurology, geriatric care, intensive care units and with patients infected with the novel COVID-19 virus. PRISMA guidelines were used to conduct the review. The search for literature was limited to articles meeting the inclusion criteria and published from 2017 to 2022 in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Wiley. A total of 768 articles from this category have been found. Ultimately, after in-depth analysis, 20 articles were included in the study. The group of respondents ranged from 49 to 3100 participants. According to the data, the percentages of nurses suffering from burnout in the presented research ranged from 14.3% to 84.7%, with the highest value of burnout among nurses who worked in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are certain factors among nurses that significantly affect the occurrence of burnout. These include, among others, working time, age, exposure to infection and contact with infected patients, lack of training on COVID-19 prevention, providing care to an increased number of COVID-19 patients per shift, lack of personal protective equipment, lack of support of administration, lack of pay satisfaction, intrinsic motivation and turnover intention.

AB  - The importance of age-friendly environments (AFEs) for older adults has been empirically and theoretically highlighted by the extant literature. However, the strength of the association between environments and older adults' well-being has not been comprehensively quantified. Given the different attributes of the physical and mental dimensions, this meta-analysis aims to synthesise and quantify the association between AFEs and the physical and mental well-being of older adults. Fourteen eligible studies were included in this analysis: among which eight explored the link between AFEs and physical well-being, and eleven investigated AFEs in association with mental well-being. A random-effects model showed a small but significant correlation between AFEs and the mental well-being of older adults (r = 0.160, 95% CI [0.084, 0.224], p < 0.001), and the correlation between AFEs and physical well-being was also significant (r = 0.072, 95% CI [0.026, 0.118], p < 0.01). The number of environmental factors involved in AFEs moderated the association with physical well-being, from which the association was only significant among studies focusing on fewer environmental factors (n < 6). Results of this meta-analysis indicated that AFEs may be more effective in promoting the emotions of older adults, compared to ameliorating their physical functioning. The limitations of current empirical studies and directions for future research in the field of environmental gerontology were also discussed.

AB  - Background Whilst the wellbeing of law enforcement personnel has been widely researched, border security personnel as a discrete group appear to be far less discussed, despite their roles frequently exposing them to potentially traumatic and challenging events such as contact with criminals or witnessing personal tragedies due to trafficking or smuggling. Aims This scoping review aimed to explore existing literature to better understand the mental health of border security personnel and the factors affecting their wellbeing. Methods Four electronic databases and grey literature were systematically searched for studies relevant to the review's aims. Following the extraction of relevant data from each study, thematic analysis was used to synthesize findings. Results Thirteen studies included relevant data and were included in the review, identifying stressors including poor management; fatigue; negative public attitudes; inadequate staffing levels, resources, and training; poor opportunities for promotion; low pay; work overload; dangerous working environments; and work-related moral dilemmas. Conclusions The review found that there has been little academic attention paid to border security personnel as a specific branch of law enforcement. Many of the stressors identified in this review are those also reported by law enforcement generally, although negative attitudes from the public and exposure to moral dilemmas appear to be more relevant for border security staff. Directly addressing work-related stress (e.g. by fostering a supportive organizational culture, addressing mental health stigma, and encouraging help-seeking) may be useful in enhancing the resilience of border security personnel.
   This scoping review revealed that there is little literature focusing specifically on the mental health of border security personnel despite this occupational group facing unique stressors. The review identified various occupational stressors faced by border security staff; moral injury and negative public attitudes appeared to be prevalent and worthy of more research. Fostering supportive organizational cultures may enhance the resilience of border security personnel.

AB  - Good brain health refers to a condition in which a person may fully realize their talents and improve their psychological, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning to cope with life's challenges. Various causes of CNS diseases are now being investigated. Radiation is one of the factors that affects the brain and causes a variety of problems. The emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles via space or a material medium is known as radiation. Particle beams and electromagnetic waves are two types of ionizing radiation that have the potential to ionize atoms in a material (separating them into positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons). Radiation to the CNS can induce delayed puberty, which can lead to hyperprolactinemia, and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis can lead to gonadotropin deficit if the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is involved in the radiation field. Ionizing radiation is the most common kind of radiation. Here, we focus on the different effects of radiation on brain health. In this article, we will look at a variety of CNS diseases and how radiation affects each one, as well as how it affects the brain's numerous processes.

AB  - The risk of suicide in psychiatric hospitals is 50 times higher than in the general population, despite patient safety being a priority for any hospital. However, to date, due to the complexity of assessing suicide risk, there has been no consensus on the suicide prevention measures that should be in place in hospitals. The aim of this work is: To provide an overview of the progress that has been made in the field of inpatient suicide prevention in recent years; discuss the problems that remain; and suggest potential future developments. As new clinical dimensions (notably anhedonia, psychological pain and hopelessness) develop, they should become new therapeutic targets. Team training (like the Gatekeeper Training Program) and the latest advances in suicide risk assessment (such as the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality) should be implemented in psychiatric wards. Suicide prevention plans (e.g., ASSIP, SAFE-T, etc.) represent easy-to-administer, low-cost interventions. The Mental Health Environment of Care Checklist has been proven effective to reduce suicide risk at hospitals. Furthermore, the types of psychotherapy recommended to reduce suicide risk are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). There are several pharmacological treatments for suicide risk, such as lithium and clozapine, which have been shown to be effective in the long term, as well as ketamine and esketamine, which are more effective in the short term. Following some encouraging recent results, buprenorphine may also be proposed to patients with a suicide risk. Triple chronotherapy rapidly improves depressive symptoms over 9 weeks. Regarding brain stimulation techniques, rTMS has proven to be effective in alleviating multiple dimensions of suicidality.

AB  - This systematic review examines the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM), the application of red to near infrared light on body tissues, on the neuroinflammatory response and oxidative stress in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. The research question and search protocol were prospectively registered on the PROSPERO database. Neurodegenerative diseases are becoming ever more prevalent in the ageing populations across the Western world, with no disease-modifying or neuroprotective treatment options being available. Hence there is a real need for the development of effective treatment options for patients. Inflammatory responses and oxidative stress within the central nervous system have a strong correlation with neuronal cell death. PBM is a non-invasive therapeutic option that has shown efficacy and promising effects in animal models of neurodegenerative disease; many studies have reported neuroprotection and improved behavioural outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous study that has reviewed the anti-inflammatory and the antioxidant effect of PBM in the context of neurodegeneration. This review has examined this relationship in animal models of a range of neurodegenerative diseases. We found that PBM can effectively reduce glial activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and oxidative stress, whilst increasing anti-inflammatory glial responses and cytokines, and antioxidant capacity. These positive outcomes accompanied the neuroprotection evident after PBM treatment. Our review provides further indication that PBM can be developed into an effective non-pharmacological intervention for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Perinatal depression causes significant harm to mothers and unborn infants. Nondrug intervention is a common and acceptable method for reducing perinatal depression in pregnant women; however, it lacks an evidence -based basis. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nondrug interventions, such as cognitive behav-ioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), and yoga, in reducing perinatal depression. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT, IPT, and yoga for improving perinatal depression were searched in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, ClinicalKey, Wanfang Data (Chinese data-base), and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database. The retrieval time limit was set from the estab-lishment of the database to December 2021. Twenty-one studies involving a total of 1981 participants were included.The present meta-analysis showed that CBT and IPT could effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in perinatal women, and the curative effect of IPT was better than that of CBT. There was no significant difference in the improvement effect of yoga on participants with depressive symptoms compared with that in the controls. This study was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42022307675).

AB  - Background and aims: Along with an aging population, exploring the impact of oral health on holistic health and determining exact outcomes in elderly individuals are important in both scientific research and clinical practice. Significant increase in the number of systematic reviews shows that oral health can directly or indirectly affect the overall health of elderly people physically, mentally and socially. To systematically collate, appraise, and synthesize the current evidence, we carried out an umbrella review of the impacts of oral health on holistic health in elderly individuals. Methods: A systematic reviews and meta-analyses search was performed in the major databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from inception to February 1, 2022, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses was referred to assess methodological quality, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, assessment, Development, and Evaluation working group classification) was used to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome included in the umbrella review. Results: Out of 1,067 records, a total of 35 systematic reviews were included. Respiratory diseases, malnutrition, age-related oral changes, frailty, cognitive impairment, depression and poor quality of life were identified as seven key outcomes that affect the physical, mental and social health of elderly individuals. Meanwhile, three intervention measures of oral health were summarized as (i) more rigorous and universal scales, (ii) dental cleaning and denture installation, and (iii) improving self-awareness regarding oral care. Conclusions: Evidence showed that oral health can significantly affect holistic health, and the diverse oral diseases directly lead to multiple health outcomes in elderly individuals. Clear high-quality evidence revealed that oral health is strongly associated with seven health outcomes covering physical, mental, and social levels, which directly corresponds to holistic health, and impacts the quality of life of elderly individuals. Such the results remind the importance of oral care in public health, and further studies need to be conducted to verity more specific association between oral health and other chronic diseases.

AB  - A comprehensive review revealed that social workers hold a variety of roles and responsibilities on integrated care teams in specialty care, primary care, and community care settings.
   Social workers are key members of integrated care (IC) teams, yet there is limited research on the presence and roles of social workers on IC teams. Research literature from 2014 to 2021 was identified using the following search engines: Academic Search Complete, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, SocINDEX and MEDLINE. An exploratory search was conducted in January 2021 and an updated search was conducted in August 2021. This search resulted in 802 references, 50 of which met criteria for full-text review. Nine articles were identified through supplemental searching. 20 articles were included in the final review. Of the 20 studies included, most were randomized control trials (45%; n = 9). Studies varied across settings including specialty care (40%; n = 8), community-based practices (35%; n = 7), and primary care (25%; n = 5). Social workers engaged in a variety of roles including behavioral interventions, care coordination, and intake assessment. Social workers are engaged in IC in a variety of roles across healthcare settings. Findings suggest that patients' mental health outcomes improve in IC settings which include social workers. Future research is needed to isolate the impact that social workers have in IC. Social workers are key members of integrated care teams, yet there is a need to explore their roles on these teams. Using a methodological approach, research literature from 2014 to 2021 was explored to establish the roles, responsibilities, and settings of social workers on integrated care teams. Of the 20 articles included in the review, social workers held various roles including intake assessment, care coordination, and behavioral interventions, such as psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. Findings suggest that social workers are on integrated care teams in a variety of roles across various healthcare settings and that patients' mental health outcomes improve in integrated care settings that include social workers.

AB  - Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among adolescents, globally. Though post-primary, school-based suicide prevention (PSSP) has the potential to be a key strategy for preventing adolescent suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STBs), there are persisting challenges to translating PSSP research to practice. Intervention and contextual factors relevant to PSSP are likely key to both PSSP effectiveness and implementation. As such, this systematic review aimed to summarise the effectiveness of PSSP for adolescent STBs and highlight important intervention and contextual factors with respect to PSSP. PsycINFO, Medline, Education Source, ERIC, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to identify randomised and non-randomised studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions located in post-primary, school-based settings targeting adolescent STBs. PSSP effectiveness and intervention and contextual factors were synthesised narratively. Twenty-eight studies were retained, containing nearly 47,000 participants. Twelve out of twenty-nine trials comparing intervention and independent control comparators reported statistically significant reductions in STBs postintervention, and 5/7 trials comparing preintervention and postintervention scores demonstrated significant reductions in STBs over time. Reporting and analysis of intervention and contextual factors were lacking across studies, but PSSP effectiveness and intervention acceptability varied across type of school. Although school personnel commonly delivered PSSP interventions, their input and perspectives on PSSP interventions were lacking. Notably, adolescents had little involvement in designing, inputting on, delivering and sharing their perspectives on PSSP interventions. Twenty out of twenty-eight studies were rated as moderate/high risk of bias, with non-randomised trials demonstrating greater risks of bias and trial effectiveness, in comparison to cluster randomised trials. Future research should prioritise complete reporting and analysis of intervention and contextual factors with respect to PSSP, involving key stakeholders (including adolescents and school personnel) in PSSP, and investigating key stakeholders' perspectives on PSSP. Given the inverse associations between both study quality and study design with PSSP effectiveness, particular consideration to study quality and design in PSSP research is needed. Future practice should consider PSSP interventions with universal components and PSSP which supports and involves key stakeholders in engaging with PSSP.

AB  - Purpose With the rising relevance of person-centred care, initiatives towards user-led decision making and designing of care services have become more frequent. This designing of care services can be done in partnership, but it is unclear how. The aim of this scoping review was to identify for mental health services, what user-provider partnerships are, how they arise in practice and what can facilitate or hinder them. Methods A scoping review was conducted to obtain a broad overview of user provider partnerships in severe mental illness. Data was inductively analysed using a conventional content analysis approach, in which meaning was found in the texts. Results In total, 1559 titles were screened for the eligibility criteria and the resulting 22 papers found relevant were analysed using conventional content analysis. The identified papers had broad and differing concepts for user-provider partnerships. Papers considered shared decision making and user-involvement as partnerships. Mechanisms such as open communication, organisational top-down support and active participation supported partnerships, but professional identity, power imbalances and stress hindered them. Users can be impeded by their illness, but how to deal with these situations should be formalised through contracts. Conclusion The field of research around user-provider partnerships is scattered and lacks consensus on terminology. A power imbalance between a user and a provider is characteristic of partnerships in mental healthcare, which hinders the necessary relationship building allowing partnerships to arise. This power imbalance seems to be closely linked to professional identity, which was found to be difficult to change.

AB  - Peer feedback is essential in writing English as a Second/Foreign Language (ESL/EFL). Traditionally, offline PF was more widely favored but nowadays online peer feedback (OPF) has become frequent in ESL/EFL learners' daily writing. This study is undertaken to probe into the gains of using OPF in ESL/EFL writing on the basis of 37 research articles published in core journals from 2012 till 2022. In order to accurately cover the previous researches, we capitalize on three methods to evaluate and analyze the data, i.e., database search, citation search and manual search. Results show that from the perspective of the ESL/EFL learners' gains, the OPF is basically divided into two categories (cognitive OPF and affective OPF), involving eight aspects in all: face-based strategies, revision-based comments, writing performance, learning environment, reflection/critical thinking/responsibility, writing emotion, motivation, and attitudes; and OPF can be well supported by a set of theories like Process-oriented Writing Theory, Collaborative Learning Theory, Interactionist Theory of L2 Acquisition and Vygotsky's sociocultural theory. By comparison, the gains from OPF outperform those from offline PF in many dimensions (e.g., face-based strategies), despite some overlaps (e.g., the shift of the role) that were revealed in several investigations. Based on the past studies, we propose some pedagogical implications on OPF from ESL/EFL writing, including accenting the "student-centered" teaching strategy, providing students with OPF on the basis of incremental knowledge, adopting OPF regularly in ESL/EFL writing activities to shape personalities and outlooks and putting OPF into its full play with recourse to abundant internet-based vehicles. This review is desired to provide a guideline for both the peer feedback practice and the upcoming scholarly researches with respect to EFL/ESL writing.

AB  - Background: The significant increase of digital collaboration, driven by the current COVID-19 pandemic, is resulting in changes in working conditions and associated changes in the stress-strain perception of employees. Due to the evident leadership influence on employees' health and well-being in traditional work settings, there is a need to investigate leadership in virtual remote work contexts as well. The objective of this scoping review was to assess the extent and type of evidence concerning virtual leadership in relation to employees' mental health, job satisfaction and perceptions of isolation.Method: A search was undertaken in five databases, PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and Web of Science, as well as reference lists of included articles on 9th February 2021 and an update on 28th September 2021. The search strategy was limited to English, German and French language, peer reviewed journal articles published from January 2000 onwards. This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tools. A narrative synthesis was conducted.Results: Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. Overarching review findings suggested a positive link between virtual leadership and well-being, job satisfaction, and a negative link to psychological strain, stress and perceptions of isolation of digitally collaborating employees.Conclusions: By mapping the available evidence on virtual leadership in relation to health and work-related employee outcomes, the review identified many research gaps in terms of content and methodology. Due to limited data, causal relationships were not derived. Future research is needed to examine the complex cause-and-effect relationships of virtual leadership in more detail.

AB  - Social determinants of health (SDH) have emerged as a major area of emphasis in medicine over the last 30 years. While increasing interest in SDH has led to a proliferation of literature on this topic, it is unclear whether the medical evidence base on SDH has assimilated contributions from other disciplines. We analyzed interdisciplinary contributions to the medical evidence base on SDH, using a bibliographic analysis of highly cited literature reviews. Medical review articles from 1990 to 2020 were queried using the Scopus database, with a keyword search in the title and abstract for "social determinants of health." The top 100 most highly cited articles were sampled for inclusion, and references in each review were screened to identify journal articles published in other disciplines. An initial Scopus search identified 502 eligible reviews. After reviewing the top 100 most highly cited articles, 40 articles published between 2000 and 2017 met our inclusion criteria. and received between 33 and 940 citations. These reviews included references to a median of 41 journal articles (interquartile range [IQR]: 25, 67), of which a median of 11 was from public health journals (IQR: 6, 18) and 4 were from other social science fields (IQR: 1, 11). On multivariable analysis, more recent reviews incorporated more sources from public health but not from other social science fields. Relevant SDH scholarship from sociology and related fields is not being integrated into the evidence base directed at clinician audiences and may be underutilized in shaping policy and practice in these areas.

AB  - Referrals to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) have increased in recent years. Services are already under-resourced and the adverse psychological impact of Covid-19 is likely to increase demand. Accordingly, an understanding of prevalence of mental health (MH) disorders among youth is imperative to help inform and plan services. Aim: To establish prevalence of MH disorders among youth (under 18) in Ireland. Method: A systematic review using pre-defined search terms in PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase and CINAHL was conducted. Empirical studies conducted in Ireland, in youth and focusing on MH disorders were included. Results: From a total of 830 papers identified, 38 papers met inclusion criteria. Significant variation in rates of MH disorders was evident based on study methodology. Screening questionnaires for general psychopathology reported rates of 4.8-17.8% scoring above clinical cut-offs, with higher rates for ADHD (7.3%). Studies examining depression ranged from 4% to 20.8%, while rates for 'current' MH disorder, determined by semi-structured interview, were 15.5%, while 'lifetime' rates varied from 19.9% to 31.2%. Fewer than half (44%) of those identified as 'in need' of specialist MH services were accessing CAMHS Conclusion: Data on MH disorders among Irish youth is limited, and studies showed significant variance in rates, making service planning difficult. There is an urgent need for serial epidemiological surveys, with clear operational criteria for clinically impairing MH difficulties. Such studies are essential to understand potential demand and service planning. This is most urgent given the expected increased demand post Covid-19.

AB  - Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has well-characterized benefits in alleviating diseases associated with depression, anxiety, and obesity, resulting in a marked improvement in the patient's quality of life. There are some studies regarding the effects of CBT on patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, there is still no report of a meta-analysis for systematic assessment. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in improving weight loss, anxiety, depression, life quality, compliance, and pregnancy outcomes in patients with PCOS. Methods: Studies regarding CBT related to PCOS in PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, CNKI, and WANFANG DATA were searched for up to 19 November 2020. A random-effects model was used to perform a meta-analysis. Results: Eight trials regarding CBT compared with lifestyle modification and routine treatments were included. No differences in depression (SMD -1.11; 95% CI -2.28, 0.07; P > 0.05), body mass index (BMI) (SMD 0.88; 95% CI -0.94, 2.71; P > 0.05), or overall life quality (SMD 1.24; 95% CI -0.44, 2.92; P > 0.05) were evident between CBT and control groups; however, anxiety (SMD -1.12; 95% CI -2.1, -0.13; P < 0.05) and quality of life in hirsutism (SMD 0.92; 95% CI 0.48, 1.35; P < 0.05) were significantly improved. For secondary outcomes, both patient compliance and pregnancy rate were improved, but no significant change in pregnancy loss rate was identified. Conclusion: CBT exhibited obvious advantages in the alleviation of anxiety, improvement of quality of life in hirsutism, and increase of compliance and pregnancy rate in patients with PCOS. Larger and higher-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the role of CBT in PCOS.

AB  - Pediatric depression is a common psychiatric disorder that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with demonstrated antide-pressant effects in the adult population, however, the efficacy and safety of ketamine for the treatment of pe-diatric depression remains poorly understood. Electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2022 to identify relevant articles. Six articles involving 46 participants with a mean age of 15.7 years were included in this systematic review. Out of six articles, three were case reports, one was a randomized clinical trial (RCT) and two were open-label trials. All studies used 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine except for one, which used 2-7 micrograms/kg. Ketamine was significantly associated with reduced depressive symptoms without severe adverse events. Taken together, the results of these studies demonstrated the potential role of ketamine for treating pediatric depression. Several important limitations were identified, most notably the small sample sizes of the component studies, and that all studies administered intravenous ketamine. Further studies with larger sample sizes and different administration modalities are needed to better determine the efficacy and safety of ketamine in pediatric depression.

AB  - BackgroundAdolescent dating violence (ADV) is a serious issue that affects millions of youth worldwide. ADV can be any intentional psychological, emotional, physical, or sexual aggression that occurs in adolescent dating and/or sexual relationships, and can occur both in person and electronically. The mental health consequences of ADV can be significant and far reaching, with studies finding long-term effects of dating violence victimization in adolescence. Preventing ADV so that youth do not experience negative mental health consequences is thus necessary. To be effective, however, prevention efforts must be comprehensive and address more than one domain of the social-ecological model, incorporating risk and protective factors across the individual level; relationship level; community level; and societal level. To support researchers and practitioners in designing such prevention programs, an understanding of what risk and protective factors have been identified over the past several decades of ADV research, and how these factors are distributed across levels of the social-ecological model, is needed. MethodsThis study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We included peer-reviewed articles published in English between January 2000 and September 2020. The search strategy was developed in collaboration with a research librarian. Covidence was used for title and abstract screening and full text review. Data were extracted from included articles using a standardized charting template, and then synthesized into tables by type of factor (risk or protective), role in ADV (victimization or perpetration), and level(s) of the social-ecological model (individual, relationship, community, societal). ResultsOur initial search across six databases identified 4,798 potentially relevant articles for title and abstract review. Following title and abstract screening and full text review, we found 20 articles that were relevant to our study objective and that met inclusion criteria. Across these 20 articles, there was a disproportionate focus on risk factors at the individual and relationship levels of the social-ecological model, particularly for ADV perpetration. Very little was found about risk factors at the community or societal levels for ADV victimization or perpetration. Furthermore, a very small proportion of articles identified any protective factors, regardless of level of the social-ecological model. ConclusionDespite best practice suggesting that ADV prevention strategies should be comprehensive and directed at multiple levels of an individual's social ecology, this systematic scoping review of reviews revealed that very little is known about risk factors beyond the individual and relationship level of the social-ecological model. Further, past research appears steeped in a risk-focused paradigm, given the limited focus on protective factors. Research is needed that identifies risk factors beyond the individual and relationship levels, and a strengths-based focus should be used to identify novel protective factors. In addition, a more critical approach to ADV research - to identify structural and not just individual risk and protective factors - is needed.

AB  - In the DSM-5, psychiatric diagnoses are made based on self-reported symptoms and clinician-identified signs. Though helpful in choosing potential interventions based on the available regimens, this conceptualization of psychiatric diseases can limit basic science investigation into their underlying causes. The reward prediction error (RPE) hypothesis of dopamine neuron function posits that phasic dopamine signals encode the difference between the rewards a person expects and experiences. The computational framework from which this hypothesis was derived, temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL), is largely focused on reward processing rather than punishment learning. Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by aberrant behaviors, expectations, reward processing, and hypothesized dopaminergic signaling, but also characterized by suffering and the inability to change one's behavior despite negative consequences. In this review, we provide an overview of the RPE theory of phasic dopamine neuron activity and review the gains that have been made through the use of computational reinforcement learning theory as a framework for understanding changes in reward processing. The relative dearth of explicit accounts of punishment learning in computational reinforcement learning theory and its application in neuroscience is highlighted as a significant gap in current computational psychiatric research. Four disorders comprise the main focus of this review: two disorders of traditionally hypothesized hyperdopaminergic function, addiction and schizophrenia, followed by two disorders of traditionally hypothesized hypodopaminergic function, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Insights gained from a reward processing based reinforcement learning framework about underlying dopaminergic mechanisms and the role of punishment learning (when available) are explored in each disorder. Concluding remarks focus on the future directions required to characterize neuropsychiatric disorders with a hypothesized cause of underlying dopaminergic transmission.

AB  - This systematic review (SR) was aimed at answering two questions: (1) how sex and ovarian hormones alter behavior associated with cocaine use; (2) which possible neurobiological mechanisms explain behavioral differences. Three different researchers conducted a search in PUBMED for all kinds of articles published between the years of 1991 to 2021 on the theme "reproductive cycle and cocaine", "estrous cycle and cocaine", "menstrual cycle and cocaine", "fluctuation of ovarian hormones and cocaine", "estrogen and cocaine" and "progesterone and cocaine". Sixty original studies were identified and subdivided into experimental rodent studies and clinical trials. Experimental studies were characterized by author/year, species/strain, sex/number, age/weight, dose/route/time of administration, hormonal assessment, or administration. Clinical trials were characterized by author/year, sex/number, age, exclusion criterion, dose/route of administration/time of cocaine, and hormonal assessment. Results gathered showed that rodent females develop increased consumption, seeking behavior, craving, relapse, locomotion, increases in stress and anxiety, among other behavioral alterations during peaks of estrogen. These observations are related to the direct effects played by ovarian hormones (in particularly estradiol), in dopamine, but also in serotonin neurons, and in brain regions such as the tegmental area, the nucleus accumbens, the hypothalamus, the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Increased sensitization to cocaine presented by high estradiol females was linked to the activation of a CBR1-mediated mechanism and GABA-A-dependent suppression of inhibitory synaptic activity of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex. Estradiol facilitation of cocaine-increased locomotion and self-administration was shown to require the release of glutamate and the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors subtype 5. Clinical studies also tend to point to a stimulatory effect of estradiol on cocaine sensitization and a neuroprotective effect of progesterone. In conclusion, the results of the present review indicate a need for further preclinical and clinical trials and neurobiological studies to better understand the relationship between sex and ovarian hormones on cocaine sensitization.

AB  - Objective: To improve the quality of life of older adult in their later years, by increasing the physical activity participation of older adult, the occurrence of falls accident scores in older adult can be prevented. This paper comprehensively summarizes the origin, development, participation forms, and fitness effects of the Otago exercise program (OEP). Methods: Using PubMed, web of science, CNKI, dimensional spectrum, and other databases, search for research papers from 2005 to April 2021 by using keywords such as Otago project exercise; aged, Fall; Cognitive function, Balance ability, Lower limb strength, Fall efficiency, and so on. PEDro Scale was used to check the quality of the literatures. Results: A total of 34 papers were included after searching for kinds of literature related to the subject of this paper and after careful review by researchers. Conclusions: Otago exercise programme is beneficial to improve the cognitive function of older adult, enhance their lower limb muscle strength and dynamic and static balance ability, and then improve the gait stability and posture control ability of older adult, which has significant positive benefits for the prevention of falls in older adult. OEP is helpful to improve the falling efficiency of older adult, help older adult overcome the fear of falling, and form a positive emotion of "exercise improves exercise, " to reduce the harm caused by sedentary behavior and the incidence of depression and improve their subjective wellbeing. Although OEP has significant positive effects on improving the health and physical fitness of older adult, preventing falls, and restoring clinical function, the corresponding neural mechanism for preventing falls is not very clear. At the same time, how OEP can be combined with emerging technologies to maximize its benefits needs to be further discussed in the future.

MethodologyRelevant literature on demoralization was searched from PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL Complete. Bibliometric analysis was performed using GraphPad Prisma 8.2.1, VOSviewer 1.6.18 and R software. Research publication trends, author-country collaboration, research hotspots and future trends were explored by generating network relationship maps. ResultsA total of 1,035 publications related to the field of demoralization were identified. The earliest relevant studies have been published since 1974, and the studies have grown faster since 2000. Psyche-oncology and Psychother Psychosom had the highest number of publications (n = 25). The United States, Italy and Australia have made outstanding contributions to the field and there was an active collaboration among leading scholars. Major research hotspots include the multiple ways of assessing demoralization, the specificity of various demographics and psychological disorders in different disease contexts, and the association and distinction of diverse clinical psychological abnormalities. The impact of COVID-19 on demoralization and subsequent interventions and psychological care may become a future research direction. ConclusionThere has been a significant increase in research in the field of demoralization after 2000. The United States provided the most publications. There is overall active collaboration between authors, countries, and institutions. In future research, more attention will be paid to the effects of COVID-19 on demoralization and intervention care for this psychology.

AB  - Cognitive decline is a gradual neurodegenerative process that is affected by genetic and environmental factors. The doctor-patient relationship in the healthcare for cognitive decline is in a "shallow" medical world. With the development of data science, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and digital twin, the introduction of the concept of the metaverse in medicine has brought alternative and complementary strategies in the intervention of cognitive decline. This article technically analyzes the application scenarios and paradigms of the metaverse in medicine in the field of mental health, such as hospital management, diagnosis, prediction, prevention, rehabilitation, progression delay, assisting life, companionship, and supervision. The metaverse in medicine has made primary progress in education, immersive consultation, dental disease, and Parkinson's disease, bringing revolutionary prospects for non-pharmacological complementary treatment of cognitive decline and other mental problems. In particular, with the demand for non-face-to-face communication generated by the global COVID-19 epidemic, the needs for uncontactable healthcare service for the elderly have increased. The paradigm of self-monitoring, self-healing, and healthcare experienced by the elderly through the metaverse in medicine, especially from meta-platform, meta-community, and meta-hospital, will be generated, which will reconstruct the service modes for the elderly people. The future map of the metaverse in medicine is huge, which depends on the co-construction of community partners.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO), in its last review of its International Classification of Diseases, established a new classification for chronic pain. Among the principal categories, of particular interest is chronic primary pain as a new type of diagnosis in those cases in which the etiology of the disease is not clear, being termed as chronic primary visceral pain when it is situated in the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis. Due to the novelty of the term, the objective of the systematic review was to examine the psychopathological and neuropsychological disorders associated with chronic primary visceral pain. We carried out a search of the scientific literature following the PRISMA directives using the Pubmed, Medline, PsycInfo and Scopus databases. A total of 33 articles were selected after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analysis of the studies showed that most persons with chronic primary visceral pain suffer from at least one psychological disorder; the most prevalent being anxiety, depressive or somatoform disorders. The most frequent psychopathological symptoms are anxiety, depression and somatization. Similarly, the findings are insufficient to determine the existence of deficits in the domains of executive functioning, memory and intelligence. However, the existence of attention biases does seem to be clear. This review supposes a starting point for conceptualizing chronic primary visceral pain. It is necessary to continue further research so as to obtain a better understanding of this pathology and the disorders associated.

AB  - Sleep disorders are prevalent nowadays, leading to anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, and other health problems. Due to the proliferation of mobile devices and the development of communication technologies, mobile apps have become a popular way to deliver sleep disorder therapy or manage sleep. This scoping review aims to conduct a systematic investigation of mobile apps and technologies supporting sleep, including the essential functions of sleep apps, how they are used to improve sleep and the facilitators of and barriers to using apps among patients and other stakeholders. We searched articles (2010 to 2022) from Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore using the keyword sleep apps. In total, 1,650 peer-reviewed articles were screened, and 51 were selected for inclusion. The most frequently provided functions by the apps are sleep monitoring, measuring sleep, providing alarms, and recording sleep using a sleep diary. Several wearable devices have been used with mobile apps to record sleep duration and sleep problems. Facilitators and barriers to using apps were identified, along with the evidence-based design guidelines. Existing studies have proved the initial validation and efficiency of delivering sleep treatment by mobile apps; however, more research is needed to improve the performance of sleep apps and devise a way to utilize them as a therapy tool.

AB  - BackgroundThe outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused unprecedented disruption to the structure of children's daily lives due to school closures, online learning, strict social distancing measures, limited access to outdoor activities and many other restrictions. Since children are more susceptible to stress than adults and there is a growing concern about the potential debilitating consequences of COVID-19 for children's mental health, the present review aims to provide empirical evidence on the groups who are most at risk of mental health problems and uncover the risk and protective factors of children's mental health.MethodsA systematic search was performed, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, in the electronic databases Web of Science (including SSCI and A & HI) and EBSCOhost (including ERIC, MEDLINE and APA PsycArticles and APA PsycINFO), for any empirical studies published between January 2020 and February 2022 that focused on children & LE; 12 years old.ResultsAn initial search identified 2,133 studies. A total of 30 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The evidence showed that many children were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and experienced internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Worsened child mental health outcomes reflected socioeconomic inequalities as most at-risk children had parents with low educational attainment, were from families of low socioeconomic status and lived in small homes. Key risk factors were identified, including unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (extended screen time, sleep disturbances and less physical activity), increased pandemic-related stressors among parents and deteriorated mental health of parents, which were directly or indirectly associated with the pandemic safety measures, such as home confinement or social distancing. Protective factors including parents' resilience, positive parent-child relationship and school connectedness in relation to children's mental health were reported.ConclusionThe overall results highlight the urgent need for the implementation of tailor-made interventions for children with signs of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Health promotion and prevention strategies by the government to maintain the mental health of children, particularly those from lower SES families who are at higher risk of worsened mental health are essential for post-pandemic policies.

AB  - Purpose of Review Anxiety symptoms increase during the peri-menstrual phase of the menstrual cycle in people with anxiety disorders. Whether this reflects a heightened variant of normal menstrual-related changes in psychological states experienced by healthy (i.e. non-anxious) people is unknown. Moreover, menstrual-related change in anxiety symptoms is a poorly understood phenomenon, highlighting a need for pre-clinical models to aid mechanistic discovery. Here, we review recent evidence for menstrual effects on anxiety-like features in healthy humans as a counterpart to recent reviews that have focused on clinically anxious populations. We appraise the utility of rodent models to identify mechanisms of menstrual effects on anxiety and offer suggestions to harmonise methodological practices across species to advance knowledge in this field. Recent Findings Consistent with reports in clinical populations, some evidence indicates anxiety symptoms increase during the peri-menstrual period in healthy people, although null results have been reported, and these effects are heterogeneous across studies and individuals. Studies in rats show robust increases in anxiety during analogous phases of the oestrous cycle. Studies in female rats are useful to identify the evolutionarily conserved biological mechanisms of menstrual-related changes in anxiety. Future experimental approaches in rats should model the heterogeneity observed in human studies to increase alignment across species and advance understanding of the individual factors that increase the propensity to experience menstrual-related changes in anxiety.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased healthcare worker (HCW) susceptibility to mental illness. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence and possible factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE databases up to May 4th, 2022. We performed random effects meta-analysis and moderator ana-lyses for the prevalence of PTSD-relevant symptoms and severe PTSD symptoms. We identified 1276 studies, reviewed 209 full-text articles, and included 119 studies (117,143 participants) with a total of 121 data points in our final analysis. 34 studies (24,541 participants) reported prevalence of severe PTSD symptoms. Approximately 25.2% of participants were physicians, 42.8% nurses, 12.4% allied health professionals, 8.9% auxiliary health professionals, and 10.8% "other". The pooled prevalence of PTSD symptoms among HCWs was 34% (95% CI, 0.30-0.39, I2 >90%), and 14% for severe PTSD (95% CI, 0.11 -0.17, I2 >90%). The introduction of COVID vaccines was associated with a sharp decline in the prevalence of PTSD, and new virus variants were associated with small increases in PTSD rates. It is important that policies work towards allocating adequate resources towards protecting the well-being of healthcare workers to minimize adverse consequences of PTSD.

AB  - Introduction: Ethnic minority personnel experience greater levels of harassment and discrimination than their non-minority counterparts. This review demonstrates the impact of these experiences on ethnic minority personnel in the armed forces. Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, EBSCO, and Web of Science. Sixteen articles that discussed Black, Asian, and ethnic minority armed forces personnel were analyzed. Results: Much of what is known about ethnic minority experiences of serving in the armed forces is based on ethnic minorities in the U.S. Armed Forces. The available literature shows that ethnic minority serving personnel and Veterans experience greater disadvantage than their native counterparts, both during and after service. Ethnic minority personnel reported poorer health than white personnel and fear of criticism from their ethnic minority community on disclosure of traumatic experiences. Ethnic minority personnel were also more likely to access formal mental health services yet less likely to engage in treatment, particularly women. Three themes were identified: cultural identity, health status and health utilisation, and trauma and discrimination. Discussion: Research reports often do not highlight individual ethnic minority groups, thus making it difficult to draw conclusions about them. Future research should consider evaluating the psychosocial context influencing functioning among different ethnic minority groups and should also explore the benefits of serving in the armed forces.
   LAY SUMMARY An armed forces consisting of personnel from diverse and ethnic minority backgrounds offers considerable benefits, not just in terms of reflecting society but for improving the effectiveness of military operations. Many ethnic minority individuals serve for long periods, during which they experience personal growth and benefit from military service. However, little research has explored the impact these experiences might have on ethnic minority communities within the Armed Forces, who report higher levels of being bullying, harassment, and discrimination. Given the lack of empirical research into armed forces ethnic minority personnel, this systematic review aimed to provide insight into and understanding of existing international research, relevant reports, and policy. The review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and included articles written in English since 2010. The review identified three themes - cultural identity, health status and health utilization, and trauma and discrimination - and indicated that ethnic minority personnel experience greater disadvantage than their native counterparts, both during and after service.

AB  - Background/objectivesImmune-inflammatory changes have been found in all types of suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB), independently of associated mental disorders. Since several Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) affect the function of inflammation-related genes, we searched the literature for genetic variations potentially altering inflammatory processes in SIB.MethodsWe included studies that looked for associations between SIB and SNPs in genes related to inflammatory processes. Case reports, literature reviews, and animal studies were excluded. Articles were retrieved from PubMed and PsycINFO databases, Google Scholar and GreySource Index until September 17th, 2022. Quality was assessed using Q-Genie.ResultsWe analyzed 32 studies. SIB has been associated with eighteen SNPs located in genes encoding for interleukin-8 (rs4073), C-reactive protein (rs1130864), tumor necrosis factor alpha (rs1800629, rs361525, and rs1099724), tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (rs1061622), transforming growth factor beta-1 (rs1982073), acid phosphatase 1 (rs7419262, rs300774), interleukin-10 (rs1800896), interferon gamma (rs2430561), amino-carboxy muconate semialdehyde decarboxylase (rs2121337), interleukin 7 (rs10448044, rs10448042), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (rs755622), interleukin 1-alpha (rs1800587), and interleukin 1-beta (rs1143634 and rs16944. A genome-wide association study reported one association at the threshold of significance with the rs300774 SNP, located in the 2p25 region containing ACP1 gene.DiscussionThe studies included were methodologically and clinically diverse and of moderate quality. Their findings suggest that some inflammation-related SNPs could increase the likelihood of SIB but the evidence to date is insufficient. Further research using gene-gene (GxG) and gene-environment (GxE) approaches is warranted.Systematic review registration[], identifier [CRD42022296310].

AB  - Background: Mindfulness affects human levels of experience by facilitating the immediate and impartial perception of phenomena, including sensory stimulation, emotions, and thoughts. Mindfulness is now a focus of neuroimaging, since technical and methodological developments in magnetic resonance imaging have made it possible to observe subjects performing mindfulness tasks. Objective: We set out to describe the association between mental processes and characteristics of mindfulness, including their specific cerebral patterns, as shown in structural and functional neuroimaging studies. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE databank of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics via PubMed using the keywords: "mindfulness, " "focused attention (FA), " "open monitoring (OM), " "mind wandering, " "emotional regulation, " "magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) " and "default mode network (DMN). " This review extracted phenomenological experiences across populations with varying degrees of mindfulness training and correlated these experiences with structural and functional neuroimaging patterns. Our goal was to describe how mindful behavior was processed by the constituents of the default mode network during specific tasks. Results and conclusions: Depending on the research paradigm employed to explore mindfulness, investigations of function that used fMRI exhibited distinct activation patterns and functional connectivities. Basic to mindfulness is a long-term process of learning to use meditation techniques. Meditators progress from voluntary control of emotions and subjective preferences to emotional regulation and impartial awareness of phenomena. As their ability to monitor perception and behavior, a metacognitive skill, improves, mindfulness increases self-specifying thoughts governed by the experiential phenomenological self and reduces self-relational thoughts of the narrative self. The degree of mindfulness (ratio of self-specifying to self-relational thoughts) may affect other mental processes, e.g., awareness, working memory, mind wandering and belief formation. Mindfulness prevents habituation and the constant assumptions associated with mindlessness. Self-specifying thinking during mindfulness and self-relational thinking in the narrative self relies on the default mode network. The main constituents of this network are the dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex. These midline structures are antagonistic to self-specifying and self-relational processes, since the predominant process determines their differential involvement. Functional and brain volume changes indicate brain plasticity, mediated by mental training over the long-term.

The study participants were divided into two groups, the "fall group " and the "control group ", and differences in demographic characteristics, lifestyles, and comorbidities were compared. Results: We included 34 articles in the analysis and analyzed 22 factors. Older age, lower education level, polypharmacy, malnutrition, living alone, living in an urban area, smoking, and alcohol consumption increased the risk of falls in the aging population. Additionally, comorbidities such as cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, frailty, previous history of falls, depression, Parkinson's disease, and pain increased the risk of falls. Conclusion: Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and lifestyle factors can influence the risk of falls and should be taken into consideration.

AB  - Given the extensive neural networks connecting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with other subcortical regions, the DLPFC has been implicated in a wide range of psychological and physiological functions during execution of movements. The main objective of this narrative review is to provide a solid theoretical foundation to deepen our understanding of the functional significance of the DLPFC during exercise. Given the limited scientific evidence in this field of scientific enquiry, this review was primarily focused on fatiguing and exhaustive exercise modes. The authors reviewed the anatomical structure of this region, as well as its functional importance for physical tasks performed mainly at moderate and high intensities. The majority of the studies employed noninvasive brain assessment techniques, such as electmencephalography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Six main DLPFC functions were identified: 1) exercise tolerance, 2) executive function, 3) attention allocation, 4) emotion regulation, 5) reward seeking, and 6) memory formation. The most important neuromodulatory function exerted by the DLPFC pertains to the inhibitory influence of this region over the amygdala and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This inhibitory function appears to be the primary possibility and is generally reliant upon connectivity with other subcortical regions. During exhaustive exercise, stress hormones appear to have an inhibitory effect on the DLPFC and hippocampus. The present authors hypothesize that the use of cognitive strategies to partially neutralize the amygdala may rely on the presence of rewards, which are then translated into motivation to action through the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems.

AB  - Background Childhood trauma is a common and potent risk factor for developing major depressive disorder in adulthood, associated with earlier onset, more chronic or recurrent symptoms, and greater probability of having comorbidities. Some studies indicate that evidence-based pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies for adult depression might be less efficacious in patients with a history of childhood trauma than patients without childhood trauma, but findings are inconsistent. Therefore, we examined whether individuals with major depressive disorder, including chronic forms of depression, and a reported history of childhood trauma, had more severe depressive symptoms before treatment, had more unfavourable treatment outcomes following active treatments, and were less likely to benefit from active treatments relative to a control condition, compared with individuals with depression without childhood trauma. Methods We did a comprehensive meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42020220139). Study selection combined the search of bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase) from Nov 21, 2013, to March 16, 2020, and full-text randomised clinical trials (RCTs) identified from several sources (1966 up to 2016-19) to identify articles in English. RCTs and open trials comparing the efficacy or effectiveness of evidence-based pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or combination intervention for adult patients with depressive disorders and the presence or absence of childhood trauma were included. Two independent researchers extracted study characteristics. Group data for effect-size calculations were requested from study authors. The primary outcome was depression severity change from baseline to the end of the acute treatment phase, expressed as standardised effect size (Hedges' g). Meta-analyses were done using random-effects models. Findings From 10 505 publications, 54 trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 29 (20 RCTs and nine open trials) contributed data of a maximum of 6830 participants (age range 18-85 years, male and female individuals and specific ethnicity data unavailable). More than half (4268 [62%] of 6830) of patients with major depressive disorder reported a history of childhood trauma. Despite having more severe depression at baseline (g=0middot202, 95% CI 0middot145 to 0middot258, I-2=0%), patients with childhood trauma benefitted from active treatment similarly to patients without childhood trauma history (treatment effect difference between groups g=0middot016, -0middot094 to 0middot125, I-2=44middot3%), with no significant difference in active treatment effects (vs control condition) between individuals with and without childhood trauma (childhood trauma g=0middot605, 0middot294 to 0middot916, I2=58middot0%; no childhood trauma g=0middot178, -0middot195 to 0middot552, I-2=67middot5%; between-group difference p=0middot051), and similar dropout rates (risk ratio 1middot063, 0middot945 to 1middot195, I-2=0%). Findings did not significantly differ by childhood trauma type, study design, depression diagnosis, assessment method of childhood trauma, study quality, year, or treatment type or length, but differed by country (North American studies showed larger treatment effects for patients with childhood trauma; false discovery rate corrected p=0middot0080). Most studies had a moderate to high risk of bias (21 [72%] of 29), but the sensitivity analysis in low-bias studies yielded similar findings to when all studies were included.
   Interpretation Contrary to previous studies, we found evidence that the symptoms of patients with major depressive disorder and childhood trauma significantly improve after pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, notwithstanding their higher severity of depressive symptoms. Evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy should be offered to patients with major depressive disorder regardless of childhood trauma status. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As growth mindset interventions increase in scope and popularity, scientists and policymakers are asking: Are these interventions effective? To answer this question properly, the field needs to understand the meaningful heterogeneity in effects. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we focused on two key moderators with adequate data to test: Subsamples expected to benefit most and implementation fidelity. We also specified a process model that can be generative for theory. We included articles published between 2002 (first mindset intervention) through the end of 2020 that reported an effect for a growth mindset intervention, used a randomized design, and featured at least one of the qualifying outcomes. Our search yielded 53 independent samples testing distinct interventions. We reported cumulative effect sizes for multiple outcomes (i.e., mindsets, motivation, behavior, end results), with a focus on three primary end results (i.e., improved academic achievement, mental health, or social functioning). Multilevel metaregression analyses with targeted subsamples and high fidelity for academic achievement yielded, d = 0.14, 95% CI [.06, .22]; for mental health, d = 0.32, 95% CI [.10, .54]. Results highlighted the extensive variation in effects to be expected from future interventions. Namely, 95% prediction intervals for focal effects ranged from -0.08 to 0.35 for academic achievement and from 0.07 to 0.57 for mental health. The literature is too nascent for moderators for social functioning, but average effects are d = 0.36, 95% CI [.03, .68], 95% PI [-.50, 1.22]. We conclude with a discussion of heterogeneity and the limitations of meta-analyses.
   Public Significance Statement Growth mindset interventions are increasing in popularity in education and are being applied to improving other areas of functioning as well; however, there is debate about how well they work. Despite the large variation in effectiveness, we found positive effects on academic outcomes, mental health, and social functioning, especially when interventions are delivered to people expected to benefit the most.

AB  - Structural and functional brain alterations are found in adults with depression. It is not known whether these changes are a result of illness or exist prior to disorder onset. Asymptomatic offspring of parents with depression offer a unique opportunity to research neural markers of familial risk to depression and clarify the temporal sequence between brain changes and disorder onset. We conducted a systematic review to investigate whether asymptomatic offspring at high familial risk have structural and functional brain changes like those reported in adults with depression. Our literature search resulted in 44 studies on 18,645 offspring ranging from 4 weeks to 25 years old. Reduced cortical thickness and white matter integrity, and altered striatal reward processing were the most consistent findings in high-risk offspring across ages. These alterations are also present in adults with depression, suggesting the existence of neural markers of familial risk for depression. Additional studies reproducing current results, streamlining fMRI data analyses, and investigating underexplored topics (i.e intracortical myelin, gyrification, subcortical shape) may be among the next steps required to improve our understanding of neural markers indexing the vulnerability to depression.

AB  - Aims Young people often seek help from their peers for mental health problems. However, little is known about young people's experiences of helping a peer with a mental health problem. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on young people's help-giving actions, highlight any gaps in the research and examine the evidence for interventions designed to increase and improve help-giving. The secondary aim was to compare findings between help-giving in face-to-face and online settings. Methods Embase, SCOPUS, PsycINFO and MEDLINE electronic databases were searched for English studies published from 2003 onwards. Studies focusing on the help-giving actions of young people (aged 12-25 years) towards a peer with a mental health problem were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal tools. Data were synthesized using thematic and narrative analysis. Results Twenty-one studies (3440 participants) were included. The most frequently reported help-giving themes were encouraging professional and adult support and providing emotional support. Although limited studies reported on online help-giving, online settings allowed for immediate help to be provided despite time or location. Both positive and negative outcomes for helping were identified. Improvements in the quality of help-giving were found after training; however, help-giving for mental health crises was poor. Conclusions Further research regarding the young people's help-giving actions to peers online is required. Training programs need to consider how to further improve the quality of help-giving among young people and to increase the trainees' confidence in helping, particularly in a mental health crisis.

AB  - Background: Multiple investigations have shown that diabetes mellitus is a predictor of post-stroke depression (PSD). However, whether elevated levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are associated with an increased risk of PSD remains controversial.Methods: We comprehensively searched databases for eligible studies. Standard mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were used to examine the relationship between peripheral blood glucose levels during the acute phase of stroke and the risk of PSD. Narrative syntheses and meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate unadjusted or adjusted ORs were available.Results: A total of 21 prospective cohort studies were included in the analysis. PSD patients had significantly higher peripheral blood glucose levels than non-PSD patients (FPG: SMD, 0.28, 95% CI, 0.11-0.45, p<0.01, HbA1c: SMD, 0.49, 95%CI, 0.20-0.78, p<0.01, respectively). In the subgroup analyses by classifying the time point of depression assessment, HbA1c was more statistically significant associated with the risk of PSD than FPG. Differences in the prevalence of diabetes were not heterogeneity sources.Conclusion: Higher levels of peripheral blood glucose in the acute phase of stroke increase the risk of PSD. HbA1c might be a better biomarker for the risk of PSD than FPG.

AB  - Objective: Allostatic load literature has proliferated over the past three decades, and a growing body of research demonstrates that higher levels of allostatic load are associated with a wide range of negative physical and mental health outcomes. However, there remain significant challenges with operationalization of the concept. A scoping review of the methods employed to create an allostatic load algorithm was conducted and recommen-dations for future research with an orientation towards advancing clinical application of the theory are discussed.Methods: A search of seven electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Social Work Abstracts, Social Service Ab-stracts, Social Sciences Citation Index (Web of Science), Sociological Abstracts, Scopus) was completed with the search term "allostatic load." Studies were reviewed, and if they met the inclusion criteria, data was extracted, complied, and presented in the narrative, table, and figures.Results: The initial searches yielded 5280 results with the final sample of 395 non-duplicate articles that met the inclusion criteria. More than half (52.5%) of all included publications employed biomarker cutoffs based on the high-risk quartiles of the sample distribution, 11.1% employed the sum of at-risk clinical scores, and the remainder of studies utilized a range of different algorithms.Conclusion: Allostatic load literature has grown at an exponential rate in recent years, but researchers continue to operationalize the concept via algorithms that may have limited utility moving forward. More nuanced statistical approaches are emerging and should be considered, as should a shift towards an approach that can provide additional clinical utility.

AB  - Introduction Suicidal behaviour is particularly frequent in patients with psychosis. Therefore, prevention is a key objective of mental health policies. The aim of the current work is to systematically review the association between neurocognitive functioning and suicidal behaviour in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Material and Methods Of the 3051 studies reviewed, only 7 met the inclusion criteria. Documents in English from their earliest date of coverage until January 2022 were searched for in the following databases: PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO (ProQuest), and Springerlink. We used the PICO strategy to collect and categorize the data from each selected manuscript. Results Overall, the results showed that the risk of suicidal behaviour is higher for FEP patients in the presence of a number of factors: poorer general neuropsychological functioning (except for working memory), poorer social cognition, more depressive symptoms, longer duration of untreated psychosis, higher awareness of the illness, poorer premorbid adjustment, and more frequent cannabis use. Discussion Comprehensive general neuropsychology and assessment of social cognition, together with routine clinical record keeping, may help to identify FEP patients at a greater risk of attempting suicide.

AB  - Although bright light therapy (BLT) has been widely used in the clinical treatment of depression, the antidepressant effect of BLT is not well understood. Considering the connection between depression and disrupted circadian rhythm, we assumed the model of human circadian phototransduction could be more accurate in evaluating the efficacy of BLT for depression compared to light level and spectrum. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted and the CS (circadian stimulus) model was used to quantify the efficacy of lighting in BLT. Articles published up to June 2022 were searched in COCHRANE, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Randomized clinical trials included articles using high circadian stimulus (H-CS, CS > 0.1) as lighting therapy for people with depressive disorder vs. a control group (CS < 0.1). The treatment effect was estimated by calculating the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Seven trials involving 258 participants met the inclusion criteria. In this sample size, H-CS lighting was associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (MD = -5.56, 95% CI = -9.22 to -1.90, P = 0.003, I-2 = 64%). According to the meta-analysis, CS can be employed for the clinical evaluation of BLT for patients with depressive disorder and exposure to H-CS lighting significantly reduced depressive symptoms among adults. A range of CS > 0.57 was obtained, during which different lighting parameter combinations (e.g., light levels, spectra, duration, and light distribution) could achieve better treatment for depression.

   Methods A systematic review of the literature using the PRISMA guideline was performed. An electronic database search of published literature between 2000 and 2022 was conducted based on predetermined search terms and parameters.
   Results Twenty-seven articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eleven articles focused on feeding practices, ten reported on nursing/maternal care experiences, five reported mental health/social support, and only one focused on mother-infant relationships. Only five papers reported using any frameworks, comprising grounded theory framework (n = 2), theory of planned behavior (n = 1), research justice framework (n =1), and the patient and public engagement protocol (n =1).
   Discussion A holistic approach to understanding the multifactorial experiences of Black mothers with preterm infants needs to be socio-culturally competent to ensure their diverse intersections and identities are accurately represented and understood. Rigorous research at the intersection of Black maternal health and the NICU hold promises for advancing maternal health equity in the United States.

AB  - Background and aims: Among the large number of studies on smartphone addiction, only a few randomized controlled trials on exercise and psychological interventions for smartphone addiction by university students have been published. This study aims to systematically investigate the impact of exercise and psychological interventions on smartphone addiction among university students.
   Methods: The PRISMA guidelines were adopted for this systematic literature review. Prominent academic databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and PsycINFO were searched to find eligible studies published before Aug 2021. The overall quality of the articles was checked using the "QualSyst" tool by Kmet et al.
   Results: From among 600 papers, 23 met the inclusion criteria and were incorporated into our systematic review. All of the studies were randomized controlled trials. The following thematic areas emerged as a result of the content analysis: study selection and design, as well as study characteristics (participants, intervention, comparisons, and outcomes).
   Discussion and conclusion: The literature on exercise and psychological interventions for smartphone addiction is scarce. There is a need to introduce new interventions and to validate the effectiveness of combined interventions. Our findings suggest that exercise and psychological interventions may help to reduce smartphone addiction. This combination was more effective compare to exercise or psychological intervention on mental health and addiction among university students. Future research should combine exercise and psychological interventions, focusing on university students, especially females, who are vulnerable to smartphone addiction. Further studies should focus on the cross-section of neuropsychology, cognitive psychology, and sports science to provide combined interventions in physiological and psychological direction.

AB  - Objective: Allostatic load refers to cumulative neuroendocrine burden and has been postulated to mediate and moderate physiological and psychological stress-related responses. This may have important implications for the risk of preterm birth. This systematic review examines the evidence on the association between prenatal allostatic load and preterm birth. Data sources: A comprehensive search of seven electronic databases was conducted from inception to August 23, 2022 to identify all English-language observational and mixed methods studies examining allostatic load and preterm birth with no year or geographic restrictions.Study eligibility criteriaStudies were included if they measured allostatic load, evaluated as the cumulative effect of any combination of more than one allostatic load biomarker, during pregnancy. Studies must have observed preterm birth, defined as < 37 weeks' gestational age, as a primary or secondary outcome of interest.Study appraisal and synthesis methodsThe Quality In Prognosis Studies tool was used to evaluate risk of bias within included studies. A narrative synthesis was conducted to explore potential associations between allostatic load and preterm birth, and sources of heterogeneity.ResultsThree prospective cohort studies were identified and revealed mixed evidence for an association between allostatic load and preterm birth. One study reported a statistically significant association while the other two studies reported little to no evidence for an association. Heterogeneity in when and how allostatic load was measured, limitations in study design and cohort socio-demographics may have contributed to the mixed evidence. Conclusions: This review provides insight into key individual-, community-, and study-level characteristics that may influence the association between allostatic load and preterm birth. Knowledge gaps are identified as foci for future research, including heterogeneity in allostatic load biomarkers and allostatic load index algorithms as well as pregnancy-specific considerations for allostatic load measurement. Further investigation of the allostatic load framework in the context of perinatal mental health is needed to advance understandings of maternal, infant, and child health.Systematic review registration, PROSPERO, identifier: CRD42020208990.

AB  - Background: The relationship between imprisonment and mental illness is bidirectional. The clinical outcomes of prisoners with mental illness have not been widely studied, especially in developing countries. This study was conducted to assess the same among male inpatients under judicial custody with charges of homicide. Methods: A retrospective chart review of male forensic ward inpatients admitted between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2016, was conducted. Diagnosis in the files was based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria. The Clinical and Global Improvement-Severity (CGI-S) scale was used to measure the severity of illness. Mean CGI-S assessment was carried out at baseline, end of 1 year, 5 years, and 15 years. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Friedman's test, and Dunn's post hoc test. Results: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders and other psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and alcohol use disorders were diagnosed in 62(49.6%), 22(17.6%), and 44(35.2%) subjects, respectively. Forty-one (32.8%) subjects had at least one readmission. The average CGI-S score for the total subjects was 5 (markedly ill) at baseline and 2 (borderline ill) at the end of their latest contact with the tertiary care hospital. For the 34 subjects (27.2%) who had follow-up information of 15 years, the average CGI-S score was 1 (normal, not at all ill) at the end of 15 years (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Clinical outcomes of prisoners with mental illness seem promising, subject to the seamless availability of services. Studies from other parts of the country are required for a more systematic understanding of the requirements of care.

AB  - The world is still in the grip of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, with putative psychological consequences for healthcare workers (HCWs). Exploring the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the first SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2003 may inform us of the long-term effects of the actual pandemic, as well as putative influencing factors such as contact with the virus, time effects, or the importance of some sociodemographic data. This information may help us develop efficient preventive strategies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of PTSD in HCWs following the SARS-CoV-1 in 2003. PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Psychinfo, and Web of Science were searched until September 2022. Random-effects meta-analyses were stratified by the time of follow-up. We included 14 studies: 4842 HCWs (32.0 years old, 84% women). The overall prevalence of PTSD was 14% (95CI 10 to 17%). The prevalence of PTSD was 16% (8 to 24%) during the epidemic, 19% (16 to 22%) within 6 months after the epidemic, and 8% (4 to 13%) more than one year after the end of the epidemic. The longest follow-up was three years after the epidemic, with 10% of HCWs with PTSD. Nevertheless, the prevalence of PTSD was significantly lower more than one year after the end of the epidemic than the first six months after the epidemic (Coefficient -10.4, 95CI -17.6 to -3.2, p = 0.007). In conclusion, the prevalence of PTSD in HCWs was high during the first epidemic of SARS-CoV in 2003 and remained high in the long term. The lessons from the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic may help prevent a wave of PTSD following the latest COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Neurodegenerative and neuronal-related diseases are major public health concerns. Human vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) increases with age. Neuronal hormones and neurotransmitters are major determinant factors regulating brain structure and functions. The implications of environmental and climatic changes emerged recently as influence factors on numerous diseases. However, the complex interaction of neurotransmitters and neuronal hormones and their depletion under environmental and climatic influences on NDDs are not well established in the literature. In this review, we aim to explore the connection between the environmental and climatic factors to NDDs and to highlight the available and potential therapeutic interventions that could use to improve the quality of life and reduce susceptibility to NDDs.

AB  - Depression is one of the most important non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), but its prevalence and related clinical characteristics are unclear. To this end, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on 129 studies, including 38304 participants from 28 countries. Overall, the prevalence of depression in PD was 38 %. When compared with patients without depression, those with depression had a younger age of onset, a lower education level, longer disease duration, higher UPDRS-III, higher H&Y staging scale, and lower MMSE, SE-ADL scores. We observed that depression was associated with female patients, patients carrying the GBA1 mutation, freezing of gait (FOG), apathy, anxiety and fatigue. Our results suggest that depression is an independent, frequent non-motor symptom in PD, appearing in the early stage and persisting throughout the disease duration. In addition, several clinical characteristics and motor and non-motor symptoms appeared to be associated with depression and negatively impacted on quality of life.

AB  - Arid and semiarid environments are characterized by low water availability (e.g., in soil and atmosphere), high air temperature, and irregularity in the spatio-temporal distribution of rainfall. In addition to the economic and environmental consequences, drought also causes physiological damage to crops and compromises their survival in ecosystems. The removal of vegetation is responsible for altering the energy exchange of heat and water in natural ecosystems and agricultural areas. The fluxes of CO2 are also changed, and environments with characteristics of sinks, which can be sources of CO2 after anthropic disturbances. These changes can be measured through methods such as sap flow, eddy covariance, remote sensing, and energy balance. Despite the relevance of each method mentioned above, there are limitations in their applications that must be respected. Thus, this review aims to quantify the processes and changes of energy fluxes, CO2, and their interactions with the surfaces of terrestrial ecosystems in dry environments. Studies report that the use of methods that integrate data from climate monitoring towers and remote sensing products helps to improve the accuracy of the determination of energy fluxes on a global scale, also helping to reduce the dissimilarity of results obtained individually. Through the collection of works in the literature, it is reported that several areas of the Brazilian Caatinga biome, which is a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest have been suffering from changes in land use and land cover. Similar fluxes of sensible heat in areas with cacti and Caatinga can be observed in studies. On the other hand, one of the variables influenced mainly by air temperature is net radiation. In dry forest areas, woody species can store large amounts of carbon in their biomass above and belowground. The use of cacti can modify the local carbon budget when using tree crops together. Therefore, the study highlights the complexity and severity of land degradation and changes in CO2, water, and energy fluxes in dry environments with areas of forest, grassland, and cacti. Vegetation energy balance is also a critical factor, as these simulations are helpful for use in forecasting weather or climate change. We also highlight the need for more studies that address environmental conservation techniques and cactus in the conservation of degraded areas.

AB  - Background and objectives: Sleep and circadian disturbances have been widely studied in patients with bipolar disorder. However, there is no clear evidence about the role of peripheral biomarkers of the circadian cycle in this population. This systematic review aims to identify potential endocrine blood biomarkers of circadian rhythms and study their relationship with sleep problems in these patients.Methods: An electronic search was performed of PubMed and PsycINFO databases. It included articles about the topic from 1991 through 2021. The search strategy was: ("peripheral bio-markers" OR "biological markers" OR biomarker OR cortisol OR melatonin OR orexin OR hypocre-tin) AND (blood OR serum OR plasma) AND ("sleep-wake" OR "circadian rhythm" OR sleep OR insomnia) AND "bipolar."Results: After excluding duplicates, 92 records were obtained. Only 5 studies met the inclusion criteria (n=499; bipolar disorder=125; unipolar depression=148; schizophrenia=80; con-trols=146). The endocrine parameters analyzed were: cortisol (3 studies), melatonin (1 study), and orexin-A (1 study). Overall, no significant associations were detected between these bio-markers and sleep disturbances, assessed with subjective (psychometric evaluation) and/or objective (polysomnography) measures.Conclusion: This review highlights the lack of studies exploring the role of endocrine biomarkers related to circadian function in the pathophysiology of sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder.

AB  - Addressing the mental health needs of healthcare workers (HCWs), who are at high risk of suicide, is an important public health issue. Therefore, this systematic review investigated the effect of psychosocial intervention targeting suicidal behavior (i.e., suicidal ideation, attempt, or fulfillment) of HCWs. Five electronic databases were searched for interventional studies reporting HCWs' suicidal behavior outcomes. Only two interventional studies were included in this review, and no consistent conclusion was drawn from the existing literature regarding the psychosocial prevention strategies focusing on the suicide risk of HCWs. The results indicate that compared with numerous observational studies reporting poor mental health and/or severity of suicidal risk among HCWs, intervention studies using psychosocial strategies to reduce the risk of suicide are relatively scarce. Although the insufficient number and heterogeneity of the included studies leave the results inconclusive, our findings emphasize the need to fill the research gap in this field. The causes of the gap are further explored, and suggestions for future research are provided.

KW  - ME
AB  - Background: Facebook represents a new dimension for global information sharing. Suicidal behaviours and attempts are increasingly reported on Facebook. This scoping review explores the various aspects of suicidal behaviours associated with Facebook, discussing the challenges and preventive measures. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus were searched for related articles published in English up to October 2021, using different combinations of "Facebook" and "suicide". A group of experts comprising consultant psychiatrists screened the records and read the full-text articles to extract relevant data. Twenty-eight articles were chosen as relevant and included in the review under four selected themes. Results: Facebook impacts on suicidal behaviours in different aspects. Announcing suicides through sharing notes or personal information may lead to the prediction of suicide but be harmful to the online audience. Live-streaming videos of suicide is another aspect that questions Facebook's ability to monitor shared contents that can negatively affect the audience. A positive impact is helping bereaved families to share feelings and seek support online, commemorating the lost person by sharing their photos. Moreover, it can provide real-world details of everyday user behaviours, which help predict suicide risk, primarily through novel machine-learning techniques, and provide early warning and valuable help to prevent it. It can also provide a timeline of the user's activities and state of mind before suicide. Conclusions: Social media can detect suicidal tendencies, support those seeking help, comfort family and friends with their grief, and provide insights via timelining the users' activities leading to their suicide. One of the limitations was the lack of quantitative studies evaluating preventative efforts on Facebook. The creators' commitment and the users' social responsibility will be required to create a mentally healthy Facebook environment.

AB  - Background: This meta-analysis summarized longitudinal findings pertaining to exhaustion's predictors. In so doing, our aim was ultimately to identify target factors for the prevention of burnout. Methods: We searched for studies that (a) examined predictors of exhaustion longitudinally and (b) reported correlation coefficients as an effect estimate. We conducted our literature search in three databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase. We focused on studies published between January 1990 and November 2020. Predictors were grouped into families, subfamilies, and subgroups. A meta-analysis of z-transformed correlation coefficients (rho) was performed. The results were scrutinized in relation to studies' follow-up length. Results: We included 65 studies assessing 242 predictors of different types captured across different occupations. Our findings highlighted mostly weak associations (rho < 0.30). For six predictors-Job control, Job resources, Interactions at work, Communication and leadership, Job attitudes, and Work-family interface-longer length of follow-up involved weaker associations with exhaustion. The quality of the evidence available was generally low. Conclusions: The evidence available does not point to clear target factors for preventing burnout. The decrease in associations as the follow-up length increases may suggest a relatively short latency period, followed by recovery. Higher-quality cohorts should be conducted to better understand the etiology and course of burnout.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has strained hospitals and healthcare workers engaged in combating the virus with limited knowledge and resources. Intensive care unit (ICU) nurses are among the healthcare workers most affected by the pandemic and are at risk for developing burnout syndrome. Objective: The present study aims to explore burnout symptoms prevalence among ICU nurses and to identify the individual, organizational, and contextual risk, and protective factors of burnout in ICU nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A scoping review was conducted by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Only papers with empirical data and referred to ICU nurses were included. A total of 350 initial results were yielded, and 40 full texts were screened. Twelve papers constituted the final sample in the analysis. Results: High levels of symptoms of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment) were registered among ICU nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased workload, lack of equipment, social stigma, and fear of contagion emerged as key risk factors. Social support from leaders and colleagues, professional recognition, use of personal protective tools, and witnessing patients' successful recovery emerged as major protective factors. Conclusions: The results may inform the development of timely actions to counter burnout in ICU nurses during this COVID-19 pandemic and in a post-COVID-19 scenario.

AB  - Altered emotion dynamics and emotion regulation (ER) have been indicated in theoretical descriptions of abnormal emotional functioning, which contributes to the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa (AN). Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has recently become popular in research on eating disorders. It is a source of new insights into the psychopathology of AN as it enables intensive long-term tracking of everyday experiences and behaviours of individuals through repeated self-reports. The following systematic review aims to synthesize research on the use of EMA when evaluating emotion dynamics and ER in AN. Specific studies were identified with the use of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases. A supplemental search was performed in reference lists of the relevant publications. As a result, 27 publications were identified and included in the systematic review. The findings from the reviewed studies point to various disturbed components of emotion dynamics as well as to unique associations of maladaptive ER strategies with specific abnormalities in emotion dynamics in AN. Limitations of the studies were discussed as well. An outlook for further research in the field was provided in the last section of the paper.

AB  - In 2020, as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world enacted a wide variety of regulations and laws to contain the incidence of infection. One of these measures was the relocation of work to the home office. The objective of this review was to analyze the influence of the home office in correlation with regulations on sedentary and activity behavior. A search was conducted on various electronic databases from November 2019 to January 2022, using the search terms physical activity (PA), COVID-19, and working from home. The primary outcomes were changes in PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Secondary outcomes included pain, mood, and parenting stress. The risk of bias was assessed using the (NHLBI) Quality Assessment Tool. For the review, 21 articles met the inclusion criteria (total n = 1268). There was a significant increase in SB (+16%) and a decrease in PA (-17%), Light PA (-26%), and moderate to vigorous PA (-20%). There was also an increase in pain and parenting stress and a decrease in well-being. Due to our significant results, programs that promote movement should be created. Future studies should explore how an increase of PA and a reduction of SB in the home office could be achieved.

AB  - Background: People with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and their carers/families continue to experience structural stigma when accessing health services. Structural stigma involves societal-level conditions, cultural norms, and organizational policies that inhibit the opportunities, resources, and wellbeing of people living with attributes that are the object of stigma. BPD is a serious mental illness characterized by pervasive psychosocial dysfunction including, problems regulating emotions and suicidality. This scoping review aimed to identify, map, and explore the international literature on structural stigma associated with BPD and its impact on healthcare for consumers with BPD, their carers/families, and health practitioners.
   Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature encompassed MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and JBI Evidence-Based databases (from inception to February 28th 2022). The search strategy also included grey literature searches and handsearching the references of included studies. Eligibility criteria included citations relevant to structural stigma associated with BPD and health and crisis care services. Quality appraisal of included citations were completed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool 2018 version (MMAT v.18), the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses Tool, and the AGREE II: advancing guideline development, reporting, and evaluation in health care tool. Thematic Analysis was used to inform data extraction, analysis, interpretation, and synthesis of the data.
   Results: A total of 57 citations were included in the review comprising empirical peer-reviewed articles (n = 55), and reports (n = 2). Studies included quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods, and systematic review designs. Review findings identified several extant macro- and micro-level structural mechanisms, challenges, and barriers contributing to BPD-related stigma in health systems. These structural factors have a substantial impact on health service access and care for BPD. Key themes that emerged from the data comprised: structural stigma and the BPD diagnosis and BPD-related stigma surrounding health and crisis care services.
   Conclusion: Narrative synthesis of the findings provide evidence about the impact of structural stigma on healthcare for BPD. It is anticipated that results of this review will inform future research, policy, and practice to address BPD-related stigma in health systems, as well as approaches for improving the delivery of responsive health services and care for consumers with BPD and their carers/families.

AB  - Normative transitions between educational settings can be important life events for young people, having the potential to influence mental health trajectories across the life course. Interventions to target transitions have been used to support children and young people as they transition between school settings, but there is limited synthesis of their effects. Seven databases were searched to identify studies of universal interventions focused on supporting mental health and wellbeing across three main types of educational transition: preschool to elementary school; school to school (including elementary to middle; middle to high and other combinations depending on country); and high school to post-compulsory education. Effect directions for behavioural, psychological/emotional and social measures of mental health were extracted for each study and synthesized using effect direction plot methodology. Searches identified 6494 records for screening. This resulted in 34 papers being included in the review, consisting of 24 different interventions. Social outcomes appeared more amenable to intervention than behavioural outcomes, with mixed findings for psychological measures of mental health. Intervention characteristics shifted based on the age of young person involved in the transition, with greater focus on parenting and school environment during the early transitions, and more focus on social support for the transition to post-compulsory education. A broad range of interventions were identified for supporting mental health and wellbeing across the three types of educational transition with mixed impact and diverse methodologies. More research is needed to identify transferable intervention mechanisms that may hold across different contexts and settings. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020176336.

AB  - In the face of a possible threat, a range of physiological (e.g., increased heart rate) and behavioral (e.g., avoidance or escape) responses are recruited. Here, we will focus on avoidance, in its persistent form one of the core symptoms of anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The initial goal of fear and avoidance responses is to increase survival, but if they become persistent or overgeneralize, they can disrupt normal daily functioning, and ultimately even result in anxiety-related disorders. Relatedly, acute stress responses promote adaptation and survival, while chronic stress has been found to aggravate pathophysiology. Thus, stress might trigger the transition from adaptive to maladaptive responses, e.g., from goal-directed to persistent avoidance. Animal models are prime tools to unravel if and how stress influences avoidance. This is typically done by performing stress inductions prior to the assessment of (passive or active) avoidance behavior. Despite its clinical relevance, the current literature on this topic is fragmented, and an overall conclusion is lacking. In this Review, we first recapitulate the state of the art regarding stress and active as well as passive avoidance procedures. We then summarize the behavioral effects of acute and chronic stress on active and passive avoidance, and discuss the main neurobiological findings of the field. Finally, we highlight possible reasons for the largely contradictory findings in the literature and we propose strategies to further unravel the effect of stress on avoidance behavior. A deeper understanding of this currently unresolved matter may provide further insights in the etiology and treatment of anxiety-related disorders.

AB  - The purpose of this scoping review is to investigate the value of creative arts therapies in healthy older adults. This article aims to shed light on current knowledge concerning the effectiveness of art therapies (ATs) for the prevention of common age-related conditions using the definition of art therapy provided by the American Art Therapy Association (AATA), as well as Cohen's conceptual framework for the psychological conceptualization of the relationship between the arts and health in later life. The objective is to carefully capture subthreshold situations of distress, which are often not taken into account and primarily involve psychological aspects that are crucial in the multidimensional perspective of healthy aging. Twelve articles were selected and examined following an initial electronic search on 3 databases. A thematic analysis of the results identified four major themes: improving cognitive performance and proprioception; enhancing self-identity and meaningful life; reducing feelings of loneliness and depressive symptoms; and the importance of socialization. All these aspects constitute the basis for preventing psychological distress and enhancing mental well-being for healthy aging.

AB  - Mental disorders during pregnancy are common, with long-lasting negative effects on mother and child. Treatment of these women is challenging, because of the high incidence of additional psychosocial problems and barriers on population and healthcare level. Collaborative care, collaboration between mental health and obstetric care professionals, may help to overcome these problems. The aim of this review is to review antenatal mental health interventions and analyse the impact of collaborative care. Two independent reviewers searched for RCT's in PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO. Trials studying the effect of psychological or pharmacological interventions on the mental health of pregnant women with psychiatric symptoms (and psychosocial problems) were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. Each study was scored on collaborative care criteria: multi-professional approach to patient care, structured management plan, scheduled patient follow-ups and enhanced interprofessional communication. Thirty-five studies were included. Most trials studied the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy on antenatal depression. Almost all interventions met at least one collaborative care criteria. Interventions were mostly provided by multiple professionals, but interprofessional communication rarely took place. Interventions that met more criteria did not more often show a positive effect on maternal mental health. There is lack of research on antenatal psychiatric disorders other than depressive and on long-term treatment outcomes. Collaborative care is partly implemented in most current interventions, but more trials (including interprofessional communication) are needed to be conclusive whether collaborative care is a key component in antenatal mental healthcare.

AB  - Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease with underlying genetic, inflammatory and immunological background, which is a great medical problem, currently regarded as a systemic condition. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterized by a progressive loss of nervous tissue, which affects elderly people more frequently; therefore, it is suspected that, due to society's aging, morbidity is going to increase. We performed a thorough review in order to investigate for the first time whether psoriasis may predispose to different particular neurodegenerative diseases-Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PubMed search resulted in the retrieval of 833 records, of which 77 eligible were included in the review. Our thorough analysis revealed there are some potential links between psoriasis and NDs (inflammation, oxidative stress, genetics, cardiometabolic disorders), but there is no strong evidence that psoriasis may predispose to NDs. Based on the evidence, it seems that the risk of PD in psoriatics is not increased, and the evidence for increased risk of AD slightly prevails the data that state the opposite. ALS risk does not seem to be increased in psoriatics. The paucity of original studies does not allow for the formulation of definitive conclusions but encourages to perform further investigations.

AB  - Poststroke depression significantly affects health and quality of life of stroke patients. This study evaluates the role of social support in influencing poststroke depression. The literature search was conducted in electronic databases and study selection was based on precise eligibility criteria. The prevalence rates reported by individual studies were pooled. A meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD) in social support between depressed and non-depressed stroke patients was performed. The odds ratios and correlation coefficients showing the relationship between social support and depression were pooled to achieve overall estimates. Twenty-five studies (9431 patients) were included. The prevalence of depression was 36% [95% confidence interval (CI): 28, 45]. Patients with poststroke depression had significantly lower social support in comparison with patients with no or lower levels of depression [SMD in social support scores -0.338 (95% CI: -0.589, -0.087); p = 0.008]. The odds of depression were lower in patients receiving higher levels of social support [OR 0.82 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.95)] but were higher in patients who were receiving weaker social support [OR 5.22 (95% CI: -0.87, 11.31)]. A meta-analysis of correlation coefficients found a significantly inverse correlation between social support and poststroke depression [r -0.336 (95% CI: -0.414, -0.254)]. Poststroke depression has a significant independent inverse association with social support.

AB  - Autistic individuals are at elevated risk for difficulties with emotion regulation (ER) that emerge early in life and are associated with a range of internalizing and externalizing disorders. Existing interventions that support ER have focused on school-age autistic children and adolescents as well as adults. Proactive approaches to improving ER in early childhood are thus needed, as is understanding the approaches by which ER skills can be feasibly supported in this young population. This review summarizes how ER has been measured within parent-mediated interventions for children at or under the age of 6 years and the extent to which ER is measured concurrently with or distinctly from observable behaviors that have been referenced in existing literature as externalizing or challenging behavior. Using PsycInfo, EBSCOhost, and PubMed databases, we searched for peer-reviewed journal articles published through August 2021, that focused on the use of parent-mediated interventions targeting ER and/or challenging behavior. The systematic search resulted in 4,738 publications; following multi-stage screening, the search yielded 20 studies. Eighteen of 20 studies were designed to target challenging behavior using manualized curricula or behavior analytic methodologies and assessed child outcomes through validated caregiver rating scales and/or direct behavioral observation. One study measured changes in ER as secondary to the social communication skills that were targeted in the intervention. Only one study specifically supported ER skill development and measured changes in ER as the primary intervention outcome. Findings highlight the need for better assessment of ER outcomes within the context of parent-mediated interventions for toddlers and young autistic children.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the impact of persistent precarious employment (lasting 12+ months) on the health of working age adults, compared with more stable employment. Persistent precarity reflects a shift towards less secure forms of employment and may be particularly important for health. Methods Nine databases were systematically searched to identify quantitative studies that assessed the relationship between persistent precarious employment and health outcomes. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using an adaptation of the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. Narrative synthesis and random effects meta-analysis were conducted. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results Of 12 940 records screened, 50 studies met the inclusion criteria and 29 were included in meta-analyses. RoB was generally high (n=18). The most reported outcome domain was mental health; with evidence also reported relating to general health, physical health,and health behaviours. Of GRADE assessed outcomes, persistent precarious employment was associated with increased risk of poor self-rated health (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.14, I-2=80%) and mental health symptoms (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.70, I-2=65%). The association with all-cause mortality was imprecisely estimated (OR 1.10, 5% CI 0.91 to 1.33, I-2=73%). There was very low GRADE certainty across all outcomes. Conclusions Persistent precarious employment is associated with poorer health, particularly for outcomes with short time lags, though associations are small and causality is highly uncertain. Further research using more robust methods is needed but given potential health harms of persistent precarious employment, exploration of precautionary labour regulations and employment policies is warranted.

AB  - The presence of atypical cytoskeletal dynamics, structures, and associated morphologies is a common theme uniting numerous diseases and developmental disorders. In particular, cytoskeletal dysregulation is a common cellular feature of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. While the numerous activators and inhibitors of dysregulation present complexities for characterizing these elements as byproducts or initiators of the disease state, it is increasingly clear that a better understanding of these anomalies is critical for advancing the state of knowledge and plan of therapeutic attack. In this review, we focus on the hallmarks of cytoskeletal dysregulation that are associated with cofilin-linked actin regulation, with a particular emphasis on the formation, monitoring, and inhibition of cofilin-actin rods. We also review actin-associated proteins other than cofilin with links to cytoskeleton-associated neurodegenerative processes, recognizing that cofilin-actin rods comprise one strand of a vast web of interactions that occur as a result of cytoskeletal dysregulation. Our aim is to present a current perspective on cytoskeletal dysregulation, connecting recent developments in our understanding with emerging strategies for biosensing and biomimicry that will help shape future directions of the field.

AB  - Aim To appraise the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine (LAM) in the treatment of pediatric mood disorders (PMD) (i.e., Major Depressive disorder [MDD], bipolar disorder [BD]). Methods Major databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), open-label trials, and observational studies reporting on pediatric (age < 18 years) patients treated with LAM for mood disorders. Results A total of 3061 abstracts were screened and seven articles were selected for inclusion. Seven studies (319 BD and 43 MDD patients), including one RCT (n = 173), three prospective (n = 105), and three retrospective (n = 84) studies, met the study criteria with a study duration range from 8 to 60.9 weeks. The mean age of this pooled data is 14.6 +/- 2.0 years. LAM daily dosage varied from 12.5 to 391.3 mg/day among the studies. In an important finding, the RCT reported favorable outcomes with LAM (HR = 0.46; p = 0.02) in 13- to 17-year-old age group as compared with 10- to 12-year-old age group (HR = 0.93; p = 0.88). In addition, time to occurrence of a bipolar event trended toward favoring LAM over placebo. All the studies identified LAM as an effective and safe drug in PMDs especially, BDs. Overall, LAM was well tolerated with no major significant side effects and no cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Conclusions Most studies suggested that LAM was safe and effective in pediatric patients with mood disorders. However, the data regarding the therapeutic range for LAM are lacking. Based on the data, there is inconsistent evidence to make conclusive recommendations on therapeutic LAM dosage for mood improvement in the pediatric population. Further studies including larger sample sizes are required to address this relevant clinical question.

AB  - Given the bond between emotion and cognition underlying the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, positive and negative emotions have critical roles in cognitive skills. The aim of this review was to probe into the triarchic relationship between L2 learners' cognition, emotion, and language performance, reflected in the bond between self-efficacy, foreign language anxiety, and speaking skill, in light of the main emerging theories in the field of SLA underpinning this relationship. Moreover, the theoretical foundations, such as learners' cognitive performances, Bandura's self-efficacy theory, control-value theory, and positive psychology theory, were explicated in order to justify the relationship between self-efficacy and oral communication skill. Furthermore, the underlying theories such as attentional control theory, complex dynamic system theory, affective filter theory, and cultural schema theory, which relate foreign language anxiety to speaking skill were scrutinized in this review. The review also expounded on the implications and future directions for EFL teachers, material designers, teacher educators, educational policy-makers, and advisors. The ideas can improve their awareness of learner self-efficacy, foreign language anxiety, and oral communication skill in educational contexts.

AB  - Purpose Ever since Leo Kanner first described autism in 1943, the research in this field has grown immensely. In 2021 alone, 5837 SCOPUS indexed documents were published with a title that contained the words: "autism", "autistic", or "ASD". The purpose of this study was to examine the most common topics of autism research in 2021 and present a geographical contribution to this research. Methods We performed a content analysis of 1102 abstracts from the articles published in 11 Autism journals in 2021. The following journals, indexed by the SCOPUS database, were included: Autism, Autism Research, Molecular Autism, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities, Education and Training in Autism and Developmental Disabilities, Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, Advances in Autism, Autism and Developmental Language Impairments, and Autism in Adulthood. Results According to the analysis, the main research topics were: mental health, social communication, social skills, quality of life, parenting stress, ADHD, Covid-19, self-efficacy, special education, and theory of mind. In relation to geographic distribution, most studies came from the USA, followed by the UK, Australia, and Canada. Conclusion Research topics were aligned with the priorities set by stakeholders in autism, most notably persons with autism themselves and their family members. There is a big gap in research production between developed countries and developing countries.

AB  - Aims Lithium has long been believed to reduce the risk of suicide and suicidal behaviour in people with mood disorders. Previous meta-analyses appeared to support this belief, but excluded relevant data due to the difficulty of conducting meta-analysis of rare events. The current study is an updated systematic review and meta-analysis that includes all eligible data, and evaluates suicide, non-fatal suicidal behaviour (including suicidal ideation) and suicide attempts. Methods We searched PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase and some trial registers. We included all randomised trials comparing lithium and placebo or treatment as usual in mood disorders published after 2000, to ensure suicide was reliably reported. Trial quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Pooled data were analysed using Fisher's Exact test. In addition, meta-analysis was conducted using various methods, prioritizing the Exact method. All trials were included in the analysis of suicide initially, regardless of whether they reported on suicide or not. We conducted a sensitivity analysis with trials that specifically reported on suicides and one that included trials published before 2000. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed involving suicide prevention trials, trials excluding people already taking lithium, trials involving people with bipolar disorder exclusively and those involving people with mixed affective diagnoses. Non-fatal suicidal behaviour and suicide attempts were analysed using the same methods, but only trials that reported these outcomes were included. PROSPERO registration: CRD42021265809. Results Twelve eligible studies involving 2578 participants were included. The pooled suicide rate was 0.2% for people randomised to lithium and 0.4% with placebo or treatment as usual, which was not a statistically significant difference; odds ratio (OR) = 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.03-2.49), p = 0.45. Meta-analysis using the Exact method produced an OR of 0.42 (95% confidence interval 0.01-4.5). The result was not substantially different when restricted to 11 trials that explicitly reported suicides and remained statistically non-significant when including 15 trials published before 2000 (mostly in the 1970s). There were no significant differences in any subgroup analysis. There was no difference in rates of all non-fatal suicidal behaviour in seven trials that reported this outcome, or in five trials that reported suicide attempts specifically. Meta-analyses using other methods also revealed no statistically significant differences. Conclusions Evidence from randomised trials is inconclusive and does not support the idea that lithium prevents suicide or suicidal behaviour.

AB  - Since Stern first started his work in 1938, the field has recognized several empirically supported models of the etiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Two such models are the Tripartite Model of the Development of BPD and the Biosocial Development Model of BPD. The Tripartite Model of the Development of BPD suggests that it is a combination of a hyperbolic temperament, traumatic childhood experiences, and an event or series of events that trigger the onset of BPD. Whereas the Biosocial Development Model of BPD elaborates on the work of Linehan's Biosocial Theory. This model suggests a combination of an emotionally vulnerable temperament and an invalidating environment cause BPD. Over 70 years of research support these models. This article covers a detailed description of each of these models, the decades of research supporting these models, similarities, differences, treatment implications, the latest research, and future directions.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis study was to estimate the pooled prevalence of burnout among health care workers (HCWs), who worked in health centers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Questionnaire. A comprehensive search based on specific terms was performed through the online studies of Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest, until January 2022. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tool. Data analysis was carried out through the random-effects model, and the heterogeneity was investigated by I-2 statistic using the software STATA Version 16. In total, seven articles with 5,022 participants were included in the final analysis. Four studies with 4,419 participants reported the prevalence of burnout as percent in moderate and severe types for all three components of burnout syndrome. Our results showed that the 45% of pooled moderate and 37% of severe levels of emotional exhaustion, 49% of pooled moderate and 18% of severe levels of depersonalization, 38% of pooled moderate and 51% of pooled severe levels of reduced personal accomplishment. Whereas six studies with 4,838 sample size reported the mean prevalence of MBI-based burnout syndrome and the mean pooled prevalence of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and accomplishment was 21.57, 7.47, and 33.48, respectively. Based on our findings, HCWs who worked in health centers during COVID-19 outbreak, experienced significant burnout. Therefore, it is necessary to design and implement programs to deal with burnout among this populations.
   Public Significance Statement What is the public health significance of this article? This study suggests that health care workers (HCWs) who worked in health centers during the outbreak of COVID-19 and were in direct and/or indirect contact with COVID-19 patients experienced significant burnout. Burnout among HCWs is an important issue because it not only has an impact on their quality of life, but it can potentially affect the quality of care provided, increase medical errors, reduce patient safety, and even the influence on the mental health of their families and society. Therefore, it is necessary to design and implement programs to deal with burnout among this populations.

AB  - The association between income inequality in a society and the poor health status of its people has attracted the attention of researchers from multiple disciplines. Based on the ISI Web of Science database, bibliometric methods were used to analyze 546 articles related to income inequality research in health field published between 1997 and 2021. We found that the USA contributed most articles, the Harvard Univ was the most influential institution, Social Science & Medicine was the most influential journal, and Kawachi I was the most influential author; the main hotspots included the income inequality, income, health inequality, mortality, socioeconomic factors, concentration index, social capital, self-rated health, income distribution, infant mortality, and population health in 1997-2021; the cardiovascular disease risk factor, social capital income inequality, individual mortality risk, income-related inequalities, understanding income inequalities, income inequality household income, and state income inequality had been the hot research topics in 1997-2003; the self-assessed health, achieving equity, income-related inequalities, oral health, mental health, European panel, occupational class, and cardiovascular diseases had been the hot research topics in 2004-2011; the adolescent emotional problem, South Africa, avoidable mortality, rising inequalities, results from world health survey, working-age adult, spatial aggregation change, prospective study, and mental health-empirical evidence had been the hot research topics in 2012-2021; there were 11 articles with strong transformation potential during 2012-2021. The research results of this paper are helpful to the scientific understanding of the current status of income inequality research in health field.

AB  - Objective: Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders in children. The caregivers of these children bear heavy burden of care in the process of taking care of them. The objective of this metasynthesis was to explore the experiences and needs of caregivers of children with epilepsy. Methods and data sources: Eight databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP database, and CBM) were searched for qualitative studies from each database's inception to 31 June 2021. Studies were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. Qualitative data were extracted, summarized, and meta-synthesized. Results: 13 studies were included, covering the data of 316 participants. 36 research results were extracted from these studies, which were combined into 11 categories, and finally formed 4 themes: (a) heavy burden of care; (b) emotional experience; (c) coping strategies; (d) care needs. Conclusion: Caregivers beared a heavy burden of care and psychological burden. Despite the adoption of different coping strategies, their emotional distress was still very serious. Caregivers had unmet care needs. In order to improve caregivers' care capacity, the society and healthcare workers need to provide them with information support, psychological support, and take measures to create a friendly medical and living environment for them.ImpactUnderstanding the experiences of caregivers of children with epilepsy will inform future research and practice. Healthcare workers could develop interventions to reduce caregiver burden and improve the level of caregivers' mental health. On the other hand, effective programs should be designed to improve caregivers' knowledge of the disease and enhance their ability to care. Society needs to take steps to improve the medical environment and the social stigma that is not friendly to epilepsy.

AB  - Background Depression due to stigma resulting from their sexual identity, isolation, social exclusion, and insufficient access to care and counseling services has become a health problem among men who have sex with men (MSM). Objectives This study aimed to determine the global prevalence of depression among MSM as a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods This study was a systematic review and meta-analysis performed in five steps of search strategy, screening and selecting articles, data extraction, evaluation of the risk of bias, and meta-analysis. In this study, the determined keywords were searched in the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science from January 1913 to July 2021 to find the initial articles, from which data were extracted according to the set checklist in the data extraction stage. Finally, the studies were included in the present meta-analysis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, to be evaluated using the Newcastle Ottawa scale checklist. I Square and Q Cochrane were also used to assess the degree of heterogeneity. The analyses were performed using the random-effects model in STATA 16. Results The results showed the quality score of the majority of cross-sectional studies included in the meta-analysis (62 studies) was equal to six or seven (moderate), and five ones had a high-quality score. After combining these studies, the pooled prevalence of depression among MSM in the world was 35% (95% CI 31%-39%, I square; 98.95%, P-value < 0.001). Population subgroup analysis showed the pooled prevalence of depression among MSM living with HIV was 47% (95% CI 39%-55%, I square; 95.76%, P-value < 0.001). Continent subgroup analysis showed the highest pooled prevalence of depression among Asian MSM at 37% (95% CI 31%-43%, I square; 99.07%, P-value < 0.001). Also, in the subgroup analysis of the sampling method, the pooled prevalence in the studies which used the respondent-driven sampling method was equal to 34% (95% CI 25%-43%, I square; 99.32%, P-value < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis revealed the pooled prevalence of depression in studies included in the meta-analysis was near or around the pooled estimate. Conclusion The pooled prevalence of depression among MSM was almost three times higher than the general male population. Therefore, particular and therapeutic interventions such as screening, and harm reduction programs for mental disorders, especially depression, are suggested to be considered in service packages.

AB  - BackgroundPerimenopausal depression (PMD) is characterized by affective symptoms as well as menopause-specific somatic complaints and has attracted increasing attention over the past few decades. Using a bibliometric tool, this study aims to evaluate the origin, current hotspots, and research trends on PMD. MethodsArticles with research on PMD were retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). We used the bibliometric method to analyze publication years, journals, countries, institutions, authors, research hotspots, and trends. We plotted the reference co-citation network and used keywords to analyze the research hotspots and trends. ResultsA total of 209 publications related to PMD were identified from WoSCC on May 8, 2022. The number of publications concerning PMD every year shows an upward trend. Further analysis indicated that 209 articles were contributed by 45 countries, 288 institutions, and 501 authors. The United States contributed the most significant number of publications, followed by China. Harvard University is the core institution of PMD research, and Cohen's work has had an important impact on another research. The occurrence and pathological mechanisms of depression during the menopausal transition from the knowledge base of PMD. All of them belong to the category of gynecology and psychosis, which reflects the focus of the research topics. Major depression, postmenopausal women, symptoms like hot flashes, and prevalence and risk factors are research hotspots in the PMD field. The frontiers in PMD field that will impact future research are anxiety, meta-analysis, association, and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). ConclusionThese findings provide us with the core countries, institutions, and authors in PMD research and point out the direction of attention in this field. The current research focuses on depression, postmenopausal women, hot flashes, and other symptoms, as well as the prevalence and risk factors. The frontiers will be anxiety, meta-analysis, related factors, and depression assessment in future research.

AB  - Objective: Guidelines for the prescription of antidepressants for Depressive Disorders (DD) have been in place for a long time. However, there is a lack of systematic information on the prescribing behavior of antidepressants in evidence-based clinical practice in psychopharmacotherapy of depressive disorders. This may suggest a lack of implementation of clinical guidelines by clinicians. Existing literature mainly focuses on specific issues or medications. To provide general information on the prescribing behavior of antidepressants for depressive disorders, a systematic review of available studies since 2013 was conducted.
   Methods and materials: To ensure a structured and systematic approach for the literature search and subsequent review process, the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Majormedical and health and psychological databases were used for the literature search. These included Ebsco Host, OVID, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science. The online application "Covidence" was employed to manage the titles collected and the full articles retrieved from the initial literature search. Upon finalizing the list of selected studies, data extraction was then conducted using a build-in function of the Covidence platform with the required information pre-set on a template for data extraction. The extracted information was tabulated and summarized in a table.
   Results: Forty-one studies were identified after an extensive search of the literature following the PRISMA guidelines. Of these, 37 quantitative studies providing useful information were systematically reviewed and information extracted. There was a high level of heterogeneity among these studies with different foci or characteristics. Most studies were conducted in or utilized data obtained from hospital and primary healthcare settings. SSRIs were the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant in the past decade, particularly among younger patients. Among these studies, antidepressants were mainly prescribed by psychiatrists with some by other physicians and general practitioners. This might reflect differences in legislation regarding professional requirements for prescribers or clinical practices.
   Conclusions: A few themes that would be considered important in terms of the effect of prescription behavior on depression, specifically children/adolescents, special target populations, and off-label prescription. The results highlighted the need for more studies on a community-based approach and the role of GPs in the treatment of DD.

AB  - Background: PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD) had a great impact on health care workers during the COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19). Better knowledge of the prevalence of PTSD and its risk factors is a major public health problem. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence and important risk factors of PTSD among medical staff during the COVID-19. Methods: The databases were searched for studies published during the COVID-19, and a PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis) compliant systematic review (PROSPERO-CRD 42021278970) was carried out to identify articles from multiple databases reporting the prevalence of PTSD outcomes among medical staff. Proportion random effect analysis, I-2 statistic, quality assessment, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis were carried out. Results: A total of 28 cross-sectional studies and the PTSD results of doctors and nurses were summarized from 14 and 27 studies: the prevalences were 31% (95% CI [confidence interval, CI]: 21%-40%) and 38% (95% CI: 30%-45%) in doctors and nurses, respectively. The results also showed seven risks (p < 0.05): long working hours, isolation wards, COVID-19 symptoms, nurses, women, fear of infection, and pre-existing mental illness. Two factors were of borderline significance: higher professional titles and married. Conclusion: Health care workers have a higher prevalence of PTSD during COVID-19. Health departments should provide targeted preventive measures for medical staff away from PTSD. (c) 2022 Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a common atypical parkinsonism, characterized by a varying combination of autonomic, cerebellar, and pyramidal systems. It has been noticed that the patients with MSA can be accompanied by some neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular depression. However, there is limited understanding of MSA-related depression. To bridge existing gaps, we summarized research progress on this topic and provided a new perspective regarding pathological, clinical, and imaging aspects. Firstly, we synthesized corresponding studies in order to investigate the relationship between depression and MSA from a pathological perspective. And then, from a clinical perspective, we focused on the prevalence of depression in MS patients and the comparison with other populations. Furthermore, the associations between depression and some clinical characteristics, such as life quality and gender, have been reported. The available neuroimaging studies were too sparse to draw conclusions about the radiological aspect of depression in MSA patients but we still described them in the presence of paper. Finally, we discussed some limitations and shortcomings existing in the included studies, which call for more high-quality basic research and clinical research in this field.

AB  - Introduction Emotional regulation (ER) is a core variable involved in the onset and maintenance of mental health disorders; therefore, interventions targeting ER in adolescence represent a promising preventive action. The current systematic review provides a synthesis of the evidence on school-based interventions on ER in adolescent students. Methods Six electronic databases (Medline, Psychology Database, Embase, Scopus, Psychinfo, and Web of Science) were searched. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies. Results A total of 36 studies were identified. The interventions were based on different theoretic frameworks and focused on different components of ER. There were universal interventions that addressed the entire class, as well as interventions for a selected population of at-risk students. Only one-third of the studies were based on manualized programs. Small to moderate effect sizes were found for mental health and ER skills. Only a few studies assessed risky behaviors, and these studies showed a reduction with moderate to large effect size. Studies conducted on high-risk populations showed medium-high effect sizes on ER skills. In contrast, studies conducted on unselected samples of students showed greater variability in the outcome estimates. Acceptability analysis and attendance rates suggested that the interventions were well received by students. The lack of follow-up assessments and the absence of sample-size calculation were the most frequent methodological weaknesses. Conclusions The content of the present review could be useful for professionals involved in the planning of school psychological services. Overall, the findings of the current review support the applicability and beneficial effect of school-based intervention for adolescents. Moreover, the results clearly point out the utility of a multitiered model to structure coordinated and integrated preventive interventions and to optimize resources.

AB  - Introduction The impact of psychiatric medications and their enhancing or impairing effects on physical performance remains inconclusive. Therefore, with this systematic review we provide a comprehensive overview of frequently used psychotropic drugs and their effects on physical performance for the purpose of providing empirical information and deriving prescription and therapy recommendations for clinical practice.Methods We systematically searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases and extracted human studies investigating the effect of psychotropic drugs on parameters associated with the level of physical performance, such as exercise time, oxygen consumption, heart rate, muscle contraction or blood lactate concentration in physically healthy participants. 36 studies - comprising a broad range of psychotropic agents, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedatives, and stimulants - were selected for final analyses.Results Most studies (N = 32) were randomized controlled trials (RCT) with a double-blind crossover design. Antidepressants (N = 21) were the most frequently studied drug class, with contradictory results e.g., performance enhancement in warm environment but not in temperate conditions for bupropion or inconsistent findings between studies for other antidepressants. Antipsychotics (N = 3) mainly showed impairing effects on physical performance, while stimulants (N = 4) were often performance-enhancing. Sedatives (N = 9) may cause a hangover effect.Conclusion The examined studies with heterogeneous design showed different effects of psychiatric medications on physical performance. Antipsychotics seemed to be performance impairing, while the findings for antidepressants and sedatives were more inconsistent. Stimulants were the only group with consistent performance-enhancing effects. However, most studies were conducted with a small sample size (N < 10), mostly in well-trained subjects rather than in patients with psychiatric disorders, and most studies used single-dose designs. These issues impede the formulation of generalized conclusions for treatment regimes and should therefore be considered in further longitudinal studies for clinically reliable statements. Nevertheless, answering our research question is quite relevant for clinical practice and therapeutic prescription and should be further investigated especially considering the high drop-out rates in drug treatment.

AB  - Purpose: The unique constraints to everyday life brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have been suggested to negatively impact those with pre-existing mental health issues such as eating disorders. While individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating behaviors likely represent a vulnerable group to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the pandemic is yet to be fully established. Methods: We systematically examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors. We searched electronic databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE for literature published until October 2021. Eligible studies were required to report on individuals with or without a diagnosed eating disorder or disordered eating behaviors who were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Seventy-two studies met eligibility criteria with the majority reporting an increase in eating disorder or disordered eating behaviors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it appears children and adolescents and individuals with a diagnosed eating disorder may present vulnerable groups to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: This mixed systematic review provides a timely insight into COVID-19 eating disorder literature and will assist in understanding possible future long-term impacts of the pandemic on eating disorder behaviors. It appears that the role of stress in the development and maintenance of eating disorders may have been intensified to cope with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research is needed among understudied and minority groups and to examine the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors.

AB  - Salinity is a major environmental factor shaping the distribution and abundance of marine organisms. Climate change is predicted to alter salinity in many coastal regions due to sea level rise, evaporation, and changes in freshwater input. This exerts significant physiological stress on coastal invertebrates whose body fluid osmolality follows that of seawater ('osmoconformers'). In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of osmolytes (both organic and inorganic) utilized by osmoconforming marine invertebrates during a > 14-day acclimation to reduced salinity. Of the 2,389 studies screened, a total of 56 fulfilled the search criteria. Thirty-eight studies reported tissue osmolyte. Following acclimation to reduced salinity, tissue concentrations of six organic compounds and sodium were consistently reduced across phyla. This suggests that intracellular inorganic ions are not only utilized as a rapid response system during acute exposure to low salinity stress but also, in concert with reductions in organic osmolyte concentrations, during longer-term acclimation. Our systematic review demonstrates that only a few studies (n = 13) have quantified salinity-induced long-term changes in intracellular ion concentrations. In addition, no study has compiled a complete intracellular osmolyte budget. Alanine, betaine, glycine, and taurine are the major organic osmolytes that are universally employed across five phyla. The characterization of organic osmolytes was heavily weighted towards free amino acids (FAAs) and derivatives-neglecting methylamines and methylsulfonium compounds, which can be as important as FAAs in modulating intracellular osmolality. As a consequence, we suggest best-practice guidelines to streamline experimental designs and protocols in osmoregulation research in order to better understand the conserved mechanisms that define the limits of salinity acclimation in marine invertebrates. To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on osmolyte concentrations in osmoconformers acclimated to low salinity. It creates a valuable baseline for future research and reveals large research gaps. Our meta-analysis suggests that there are common osmolyte actors employed across phyla but no uniform concept since osmolyte pool composition and proportions were taxon-specific. In light of future salinity changes and their potential consequences, it becomes more important to understand salinity tolerance capacities and limits.

Hence, the current review aimed to examine the prevalence and associated factors of depression among cancer patients in Ethiopia. Method A computerized systematic literature search was made in MEDLINE, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Each database was searched from its start date to June 2020. More over we will also add scholars and gray literature consultations. All articles will be included if they were published in English, which evaluated the prevalence and associated factors of depression among cancer patients in Ethiopia. Pooled estimations with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated with DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model. Publication bias was evaluated by using inspection of funnel plots and statistical tests. Discussion Since we are using existing anonymized data, ethical approval is not required for this study. Our results can be used to guide clinical decisions about the most efficient way to prevent and treat depression among cancer patients. Systematic review registration Submitted to Prospero.

AB  - The estimated number of Substance Users (SU) globally has currently reached a very high number and is still increasing. This aspect necessitates appropriate interventions for prevention and specific treatments. The literature shows that digital treatments can be useful in the context of health services and substance abuse. This systematic review focuses mainly on research on the effectiveness of digital treatments for SU. Data sources included studies found on PsycINFO, PubMed, SCOPUS, and WebOfScience (WOS) database searches. The following keywords were used: TITLE (digital OR computer OR software OR tablet OR app OR videogame OR seriousgame OR virtualreality) AND ABSTRACT((mental AND health) AND (addiction OR dependence OR substance OR drug)). We focused on peer-reviewed articles published from 2010 through 2021 using PRISMA guidelines. A total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria (i.e., type of intervention, efficacy in terms of misuse of substances and scored outcomes from questionnaire or toxicology tests, study methodology). The studies included investigations of specific digital treatments for SU of various kinds of drugs. The interventions were administered using personal computers, smartphones, or, in a few cases, tablets. Most of the interventions focused on the cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) model and/or on the use strategies, tips, or feedback. A minority provided information or training programs. The current review shows that digital treatments and interventions are effective in reducing the frequency of use, augmenting abstinence, or reducing the gravity of dependence for most of the studies at post-treatment. However, due to the heterogeneity of the variables (i.e., substance type, digital tool used, and treatment administered), there was a reduced generalizability of the results. This review highlights the need to continue the research in this field, and above all, to create effective digital protocols.

AB  - Deficits in social cognition and function are characteristic of dementia, commonly accompanied by a loss of awareness of the presence or extent of these deficits. This lack of awareness can impair social relationships, increase patients' and carers' burden, and contribute to increased rates of institutionalization. Despite clinical importance, neural correlates of this complex phenomenon remain unclear. We conducted a systematic search of five electronic databases to identify functional and structural neuroimaging studies investigating the neural correlates of impaired awareness of social cognition and function in any dementia type. We rated study quality and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results of the eight studies that met the predefined eligibility criteria. Across these studies, deficits in awareness of impairments in social cognition and function were associated with structural or functional abnormalities in the frontal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and insula. Several identified regions overlap with established neural correlates of social cognition. More research is needed to understand awareness of social cognition and function and how this becomes impaired in dementia to improve neuroscientific understanding, aid the identification of this problematic symptom, and target interventions to reduce burden and improve care.

AB  - Insomnia is a common complaint affecting human performance in daily life activities. This study aimed to analyze the effects of Crocus sativus on insomnia. Methods: PRISMA guidelines were used according to the PICOS model. A systematic search of PubMed/Medline and the Cochrane Library was undertaken for literature until December 2021. A random effects model was used with I-2 statistic to assess heterogeneity and a GRADE assessment was used to assess the quality of the outcomes. Eight articles were included, involving 431 participants. Crocus sativus reduced insomnia severity (SMD: 0.53; 95%CI: -0.05 to 1.11; I-2 statistic = 59%; p = 0.08) and increased sleep quality (SMD 0.89, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.68; I-2 statistic = 90%; p = 0.03; 6 studies, 308 participants, very low-quality evidence) and duration (SMD: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.21 to 0.93; I-2 statistic = 40%; p = 0.002; 5 studies; 220 participants, moderate-quality evidence) compared with the placebos. Although there is limited evidence of a very low- to moderate-quality, Crocus sativus may benefit people with insomnia. This non-pharmacological intervention may reduce the chance of adults with insomnia taking sedative-hypnotic medication, thus reducing dependency and withdrawal symptoms.

To prevent the spread, strict containment measures and stay at home guidelines were issued by officials. Due to this, an unanticipated and rapid change has occurred in the daily routine and lifestyle of the people. Physical distancing and quarantine measures strongly impacted people's lives, their eating habits and everyday ablutions. A comprehensive search of recent literature related to nutrition and diet during the pandemic was undertaken using electronic databases like MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate. This review deals with the effects of COVID-19 on malnutrition, the foods that help in boosting the immune system, and on specific, vulnerable, age groups. Although there are various health concerns that has come up during the pandemic, through this review, we investigate some aspects related to nutrition as the recovery of every individual who was affected by COVID-19 was influenced by their nutritional intake.

AB  - Most people living with dementia in the early-to-middle stages live in the community or in their own homes and engagement in enjoyable activities is fundamental to maintaining quality of life and autonomy. Horticulture-based activities are beneficial for the health and well-being for people living with dementia ("PLWD") in residential care settings, yet evidence within community settings, where the majority live, has not been comprehensively synthesized. A mixed studies systematic review protocol was registered and a systematic search conducted to June 2022 across MEDLINE, COCHRANE, Web of Science, Embase, Psycnet, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases, using terms relating to dementia and horticulture. Original studies examining group or individual horticulture-based programs for community-dwelling PLWD were included. Forty-five articles were selected for full review, eight met inclusion criteria and were retained for data extraction. Evidence from three mixed methods, two quantitative, two qualitative, and one case study design, involving a total of 178 community dwelling PLWD, was narratively summarized. Findings revealed that involvement in horticulture-based activities led to positive impacts on engagement, social interactions, and mental and physical well-being in PLWD. No conclusive evidence was found from included studies for improvement in cognitive function. As most studies to date have concentrated on PLWD in long-term care settings, future research should evaluate the effect of these types of activities in a more rigorous intervention design in community settings.

AB  - (1) Background: The subject of athlete burnout is often discussed among sports psychologists. Interventions to reduce this phenomenon are still under investigation with follow-ups. Thus, the purpose of the current meta-analysis is to examine psychological interventions that was carried out to decrease or eliminate burnout syndrome in young athletes. (2) Methods: Scientific electronic databases were searched, and five published studies published between January and June 2022 that met the criteria were selected. The systematic review and meta-analyses followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The Cochrane collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias was used to assess the studies' quality. Metafor, a package of the R statistical program, was used to perform the analysis. (3) Results: Cognitive behavioral therapy- and mindfulness-based interventions effectively reduced most dimensions of burnout. Moreover, online interventions were significantly more beneficial in this reduction. (4) Conclusions: There should be more high-quality studies on the effectiveness of psychological interventions in reducing burnout, mainly because it leads to tremendous physical and psychological problems for athletes and their coaches; therefore, it requires particular interventions and prevention strategies.

AB  - Objective: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with psychiatric comorbidities. However, the association between IBD and suicidal ideation or suicide attempts has not been well established. This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between IBD and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide.
   Methods: We systematically searched five electronic databases - PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO - from their inception to January 28, 2022. Quality assessment, data synthesis, subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and publication bias assessment were performed on the included studies.
   Results: We identified 28 studies with 1,047,755 patients with IBD. The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation in patients with IBD was 17.3% (95% CI, 9.5%-25.2%). Patients with IBD were associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts (relative risk [RR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.08-1.79) and suicide deaths (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09-1.43) than the controls without IBD. Patients with Cmhn's disease subtypes, female IBD, pediatric-onset IBD, young adult IBD, and short-duration IBD had a particularly high risk for suicide.
   Conclusion: Patients with IBD had a high prevalence of suicidal ideation and a significantly higher likelihood of suicide attempts and suicide. Caring for patients with IBD, including their mental health needs, may require concerted efforts among gastroenterologists and other healthcare providers.

AB  - Background. Stigma associated with psychological problems is a major concern that negatively affects people living with different symptomatology, sometimes with serious consequences for their health. The principal purpose of this paper was to carry out an updated systematic review to explore the relationship between the stigma associated with mental health problems and the risk of suicide in the clinical population, as well as to study the variables involved in this relationship.
   Method. A search was carried out in the PsycInfo, Pubmed and Scopus databases, using keywords related to stigma, suicide, and limiting the studies to clinical samples. The search included articles in English and Spanish from January 2012 to December 2020.
   Results. A total of 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis. The results suggest that increased self-stigma toward mental health problems is associated with increased risk of suicide in clinical population. Also, variables involved in this relationship are suggested, such as depression, hopelessness, loss of vital sense, unemployment or decrease of support networks.
   Conclusion. The stigma associated with mental health problems could be a potential therapeutic target for reducing the risk of suicide in the clinical population. Exhaustive studies, with control groups random assignment, and more heterogeneous samples are necessary to know the phenomenon in greater depth.

AB  - Background: Health anxiety exists on a continuum ranging from the absence of health awareness to the obsessive fear of having a serious illness despite reassurance. Its pathological manifestation can be diagnosed as hypochondriacal or illness anxiety or somatic symptom disorder. Health anxiety is associated with psychological distress and adverse life events, among others, and leads to considerable economic burden. Compared to the majority population, migrants, and ethnic minorities often face major health inequalities. Several mental illnesses and psychosomatic complaints are more common among these groups. To date, potential ethnic and migration-related inequalities in health anxiety have not been clearly described. However, they are of high relevance for the provision of adequate health care of this diverse and potentially vulnerable group. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of health anxiety in migrants and ethnic minorities. Methods: A systematic literature search of PubMED, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PSYNDEX was conducted, covering all studies published until 1(st) of December 2021. Studies were selected if they employed validated measurement tools of health anxiety and examined migrants and/or ethnic minorities in comparison with the majority population. Meta-analytic methods were applied by using a random-effect model. The study quality was assessed with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP). Results: We identified 18 studies from 445 studies initially screened. Of these, 14 studies conducted in North America with a total number of 5,082 study participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect size indicated a higher risk of health anxiety in migrants and ethnic minorities compared to the majority population (OR 1.39, 95%-CI 1.01-1.92). The results proved not to be robust according to publication bias (adjusted OR 1.18, 95%-CI 0.83-1.69) and fail-safe N (2/3 < benchmark N = 75) and are limited due to heterogeneity (I-2 = 57%), small sample sizes and an overall low quality of included studies. Conclusion: To address the diversity of migrants and ethnic minorities, inter-sectional approaches across different countries are needed in research to shed further light on social inequalities in health anxiety linked to migration.

AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-based interventions are increasingly used in health, economic and educational systems. There are numerous studies demonstrating the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in the educational sectors (primary, secondary, and tertiary). This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the current state of research on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on the academic performance of students as measured by their grade point average (GPA). Methods: Literature search was conducted in Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycARTICLES, PubMed, and Google Scholar through March 2022. The inclusion criteria were: (1) the use of GPA as a measure of students' academic performance, (2) a sample that was subjected to a mindfulness-based intervention without medical indication, (3) the student status of the subjects. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model with the generic inverse variance method. Results: The search included a total of 759 studies, of which six randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. In these trials, significant group differences for GPA were found with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.16-1.62 yielding a significant overall effect of d = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.15-0.69) and a low magnitude of heterogeneity of I-2 = 37%. Discussion: In conclusion, the first results of this emerging research field seem promising. However, the exact mechanisms of action are still unclear.

AB  - Animal models of psychiatric disorders have been highly effective in advancing the field, identifying circuits related to pathophysiology, and identifying novel therapeutic targets. In this review, we show how animal models, particularly those based on development, have provided essential information regarding circuits involved in disorders, disease progression, and novel targets for intervention and potentially prevention. Nonetheless, in recent years there has been a pushback, largely driven by the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), to shift away from animal models and instead focus on circuits in normal subjects. This has been driven primarily from a lack of discovery of new effective therapeutic targets, and the failure of targets based on preclinical research to show efficacy. We discuss why animal models of complex disorders, when strongly cross-validated by clinical research, are essential to understand disease etiology as well as pathophysiology, and direct new drug discovery. Issues related to shortcomings in clinical trial design that confound translation from animal models as well as the failure to take patient pharmacological history into account are proposed to be a source of the failure of what are likely effective compounds from showing promise in clinical trials.

AB  - Individual variation in responses to commonly used tests of anxiety and spatial memory is often reported. While this variation is frequently considered to be 'noise', evidence suggests that it is, at least partially, related to consistent individual differences in behavioral responses (i.e., personality). The same tests used to assess anxiety are often used to profile personality traits, but personality differences are rarely considered when testing treatment differences in anxiety. Focusing on the rat literature, we describe fundamental principles involved in anxiety and spatial memory tests and we discuss how personality differences and housing conditions can in-fluence behavioral responses in these tests. We propose that an opportunity exists to increase stress resiliency in environmentally sensitive individuals by providing environmental enrichment. We conclude by discussing different approaches to incorporating personality measures into the design and analysis of future studies; given the potential that variation masks research outcomes, we suggest that a strategy which considers the individual and its housing can contribute to improving research reproducibility.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). It is mainly caused by trauma and reduces the quality of life of the affected individual. Ginsenosides are safe and effective traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), and their efficacy against SCI is being increasingly researched in many countries, especially in China and Korea. This systematic review evaluated the neuroprotective effects of ginsenosides in SCI and elucidated their properties. MethodsAll experimental information and summaries used in this review were acquired from peer-reviewed articles in the relevant fields. The PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched for relevant articles. Information on the manual classification and selection of ginsenosides that protect against SCI is included in this review. ResultsA literature survey yielded studies reporting several properties of ginsenosides, including anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, anti-oxidative stress, and inhibition of glial scar formation. ConclusionIn this review, we discuss the mechanisms of action of different ginsenosides that exert neuroprotective effects in SCI. These results suggest that after further verification in the future, ginsenosides may be used as adjunctive therapy to promote neurological recovery.

AB  - Objective: A better understanding of the genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its association with neuroplasticity could play a pivotal role in finding future therapeutic targets for novel drugs in major depressive disorder (MDD). Because there are conflicting results regarding the exact role of BDNF polymorphisms in MDD still, we set out to systematically review the current evidence regarding BDNF-related mutations in MDD. Methods: We conducted a keyword-guided search of the PubMed and Embase databases, using 'BDNF' or 'brain-derived neurotrophic factor' and 'major depressive disorder' and 'single-nucleotide polymorphism'. We included all publications in line with our exclusion and inclusion criteria that focused on BDNF-related mutations in the context of MDD. Results: Our search yielded 427 records in total. After screening and application of our eligibility criteria, 71 studies were included in final analysis. According to present overall scientific data, there is a possibly major pathophysiological role for BDNF neurotrophic systems to play in MDD. However, on the one hand, the synthesis of evidence makes clear that likely no overall association of BDNF-related mutations with MDD exists. On the other hand, it can be appreciated that solidifying evidence emerged on specific significant sub-conditions and stratifications based on various demographic, clinico-phenotypical and neuromorphological variables. Conclusions: Further research should elucidate specific BDNF-MDD associations based on demographic, clinico-phenotypical and neuromorphological variables. Furthermore, biomarker approaches, specifically combinatory ones, involving BDNF should be further investigated.

AB  - In recent years, development of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as other brain disorders, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia have been shown to be associated with changes in the gut microbiome. Several factors can induce an alteration in the bacterial composition of the host's gastrointestinal tract. Besides dietary changes and frequent use of antibiotics, the microbiome is also profoundly affected by aging. Levels of microbiota-derived metabolites are elevated in older individuals with age-associated diseases and cognitive defects compared to younger, healthy age groups. The identified metabolites with higher concentration in aged hosts, which include choline and trimethylamine, are known risk factors for age-related diseases. While the underlying mechanisms and pathways remain elusive for the most part, it has been shown, that these metabolites are able to trigger the innate immunity in the central nervous system by influencing development and activation status of brain-resident macrophages. The macrophages residing in the brain comprise parenchymal microglia and non-parenchymal macrophages located in the perivascular spaces, meninges, and the choroid plexus. In this review, we highlight the impact of age on the composition of the microbiome and microbiota-derived metabolites and their influence on age-associated diseases caused by dysfunctional brain-resident macrophages.

AB  - Objective To systematically evaluate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in reducing comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Methods Three electronic databases were searched for randomized, sham-controlled clinical trials evaluating rTMS for the treatment of OCD. Hedge's g was calculated as the effect size for anxiety/depression symptom severity (primary outcome) and OCD severity (secondary outcome). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the most promising target and whether a reduction in OCD severity moderates the change in anxiety or depression scores. Results Twenty studies (n = 688) were included in the meta-analysis. rTMS had small-medium effect size on OCD (Hedge's g = 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.20, 0.65]; P < 0.001), anxiety (Hedge's g = 0.3; 95% CI: [0.11, 0.48]; P = 0.001) and depression (Hedge's g = 0.24; 95% CI: [0.07, 0.40]; P = 0.003) symptoms. Subgroup analysis showed that protocols targeting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were effective for 3 outcome measures. The change in anxiety, but not depression severity, was moderated by a change in OCD symptom scores. However, the findings are uncertain as a majority of the studies had some concerns or a high risk of bias. Conclusions Active rTMS protocol targeting DLPFC is effective in reducing the comorbid anxiety/depression symptoms along with OCD severity. The antidepressant effect is not moderated by the anti-obsessive effect of rTMS. Abrege

The objective of this systematic review was to examine the current empirical literature on refugee mental health in Europe with a focus on children and families. A systematic search was conducted between January 2022 to June 2022 in PsychInfo, CINAHIL and PubMed. The search produced 2385 results and 62 articles met the selection criteria. Results showed that children had high rates of trauma exposure and were at higher risk of psychopathology than their host peers. Post-migration stressors impact mental health outcomes in adolescents and adults. However, most studies were self-report and cross-sectional and there were very few studies on refugee parenting or dyadic relationships.

AB  - The clinical presentation that emerges from the extensive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mental health literature suggests high correlations among many conventional psychiatric diagnoses. Arguments against the use of multiple comorbidities for a single patient have been published long before the pandemic. Concurrently, diagnostic recommendations for use of transdiagnostic considerations for improved treatment have been also published in recent years. In this review, we pose the question of whether a transdiagnostic mental health disease, including psychiatric and neuropsychiatric symptomology, has emerged since the onset of the pandemic. There are many attempts to identify a syndrome related to the pandemic, but none of the validated scales is able to capture the entire psychiatric and neuropsychiatric clinical presentation in infected and non-infected individuals. These scales also only marginally touch the issue of etiology and prevalence. We suggest a working hypothesis termed Complex Stress Reaction Syndrome (CSRS) representing a global psychiatric reaction to the pandemic situation in the general population (Type A) and a neuropsychiatric reaction in infected individuals (Type B) which relates to neurocognitive and psychiatric features which are part (excluding systemic and metabolic dysfunctions) of the syndrome termed in the literature as long COVID. We base our propositions on multidisciplinary scientific data regarding mental health during the global pandemic situation and the effects of viral infection reviewed from Google Scholar and PubMed between February 1, 2022 and March 10, 2022. Search inclusion criteria were "mental health ", "COVID-19 " and "Long COVID ", English language and human studies only. We suggest that this more comprehensive way of understanding COVID-19 complex mental health reactions may promote better prevention and treatment and serve to guide implementation of recommended administrative regulations that were recently published by the World Psychiatric Association. This review may serve as a call for an international investigation of our working hypothesis.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of music-based interventions on unilateral spatial neglect. Five databases were retrieved prior to May 5, 2022. A range of study designs were considered, including randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, cohorts, and case series/reports. Types of music-based interventions were not limited. Methodological quality of randomized trials were evaluated using the RoB 2 tool, and the RoBiNT scale was utilized to assess the quality of case studies. Two authors independently summarized main results for assessments. Search strategies identified 186 potentially relevant articles, and 10 articles were collected for in-depth analysis. Preliminary results showed that USN patients performed better in cancellation tests than bisection tests after music-based intervention. In summary, pleasant music listening may have a beneficial effect on the visual attention of USN patients, and it can be hypothesized that this is related to the positive mood and emotions of patients induced by music. Music with a dynamic auditory stimulus as a new music listening programme in USN rehabilitation is worthy of further investigation. Instrument playing intervention can be considered as a multisensory stimulation to ameliorate neglect performance via multiple mechanisms. However, current results only support the short-term positive effects of music-based interventions on USN.

AB  - Motivated behavior is integral to the survival of individuals, continuously directing actions toward rewards or away from punishments. The orchestration of motivated behavior depends on interactions among different brain circuits, primarily within the dopaminergic system, that subserve the analysis of factors such as the effort necessary for obtaining the reward and the desirability of the reward. Impairments in motivated behavior accompany a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, decreasing the patients' quality of life. Despite its importance, motivation is often overlooked as a parameter in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we review motivational impairments in rodent models of schizophrenia, depression, and Parkinson's disease, focusing on studies investigating effort-related behavior in operant conditioning tasks and on pharmacological interventions targeting the dopaminergic system. Similar motivational disturbances accompany these conditions, suggesting that treatments aimed at ameliorating motivation levels may be beneficial for various neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to review and synthesize the empirical evidence about the connection between healthcare facility design and the mental health of healthcare professionals by reviewing the relevant literature. Background: Mental exhaustion of healthcare professionals is becoming a critical issue in healthcare, especially during the pandemic. The physical design of healthcare facilities has significant potential to reduce and prevent the mental exhaustion of healthcare professionals by removing environmental stressors and providing restorative experiences. However, the built environment is not fully utilized as an intervention to support healthcare professionals. Methods: Relevant articles were identified from the Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science databases using a combination of search terms representing environmental design factors and health outcomes. Identified articles were reviewed by their titles, abstracts, and full texts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The search yielded 27 empirical articles investigating the relationships between environmental design factors and staff mental health outcomes, including stress, fatigue, job satisfaction, burnout, and well-being. Healthcare design aspects that were investigated in the identified articles include overall facility and perception (e.g., aesthetic appeal and impression, belonging to the surroundings, safety), specific spaces (e.g., patient area, staff workspace), intangible elements (e.g., exterior view, light, sound), and interior space and ergonomics (e.g., material finishes, furniture). Conclusions: Through the synthesis of the current literature regarding the relationships between healthcare facility design and the mental health of healthcare professionals, this study provides implications for supporting healthcare professionals through the design of the healthcare facility.

AB  - Purpose Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are more likely to have a poor health status because of being diagnosed with a range of physical and mental health conditions and experience disparities in health care. The purpose of this study is to find barriers to health care experienced by adults with ASD and find gaps in health care which health-care providers can work to fill. Design/methodology/approach This scoping review aimed to identify studies that report on disparities in health and health-care service provisions experienced by adults with ASD. The authors included articles that described health-care disparities for patients with ASD and were published in peer-reviewed journals between January 2010 and April 2022. The authors searched the following databases and medical journals to search for eligible studies: Google Scholar, Pubmed, Elsevier, Sage Publications and Embase. The authors comprehensively searched key terms related to ASD, health care and disparities. Findings The core defining features of ASD, which include communication and social impairments and deficits in sensory processing, were found to be barriers in the health-care experience of adults with ASD. Continued research and changes in health care, such as developing interventions to empower patients, adequately training providers and increasing the accessibility of the health-care system, are necessary to ensure adults with ASD receive adequate medical care. Research limitations/implications Additionally, clarifying the current literature on this topic can guide future research efforts to explore the influence of factors such as gender and the spectrum of autism itself leading to various levels of abilities and their influence on the health-care experience of adults with ASD. Practical implications Overall, the findings from this scoping review underline the importance of providing readily accessible evidence-based, age-appropriate primary and hospital health care for adults with ASD. Social implications Further interventions are needed to empower patients, adequately train providers, increase the accessibility of the health-care system, increase support for ASD patients and decrease discrimination. Originality/value This paper is a scoping literature review of the original work done by researchers in the field of developmental disorders and health care.

AB  - Background Several pioneering studies investigated deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa (AN) patients, but overall effects remain yet unclear. Aim of this study was to obtain estimates of efficacy of DBS in AN-patients using meta-analysis. Methods We searched three electronic databases until 1st of November 2021, using terms related to DBS and AN. We included trials that investigated the clinical effects of DBS in AN-patients. We obtained data including psychiatric comorbidities, medication use, DBS target, and study duration. Primary outcome was Body Mass Index (BMI), secondary outcome was quality of life, and the severity of psychiatric symptoms, including eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, and anxiety symptoms. We assessed the risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool. Results Four studies were included for meta-analysis, with a total of 56 patients with treatment-refractory AN. Follow-up ranged from 6-24 months. Random effects meta-analysis showed a significant increase in BMI following DBS, with a large effect size (Hedges's g = 1 center dot 13; 95% CI = 0 center dot 80 to 1 center dot 46; Z-value = 6 center dot 75; P < 0 center dot 001), without heterogeneity (I-2 = 0 center dot 00, P = 0 center dot 901). Random effects meta-analysis also showed a significant increase in quality of life (Hedges's g = 0 center dot 86; 95% CI = 0 center dot 44 to 1 center dot 28; Z-value = 4 center dot 01, P < 0 center dot 001). Furthermore, DBS decreased the severity of psychiatric symptoms (Hedges's g = 0 center dot 89; 95% CI = 0 center dot 57 to 1 center dot 21; Z-value = 5 center dot 47; P < 0 center dot 001, I-2 = 4 center dot 29, P = 0 center dot 371). Discussion In this first meta-analysis, DBS showed statistically large beneficial effects on weight restoration, quality of life, and reduction of psychiatric symptoms in patients with treatment-refractory AN. These outcomes call for more extensive naturalistic studies to determine the clinical relevance for functional recovery. This study is preregistered in PROSPERO,CRD42022295712.

AB  - Background: Digital interventions have become an accessible format in clinical practice to provide better support for patients with mental disorders. However, the clinical efficacy in patients with depressive disorders is not well known. We aimed to determine the efficacy of smartphone applications (apps) in patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder. Method: An electronic database search was performed of PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, to identify relevant articles up to June 12, 2021. Peer-reviewed articles were screened and selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Seven articles met the inclusion criteria and therefore were selected for the systematic review, which included a total of 651 patients. The results were heterogeneous, essentially due to the different methodologies used in the selected studies. Conclusions: Digital smartphone-delivered interventions do not appear to reduce depressive symptomatology nor improve the quality of life in patients diagnosed with depressive disorders when compared to an active control group. Taking into account the inherent methodological difficulties and the variability among such studies, it is apparent that further research-with more methodologically refined clinical trials, including larger sample sizes-is needed.

AB  - Background: Exercise has been used to manage symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The effect of exercise on PTSD outcomes has been previously explored in several studies. However, it still remains unclear what type of exercise/physical activity, intensity and duration is most effective for reducing symptoms of PTSD. A systematic review was conducted to determine which forms of exercise or physical activity have the greatest effect on PTSD outcome scores including an evaluation of exercise frequency and volume. Methods: The following electronic databases were systematically searched from January 1980 to June 2021: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were studies investigating adults aged 18 or over, reporting the effect of exercise and physical activities on PTSD symptom outcome scores. Two reviewers independently extracted information on study characteristics, exposure and outcomes. In total of 3,217 articles were screened and 23 full text articles further assessed, with 13 RCT's included in the review, covering seven exercise/physical activity interventions. The study protocol was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42021255131). Results: Thirteen studies from four countries involving a total of 531 patients were selected for inclusion. Individual forms of exercise/physical activity examined showed some effect on reducing PTSD symptoms but combined exercises (resistance training, aerobic, strength and yoga) administered over a 12 week period, three times a week for 30-60 min showed greater effects on PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: The limited evidence suggests that a combined exercise intervention has the best evidence for a having a beneficial effect on PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Fatigue is recognized as one of the most commonly presented long-term complaints in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review was performed to describe symptoms, etiology, possible risk factors related to post-COVID-19 fatigue and the therapeutic approaches used for the treatment of post-COVID-19 fatigue. For the systematic literature search the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycInfo were used. All articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed for demographics, clinical data and treatment. Included were studies which focused on an adult population (18-65 years old); elderly patients and patients with chronic somatic diseases which can also cause fatigue were excluded. We identified 2,851, screened 2,193 and finally included 20 studies with moderate to high methodological quality, encompassing 5,629 participants. Potential risk factors for post-COVID-19 fatigue were old age, female sex, severe clinical status in the acute phase of infection, a high number of comorbidities, and a prediagnosis of depression/anxiety. Lastly, a possible autoimmune etiology was suspected. Several treatment approaches have been tested mostly in small and uncontrolled studies so far: a Chinese herbal formulation improved breathlessness and fatigue. Moreover, molecular hydrogen (H-2) inhalation had beneficial health effects in terms of improved physical (6-min walking test) and respiratory function in patients with post-COVID-19. Patients also noticed improvement in fatigue after undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP). Lastly. muscle strength and physical function were improved after undergoing an 8-weeks biweekly physical therapy course including aerobic training, strengthening exercises, diaphragmatic breathing techniques, and mindfulness training. However, larger and controlled studies e.g., investigating the effect of physical and / or psychotherapy for patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue are urgently warranted.

AB  - An important, yet under-explored area of interpretation bias research concerns the examination of potential physiological correlates and sequalae of this bias. Developing a better understanding of the physiological processes that underpin interpretation biases will extend current theoretical frameworks underlying interpretation bias, as well as optimise the efficacy of cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) interventions aimed at improving symptoms of emotional disorders. To this end, systematic searches were conducted across the Web of Science, PsycInfo and Pubmed databases to identify physiological markers of interpretation bias. In addition, grey literature database searches were conducted to compliment peer-reviewed research and to counter publication bias. From a combined initial total of 898 records, 15 studies were included in qualitative synthesis (one of which was obtained from the grey literature). Eligible studies were assessed using a quality assessment tool adapted from the Quality Checklist for Healthcare Intervention Studies. The searches revealed seven psychophysiological correlates of interpretation bias, namely event-related potentials, heart rate and heart rate variability, respiratory sinus arrythmia, skin conductance response, pupillometry, and electromyography. The respective theoretical and practical implications of the research are discussed, followed by recommendations for future research.

AB  - Background Cognitive therapy and behavioural activation are both widely applied and effective psychotherapies for depression, but it is unclear which works best for whom. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis allows for examining moderators at the participant level and can provide more precise effect estimates than conventional meta-analysis, which is based on study-level data. Aims This article describes the protocol for a systematic review and IPD meta-analysis that aims to compare the efficacy of cognitive therapy and behavioural activation for adults with depression, and to explore moderators of treatment effect. (PROSPERO: CRD42022341602) Method Systematic literature searches will be conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, to identify randomised clinical trials comparing cognitive therapy and behavioural activation for adult acute-phase depression. Investigators of these trials will be invited to share their participant-level data. One-stage IPD meta-analyses will be conducted with mixed-effects models to assess treatment effects and to examine various available demographic, clinical and psychological participant characteristics as potential moderators. The primary outcome measure will be depressive symptom level at treatment completion. Secondary outcomes will include post-treatment anxiety, interpersonal functioning and quality of life, as well as follow-up outcomes. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first IPD meta-analysis concerning cognitive therapy versus behavioural activation for adult depression. This study has the potential to enhance our knowledge of depression treatment by using state-of-the-art statistical techniques to compare the efficacy of two widely used psychotherapies, and by shedding more light on which of these treatments might work best for whom.

AB  - Background: Digital, self-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions circumvent many barriers to in-person therapy for young people (aged 12-24 years), although adherence to these interventions is low. The absence or insufficient disclosure of recommendations or instructions for appropriate use may account for this. As such, many young people may not self-administer these interventions appropriately or receive the optimal degree of treatment.
   Objective: This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature on digital CBT for depression and anxiety in young people to describe how appropriate use has been defined and communicated to users as instructions for use, to describe how adherence has been measured, and to determine the associations between adherence and treatment outcomes.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted with 2 reviewers (SHL and MRA) extracting data independently. Overall, 4 electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) were searched in April 2021 for studies that met the following inclusion criteria: participants aged between 12 and 24 years, evaluated a digital CBT intervention targeting depression or anxiety, and reported instructions or recommendations for use or measures of adherence. Studies that evaluated non-CBT interventions or cognitive- or behavioral-only interventions were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs.
   Results: There were 32 manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 (88%) were unique studies (N=16,578 youths). Definitions of appropriate use varied among the different interventions in terms of intended recipients, duration and frequency of use, and the features used to support engagement and adherence to appropriate use definitions. Reporting of appropriate use definitions in studies was inconsistent, with no study systematically describing components of appropriate use or providing information on how recommendations for use were relayed to users. Most often, definitions of appropriate use were derived from the study protocol and descriptions of intervention features. Adherence was mostly operationalized as the degree of intervention completion; however, reporting of adherence data was heterogeneous. There was little evidence of an association between degree of use and outcomes in the 9 studies that examined this.
   Conclusions: Definitions of appropriate use are unique to each digital CBT intervention. However, statements of appropriate use are not systematically reported in the literature. Furthermore, the extent to which recommendations for use are communicated to users is not routinely reported. Despite unique definitions of appropriate use, adherence was most often generically operationalized as the degree of intervention completion and was not consistently associated with outcomes. We proposed a framework to promote systematic reporting of definitions of appropriate use for digital interventions to provide guidance to users and to assist the development of appropriate and nuanced measures of adherence.

AB  - Climate change is amongst the most serious issues nowadays. Climate change has become a concern for the scientific community as it could affect human health. Researchers have found that climate change potentially impacts human mental health, especially among depressive patients. However, the relationship is still unclear and needs further investigation. The purpose of this systematic review is to systematically evaluate the evidence of the association between climate change effects on depressive patients, investigate the effects of environmental exposure related to climate change on mental health outcomes for depressive patients, analyze the current technique used to determine the relationship, and provide the guidance for future research. Articles were identified by searching specified keywords in six electronic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Springer, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Digital Library) from 2012 until 2021. Initially, 1823 articles were assessed based on inclusion criteria. After being analyzed, only 15 studies fit the eligibility criteria. The result from included studies showed that there appears to be strong evidence of the association of environmental exposure related to climate change in depressive patients. Temperature and air pollution are consistently associated with increased hospital admission of depressive patients; age and gender became the most frequently considered vulnerability factors. However, the current evidence is limited, and the output finding between each study is still varied and does not achieve a reasonable and mature conclusion regarding the relationship between the variables. Therefore, more evidence is needed in this domain study. Some variables might have complex patterns, and hard to identify the relationship. Thus, technique used to analyze the relationship should be strengthened to identify the relevant relationship.

AB  - Introduction: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a prevalent sensory deficit presenting commonly as age-related hearing loss. Other forms of SNHL include noise-induced and sudden SNHL. Recent evidence has pointed to oxidative stress as a common pathogenic pathway in most subtypes of acquired SNHL. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA sequences that suppress target mRNA expression and affect downstream processes. Many studies have shown that miRNAs are integral biomolecules in hypoxia-adaptive responses. They also promote apoptosis in response to oxidative stress resulting in SNHL. Our hypothesis is that miRNAs are involved in the pathophysiological responses to hypoxia and oxidative stress that result in SNHL. This study reviews the evidence for hypoxia-adaptive miRNAs (hypoxamiRs) in different types of acquired SNHL and focuses on miRNAs involved in hypoxia driven SNHL.Methods: Electronic bibliographic databases PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched independently by two investigators for articles published in English from the inception of individual databases to the end of July 2020. The text word or medical subject heading searches of all fields, titles, abstracts, or subject headings depending on the database were undertaken with combinations of the words "microRNAs", "hypoxia", "hypoxamiRs", "oxidative stress", "ischemia" and "hearing loss". The reference lists of studies meeting the inclusion criteria were searched to identify additional relevant studies. The inclusion criteria included relevant clinical studies with human subjects, animals, and in vitro experiments. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool for human studies and the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) a risk of bias assessment tool for animal model and in vitro studies.Results: A total of 15 primary articles were selected for full text screening after excluding duplicates, reviews, retracted articles, and articles not published in English. All nine articles meeting the study inclusion criteria were from animal or in vitro model studies and were assessed to be at low risk of bias. miRNAs miR-34a and miR-29b were reported to be involved in SNHL in inner ear cell models exposed to oxidative stress. Signaling pathways Sirtuin 1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1-alpha (SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha), SIRT1/p53, and SIRT1/hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha) were identified as underlying pathways involved in acquired SNHL.Conclusion: There is evidence that miR-34a and -29b are involved in hypoxia-driven and other causes of oxidative stress-related acquired SNHL. Further studies are required to determine if these findings are clinically applicable.

AB  - Purpose The continuum of mental health/illness has been subject to scientific debate for decades. While current research indicates that continuum belief interventions can reduce mental health stigma and improve treatment seeking in affected populations, no study has yet systematically examined measures of continuum beliefs. Methods This preregistered systematic review summarizes measures of continuum beliefs. Following the PRISMA statement, three scientific databases (PubMed, PsycInfo and PsycArticles via EBSCOhost, Web of Science) are searched, instruments are described and discussed regarding their scope, and methodological quality. Results Overall, 7351 records were identified, with 35 studies reporting relevant findings on 11 measures. Most studies examined general population samples and used vignette-based measures. Schizophrenia and depression were most commonly examined, few studies focused on dementia, ADHD, OCD, eating disorders, and problematic alcohol use, or compared continuum beliefs across disorders. Validity was very good for most measures, but reliability was rarely tested. Measures mostly assessed beliefs in the normality of mental health symptoms or the normality of persons with such symptoms but rarely nosological aspects (i.e., categorical v continuous conceptualization of mental disorders). Conclusions Current research provides psychometrically sound instruments to examine continuum beliefs for a variety of mental disorders. While studies suggest utility for general population samples and mental health professionals, more research is necessary to corroborate findings, for instance, regarding age (e.g., in adolescents), gender, or type of mental disorder. Future research should also compare self-report ratings, and vignette-based measures, include measures of nosological concepts to fully grasp the continuum concept of mental illness.

AB  - Personal budgets (PBs) may improve the lives of people with mental health conditions and people with intellectual disability (ID). However, a clear definition of PB, benefits, and challenges is still faded. This work aims to systematically review evidence on PB use in mental health and ID contexts, from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective, and summarize the recent research on interventions, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of PBs in beneficiaries with mental health conditions and/or ID. The present systematic review is an update of the existing literature analyzed since 2013. We performed a systematic search strategy of articles using the bibliographic databases PubMed and PsycINFO. Six blinded authors screened the works for inclusion/exclusion criteria, and two blinded authors extracted the data. We performed a formal narrative synthesis of the findings from the selected works. A total of 9,800 publications were screened, and 29 were included. Improvement in responsibility and awareness, quality of life, independent living, paid work, clinical, psychological, and social domains, and everyday aspects of the users' and their carers' life have been observed in people with mental health conditions and/or ID. However, the PBs need to be less stressful and burdensome in their management for users, carers, and professionals. In addition, more quantitative research is needed to inform PBs' policymakers.

AB  - The field of particle physics is at the crossroads. The discovery of a Higgs-like boson completed the Standard Model (SM), but the lacking observation of convincing resonances Beyond the SM (BSM) offers no guidance for the future of particle physics. On the other hand, the motivation for New Physics has not diminished and is, in fact, reinforced by several striking anomalous results in many experiments. Here we summarise the status of the most significant anomalies, including the most recent results for the flavour anomalies, the multi-lepton anomalies at the LHC, the Higgs-like excess at around 96 GeV, and anomalies in neutrino physics, astrophysics, cosmology, and cosmic rays. While the LHC promises up to 4 ab(-1) of integrated luminosity and far-reaching physics programmes to unveil BSM physics, we consider the possibility that the latter could be tested with present data, but that systemic shortcomings of the experiments and their search strategies may preclude their discovery for several reasons, including: final states consisting in soft particles only, associated production processes, QCD-like final states, close-by SM resonances, and SUSY scenarios where no missing energy is produced. New search strategies could help to unveil the hidden BSM signatures, devised by making use of the CERN open data as a new testing ground. We discuss the CERN open data with its policies, challenges, and potential usefulness for the community. We showcase the example of the CMS collaboration, which is the only collaboration regularly releasing some of its data. We find it important to stress that individuals using public data for their own research does not imply competition with experimental efforts, but rather provides unique opportunities to give guidance for further BSM searches by the collaborations. Wide access to open data is paramount to fully exploit the LHCs potential.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Nucleic acid damage from oxidative stress (NA-OXS) may be a molecular mechanism driving the severely increased morbidity and mortality from somatic causes in adults with psychiatric disorders.
   OBJECTIVE To systematically retrieve and analyze data on NA-OXS across the psychiatric disorder diagnostic spectrum.
   DATA SOURCES The PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to November 16, 2021. A hand search of reference lists of relevant articles was also performed.
   STUDY SELECTION Key study inclusion criteria in this meta-analysis were as follows: adult human study population, measurement of any marker of DNA or RNA damage from oxidative stress, and either a (1) cross-sectional design comparing patients with psychiatric disorders (any diagnosis) with a control group or (2) prospective intervention. Two authors screened the studies, and 2 senior authors read the relevant articles in full and assessed them for eligibility.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Two authors performed data extraction independently, and a senior coauthor was consulted in cases of disagreement. Data were synthesized with random-effects and multilevel meta-analyses.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The predefined hypothesis was that individuals with psychiatric disorders have increased NA-OXS levels. The main outcome was the standardized mean differences (SMDs) among patients and controls in nucleic acid oxidation markers compared across diagnostic groups. Analyses were divided into combinations of biological matrices and nucleic acids.
   RESULTS Eighty-two studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, comprising 205 patient vs control group comparisons and a total of 10 151 patient and 10 532 control observations. Overall, the data showed that patients with psychiatric disorders had higher NA-OXS levels vs controls across matrices and molecules. Pooled effect sizes ranged from moderate for urinary DNA markers (SMD = 0.44 [95% CI, 0.20-0.68]; P < .001) to very large for blood cell DNA markers (SMD = 1.12 [95% CI. 0.69-1.55; P < .001). Higher NA-OXS levels were observed among patients with dementias followed by psychotic and bipolar disorders. Sensitivity analyses excluding low-quality studies did not materially alter the results. Intervention studies were few and too heterogenous for meaningful meta-analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this meta-analysis suggest that there is an association with increased NA-OXS levels in individuals across the psychiatric disorder diagnostic spectrum. NA-OXS may play a role in the somatic morbidity and mortality observed among individuals with psychiatric disorders.

Actigraphic monitoring of day and night activity patterns could provide useful data to detect symptom worsening, prevent risk periods, and evaluate treatment efficacy in those disorders. Thus, we have conducted a systematic search of the scientific literature to find any original study using actigraphic monitoring to investigate activity and sleep patterns in patients affected by any type of anxiety disorder according to the definition of the DSM-5. We found only six studies fulfilling these criteria. Three studies report significant findings in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. Overall, the samples and methods are heterogeneous. Although the authors support the interest of actigraphic monitoring in anxiety disorders, the evidence to date is very limited.

AB  - Indigenous communities demonstrate immense cultural strengths despite being impacted by mental health and academic disparities due to ongoing systemic racism and historical trauma. Given that schools are a context in which indigenous youths' needs have potential to be met through preventive intervention, this scoping review explores and summarizes the cultural relevance of school-based prevention interventions that have been implemented with students from indigenous backgrounds. We included articles published between January 2010 and February 2021 that included descriptive, outcome, and/or program development data on school-based prevention programs used with indigenous students in the USA and Canada. The initial search yielded 2131 articles for review, and ultimately 35 articles describing 27 interventions were included in the final sample. The majority of the programs (n = 20) were focused on substance use prevention or sexual and reproductive health and targeted adolescents in middle and high school; only five programs focused on mental health, social-emotional learning, and academics. All interventions were culturally consonant, but the program development process differed: 11 interventions were culturally grounded (i.e., developed based on values and beliefs of a specific cultural group) with one being community initiated (i.e., grassroots development), and 17 were culturally adapted (i.e., the tailoring of an existing intervention for a specific cultural group). We describe each intervention and its cultural components and provide commentary on how school-based prevention and social-emotional learning interventions can promote academic success for indigenous students in the USA and Canada.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique that involves the application of magnetic pulses on hyperactive or hypoactive cortical brain areas. rTMS is considered a high therapeutic tool in many neuropsychiatric conditions. Despite its wide and continuous usage for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, information about the use of rTMS in bipolar disorders is limited and not well-established in the literature. Objectives: This scoping review aims to explore the literature available regarding the application of rTMS for the management of bipolar disorders, to garner evidence in support of it uses in the management of bipolar disorders, and for recommendations on future clinical and research work. Method: We electronically conducted a data search in five research databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psych INFO, SCOPUS, and EMBASE) using all identified keywords across all the databases to identify evidence-based studies. Articles were included if they were published randomized control designs aimed at the use of rTMS in the management of bipolar disorders. Overall, nine studies were eligible for this review. The search results are up to date as of the final date of data search-20 December 2020. Only full-text published articles written in English were reviewed. Review articles on treatment with rTMS for conditions either than bipolar disorders were excluded. Conclusion: The application of rTMS intervention for bipolar disorders looks promising despite the diversity of its outcomes and its clinical significance. However, to be able to draw a definite conclusion on the clinical effectiveness of the technique, more randomized controlled studies with well-defined stimulation parameters need to be conducted with large sample sizes in the future.

AB  - Simple Summary Exercise has shown to have a positive impact on both motor and non-motor functions in Parkinson's Disease patients. However, particularly in later stages of the disease, reduced cognitive function and motor capacity may lead to an inability to stay physically active. Therefore, alternative strategies for patients with Parkinson's Disease are necessary to minimize burden for patients, their families and public health care. Whole-Body Vibration could be such an alternative. Whole-Body Vibration is an exercise or treatment method in which subjects are exposed to a mechanical vibration while sitting, standing or exercising on a vibrating platform. Whole-Body Vibration is currently used for physiotherapy, sports and rehabilitation purposes. Whole-Body Vibration treatment is interesting because it affects both the body and brain. The potential of Whole-Body Vibration for, specifically, Parkinson's Disease patients should be clarified for further application. For this purpose, we conducted an extensive systematic review of the articles investigating the effects of Whole-Body Vibrations (1) on animals and humans with Parkinson's Disease and (2) on neuropathological Parkinson's Disease mechanisms. The results show some potential of Whole-Body Vibration for Parkinson's Disease patients. The recommendations provided by this review can be used by researchers and rehabilitative practitioners implementing Whole-Body Vibration as a treatment for Parkinson's Disease patients. (1) Background: When the severity of Parkinson's Disease (PD) increases, patients often have difficulties in performing exercises. Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) may be a suitable alternative. This systematic review aims to clarify if WBV shows potential as rehabilitative therapy for PD patients. (2) Methods: We searched several databases for controlled trials investigating the effects of WBV (1) on PD populations and (2) PD neuropathological mechanisms. We included both human and animal studies and performed meta-analyses. (3) Results: The studies on PD populations (14 studies) show an overall significant, but small, effect in favor of WBV (Hedges' g = 0.28), for which the effects on stability (Hedges' g = 0.39) and balance (Hedges' g = 0.30) are the most prominent. The studies on the neuropathological mechanisms (18 studies) show WBV effects on neuroinflammation (Hedges' g = -1.12) and several specific WBV effects on neurotransmitter systems, growth factors, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and oxidative stress. (4) Conclusions: The effects of WBV on human PD patients remains inconclusive. Nevertheless, WBV protocols with sufficient duration (>= 3 weeks), session frequency (>= 3 sessions/week) and vibration frequency (>= 20 Hz) show potential as a treatment method, especially for motor function. The potential of WBV for PD patients is confirmed by the effects on the neuropathological mechanisms in mostly non-PD populations. We recommend high-quality future studies on both PD patients and PD mouse models to optimize WBV protocols and to examine the neuropathological mechanisms in PD populations.

AB  - In recent years, social media has become part of our lives, even among children. From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic period, media device and Internet access rapidly increased. Adolescents connected Internet alone, consulting social media, mostly Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. During "lockdown", the Internet usage allowed communication with peers and the continuity activities such as school teaching. However, we have to keep in mind that media usage may be related to some adverse consequences especially in the most vulnerable people, such as the young. Aim of the review is to focus on risks correlated to social media use by children and adolescents, identifying spies of rising problems and engaging in preventive recommendations. The scoping review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines, searching on PubMed the terms "social media" or "social network", "health", and "pediatrics". Excluding articles not pertinent, we found 68 reports. Out of them, 19 were dealing with depression, 15 with diet, and 15 with psychological problems, which appeared to be the most reported risk of social media use. Other identified associated problems were sleep, addiction, anxiety, sex related issues, behavioral problems, body image, physical activity, online grooming, sight, headache, and dental caries. Public and medical awareness must rise over this topic and new prevention measures must be found, starting with health practitioners, caregivers, and websites/application developers. Pediatricians should be aware of the risks associated to a problematic social media use for the young's health and identify sentinel signs in children as well as prevent negative outcomes in accordance with the family.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most common comorbid psychiatric disorders in patients with bipolar disorder. Managing anxiety symptoms in comorbid conditions is challenging and has received little research interest. The findings from preclinical research on fear conditioning, an animal model of anxiety disorder, have suggested that memory reconsolidation updating (exposure-based therapy) combined with val-proate might facilitate the amelioration of fear memories. Here, three cases of successful amelioration of agoraphobia and panic symptoms through valproate adjuvant therapy for cognitive behavioral therapy in patients who failed to respond to two to three consecutive stan-dard pharmacotherapy trials over several years are described. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine CBT with valproate in patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, and comorbid bipolar disorder. Additionally, the background preclinical re-search on this combination therapy based on the reconsolidation-updating mechanism, the inhibition of histone deacetylase 2, and critical period reopening, off-label use of valproate in panic disorder, plasticity-augmented psychotherapy, and how to combine valproate with CBT is discussed.

AB  - Light therapy has increasingly been used in relieving non-seasonal depression. We aimed to summarize the evidence and evaluate the methodological quality regarding the effectiveness and safety of light therapy for nonseasonal depression from systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs). In this study, five databases were searched from their inceptions to January 24, 2022. SRs/MAs on light therapy treatment for non-seasonal depression were included. Methodological quality assessment was performed using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), and evidence quality assessment was performed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Six SRs/MAs on light therapy treatment for non-seasonal depression were included. The AMSTAR-2 showed that the methodological level of five included SRs/MAs were evaluated as critically low quality, and one included SRs/MAs were rated as low quality. According to the evaluation results of GRADE, the quality of evidence was mostly unsatisfactory. The results and descriptions in the included SRs/MAs suggest that light therapy is effective as a non-pharmacological intervention for the treatment of non-seasonal depression. However, the generally unsatisfied evidence quality and methodological quality of the SRs/Mas indicate that these results must be interpreted with caution.

AB  - (1) Background: ADHD is recognized as one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. The worldwide prevalence of ADHD is estimated at 5.3%; however, estimates vary as a function of a number of factors, including diagnostic methods, age, sex and geographical location. A review of studies is needed to clarify the epidemiology of ADHD in Canada. (2) Methods: A search strategy was created in PubMed and adapted for MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Papers were included if they examined diagnosed ADHD prevalence and/or incidence rates in any region of Canada, age group and gender. A snowball technique was used to identify additional papers from reference lists, and experts in the field were consulted. (3) Results: Ten papers included in this review reported on prevalence, and one reported on incidence. One study provided an overall prevalence estimate across provinces for adults of 2.9%, and one study provided an overall estimate across five provinces for children and youth of 8.6%. Across age groups (1 to 24 years), incidence estimates ranged from 0.4% to 1.2%, depending on province. Estimates varied by age, gender, province, region and time. (4) Conclusions: The overall Canadian ADHD prevalence estimate is similar to worldwide estimates for adults. Most studies reported on prevalence rather than incidence. Differences in estimates across provinces may reflect the varying number of practitioners available to diagnose and prescribe medication for ADHD across provinces. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of ADHD in Canada, a study is needed that includes all provinces and territories, and that considers estimates in relation to age, gender, ethnicity, geographical region, socioeconomic status and access to mental healthcare coverage. Incidence rates need further examination to be determined.

AB  - Background: Behavioral activation is recognized as a stand-alone, evidence-based therapy for depression. Internet-delivered psychological interventions are easy to access and low cost. Therefore, it is important to determine whether internet-delivered behavioral activation (iBA) is an effective option for improving depressive symptoms and other health-related outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of iBA on individuals with depressive symptoms. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted within four databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved iBA for people with depressive symptoms. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. Depending on I2 statistic values for heterogeneity, either a random effects model or fixed effects model was used. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the type of control groups. Results: Twenty RCTs met the eligibility criteria. Meta-analyses showed iBA had small to medium effects on depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, functioning, perceived social support, and behavioral activation (BA) in people suffering from depressive symptoms at the immediate posttest and follow-up compared to control conditions. Limitations: Relatively fewer studies were conducted to compare effects of iBA on outcomes other than depressive symptoms and BA process measures compared to comparison or control conditions. The overall risk of bias across the included RCTs was unclear. Conclusions: Further high-quality studies are needed to verify the effects of iBA on varied health outcomes and BA process measures for individuals with depressive symptoms.

AB  - To review the recent progress of machine learning for the early diagnosis of depression (major depressive disorder). The source of data was 32 original studies in the Web of Science. The search terms were "depression" (title) and "random forest" (abstract). The eligibility criteria were the dependent variable of depression, the interventions of machine learning (the decision tree, the naive Bayesian, the random forest, the support vector machine and/or the artificial neural network), the outcomes of accuracy and/or the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the early diagnosis of depression, the publication year of 2000 or later, the publication language of English and the publication journal of SCIE/SSCI. Different machine learning methods would be appropriate for different types of data for the early diagnosis of depression, e.g., logistic regression, the random forest, the support vector machine and/or the artificial neural network in the case of numeric data, the random forest in the case of genomic data. Their performance measures reported varied within 60.1-100.0 for accuracy and 64.0-96.0 for the AUC. Machine learning provides an effective, non-invasive decision support system for early diagnosis of depression.

AB  - Background: High-dose ionizing radiation (IR) (>0.5 Gy) is an established risk factor for cognitive impairments, but this cannot be concluded for low-to-moderate IR exposure (<0.5 Gy) in adulthood as study results are inconsistent. The objectives are to summarize relevant epidemiological studies of low-to-moderate IR exposure in adulthood and to assess the risk of non-cancerous CNS diseases. Methods: A systematic literature search of four electronic databases was performed to retrieve relevant epidemiological studies published from 2000 to 2022. Pooled standardized mortality ratios, relative risks, and excess relative risks (ERR) were estimated with a random effect model. Results: Forty-five publications were included in the systematic review, including thirty-three in the quantitative meta-analysis. The following sources of IR-exposure were considered: atomic bomb, occupational, environmental, and medical exposure. Increased dose-risk relationships were found for cerebrovascular diseases incidence and mortality (ERRpooled per 100 mGy = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.03-0.05; ERRpooled at 100 mGy = 0.01; 95% CI: -0.00-0.02, respectively) and for Parkinson's disease (ERRpooled at 100 mGy = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.06-0.16); Conclusions: Our findings suggest that adult low-to-moderate IR exposure may have effects on non-cancerous CNS diseases. Further research addressing inherent variation issues is encouraged.

AB  - It is unclear how to effectively protect healthcare workers' mental health during infectious disease epidemics. Targeting the occupational determinants of stress may hold more promise than individual stress management, which has received more focus. Through a systematic review of the 2000-2021 English- and French-language scientific literature, we evaluated the effectiveness of organizational and psychosocial work environment interventions to protect healthcare workers' mental health in an epidemic/pandemic context. Evidence from medium- and high-quality studies was synthesized using GRADE. Among 1604 unique search results, 41 studies were deemed relevant, yielding 34 low-quality and seven medium-quality studies. The latter reported on promising multi-component prevention programs that combined staffing adjustments, work shift arrangements, enhanced infection prevention and control, recognition of workers' efforts, psychological and/or logistic support during lockdowns (e.g., accommodation). Our confidence in the effectiveness of reviewed interventions is low to very low, however, owing to methodological limitations. We highlight gaps in the reporting of intervention process and context elements and discuss theory and implementation failure as possible explanations for results. We conclude by urging authors of future studies to include and document detailed risk assessments of the work environment, involve workers in solution design and implementation and consider how this process can be adapted during an emergency.

AB  - The NLRP inflammasome is a multi-protein complex which mainly consists of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain. Its activation is linked to microglial-mediated neuroinflammation and partial neuronal degeneration. Many neuropsychiatric illnesses have increased inflammatory responses as both a primary cause and a defining feature. The NLRP inflammasome inhibition delays the progression and alleviates the deteriorating effects of neuroinflammation on several neuropsychiatric disorders. Evidence on the central effects of the NLRP inflammasome potentially provides the scientific base of a promising drug target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review elucidates the classification, composition, and functions of the NLRP inflammasomes. It also explores the underlying mechanisms of NLRP inflammasome activation and its divergent role in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, drug use disorders, and anxiety. Furthermore, we explore the treatment potential of the NLRP inflammasome inhibitors against these disorders.

KW  - HEALTH
AB  - The working life of individuals is now longer because of increases to state pension age in the United Kingdom. Older workers may be at particular risk in the workplace, compared with younger workers. Successful workplace interventions to reduce occupational stress amongst older workers are essential, but little is known about their effectiveness. The aim is to evaluate current evidence of the effectiveness of interventions for reducing stress in older workers in non-healthcare settings. Four database searches were conducted. The search terms included synonyms of "intervention", "workplace" and "occupational stress" to identify original studies published since 2011. Dual screening was conducted on the sample to identify studies which met the inclusion criteria. The RoB 2.0 tool for RCTs was used to assess the risk of bias. From 3708 papers retrieved, ten eligible papers were identified. Seven of the papers' interventions were deemed effective in reducing workplace stress. The sample size for most studies was small, and the effectiveness of interventions were more likely to be reported when studies used self-report measures, rather than biological measures. This review indicates that workplace interventions might be effective for reducing stress in older workers. However, there remains an absence of high-quality evidence in this field.

AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome that involves chronic pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and impaired quality of life and daily functioning. In addition to medical and psychological therapies, other therapies including acupuncture and dry needling aim to reduce pain and disability in patients with FM. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of dry needling and acupuncture in patients with FM regarding pain, function and disability in both the short and the long term. MEDLINE, PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trial studies evaluating efficacy data of dry needling or/and acupuncture treatments to improve pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and impaired quality of life and/or daily function. A qualitative analysis including the methodological quality and a systematic data synthesis was performed. A total of 25 studies addressed the selection criteria. Most studies had an acceptable methodological quality. Four studies assessed the effect of dry needling, and twenty-one studies assessed the effect of acupuncture. In general, both interventions improved pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue, stiffness, quality of sleep and quality of life. However, both techniques were not compared in any study. Acupuncture and dry needling therapies seems to be effective in patients with FM, since both reduced pain pressure thresholds, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbances and disability in the short term. It is still required to compare both techniques and their application in the long term.

AB  - BackgroundThere have been several controversies about the correlation between vitamin D and depression. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and the incidence and prognosis of depression and to analyze the latent effects of subgroups including population and supplement strategy. MethodsA systematic search for articles before July 2021 in databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) was conducted to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence and prognosis of depression. ResultsThis meta-analysis included 29 studies with 4,504 participants, indicating that the use of vitamin D was beneficial to a decline in the incidence of depression (SMD: -0.23) and improvement of depression treatment (SMD: -0.92). Subgroup analysis revealed that people with low vitamin D levels (<50 nmol/L) and females could notably benefit from vitamin D in both prevention and treatment of depression. The effects of vitamin D with a daily supplementary dose of >2,800 IU and intervention duration of >= 8 weeks were considered significant in both prevention and treatment analyses. Intervention duration <= 8 weeks was recognized as effective in the treatment group. ConclusionOur results demonstrate that vitamin D has a beneficial impact on both the incidence and the prognosis of depression. Whether suffering from depression or not, individuals with low vitamin D levels, dose >2,800 IU, intervention duration >= 8 weeks, and all females are most likely to benefit from vitamin D supplementation.

Neuromodulation is a promising therapeutic method that stimulates neural circuitries to treat neuropsychiatric illnesses. We conducted a scoping review on the neurogenic and antidepressant outcomes of neuromodulation in animal models of depression. PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo were comprehensively searched for full-text English articles from inception to October 5, 2021. Data screening and extraction were conducted independently by two researchers. Seventeen eligible studies were included in this review. The majority of studies used non-invasive neuromodulation (n = 14) and assessed neurogenesis using neural proliferation (n = 16) and differentiation markers (n = 9). Limited reports (n = 2) used neurogenic inhibitors to evaluate the role of neurogenesis on the depressive-like behavioral outcomes. Overall, neuromodulation substantially effectuated both hippocampal cell proliferation and antidepressant-like behavior in animal models of depression, with some providing evidence for enhanced neuronal differentiation and maturation. The proposed neurogenic-related mechanisms mediating the neuromodulation efficacies included neurotrophic processes, anti-apoptotic pathways, and normalization of HPA axis functions. Further research is warranted to explore the role of neuromodulation-induced neurogenic effects on treatment efficacies and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Neuropathic pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms are common complications reported by the traumatic brain injury (TBI) population. Although a growing body of research has indicated the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the management of neurological and psychiatric disorders, little evidence has been presented to support the effects of rTMS on neuropathic pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with TBI in all age groups. In addition, a better understanding of the potential factors that might influence the therapeutic effect of rTMS is necessary. The objective of this preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis was to quantify the effects of rTMS on physical and psychological symptoms in individuals with TBI. We systematically searched six databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rTMS in TBI patients reporting pain and neuropsychiatric outcomes published until March 20, 2022. The mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was estimated separately for outcomes to understand the mean effect size. Twelve RCTs with 276 TBI patients were ultimately selected from 1605 records for systematic review, and 11 of the studies were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, five of the included studies showed a low risk of bias. The effects of rTMS on neuropathic pain were statistically significant (MD=-1.00, 95% CI -1.76 to -0.25, P=0.009), with high heterogeneity (I2=76%). A significant advantage of 1 Hz rTMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in improving depression (MD=-6.52, 95% CI -11.58 to -1.46, P=0.01) was shown, and a significant improvement was noted in the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire-13 (RPQ-13) scores of mild TBI patients after rTMS (MD=-5.87, 95% CI -10.63 to -1.11, P=0.02). However, no significance was found in cognition measurement. No major adverse events related to rTMS were reported. Moderate evidence suggests that rTMS can effectively and safely improve neuropathic pain, while its effectiveness on depression, postconcussion symptoms, and cognition is limited. More trials with a larger number of participants are needed to draw firm conclusions.

AB  - Introduction Knowledge about the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders is increasing in the last decades and evidence from literature suggests a central role for immuno-inflammatory mechanisms in these illnesses. The antipsychotic quetiapine acts on dopamine and serotonin signalling and well-established evidence demonstrates that these neurotransmitters can modulate immune functions in healthy and diseased conditions. Starting from this perspective, in the last few decades, a number of studies attempted to identify quetiapine effects on immune functions in order to highlight a possible additional effect of this drug in psychotic diseases, although no conclusive results were obtained. Methods We critically reviewed preclinical and clinical studies evaluating quetiapine effects on immune systems, suggesting strategies for future work in this field. Results Computerised search, in PubMed and Embase databases, was performed in March 2020: 120 studies were identified but only 29 relevant papers were selected for detailed review. Conclusion Despite some interesting preliminary findings about anti-inflammatory effects of quetiapine, mainly supported by preclinical studies, it is possible to conclude further studies are needed to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of this drug and achieve a better understanding of its relevance on clinical outcomes to finally identify new therapeutic approaches in psychiatric treatment.Keypoints Mounting evidence points to a role for immuno-inflammatory mechanisms in psychiatric disorders. Quetiapine (QUE) acts on catecholamine (dopamine and norepinephrine) and serotonin signalling. The immunomodulatory effects of catecholamines are well established. Treatment with QUE in psychiatric disorders could leverage immunomodulatory effects. QUE unclear role in immune function modulation suggests future work.

AB  - Gamma oscillation is the synchronization with a frequency of 30-90 Hz of neural oscillations, which are rhythmic electric processes of neuron groups in the brain. The inhibitory interneuron network is necessary for the production of gamma oscillations, but certain disruptions such as brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic imbalances can cause this network to malfunction. Gamma oscillations specifically control the connectivity between different brain regions, which is crucial for perception, movement, memory, and emotion. Studies have linked abnormal gamma oscillations to conditions of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli (GENUS) provides significant neuroprotection. This review discusses the function of gamma oscillations in advanced brain activities from both a physiological and pathological standpoint, and it emphasizes gamma entrainment as a potential therapeutic approach for a range of neuropsychiatric diseases.

AB  - IntroductionInsomnia is a stress-related sleep disorder, may favor a state of allostatic overload impairing brain neuroplasticity, stress immune and endocrine pathways, and may contribute to mental and physical disorders. In this framework, assessing and targeting insomnia is of importance. AimSince maladaptive neuroplasticity and allostatic overload are hypothesized to be related to GABAergic alterations, compounds targeting GABA may play a key role. Accordingly, the aim of this review was to discuss the effect of GABA(A) receptor agonists, short-medium acting hypnotic benzodiazepines and the so called Z-drugs, at a molecular level. MethodLiterature searches were done according to PRISMA guidelines. Several combinations of terms were used such as "hypnotic benzodiazepines" or "brotizolam," or "lormetazepam" or "temazepam" or "triazolam" or "zolpidem" or "zopiclone" or "zaleplon" or "eszopiclone" and "insomnia" and "effects on sleep" and "effect on brain plasticity" and "effect on stress system". Given the complexity and heterogeneity of existing literature, we ended up with a narrative review. ResultsAmong short-medium acting compounds, triazolam has been the most studied and may regulate the stress system at central and peripheral levels. Among Z-drugs eszopiclone may regulate the stress system. Some compounds may produce more "physiological" sleep such as brotizolam, triazolam, and eszopiclone and probably may not impair sleep processes and related neural plasticity. In particular, triazolam, eszopiclone, and zaleplon studied in vivo in animal models did not alter neuroplasticity. ConclusionCurrent models of insomnia may lead us to revise the way in which we use hypnotic compounds in clinical practice. Specifically, compounds should target sleep processes, the stress system, and sustain neural plasticity. In this framework, among the short/medium acting hypnotic benzodiazepines, triazolam has been the most studied compound while among the Z-drugs eszopiclone has demonstrated interesting effects. Both offer potential new insight for treating insomnia.

AB  - BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common clinical disease often associated with insulin resistance (IR). The interaction between PCOS and IR will promote the progress of PCOS and the risk of related complications, harm women's physical and mental health, and increase the social and economic burden. Materials and MethodsPCOS IR-related works of literature were retrieved through the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) Database and imported into VOSviewer and CiteSpace, respectively, in plain text format to conduct the literature visualization analysis of authors, countries, institutions, highly cited works of literature, and keywords, aiming to reveal the hot spots and trends of PCOS IR fields. ResultsA total of 7,244 articles were retrieved from 1900 to 2022. Among them, the United States has made the largest contribution. Diamanti-Kandarakis E was the author with the most publications, and the University of Athens was the institution with most publications. Keyword analysis showed that PCOS interacts with IR mainly through sex-hormone binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, insulin-like growth factor, oxidative stress, and other mechanisms. In addition, the complications of PCOS complicated with IR are also the focus of researchers' attention. ConclusionsThrough bibliometric analysis, this paper obtains the research hotspot and trend of PCOS IR fields, which can provide a reference for subsequent research.

AB  - Background Accurate epidemiological data are essential for the planning of policies aimed at the identification, prevention, and management of delirium. The reported occurrence of delirium in hospitalized patients varies widely among studies, ranging between 5% to more than 80% in the international literature. The exact occurrence in Latin America is not well described. Objective The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic analysis of the published data on the epidemiology of delirium in hospitalized patients in Latin America. Methods We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. Both MEDLINE and LILACS databases were searched for original research articles reporting the occurrence of delirium among adult hospitalized patients in Latin American countries. Studies including pediatric populations were excluded from this analysis. Two authors independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed quality, and extracted data. The corresponding authors of the original articles were contacted to obtain relevant information about the study when this was not present in the published manuscripts. Results Seven hundred and eighteen original articles were identified. After screening titles and abstracts, 149 studies were included in the final analysis. The occurrence of delirium varied depending on the clinical scenario: (1) in the general medico-surgical wards, it ranged from 2.1% to 60.4%, (2) in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs), from 9.6% to 94.8%, (3) in the post-operatory population, from 5.45% and 52.3%, and (4) it was found to be between 10.7% and 62% in the emergency department setting. The most used delirium assessment tools were the "Confusion Assessment Method" (CAM; in the general population), and the "Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU" (CAM-ICU). Fourteen out of 149 studies were conducted in clinical settings who actively implemented some form of non-pharmacological delirium prevention bundles, most of them as part of ICU sedation-analgesia protocols. Conclusion Delirium occurs frequently in hospitalized patients in Latin America throughout a variety of clinical scenarios, including ICU, general wards, post-operatory populations, and among the emergency department setting. The CAM and the CAM-ICU are the most used delirium assessment tools. Bundles of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium are not universally implemented.

AB  - Memory and motor deficits are commonly identified in Parkinson's disease (PD). 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is transformed to MPP+ via monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), which causes oxidative stress and destroys dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and is widely used to create animal models of PD. However, to-date, a comprehensive analysis of the MPTP effects on various aspects of PD does not exist. Here, we provide a systematic review and meta-analysis on the MPTP effects on memory and motor functions by analyzing 51 studies on more than one thousand animals mainly including rats and mice. The results showed that in addition to motor functions such as coordination, balance and locomotor activity, MPTP significantly affects various mnemonic processes including spatial memory, working memory, recognition memory, and associative memory compared with the control group with some differences between systemic and intra-nigral injections on spatial memory, familiar object recognition, and anxiety-like behaviors. Nevertheless, our analysis failed to find systematic relationship between MPTP injection protocol parameters reported and the extent of the induced PD symptoms that can be a cause of concern for replicability of MPTP studies.

AB  - Objectives To summarise SNP associations identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of anxiety disorders and neuroticism; to appraise the quality of individual studies, and to assess the ancestral diversity of study participants. Methods We searched PubMed, Scopus, PsychInfo and PubPsych for GWASs of anxiety disorders, non-diagnostic traits (such as anxiety sensitivity), and neuroticism, and extracted all SNPs that surpassed genome-wide significance. We graded study quality using Q-genie scores and reviewed the ancestral diversity of included participants. Results 32 studies met our inclusion criteria. A total of 563 independent significant variants were identified, of which 29 were replicated nominally in independent samples, and 3 were replicated significantly. The studies had good global quality, but many smaller studies were underpowered. Phenotypic heterogeneity for anxiety (and less so for neuroticism) seemed to reflect the complexity of capturing this trait. Ancestral diversity was poor, with 70% of studies including only populations of European ancestry. Conclusion The functionality of genes identified by GWASs of anxiety and neuroticism deserves further investigation. Future GWASs should have larger sample sizes, more rigorous phenotyping and include more ancestrally diverse population groups.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to ascertain the comparative efficacy of these two forms on reducing anxiety scores of scales in patients with a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) by examining the available evidence for face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT). Moreover, this study attempted to determine whether ICBT can obtain similar benefits as CBT for GAD patients during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the quarantine policy and the requirement of social distance. Methods: This meta-analysis was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) according to the guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement (registration number CRD42021241938). Therefore, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining CBT or ICBT was conducted in this study to treat GAD patients diagnosed with DMS-IV. The researchers searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant studies published from 2000 to July 5, 2022. Evidence from RCTs was synthesized by Review Manager 5.4 as mean difference (MD) for change in scores of scales through a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: A total of 26 trials representing 1,687 participants were pooled. The results demonstrated that ICBT and CBT were very close in the effect size of treating GAD (MD = -2.35 vs. MD = -2.79). Moreover, they still exhibited a similar response (MD = -3.45 vs. MD = -2.91) after studies with active control were removed. Conclusion: Regarding the treatment of GAD, ICBT can achieve a similar therapeutic effect as CBT and could be CBT's candidate substitute, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic era, since the internet plays a crucial role in handling social space constraints.Systematic Review Registration, identifier CRD42021241938.

AB  - This paper analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the teachers, specifically the techno stress arising in them as a result of issues faced by them in the use of technology when they conduct the online academic activities. It aims to assess the major factors related to the online teaching that specifically adds to techno stress on the teachers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Finally, the study aims to provide suggestions to the policymakers and the management of the universities so that the effect of the COVID-19's on teachers' mental health and the related techno stress can be reduced. This paper is a literature review of the articles on the notion of techno stress on teachers and their mental health by searching the related articles with these terminologies using the renowned search engines of Google Scholar and Web of Science. A combination of the terms such as Coronavirus, COVID-19, mental health, psychological distress, techno stress, and online teaching were used in the article search for the review. The literature has suggested that the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly affected the mental health of the employees in general and specifically, the teachers who are engaged in online academic activities and teaching in the universities. The paper has identified a few factors that are the cause of the techno stress and provides recommendations for the university management and the policy makers for minimizing their negative impact on the teachers, in terms of the techno stress and their mental health. Coronavirus is a new strain of the viruses that has badly engulfed the entire population of the world. It is even now badly rising and causing deaths while this article is in the writing phase. The article has addressed the mental health concerns of the university teachers as they are now working from home using ICT for delivering the lectures and conducting the online teaching and learning activities for the students at their universities. This is a matter of grave importance now and requires immediate attention. Hence, this article broadens the scope of the research on the corona virus and its impact on the university teachers.

AB  - Distance Interpreting (DI) is a form of technology-mediated interpreting which has gained traction due to the high demand for multilingual conferences, live-streaming programs, and public service sectors. The current study synthesized the DI literature to build a framework that represents the construct and measurement of cognitive load in DI. Two major areas of research were identified, i.e., causal factors and methods of measuring cognitive load. A number of causal factors that can induce change in cognitive load in DI were identified and reviewed. These included factors derived from tasks (e.g., mode of presentation), environment (e.g., booth type), and interpreters (e.g., technology awareness). In addition, four methods for measuring cognitive load in DI were identified and surveyed: subjective methods, performance methods, analytical methods, and psycho-physiological methods. Together, the causal factors and measurement methods provide a multifarious approach to delineating and quantifying cognitive load in DI. This multidimensional framework can be applied as a tool for pedagogical design in interpreting programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. It can also provide implications for other fields of educational psychology and language learning and assessment.

AB  - The "frontal lobe paradox " highlights a phenomenon in which a subset of patients who possess frontal lobe damage and exhibit marked impairments in everyday life are still able to able to verbally describe a logical course of action relating to a task and perform well in interview and test settings. Such cases pose a challenge with regard to the assessment of mental capacity within clinical settings. Recent position articles state that the frontal lobe paradox is a well-known phenomenon within the field of neuropsychology, anecdotal reports from clinicians in the UK suggest this is not the case. Consequently, we conducted a scoping review to examine the breadth and depth of literature relating to the frontal lobe paradox. Searches were conducted using electronic databases and search engines, which were supplemented with a snowball search of the references used within relevant literature. We identified and reviewed 28 documents specifically related to the frontal lobe paradox. Nearly 50% of all identified academic texts published since 2000 were position articles that cited a handful of case studies published between 1936 and 1986 as evidence for the phenomenon. We also observed instances of articles citing position articles as evidence of the frontal lobe paradox. Overall, our findings indicate a lack of readily accessible research specific to the frontal lobe paradox. In particular, there is a lack of contemporary research specific to the subject and an absence of clarification as to which syndromes and disorders are included within the term.

AB  - There is evidence to support the positive contribution of autobiographical recall based techniques on individuals' quality of life, mood and cognitive functioning. In this review, we analyzed the effects of the use of personal photographs in interventions based on autobiographical memory in older people with and without cognitive impairment. The PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. The search was carried out in the electronic databases Web of Sciences (WOS), Medline (PubMed), SCIELO and PsycInfo (American Psychological Association). The articles based on clinical trials selected were evaluated using the PEDRo scale, which is specific to this type of article. Of the 1098 articles initially found, 6 met the inclusion criteria. The final articles focused their intervention on the use of autobiographical photographs as a means of stimulation. The results show that the use of photographs in different autobiographical recall stimulation techniques is associated with higher scores on well-being and quality of life, as well as with improvements in personal identity and cognitive functioning. This suggests that using personal photographs shows promise in enhancing the effect of these types of interventions in healthy or cognitively impaired older adults.

AB  - Prior research suggests that conscious face processing occurs preferentially in right hemisphere occipito-parietal regions. However, less is known about brain regions associated with non-conscious processing of faces, and whether a right-hemispheric dominance persists in line with specific affective responses. We aim to review the neural responses systematically, quantitatively, and qualitatively underlying subliminal face processing. PubMed was searched for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) publications assessing subliminal emotional face stimuli up to March 2022. Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses and narrative reviews were conducted on all studies that met ALE requirements. Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. In a meta-analysis of all 22 eligible studies (merging clinical and non-clinical populations, whole brain and region of interest analyses), bilateral amygdala activation was reported in the left (x = -19.2, y = 1.5, z = -17.1) in 59% of studies, and in the right (x = 24.4, y = -1.7, z = -17.4) in 68% of studies. In a second meta-analysis of non-clinical participants only (n = 18), bilateral amygdala was again reported in the left (x = -18, y = 3.9, z = -18.4) and right (x = 22.8, y = -0.9, z = -17.4) in 56% of studies for both clusters. In a final meta-analysis of whole-brain studies only (n=14), bilateral amygdala was also reported in the left (x = -20.2, y = 2.9, z = -17.2) in 64% of studies, and right (x = 24.2, y = -0.7, z = -17.8) in 71% of studies. The findings suggest that non-consciously detected emotional faces may influence amygdala activation, especially right-lateralized (a higher percentage of convergence in studies), which are integral for pre-conscious affect and long-term memory processing.

AB  - Perinatal depression (PND) screening recommendations are made by national, state-based and professional organisations; however, there is disagreement regarding screening timing, provider responsible, screening setting, screening tool as well as the follow-up and referral pathways required post-screening. This systematic review aimed to identify, describe and compare PND screening recommendations from member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Publications were identified through systematically searching PubMed, Google and the Guidelines International Network (GIN). Recommendations regarding PND screening endorsement, timing, frequency, responsible provider, tools/assessments and follow-up and referral were extracted. Twenty-one publications, including guidelines, from five countries were included. Most made recommendations in support of PND screening using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Details differed regarding terminology used, as well as frequency of screening, follow-up mechanisms and referral pathways. A broad range of health providers were considered to be responsible for screening. This is the first review to identify and compare PND screening recommendations from OECD member countries; however, only online publications published in English, from five countries were included. Heterogeneity of publication types and inconsistency in definitions rendered quality assessment inappropriate. While most publications generally endorsed PND screening, there are exceptions and the associated details pertaining to the actual conduct of screening vary between and within countries. Developing clear, standardised recommendations based on current evidence is necessary to ensure clarity amongst healthcare providers and a comprehensive approach for the early detection of PND.

AB  - Sea cucumbers are amongst the highest value seafoods available commercially, especially in the south-east Asian region, primarily due to their nutritional and health benefits as applied in Traditional Chinese Medicine. While the majority of studies for nutritional products derived from sea cucumber compounds have been conducted in vitro, the number of in vivo and evidence-based human clinical studies are limited. This review has critically assessed the advances in in vivo and clinical studies of sea cucumber-derived bioactives (both extracts and compounds) via a comprehensive literature research on papers published in the last ten years from 2012-2021. Sea cucumber-derived compounds were reported to have the following activities: anticancer, antihyperlipidemic, antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant/antithrombotic, antioxidant, and antihypertension, immunomodulatory, wound healing and as treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These active compounds include triterpene glycosides (saponins), fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (FCS), cerebrosides, glycosaminoglycan, fucoidan, phospholipids, polysaccharides, peptides, long-chain bases, Frondanol A5, acid mucopolysaccharide, and phosphatidylcholines. Gaps, challenges and future directions have been identified and discussed separately to progress different areas of research and to further scientific validation, development and application of sea cucumbers for human health and nutritional products.

AB  - BackgroundPremenstrual syndrome/premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a serious condition affecting women worldwide, causing clinically significant distress or interference. Therefore, solving these diseases has become the utmost concern worldwide, culminating in numerous studies. In this study, we performed bibliometric analysis on the 100 most cited papers with the aim of identifying research hot spots and trends in this field. MethodsWe screened the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) of Web of Science (WOS) to identify the top 100 cited studies on PMS/PMDD. Next, we analyzed relevant literature from various journals, countries/regions, institutions, authors, and keywords. Finally, we used VOSviewer and Citespace software to generate knowledge maps and identify hot spots and trends. ResultsThe top 100 highly cited studies were published in 55 journals, between 1999 and 2017, across 24 countries/regions around the world. Most articles were published in Obstetrics and Gynecology, whereas Psych neuroendocrinology had the largest average number of citations per paper. The United States had the highest number of publications, followed by England, Canada, and Sweden. The top three institutions that published the highly cited literature were the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Obstetrics, Gynecology, Psychiatry, and Reproductive Biology were the main research directions, whereas the top 10 Co-occurrence of Keywords included double-blind, fluoxetine, efficacy, prevalence, epidemiology, phase sertraline treatment, depression, progesterone, placebo, and placebo-controlled trial. Results from cluster analysis indicated that more comprehensive epidemiology and steroid pathogenesis have gradually become the hot spots and trends. ConclusionThese findings demonstrated that bibliometric analysis can intuitively and rapidly reveal the frontiers and hot spots of research in PMS/PMDD. Notably, epidemiology, steroid pathogenesis, GABAA receptor delta subunits, and double-blind placebo-controlled trials are potential areas of focus for future research.

KW  - DEPRESSION
AB  - Background and Aims: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is closely associated with gut-brain interaction disorder (DGBI), characterized by the interaction of gastrointestinal symptoms and central nervous system dysregulation. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has a good concurrent effect in the treatment of FD, especially for patients with concurrent psychological disorders. A meta-analysis was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHMs in the treatment of FD. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese Biological Medical Database (CBM), Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) were searched to collect randomized controlled trials of FD treated with CHM. The retrieval time limit is from the establishment of the database till 11 April 2022. Two researchers independently searched databases, screened documents, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias of included studies. RevMan 5.4 software was used for meta-analysis. Results: A total of 11 studies including 951 patients were included. The study was divided into two parts. The first part included 5 clinical trials, including 471 patients. The experimental group was treated only with CHM and the control group was only treated with placebo. The results of first part showed that the total effective rate of CHM in the treatment of FD was higher than that in the placebo group (84.5 vs. 49.4%) [relative risk (RR) = 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.13, 2.75); P = 0.01]. In addition, CHM treatment could reduce the total symptom score [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -10.05; 95% CI (-13.50, -6.59); Z = 5.70; P < 0.0001] and depression score [SMD = -7.68; 95% CI (-14.43, -0.94); Z = 2.23; P = 0.03]. The second part included 6 clinical trials, including 480 patients. The experimental group was only treated with CHM and the control group was treated with prokinetic agents combined with flupentixol melitracen (deanxit). The results of second part showed that the total effective rate of CHM in the treatment of FD was higher than that of the control group (92.6 vs. 78.8%) [RR = 1.17; 95% CI (1.09, 1.26), P < 0.0001]. In addition, CHM treatment could reduce HAMA score [mean difference (MD) = -3.19; 95% CI (-3.79, -2.59); Z = 10.40; P < 0.00001], HAMD score [MD = -4.32; 95% CI (-6.04, -2.61); Z = 4.94; P < 0.00001], and gastric emptying rate [MD = 12.62; 95% CI (5.84, 19.40); Z = 3.65; P = 0.0003]. The results of the two parts of the meta-analysis showed no serious adverse reactions, and there was no significant difference in the adverse reactions between the experimental group and the control group [MD = 1.14; 95% CI (0.53, 2.42); Z = 0.33; P = 0.74]; [MD = 0.14; 95% CI (0.01, 2.67); Z = 1.30; P = 0.19]. Conclusion: The current evidence shows that CHM treatment has great potential and safety in alleviating the symptoms of FD and improving the psychological disorders of anxiety and depression in patients with FD. Limited by the quantity and quality of the included studies and other biases, the above conclusions need more high-quality studies to be verified.

AB  - Urbanisation processes and anthropogenic actions led to a significant increase in pollution levels, with relevant consequences on global health. In particular, noise pollution demonstrated an association with cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory diseases. Furthermore, increasing evidence underlined the possible role of air and noise pollution in the development of psychiatric disorders. In this narrative review, evidence concerning the relationship between noise pollution and the emergence of psychiatric symptoms or psychiatric disorders is summarised. After the literature search process was completed, 40 papers were included in the present review. The exposure to road-, rail-, and air- traffic represented a risk factor for the emergence of affective disorders. This could also be mediated by the occurrence of circadian rhythms disturbances or by noise annoyance and noise sensitivity, both influencing psychological well-being and health-related quality of life. Fewer studies concentrated on special populations, particularly pregnant women and children, for whom noise pollution was confirmed as a risk factor for psychopathology. The better clarification of the complex interaction between noise pollution and mental health may help to identify subjects at risk and targeting specific prevention and intervention strategies in the urban environment.

AB  - We performed an umbrella review on environmental risk/protective factors and biomarkers for postpartum depressive symptoms to establish a hierarchy of evidence. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception until 12 January 2021. We included systematic reviews providing meta-analyses related to our research objectives. Methodological quality was assessed by AMSTAR 2, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated by GRADE. This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021230784). We identified 30 articles, which included 45 environmental risk/protective factors (154,594 cases, 7,302,273 population) and 9 biomarkers (2018 cases, 16,757 population). The credibility of evidence was convincing (class I) for antenatal anxiety (OR 2.49, 1.91-3.25) and psychological violence (OR 1.93, 1.54-2.42); and highly suggestive (class II) for intimate partner violence experience (OR 2.86, 2.12-3.87), intimate partner violence during pregnancy (RR 2.81, 2.11-3.74), smoking during pregnancy (OR 2.39, 1.78-3.2), history of premenstrual syndrome (OR 2.2, 1.81-2.68), any type of violence experience (OR 2.04, 1.72-2.41), primiparity compared to multiparity (RR 1.76, 1.59-1.96), and unintended pregnancy (OR 1.53,

AB  - This article aimed to investigate the effects of menstrual cycle phases on perceptual responses in athletes by means of systematic review and meta-analysis. The search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Sport Discus databases considering articles with two or more menstrual phases for comparison. The PECO criteria were used for the keywords "menstrual cycle," "athletes," and "perceptual responses" with their respective entry terms. Of 1.165 records identified, 14 articles were available for the final evaluation, while eight articles were eligible for a meta-analysis. The perceptual responses evaluated in the studies were: motivation, competitiveness, sleep quality, stress, muscle soreness, fatigue, perceived effort, mood, menstrual symptoms, perceived endurance, and readiness. The meta-analysis was conducted for perceived effort only. The results showed that the level of perceived exertion does not differ two phases of the menstrual cycle (MD = 3.03, Q = 1.58, df = 1, p = 0.209), whereas RPE was 19.81 +/- 0.05 and 16.27 +/- 0.53 at day 1-5 and day 19-24, respectively. Two studies found statistically significant changes in motivation and competitiveness during the cycle, with better outcomes in ovulatory phase compared to follicular and luteal. One study found an increase in mood disturbance in the pre-menstrual phase (vs. mid-cycle); one decreased vigor in the menstrual phase (vs. luteal); one increased the menstrual symptoms in the follicular phase (vs. ovulation), and one study reported increased fatigue and decreased sleep quality on luteal phase (vs. follicular). The remaining studies and variables were not affected by the menstrual cycle phase. Based on the results from the studies selected, some perceptual responses are affected in different menstrual cycle phases. A "favorable" subjective response in athletes was noticed when the ovarian hormones present an increase in concentration levels compared to phases with lower concentration. Different perceptual variables and methodological approaches limit the generalization of the conclusion.

AB  - Friendships are vital to mental health and well-being. Understanding autistic individuals' lived experiences of friendship is necessary to support friendship development. A scoping review exploring autistic individuals' experiences of friendship was undertaken to understand their perspectives of friendship. Electronic database and manual reference searches identified twenty-two studies exploring autistic perspectives of friendship. Results were synthesised using a meta-ethnographic approach across the lifespan. Findings highlight the common and unique experiences of friendship among autistic individuals. While autistic individuals defined friendship based on homophily and propinquity, similar to non-autistic individuals, unique challenges including friendship insecurity, monotropism and efforts to conform to neurotypical social norms, leading to anxiety, were experienced by autistic individuals.

AB  - The use of low doses of psychedelic substances (microdosing) is attracting increasing interest. This systematic review summarises all empirical microdosing research to date, including a set of infrequently cited studies that took place prior to prohibition. Specifically, we reviewed 44 studies published between 1955 and 2021, and summarised reported effects across six categories: mood and mental health; wellbeing and attitude; cognition and creativity; personality; changes in conscious state; and neurobiology and physiology. Studies showed a wide range in risk of bias, depending on design, age, and other study characteristics. Laboratory studies found changes in pain perception, time perception, conscious state, and neurophysiology. Self-report studies found changes in cognitive processing and mental health. We review data related to expectation and placebo effects, but argue that claims that microdosing effects are largely due to expectancy are premature and possibly wrong. In addition, we attempt to clarify definitional inconsistencies in the microdosing literature by providing suggested dose ranges across different substances. Finally, we provide specific design suggestions to facilitate more rigorous future research.

AB  - Anxiety is often conceptualised as the prototypical disorder of interoception (one's perception of bodily states). Whilst theoretical models predict an association between interoceptive accuracy and anxiety, empirical work has produced mixed results. This manuscript presents a pre-registered systematic review (https://osf.io/2h5xz) and meta-analysis of 55 studies, obtained via a Pubmed search on 9th November 2020, examining the relationship between state and trait anxiety and objectively measured cardiac interoceptive accuracy as assessed by heartbeat counting and discrimination tasks. Potential moderators of this relationship - the age, gender and clinical diagnoses of participants, the anxiety measures used and the study design - were also explored. Overall, we found no evidence for an association between cardiac interoceptive accuracy and anxiety, with none of the factors examined moderating this finding. We discuss the implications these findings have for future research, with a particular focus on the need for further investigation of the relationship between anxiety and other facets of interoception.

AB  - Background: Rates of mental health problems among youth are high and rising, whereas treatment seeking in this population remains low. Technology-delivered interventions (TDIs) appear to be promising avenues for broadening the reach of evidence-based interventions for youth well-being. However, to date, meta-analytic reviews on youth samples have primarily been limited to computer and internet interventions, whereas meta-analytic evidence on mobile TDIs (mTDIs), largely comprising mobile apps for smartphones and tablets, have primarily focused on adult samples. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mTDIs for a broad range of well-being outcomes in unselected, at-risk, and clinical samples of youth. Methods: The systematic review used 5 major search strategies to identify 80 studies evaluating 83 wellness-and mental health-focused mTDIs for 19,748 youth (mean age 2.93-26.25 years). We conducted a 3-level meta-analysis on the full sample and a subsample of the 38 highest-quality studies. Results: Analyses demonstrated significant benefits of mTDIs for youth both at posttest (g=0.27) and follow-up (range 1.21-43.14 weeks; g=0.26) for a variety of psychosocial outcomes, including general well-being and distress, symptoms of diverse psychological disorders, psychosocial strategies and skills, and health-related symptoms and behaviors. Effects were significantly moderated by the type of comparison group (strongest for no intervention, followed by inert placebo or information-only, and only marginal for clinical comparison) but only among the higher-quality studies. With respect to youth characteristics, neither gender nor pre-existing mental health risk level (not selected for risk, at-risk, or clinical) moderated effect sizes; however, effects increased with the age of youth in the higher-quality studies. In terms of intervention features, mTDIs in these research studies were effective regardless of whether they included various technological features (eg, tailoring, social elements, or gamification) or support features (eg, orientation, reminders, or coaching), although the use of mTDIs in a research context likely differs in important ways from their use when taken up through self-motivation, parent direction, peer suggestion, or clinician referral. Only mTDIs with a clear prescription for frequent use (ie, at least once per week) showed significant effects, although this effect was evident only in the higher-quality subsample. Moderation analyses did not detect statistically significant differences in effect sizes based on the prescribed duration of mTDI use (weeks or sessions), and reporting issues in primary studies limited the analysis of completed duration, thereby calling for improved methodology, assessment, and reporting to clarify true effects. Conclusions: Overall, this study's findings demonstrate that youth can experience broad and durable benefits of mTDIs, delivered in a variety of ways, and suggest directions for future research and development of mTDIs for youth, particularly in more naturalistic and ecologically valid settings.

AB  - Background: It has been identified that military veterans have distinct experiences of loneliness and social isolation and, when comparing this community to other client groups with a PTSD diagnosis, veterans respond less favorably to treatment. However, the link between PTSD and loneliness for veterans remains insufficiently researched and it is unclear if there are effective interventions tackling this distinct experience of loneliness. Aims: This systematic narrative review aimed to synthesize existing evidence incorporating elements of social connection, social isolation, and loneliness within interventions for military veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD, consequently aiming to examine the impact of such interventions upon this community. Methods: Six databases were searched, utilizing relevant search criteria, with no date restrictions. Articles were included if they involved intervention or treatment for military veterans with PTSD and considered elements of social connection, social isolation, and/or loneliness. The initial search returned 202 papers. After exclusions, removal of duplications, and a reference/citation search, 28 papers remained and were included in this review. Results: From the 28 studies, 11 directly addressed social isolation and two studies directly addressed loneliness. Six themes were generated: (i) rethinking the diagnosis of PTSD, (ii) holistic interventions, (iii) peer support, (iv) social reintegration, (v) empowerment through purpose and community, and (vi) building trust. Conclusions: A direct focus upon social reintegration and engagement, psychosocial functioning, building trust, peer support, group cohesiveness and empowerment through a sense of purpose and learning new skills may mitigate experiential loneliness and social isolation for veterans with PTSD. Future research and practice should further explore the needs of the PTSD-diagnosed veteran community, seek to explore and identify potential common routes toward the development of PTSD within this community and consider bespoke interventions for tackling loneliness.

AB  - BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant mortality and morbidity in the United States. The mental health impact during the pandemic was huge and affected all age groups and population types. We reviewed the existing literature to understand the present trends of psychological challenges and different coping strategies documented across different vulnerable sections of the United States population. This rapid review was carried out to investigate the trends in psychological impacts, coping ways, and public support during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in the United States. Materials and MethodsWe undertook a rapid review of the literature following the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We searched PubMed as it is a widely available database for observational and experimental studies that reported the psychological effects, coping ways, and public support on different age groups and healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. ResultsWe included thirty-five studies in our review and reported data predominantly from the vulnerable United States population. Our review findings indicate that COVID-19 has a considerable impact on the psychological wellbeing of various age groups differently, especially in the elderly population and HCWs. Review findings suggest that factors like children, elderly population, female gender, overconcern about family, fear of getting an infection, personality, low spirituality, and lower resilience levels were at a higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during this pandemic. Systemic support, higher resilience levels, and adequate knowledge were identified as protecting and preventing factors. There is a paucity of similar studies among the general population, and we restricted our review specifically to vulnerable subgroups of the population. All the included studies in our review investigated and surveyed the psychological impacts, coping skills, and public support system during the COVID-19 pandemic. ConclusionThe evidence to date suggests that female gender, child and elderly population, and racial factors have been affected by a lack of support for psychological wellbeing. Further, research using our hypothesized framework might help any population group to deal with a pandemic-associated mental health crisis, and in that regard, analysis of wider societal structural factors is recommended.

AB  - Although the relationship is complex, there is an association between alcohol use and offending behavior with an interplay between the amount drank, the pattern of drinking and individual and contextual factors. Alcohol brief interventions have been shown to be effective in primary healthcare, however there is currently a lack of compelling evidence in the criminal justice system. We carried out a rapid systematic review of the literature, which updated our review conducted in 2016. Following systematic searches, we included 36 papers on prevalence and 13 papers on effectiveness. Between 26 and 88% of individuals in the policy custody setting scored positive for an alcohol use disorder. In the magistrates court this was 95%; 31-86% in the probation setting and between 19 and 86% in the prison system. In relation to probable dependence, between 21 and 38% of individuals were shown to have probable alcohol dependence in the police custody suite setting; 39 per cent in the magistrate court system; 17-36% in the probation setting and between 18 and 48% in the prison system. This compares to 6% in the general population. We included 13 studies of effectiveness with differing outcome measures and outcomes. We conclude more studies are needed in the field to develop the current evidence base.

AB  - Purpose: The main purpose of our systematic review was to investigate the effect of peer-led intervention on self-stigma in individuals with mental health problems. Secondary purpose was investigating the impact of peer intervention on clinical symptoms, recovery-related outcomes, and disclosure-related outcomes. Methods: Five electronic databases were searched from 1975 to 2021. Literature databases were searched for randomized controlled trials. From the perspective of key outcomes, a meta-analysis of the effects of peer-led interventions on changing stigma was conducted. Results: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials targeting different target groups with mental health problems (e.g., adolescents, college students, family members of mentally ill persons, unemployed persons, etc.) was conducted. It was found that, at the end of the intervention, intervention had a positive effect on main outcomes such as self-stigma and stress from stigma. As for secondary outcomes, there was no significant influence on clinical symptoms. There was a positive effect on rehabilitation and empowerment, but without a statistical significance. There was a statistically significant effect on self-efficacy and professional help seeking. There was a statistically significant effect on confidentiality and disclosure-related distress in the Honest Open Proud (HOP) subgroup. There was no significant influence on confidentiality and withdrawal in the non-HOP subgroup. Conclusion: Peer-led intervention can reduce self-stigma and stigma pressure and might improve recovery and empowerment. It increases self-efficacy and willingness to seek professional help, but has no significant effect on clinical symptoms and withdrawal. HOP intervention has positive effects on disclosure-related confidentiality and pain.

AB  - Neurological disorders (NDs) are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction leading to synaptic failure, cognitive impairment, and motor injury. Among these diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have raised a significant research interest. These disorders present common neuropathological signs, including neuronal dysfunction, protein accumulation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial abnormalities. In this context, mitochondrial impairment is characterized by a deficiency in ATP production, excessive production of reactive oxygen species, calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial transport failure, and mitochondrial dynamics deficiencies. These defects in mitochondrial health could compromise the synaptic process, leading to early cognitive dysfunction observed in these NDs. Interestingly, skin fibroblasts from AD, PD, HD, and ALS patients have been suggested as a useful strategy to investigate and detect early mitochondrial abnormalities in these NDs. In this context, fibroblasts are considered a viable model for studying neurodegenerative changes due to their metabolic and biochemical relationships with neurons. Also, studies of our group and others have shown impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics in fibroblasts from patients diagnosed with sporadic and genetic forms of AD, PD, HD, and ALS. Interestingly, these mitochondrial abnormalities have been observed in the brain tissues of patients suffering from the same pathologies. Therefore, fibroblasts represent a novel strategy to study the genesis and progression of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, PD, HD, and ALS. This review discusses recent evidence that proposes fibroblasts as a potential target to study mitochondrial bioenergetics impairment in neurological disorders and consequently to search for new biomarkers of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Striving for an integrated semi-natural stream-floodplain system as restoration target would optimally serve biodiversity and the provisioning of ecosystem services. This pursuit is currently limited by multiple pressures and constraints that come with, amongst others, a high human population density and intensive land-use. To be able to weigh the ecological and societal needs in lowland-stream watersheds, we analysed the developments in lowland-stream restoration in relation to the actual and potential state of ecosystems services these systems provide. To reach an ecological-societal balance in stream restoration, we pose five steps: (i) Choose a clear and realistic restoration target, (ii) Map and quantify environmental stressors at local to watershed scale, (iii) Map and quantify biological indicators at local to regional scale, (iv) List potential restoration measures to remove or mitigate stressors, and (v) Build scenarios, composed of combinations of measures fitting the societal context of the watershed. The most promising scenarios make use of watershed processes and involve establishing a transverse landscape zonation, from the streams' riparian zone to the uplands. Such landscape transition poses a challenge for policy makers and implies a strong societal change. Therefore, a framework is provided with building blocks that help to find a suitable balance in practice.

AB  - BackgroundCyberchondria has been brought into sharp focus during the COVID-19 health emergency; it refers to individuals who obsessively and compulsively search for health information online, resulting in excessive health concerns. Recent scholarship focuses on its obsessive and compulsive aspect, following a biopsychosocial approach as opposed to a pathology of health anxiety. It lacks interpretation of the socio-psychological dynamics between the dimensions. ObjectiveThis review aims to propose a holistic view toward understanding cyberchondria as an obsessive-compulsive syndrome and considers possible interventions. It specifically seeks to explain cyberchondria from diversified mediator variables and to pinpoint connections between each perspective. MethodologyComprehensive searches of databases such as PubMed and Springer were conducted to identify English articles relating to cyberchondria from 2001 to 2022. Based on a systematic filtering process, 27 articles were finally reviewed. FindingsThe authors compare and confirm three forecasts to predict cyberchondria, associating it with individual metacognition, uncertainty of unverified information, and algorithm-driven, biased information environments. ValueTheoretically, a holistic framework is proposed to explain the obsessive and compulsive features of cyberchondria. Clinically, the research calls for more professional psychoeducation and chain screening of cyberchondria and other psychological disorders. Socially, it promotes support for risk-sensitive, information-deficient groups during pandemics like COVID-19. It also stresses more careful use of algorithm-driven search engine technology for platforms delivering medical information. Future research may explore areas such as the association between cyberchondria and other social-related disorders, as well as correlations among cyberchondria, obsessive and compulsive disorders, medical trust, and algorithm-driven search results.

AB  - This systematic literature review examines research on religiosity and happiness within the Muslim population. Earlier investigations predominantly focused on Christianity and happiness in Western countries and found a significant positive association. This literature review was conducted to investigate research exploring the relationship between religiosity and happiness among Muslims. A literature search identified 59 papers examining this relationship between the years 2000 and 2020. Standard quality assessment criteria were used to assess the quality of the selected papers. Each paper was scored by two independent researchers and several of the papers were excluded due to not meeting inclusion criteria or scoring below .55 in the quality assessment. Some 49 studies were included in this literature review, which found a positive correlation between happiness and religiosity within the Muslim population. Furthermore, most studies posited a significant relationship between the variables. This paper explores this suggested positive correlation further, highlights the limitations of the research, and discusses the implications of the findings.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) may be a major concern in military and veteran populations, and the aims of this systematic review were to (1) provide best available estimates of overall prevalence based on studies that are most representative of relevant populations, and (2) contextualise these via examination of IPV types, impacts, and context. An electronic search of PsycINFO, CINHAL, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases identified studies utilising population-based designs or population screening strategies to estimate prevalence of IPV perpetration or victimisation reported by active duty (AD) military personnel or veterans. Random effects meta-analyses were used for quantitative analyses and were supplemented by narrative syntheses of heterogeneous data. Thirty-one studies involving 172,790 participants were included in meta-analyses. These indicated around 13% of all AD personnel and veterans reported any recent IPV perpetration, and around 21% reported any recent victimisation. There were higher rates of IPV perpetration in studies of veterans and health service settings, but no discernible differences were found according to gender, era of service, or country of origin. Psychological IPV was the most common form identified, while there were few studies of IPV impacts, or coercive and controlling behaviours. The findings demonstrate that IPV perpetration and victimisation occur commonly among AD personnel and veterans and highlight a strong need for responses across military and veteran-specific settings. However, there are gaps in understanding of impacts and context for IPV, including coercive and controlling behaviours, which are priority considerations for future research and policy.

AB  - Background: US federal and subfederal immigrant-related policy activity has increased in recent years. We hypothesize that these policies are structural determinants of health for Latinx communities, operating through access to resources, discriminatory enforcement, and stress. Methods: We searched seven databases for quantitative studies, published as of September 2021, examining the association between the presence of federal, state, or local immigrant-related policy(ies), over time or cross-sectionally, and mental or physical health outcomes among immigrant or US-born Latinx adults. We rated studies on methodologic quality. Results: Eleven studies were included. Policies included federal and state policies. Health outcomes included mental health (seven studies), self-rated health (n = 6), and physical disability (n = 1). Among immigrant, noncitizen, or Spanish-preferring Latinx adults, exclusionary policies were associated with poor self-rated health, physical disability, and poor mental health. Inclusive policies were associated with better health, although null findings were more common than among studies of exclusionary policies. Only three studies separately examined policy effects on US-born or citizen Latinx adults and these findings were often null. All studies received a weak overall study quality rating; among quality domains, studies were strongest in confounding control and weakest in outcome information bias and reporting missing data approaches. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that immigrant-related policies, especially exclusionary policies, are structural drivers of health for immigrant or noncitizen Latinx adults. However, evidence is scant among US-born or citizen Latinx adults. Studies of policies and physical health outcomes besides disability are lacking, as are results disaggregated by nativity and/or citizenship status.

AB  - (1) Background: A traumatic birth can lead to the development of childbirth-related posttraumatic stress symptoms or disorder (CB-PTS/D). Literature has identified the risk factors for developing CB-PTS/D within the first six months postpartum thoroughly. However, the impact of mode of birth on CB-PTS/D beyond 6 months postpartum is scarcely studied. (2) Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in the databases PubMed, Embase and CINAHL and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Studies were included if they reported the impact of mode of birth on CB-PTS/D beyond 6 months postpartum. (3) Results: In total, 26 quantitative and 2 qualitative studies were included. In the quantitative studies the percentage of women with CB-PTS/D ranged from 0.7% to 42% (between six months and five years postpartum). Compared with vaginal birth, operative vaginal birth, and emergency caesarean section were associated with CB-PTS/D beyond 6 months postpartum. Qualitative studies revealed that some women were suffering from CB-PTS/D as long as 18 years after birth. (4) Conclusions: Long- term screening of women for PTSD in the postnatal period could be beneficial. More research is needed on models of care that help prevent CB-PTS/D, identifying women at risk and factors that maintain CB-PTS/D beyond 6 months postpartum.

   Methods: International electronic databases, including Web of Science, Medline through PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, were searched on Dec 23, 2018. The search strategy was developed using main words, including firefighter, resilience, and indicators. Then, the indicators related to firefighters??? resilience were extracted and analyzed using a qualitative synthesis method.
   Results: Overall, 7178 unique documents were identified by searching different databases. Then, by screening the title and abstract, 7104 articles were excluded, and only 74 full text papers were critically studied. Finally, 31 full text articles were selected for the analysis. Quality appraisal of included studies done by modified STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) tool. Moreover, 186 indicators and cri-teria were extracted from the included studies and classified into 6 domains and 15 categories.
   Conclusion: This study suggests six main domains, including physical health, physical fitness, mental health, life style, job-related competencies, and demographic status, to categorize different indicators of firefighters' resilience. Building resilience in firefighters requires all these domains to be considered in the assessment, planning, and evaluation processes.

AB  - The present meta-analysis was performed to compare Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality factors between (i) patients with a bipolar mood disorder (BMD) and healthy controls (HC), (ii) patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and HC, and (iii) two diagnostic categories of BMD and BPD. The literature systematic search was performed on PubMed (Medline) for all articles published in English from January 1990 to June 2021 (PROSPERO-CRD42021267855). The pooled effect sizes were obtained by the standard mean differences (Cohen's d) between cases with BMD and BPD and HC using the random-effects method. Egger's test and I2 > 50 were used to detect possible publication bias and heterogeneity, respectively. Due to the limited number of studies to compare FFM factors between these two diagnostic categories, we compared the standard z-scores extracted from two separate analyzes for each disorder. Eleven case-control studies were entered into the meta-analysis. The results show that there are significant differences between the two diagnostic categories and HC in all FFM factors, except openness for BMD. Based on z-scores, we found that the two diagnostic categories are different in neuroticism (BMDBPD), openness (BMD > BPD), and agreeableness (BMD > BPD). There was no difference between the two disorders in conscientiousness (P= 0.279). Our results suggest that profiles of personality factors distinguish BMD and BPD from HC and each other. Except for the conscientiousness factor, in other factors, BPD shows a greater tendency toward general personality psychopathology.

AB  - Context: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease worldwide. Vascular dementia isa neurodegenerative disorder characterized by gradual cognitive impairment. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes result in VaD, markedly distributing cerebral blood flow and decreasing patients' cognitive and memory performance. Due to their high energy demands, neurons are more sensitive to cellular architecture changes and exposed to mitochondrial stress than other cell types. Mitochondrial dysfunction and selective autophagy of mitochondria, known as mitophagy, are associated with VaD. This review aims to elucidate the association between mitophagy and VaD.Evidence Acquisition: This review was conducted independently by at least two researchers dominant in various VaD studies. We searched databases including Elsevier, Google Scholar, and PubMed using the terms 'vascular dementia', 'vascular cognitive impair-ment', and 'mitophagy'. We evaluated 70 articles on the relationship between VaD and mitophagy and interpreted the results. Adobe Photoshop 2022 was used for drawing figures by researchers. Results: The autophagy process plays a protective role in experimental VaD models via preserving vascular integrity and the struc-ture of the blood-brain barrier, upregulating occludin and claudin protein expressions, reducing oxidative stress, and decreasing cognitive dysfunction. Some studies claim that autophagy could have adverse effects in a time-dependent manner against neuronal injury. Prolonged autophagy and overexpressed autophagic proteins induce ischemic injury and cause neuronal cells to undergo apoptotic cell death.Conclusions: Although there are limited studies on the activation of mitophagy-related pathways in VaD, and the definitive role of mitophagy in neuronal healing is unclear, further research is needed to elucidate mitophagy pathways in neurons.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Considerably less is known about self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) in preadolescence than older age groups, owing partly to the common view that young children are incapable of suicidal thoughts. Yet, preadolescent suicide has increased in recent years and is now the fifth leading cause of death in this age group, leading the National Institute of Mental Health to identify it as a priority for research and intervention.
   OBJECTIVE To assess prevalence estimates of preadolescent SITBs, identify correlates of these outcomes, and conduct head-to-head comparisons of preadolescent and adolescent SITBs in terms of associated characteristics.
   DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase were systematically searched from inception through December 23, 2021, for studies on the prevalence and correlates of preadolescent SITBs. The search was restricted to English language publications and peer-reviewed journals.
   STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently identified studies providing data on prevalence and correlates of preadolescent SITBs.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently extracted data from each study, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies was used to assess study quality. Pooled prevalence and Cohen d were derived from random-effects meta-analyses. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide deaths, and nonsuicidal self-injury among preadolescents.
   RESULTS Fifty-eight studies with 626 486 590 individuals were included. Lifetime prevalence of suicide in the general population was 0.79 per 1 million children. Prevalence for lifetime suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and nonsuicidal self-injury among preadolescents were 15.1%, 2.6%, and 6.2%, respectively, in community samples. These data suggest that approximately 17.0% of preadolescents with suicidal ideation transition to attempting suicide. Across several analyses, male individuals appear more likely to have SITBs in preadolescence than adolescence. Correlate data were modest for SITBs other than suicidal ideation, but among specific disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (suicidal ideation: d = 0.54 [95% CI, 0.34-0.75]) and depression (suicidal ideation: d = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.71-1.09]; suicide attempts: d = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.26-0.68]) emerged as the strongest correlates. Among interpersonal factors, child maltreatment (suicidal ideation: d = 2.62 [95% CI, 1.56-3.67]) and parental support (suicidal ideation: d = -0.34 [95% CI, -0.46 to -0.22]) yielded the largest effect sizes.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review anda meta-analysis, although preadolescent suicide deaths were rare, other SITB types occur with concerning frequency. Male individuals were at greater risk for SITBs in preadolescence relative to adolescence. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, child maltreatment, and parental support were especially relevant to suicidal ideation, as well as depression for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, in this age group. Further study, especially of SITBs other than suicidal ideation, is needed.
   This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses prevalence estimates of preadolescent self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, identifies correlates of these outcomes, and conducts head-to-head comparisons of preadolescent and adolescent self-injurious thoughts and behaviors in terms of associated characteristics.

AB  - Robust population-based research has established that sexual and gender minority youths (SGMYs) are at an increased risk of mental ill-health, but there is a dearth of literature that seeks to explore how to best support SGMY mental wellbeing. This scoping review aims to identify findings related to coping strategies and/or interventions for building resilience and/or enhancing the mental wellbeing of SGMYs. PRISMA extension for scoping review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines was utilized for this review. Studies were included if they were peer-reviewed papers containing primary data; reported psycho-social coping strategies for SGMY; were conducted with SGMYs in the adolescent age range; and were published in English. MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched. Of the 3692 papers initially identified, 68 papers were included with 24 intervention-focused studies of 17 unique interventions found. The most commonly cited therapeutic modality was cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (n = 11 studies). Despite the need to support the mental wellbeing of SGMYs, few interventions focused on this area and unique populations have been reported upon in the peer-reviewed literature. As a result, there is considerable potential to develop supports for SGMYs.

AB  - Research advances have shed new insight into cellular pathways contributing to PD pathogenesis and offer increasingly compelling therapeutic targets. In this review, we made a broad survey of the published literature that report possible disease-modifying effects on PD. While there are many studies that demonstrate benefits for various therapies for PD in animal and human studies, we confined our search to human "randomised controlled trials" and with the key words "neuroprotection" or "disease-modifying". It is hoped that through studying the results of these trials, we might clarify possible mechanisms that underlie idiopathic PD. This contrasts with studying the effect of pathophysiology of familial PD, which could be carried out by gene knockouts and animal models. Randomised controlled trials indicate promising effects of MAO-B inhibitors, dopamine agonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, therapies related to improving glucose utilization and energy production, therapies related to reduction of excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, statin use, therapies related to iron chelation, therapies related to the use of phytochemicals, and therapies related to physical exercise and brain reward pathway on slowing PD progression. Cumulatively, these approaches fall into two categories: direct enhancement of dopaminergic signalling, and reduction of neurodegeneration. Overlaps between the two categories result in challenges in distinguishing between symptomatic versus disease-modifying effects with current clinical trial designs. Nevertheless, a broad-based approach allows us to consider all possible therapeutic avenues which may be neuroprotective. While the traditional standard of care focuses on symptomatic management with dopaminergic drugs, more recent approaches suggest ways to preserve dopaminergic neurons by attenuating excitotoxicity and oxidative stress.

AB  - Medical conditions can increase drowning risk. No prior study has systematically reviewed the published evidence globally regarding medical conditions and drowning risk for adults. MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO (ProQuest) and SPORTDiscus databases were searched for original research published between 1 January 2005 and 31 October 2021 that reported adult (>= 15 years) fatal or non-fatal drowning of all intents and pre-existing medical conditions. Conditions were grouped into the relevant International Classifications of Diseases (ICD) codes. Eighty-three studies were included (85.5% high-income countries; 38.6% East Asia and Pacific region; 75.9% evidence level III-3). Diseases of the nervous system (n = 32 studies; 38.6%), mental and behavioural conditions (n = 31; 37.3%) and diseases of the circulatory system (n = 25; 30.1%) were the most common categories of conditions. Epilepsy was found to increase the relative risk of drowning by 3.8 to 82 times, with suggested preventive approaches regarding supervised bathing or showering. Drowning is a common suicide method for those with schizophrenia, psychotic disorders and dementia. Review findings indicate people with pre-existing medical conditions drown, yet relatively few studies have documented the risk. There is a need for further population-level research to more accurately quantify drowning risk for pre-existing medical conditions in adults, as well as implementing and evaluating population-level attributable risk and prevention strategies.

KW  - progressive supra-nuclear palsy
AB  - Background/Objective: Neurosyphilis can be associated with a variety of clinical manifestations. There are only a few cases of neurosyphilis associated with parkinsonism-plus syndromes (PPSs) that have been reported in the literature. We describe a case of an elderly woman who presented with abnormal gait and progressive visual disturbance, probably secondary to neurosyphilis.
   Methods: Literature search was performed in Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, Scielo, and ScienceDirect using a set of terms that included parkinsonism, tremor, and syphilis.
   Case Report: A 64-year-old female was admitted because of vision problems, gait disturbances, and cognitive impairment. The neurological examination revealed bradykinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor. The pupils were bilaterally small and reacted in size to a near object but did not constrict when exposed to bright light. The conjugate eye movements showed a defective downward gaze. On neuropsychological examination, the mini-mental state exam showed a moderate cognitive impairment. Reduced phonemic fluency was observed. A positive serum venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test was noted. A cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed positive VDRL. Brain and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging was normal. An electro-encephalogram showed diffused slow waves. Penicillin G was started. Six months after, the patient had a full recovery of her conjugate eye movements and cognitive functions. Upon further questioning, the patient reported no response with a levodopa attempt.
   Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, two individuals developed progressive supra-nuclear palsy (PSP), and one presented corticobasal degeneration (CBD), probably associated with neurosyphilis. This is the second case to document the occurrence of a progressive supra-nuclear palsy because of syphilis.

AB  - Background: Child labor remains a health hazard, affecting the mental, physical, and emotional well-being of children. Children engage in waste management through various channels while constantly working to create a healthier and cleaner environment and exposing themselves to numerous health risks. Thus, this scoping review aims to explore the occupational injuries, health hazards, and sufferings of child waste workers in South Asia. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a scoping review of available relevant scientific literature was completed to comprehensively analyze the extent of child waste workers' health suffering. Online databases PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar were searched for predefined criteria. Collected references were screened with Rayyan web tools and Endnote. Based on study inclusion criteria, a thematic synthesis was performed on the findings of 12 articles. Results: This study's findings provided deep insights into the most prevalent occupational health sufferings among child waste workers, as depicted in the available literature. Prevalence of injuries like cuts and wounds was found predominant. These injuries are caused by the collection, transportation, dumping, and recycling of waste. Respiratory, musculoskeletal, and skin diseases are more prevalent among child waste worker children than in control groups of the same socioeconomic backgrounds. A higher chance of genetic or neuro-degenerative disorder and DNA mutation indicates a long-term effect on the children working in the waste management sector. Psychological sufferings were the least explored, although very common among child laborers. MPD (Minor Psychiatric Disorder) was very high among waste workers. Regarding healthcare-seeking behavior, traditional methods are preferable rather than formal health facilities. More research is required in this area due to a lack of evidence on the health problems of child waste workers. Conclusions: Occupational hazards were myriad among child waste workers. Though many children are involved in waste management, they are typically excluded from mainstream child protection and support systems, making them more exposed to occupational harassment and injury. Policymakers should design specific programs for these vulnerable groups considering the issues below, i.e., provide protective equipment such as facemasks, gloves, footwear, and rag sorting tools to safeguard them from physical damage and illness, ensure access to health care, to school, and provide basic nutrients to them. Furthermore, the authorities should think of alternative income generating programs for these groups of children.

Methods: The review used the PRISMA statement and Whittemore and Knafl guidelines. The search engines Scopus, PubMed, Ovid (PsycINFO), and CINAHL were searched for articles published in English. Results: This review included 30 studies that met the criteria. Physical, psychological, and social factors were associated with HF caregiver burden. HF caregiver interventions included health education, post-discharge home visits, phone calls, counseling, and support groups that demonstrated some potential to reduce the caregivers' burden. Discussion: Healthcare provider team should screen for caregiver burden and promote healthy behaviors, and strategies to improve quality of life. Further studies should include caregivers as care team members and embed social networking in the interventions for reducing HF caregiver burden. The caregivers' burden could influence the poor outcomes of care, including physical, psychological, societal, and functional dimensions. Future interventions should develop to alleviate HF caregiver burden.

AB  - Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) affect over half of the adults in the United States and are known to contribute to the development of a wide variety of negative health and behavioral outcomes. The consequences of ACE exposure have been studied in patient populations that include individuals with gynecologic, orthopedic, metabolic, autoimmune, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal conditions among others. Findings indicate that ACEs not only increase risks for chronic pain but also influence emotional responses to pain in many of these individuals. A growing body of research suggests that these effects may be the result of long-lasting changes induced by ACEs in neurobiological systems during early development. However, one area that is still largely unexplored concerns the effects of ACEs on burn patients, who account for almost 450,000 hospitalizations in the United States annually. Patients with severe burns frequently suffer from persistent pain that affects their well-being long after the acute injury, but considerable variability has been observed in the experience of pain across individuals. A literature search was conducted in CINAHL and PubMed to evaluate the possibility that previously documented ACE-induced changes in biological, psychological, and social processes might contribute to these differences. Findings suggest that better understanding of the role that ACEs play in burn outcomes could lead to improved treatment strategies, but further empirical research is needed to identify the predictors and mechanisms that dictate individual differences in pain outcomes in patients with ACE exposure and to clarify the role that ACE-related alterations play in early healing and recovery from burn injuries.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a worldwide public health issue. Almost 2 years into the pandemic, the persistence of symptoms after the acute phase is a well-recognized phenomenon.
   We conducted a scoping review to map cognitive domain impairments, their frequency, and associated psycho-affective disorders in people with a previous COVID-19 infection. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsycInfo to identify relevant reports published between December 1, 2019 and February 21, 2022. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred-Reporting-Items-for-Systematic-Reviews-and-Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping review guidelines.
   Three independent reviewers selected and charted 25 records out of 922. Memory, attention, and executive functions appeared to be the most affected domains. Delayed recall and learning were the most impaired domains of memory. Among the executive functions, abstraction, inhibition, set shifting, and sustained and selective attention were most commonly impaired. Language and visuo-spatial abilities were rarely affected, although this finding might be biased by the scarcity of reports. Neurological and respiratory conditions were often reported in association with cognitive deficits. Results on psycho-affective conditions were inconclusive due to the low frequency of reported data. Admission to an intensive care unit is not related to cognitive deficits.
   This review highlighted a potential effect of a previous post-COVID-19 infection on a pattern of memory, attention, and executive functions impairments. These findings need to be confirmed on larger cohorts with comprehensive neuropsychological batteries and correlated to neurophysiological and neurobiological substrates. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Low resilient students are vulnerable to adversities that hinder academic success and wellbeing. However, little is known about the extent of low resilience among higher education students. We searched 11 electronic education and health-science related databases. We targeted higher education journals and relevant reference lists for published and unpublished articles in English and Chinese up to January 1, 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system were used to assess individual and overall evidence. Meta-analysis was conducted for 41 cross-sectional studies using the Stata software. The pooled prevalence of low resilience was 36% among 13,931 students across 18 countries. Subgroup analysis revealed that resilience measures affected resilience prevalence significantly. A higher prevalence of low resilience was found among dance or nursing students in Europe than those in their counterparts. Univariate meta-regression random-effects analyses did not find any significant covariate effects on prevalence estimates. Quality assessment showed that majority (78.05%) of individual studies was high quality, but the overall evidence was rated low. This study provides the prevalence of low resilience in higher education, identifying vulnerable student groups for targeted intervention. Well-designed observational research with standard resilience measures is recommended for future studies.

AB  - Background and objectives: Fatigue, depression, and anxiety are common burdens present in primary Sjo???gren???s syndrome patients. Those symptoms have all been linked to inflammatory dysregulations. To explore the link between inflammatory biomarkers and fatigue, depression, and anxiety in pSS patients, we aim to do a systematic literature review. Methods: The systematic review protocol and data extraction forms were designed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Our protocol has been registered on Prospero (ID CRD42020161952). The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, and PsycInfo were used, from inception to December 2019. Results: The literature search initially identified 445 articles. Finally, 12 articles were included in this systematic review. The population in studies was quite similar with mainly middle-aged women. Dates of publication extended from 2008 to 2019. Different scales were used to measure fatigue, depression, and/or anxiety. Measured inflammatory biomarkers were very diverse across studies. In consequence, results in the different included studies were disparate. Only one study explored the link between depression/anxiety and inflammatory markers: patients with depression and/or anxiety were compared to pSS patients. Conclusion: Even if the association between fatigue, depression, and/or anxiety with inflammatory markers in pSS is of interest, there are a lot of discrepancies. Sickness behavior and IFN pathways seem to be important in the inflammatory physiopathology of fatigue in pSS, and

AB  - Background: The concept of decision-making capacity (DMC) or competence remains controversial, despite widespread use. Risk-sensitive DMC assessment (RS-DMC)-the idea that the higher the risk involved in a decision, the greater the decisional abilities required for DMC-has been particularly controversial. We conducted a systematic, descriptive review of the arguments for and against RS-DMC to clarify the debate. Methods: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), PsycInfo (American Psychological Association) and Philpapers, updating our search to February 15th, 2022. We targeted peer-reviewed publications in English that argue for or against RS-DMC. Two reviewers independently screened the publications and extracted data from each eligible manuscript. Results: Of 41 eligible publications, 22 supported a risk-sensitive threshold in DMC assessment. Most arguments for RS-DMC rely on its intuitive appeal and practical merits. The arguments against RS-DMC primarily express concerns about paternalism and the seeming asymmetry between consent and refusal; critics of RS-DMC support epistemic, rather than substantive (i.e., variable threshold), risk-sensitivity; counterarguments responding to criticisms of RS-DMC address charges of paternalism and exhibit a notable variety of responses to the issue of asymmetry. Authors used a variety of frameworks regarding the definition of DMC, its elements, and its relation to decisional authority, and these frameworks were significantly associated with positions on RS-DMC. A limitation of our review is that the coding relies on judgment and interpretation. Conclusion: The review suggests that some of the debate about RS-DMC stems from differences in underlying frameworks. Most defenses of RS-DMC rely on its intuitive appeal, while most criticisms reflect concerns about paternalism or the asymmetry between consent and refusal. Defenses of RS-DMC respond to the asymmetry problem in a variety of ways. Further research is needed on the implications of underlying frameworks, the asymmetry problem, and the distinction between epistemic and substantive models of RS-DMC.

Using a previously defined search strategy, the PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched from 1961 to May 2020 for articles on this topic. Twenty-five high-quality articles, involving a total of 2265 participants, met inclusion criteria. According to these results, acceptance is a strategy with promising outcomes for handling pain in healthy populations, although its superiority over other strategies to reduce negative affect, anger, and other pain variables is unclear. The instructions and outcome variables vary widely between studies, and few studies compare acceptance with mindfulness. We discuss these findings and provide information to guide future researchers for designing fine-grained investigations that can address the gaps in this area.

AB  - Introduction: The past decade has seen key advances in early intervention for autistic children in high-income countries, with most evidence based on specialist delivery of interventions. The care gap seen in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) remains close to 100%. A key challenge in addressing this care gap concerns the paucity of specialists available to deliver services. Task-sharing provides an important potential solution; there is a need to identify interventions that are suitable for scaled-up delivery through task-sharing in low-resourced settings. We aimed to conduct a scoping review to identify studies which reported autism intervention delivered by non-specialists within LMIC and, using established frameworks, specify intervention components with evidence of successful non-specialist delivery. Methods: A scoping literature search, conducted within four databases, generated 2,535 articles. Duplicates were removed, followed by screening of titles and abstracts, with 10% double-rated for reliability. 50 full text articles were then screened independently by two raters. Articles were included if studies: (a) were conducted in LMIC; (b) included samples of autistic children (age < 10); (c) evaluated psycho-social interventions delivered by non-specialists; (d) reported child outcomes; and (e) were peer-reviewed full-texts in English. Two established frameworks - @Practicewise and NDBI-Fi framework - were then used to ascertain the commonly delivered components of these interventions. Results: Two studies met the inclusion criteria. Both studies evaluated parent-mediated interventions delivered by non-specialists in South Asia. Through the two frameworks, we identified elements and techniques that had been delivered successfully by non-specialists. Conclusion: There is evidence from two acceptability and feasibility trials that non-specialists can be trained to deliver some intervention elements and techniques within parent-mediated interventions, with good fidelity and acceptability and evidence of effectiveness. The review points up the lack of a widespread evidence base in this area and need for further research in low resourced settings, including well-powered trials and mechanistic analyses to identify active ingredients. A focus on the pre-requisites for non-specialist delivery is critical to reduce inequity and provide universal health coverage within resource-constrained health systems.

AB  - Objective: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), such as physical, emotional, and sexual abuse trigger inflammatory changes and have been associated with many causes of morbidity and mortality, including autoimmune diseases. Although Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating neurological autoimmune disease, literature linking ACEs and MS is understudied. The aim of this review was to examine the 1) state of the literature, and 2) relationships between childhood adversity and the prevalence and physical clinical features of MS (e.g., age at onset, relapses, pain, fatigue, disability). Methods: A comprehensive search was preformed through five databases and by hand using the ancestry and descendancy approach for connections to papers published through January 20th, 2022. Studies were screened by independent reviewers using Rayyan.ai, and critically appraised for both quality and reporting transparency. Results: Twelve studies examined relationships between any ACE(s) and the prevalence or physical clinical features of MS. There was considerable variance in the measurement of stressors, confounders, and categorization of MS; however most studies (n = 10) demonstrated an association between ACEs and MS (alone or grouped with other similar diagnoses), or physical clinical features. Conclusion: Although there are few studies in this area, it is of quickly growing interest. These results should be cautiously interpreted, yet highlight the need for continued work to disentangle and discern true associations.

AB  - While aging is an important risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, age-related cognitive decline can also manifest without apparent neurodegenerative changes. In this review, we discuss molecular, cellular, and network changes that occur during normal aging in the absence of neurodegenerative disease. Emerging findings reveal that these changes include metabolic alterations, oxidative stress, DNA damage, inflammation, calcium dyshomeostasis, and several other hallmarks of age-related neural changes that do not act on their own, but are often interconnected and together may underlie age-related alterations in brain plasticity and cognitive function. Importantly, age-related cognitive decline may not be reduced to a single neurobiological cause, but should instead be considered in terms of a densely connected system that underlies age-related cognitive alterations. We speculate that a decline in one hallmark of neural aging may trigger a decline in other, otherwise thus far stable subsystems, thereby triggering a cascade that may at some point also incur a decline of cognitive functions and mental well-being. Beyond studying the effects of these factors in isolation, considerable insight may be gained by studying the larger picture that entails a representative collection of such factors and their interactions, ranging from molecules to neural networks. Finally, we discuss some potential interventions that may help to prevent these alterations, thereby reducing cognitive decline and mental fragility, and enhancing mental well-being, and healthy aging.

AB  - In times of crisis, schools are expected to help students deal with the situation and any help offered should consider the social and emotional problems arising from the critical event. Therefore, school-based activities enabling children to recognize the experience and work through it are essential to sustain their normal development and prevent academic and mental health problems. This paper provides an overview of the literature on universal school crisis interventions. We performed a scoping literature search in Scopus, ERIC, and Psych Info for articles published between January 2000 and May 2021 and identified 32 universal school-based crisis interventions based on three main crisis types (armed conflict, natural disaster, and Covid-19). Analysis of the methodologies and theoretical backgrounds generated six key psychoeducational factors commonly adopted. Comparing the different programmes in terms of topics, course content, duration, and methodology can help administrators and educators select the most appropriate crisis intervention for their school and situation. We also discuss the collaboration between mental health care specialists, school teams, and other important factors needed to implement these programmes and ensure their effectiveness under real-life conditions.

AB  - Objective: The impact of the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on psychological outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in lung cancer patients remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the MBSR program on psychological states and QoL in lung cancer patients. Methods: Eligible studies published before November 2021 were systematically searched from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases. The risk of bias in eligible studies was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Psychological variables and QoL were evaluated as outcomes. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to grade the levels of evidence. Statistical analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4 and STATA 14.0. Results: A total of 17 studies involving 1,680 patients were included for meta-analysis eventually. MBSR program significantly relieved cancer-related fatigue (standard mean difference [SMD], -1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.69 to -0.82; moderate evidence) and negative psychological states (SMD, -1.35; 95% CI, -1.69 to -1.02; low evidence), enhanced positive psychological states (SMD, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.56-1.27; moderate evidence), and improved quality of sleep (MD, -2.79; 95% CI, -3.03 to -2.56; high evidence). Evidence on MBSR programs' overall treatment effect for QoL revealed a trend toward statistical significance (p = 0.06, low evidence). Conclusion: Based on our findings, the MBSR program shows positive effects on psychological states in lung cancer patients. This approach should be recommended as a part of the rehabilitation program for lung cancer patients.

AB  - Mental health-related professions, like many fields, have begun reexamining common practices and opportunities following the 2020 reawakening to the need for antiracist practices/policies. This push includes encouraging both seasoned professionals and newer trainees to do inward and outward work to increase self- and other-awareness and recognize biases. Often, it is unclear where to begin, and this deeper reflection can bring up uncomfortable realizations about oneself, colleagues, and even broader professions. Doing this deep work is most beneficial when done in a community that can provide support and further challenge. Thus, the practice of reflective supervision/consultation (RSC) is well-suited for integration of conversations about bias (implicit and explicit) as well as racism/antiracism. The current paper provides background on these concepts, the model of RSC, and specific examples of diversity, equity, and inclusion principles within the infant and early childhood mental health (IECMH) field. Parallels are drawn to existing "key concepts" of reflective supervision to provide examples for integrating conversations about bias into reflective supervision. Finally, specific tools and strategies for use are offered as starting points, with encouragement for supervisors to continue to generate ideas and tools for these important conversations. Next steps and implications for broader practice are also discussed.

AB  - Background Newly-qualified doctors in the United Kingdom experience a great deal of stress and have poor wellbeing when compared to more senior counterparts. A number of interventions have been put in place to boost healthcare professionals' wellbeing, but little is known about interventions aimed to improve the wellbeing of newly-qualified doctors in the United Kingdom. This study aims to systematically review current evidence of interventions which improved the wellbeing of newly-qualified junior doctors in the United Kingdom. Methods Five key electronic databases were searched. Subsequently, reference scanning and citation search was performed. Studies were included if they were conducted from the commencement of the Foundation Programme in 2004, until 2019. In addition, studies had to be performed on junior doctors: working in the United Kingdom and within their first five years post-qualification and have a quantitative outcome. Studies which did not meet these criteria were excluded. Quality was assessed using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Bias was not formally assessed using a standardised tool. Results Seven papers met the inclusion criteria and identified three main types of interventions: mentorship, mindfulness and clinical preparation interventions. The majority of included studies reported a positive result from the performed intervention, suggesting these to be beneficial in improving junior doctor wellbeing, and thereby reducing anxiety and stress levels. However, most of the studies used small sample sizes. Conclusions This review reveals that there is dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of intervention to improve the wellbeing of newly-qualified doctors in the United Kingdom. Most of the identified interventions focused on relieving stress and anxiety inherent within newly-qualified doctors' training programmes. However, wellbeing interventions need to take into cognisance all the factors which impact on wellbeing, particularly job-related factors. We recommend that future researchers implement large-scale holistic interventions using appropriate research methods. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42019127341.

AB  - The construct of "choking under pressure" is concerned with the phenomenon of unexpected, sudden, and significant declines in individual athletes' performances in important situations and has received empirical attention in the field of sport psychology. Although a number of theories about the reasons for the occurrence of choking under pressure exist and several intervention approaches have been developed, underlying mechanisms of choking are still under debate and the effectiveness of existing interventions remains contested. These sudden performance declines also occur in team sport. "Collective sport team collapse," which describes the situation when an entire sport team underperforms significantly within an important competitive situation, has received less empirical attention, in comparison to individual choking research. While there are a few studies that have investigated causes of collective team collapse, understandably, there has been limited empirical investigation of preventative and intervention strategies. Although the two constructs appear to share several similar characteristics and mechanisms, research has not yet examined the conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and practical links between choking under pressure and collective sport team collapse. In this review article, we seek to examine these similarities and differences and identify new ways of thinking about future interventions. Furthermore, current empirical understandings in the field of choking under pressure and collective sport team collapse are presented and the most effective intervention approaches for both constructs are introduced. On the basis of this examination, we modestly make some initial recommendations for sport psychological practitioners and future research.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to compare the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of vortioxetine in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults. Method: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), and for randomized controlled trials that examined vortioxetine vs. placebo or other antidepressants for the treatment of MDD from database inception to August 30, 2021, using keywords Vortioxetine, Brintellix, Trintellix, LuAA21004, major depressive disorder, mood disorder, affective disorder, and MDD. We identified 789 publications after removing duplicates. After screening, 20 eligible randomized controlled trials were identified, of which 19 were included in the final meta-analysis. We included adults (aged 18 years and older) with a primary diagnosis of MDD. Two review authors independently selected the studies and extracted data. We extracted data on study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability. Analyses were performed using random-effects models, and outcomes were pooled as risk ratios (RRs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs). Results: In total, 20 studies (8,547 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Vortioxetine outperformed the placebo in efficacy outcomes, including response (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.23-1.48; P < 0.001), remission (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17-1.52; P < 0.001), and cognitive function (SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.52; P = 0.0003). Compared with the serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), vortioxetine had better tolerability (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86-0.94; P < 0.001) but no significant difference in response (RR 0.91, 95%CI 0.82-1.00; P = 0.06) or remission (RR: 0.99, 95% CI 0.81-1.20, P = 0.88). Vortioxetine had no difference in response (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88-1.32; P = 0.46), remission (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.41-2.44; P = 1.00) comparing with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Conclusions: Vortioxetine is more advantageous over placebo in treating MDD among adults, but no significant difference compared to SNRIs and SSRIs in general.Systematic Review Registration, identifier: CRD42021278355.

AB  - Introduction Medical imaging in pregnancy (antenatal imaging) is routine. However, the effect of seeing fetal images on the parent-fetal relationship is not well understood, particularly for fathers or partners, or when using advanced imaging technologies. This review aimed to explore how parent experience and prenatal attachment is impacted by antenatal imaging. Method Database searches were performed between September 2020 and April 2021 Inclusion criteria were English language primary research studies published since 2000, describing or reporting measures of attachment after antenatal imaging in expectant parents. The Pillar Integration Process was used for integrative synthesis. Findings Twenty-three studies were included. Six pillar themes were developed: 1) the scan experience begins before the scan appointment; 2) the scan as a pregnancy ritual; 3) feeling actively involved in the scan; 4) parents' priorities for knowledge and understanding of the scan change during pregnancy; 5) the importance of the parent-sonographer partnership during scanning; and 6) scans help to create a social identity for the unborn baby. Conclusion Antenatal imaging can enhance prenatal attachment. Parents value working collaboratively with sonographers to be actively involved in the experience. Sonographers can help facilitate attachment by delivering parent-centred care tailored to parents' emotional and knowledge needs.

AB  - Neuroinflammatory disorder is a general term that is associated with the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function. At present, the widely studied diseases with neuroinflammatory components are mainly divided into neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, stroke, and so on. An appropriate neuroinflammatory response can promote brain homeostasis, while excessive neuroinflammation can inhibit neuronal regeneration and damage the central nervous system. Apart from the symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, antidepressants/anxiolytics, and neuroprotective drugs, the treatment of neuroinflammation is a promising therapeutic method. Sirtuins are a host of class III histone deacetylases, that require nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide for their lysine residue deacetylase activity. The role of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), one of the sirtuins, in modulating senescence, myelin formation, autophagy, and inflammation has been widely studied. SIRT2 is associated with many neuroinflammatory disorders considering it has deacetylation properties, that regulate the entire immune homeostasis. The aim of this review was to summarize the latest progress in regulating the effects of SIRT2 on immune homeostasis in neuroinflammatory disorders. The overall structure and catalytic properties of SIRT2, the selective inhibitors of SIRT2, the relationship between immune homeostasis and SIRT2, and the multitasking role of SIRT2 in several diseases with neuroinflammatory components were discussed.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted many aspects of society and has indirectly produced various psychological consequences. This systematic review aimed to estimate the worldwide prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify protective or risk factors contributing to child PTSD. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search in the PubMed, ProQuest, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, WanFang, CNKI, and VIP databases. We searched for studies published between January 1, 2020 and May 26, 2021, that reported the prevalence of child PTSD due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as factors contributing to child PTSD. Eighteen studies were included in our systematic review, of which 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results The estimated prevalence of child PTSD after the COVID-19 outbreak was 28.15% (95% CI: 19.46-36.84%, I (2) = 99.7%). In subgroup analyses for specific regions the estimated prevalence of post-pandemic child PTSD was 19.61% (95% CI: 11.23-27.98%) in China, 50.8% (95% CI: 34.12-67.49%) in the USA, and 50.08% in Italy (95% CI: 47.32-52.84%). Conclusions Factors contributing to child PTSD were categorized into four aspects: personal factors, family factors, social factors and infectious diseases related factors. Based on this, we presented a new framework summarizing the occurrence and influence of the COVID-19 related child PTSD, which may contribute to a better understanding, prevention and development of interventions for child PTSD in forthcoming pandemics.

AB  - In recent years, the problem of mobile phone addiction (MPA) has become increasingly serious among mainland Chinese adolescents. Studies have found that self-esteem may be related to MPA, but the conclusions are inconsistent. Consequently, this meta-analysis aims to explore the real relationship between self-esteem and MPA, and analyze the moderator variables. The relevant studies used in meta-analysis were obtained by searching China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Data, Chongqing VIP Information Co., Ltd. (VIP), PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Medline and Embase. Then articles were screened and coded, and statistical analysis was carried out by Stata 16.0 software. A total of 45,765 participants from 64 articles were included in the research. Meta-analysis showed that there was a moderate negative correlation between self-esteem and MPA(r = -.25, 95%CI = -.29, -.21). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis showed that the age and publication time can significantly moderate the relationship between self-esteem and MPA, but MPA measurement instrument, gender, region and publication type have no significant moderating effect. The current meta-analysis provided solid evidence that self-esteem was negatively correlated with MPA. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the causality between them, so as to make more specific practice and policy recommendations.

AB  - Mental disorders represent an increasing source of disability and high costs for societies globally. Molecular imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) represent powerful tools with the potential to advance knowledge regarding disease mechanisms, allowing the development of new treatment approaches. Thus far, most PET research on pathophysiology in psychiatric disorders has focused on the monoaminergic neurotransmission systems, and although a series of discoveries have been made, the results have not led to any material changes in clinical practice. We outline areas of methodological development that can address some of the important obstacles to fruitful progress. First, we point towards new radioligands and targets that can lead to the identification of processes upstream, or parallel to disturbances in monoaminergic systems. Second, we describe the development of new methods of PET data quantification and PET systems that may facilitate research in psychiatric populations. Third, we review the application of multimodal imaging that can link molecular imaging data to other aspects of brain function, thus deepening our understanding of disease processes. Fourth, we highlight the need to develop imaging study protocols to include longitudinal and interventional paradigms, as well as frameworks to assess dimensional symptoms such that the field can move beyond cross-sectional studies within current diagnostic boundaries. Particular effort should be paid to include also the most severely ill patients. Finally, we discuss the importance of harmonizing data collection and promoting data sharing to reach the desired sample sizes needed to fully capture the phenotype of psychiatric conditions.

AB  - Scientists have long been interested in understanding the influence of emotionally salient stimuli on attention and perception. One experimental paradigm that has shown great promise in demonstrating the effect of such stimuli is emotion-induced blindness. That is, when emotionally salient stimuli are presented in a rapid stream of stimuli, they produce impairments in the perception of task-relevant stimuli, even though they themselves are task irrelevant. This is known as emotion-induced blindness, and it is a profound and robust form of attentional bias. Here, we review the literature on emotion-induced blindness, such as identifying the types of stimuli that elicit it, and its temporal dynamics. We discuss the role of dimensional versus categorical approaches to emotion in relation to emotion-induced blindness. We also synthesize the work examining whether certain individuals, such as those high in anxiety versus psychopathy, succumb to emotion-induced blindness to different extents, and we discuss whether the deficit can be reduced or even abolished. We review the theoretical models that have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. Finally, we identify exciting questions for future research, and elucidate useful frameworks to guide future investigations.

AB  - Most females experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, but not all develop PTSD. Despite considerable research, our understanding of the key factors that constitute risk for PTSD among females is limited. Previous research has largely focused on sex differences, neglecting within group comparisons, thereby obviating differences between females who do and do not develop PTSD following exposure to trauma. In this systematic review, we conducted a search for the extent of existing research utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine neurobiological differences among females of all ages, with and without PTSD. Only studies of females who met full diagnostic criteria for PTSD were included. Fifty-six studies were selected and reviewed. We synthesized here findings from structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC MRI) studies, comparing females with and without PTSD. A range of biopsychosocial constructs that may leave females vulnerable to PTSD were discussed. First, the ways timing and type of exposure to trauma may impact PTSD risk were discussed. Second, the key role that cognitive and behavioral mechanisms may play in PTSD was described, including rumination, and deficient fear extinction. Third, the role of specific symptom patterns and common comorbidities in female-specific PTSD was described, as well as sex-specific implications on treatment and parenting outcomes. We concluded by identifying areas for future research, to address the need to better understand developmental aspects of brain alterations, the differential impact of trauma types and timing, the putative role of neuroendocrine system in neurobiology of PTSD among females, and the impact of social and cultural factors on neurobiology in females with PTSD.

AB  - Background Stroke can be a life-changing event, with survivors frequently experiencing some level of disability, reduced independence, and an abrupt lifestyle change. Not surprisingly, many stroke survivors report elevated levels of stress during the recovery process, which has been associated with worse outcomes. Purpose Given the multiple roles of stress in the etiology of stroke recovery outcomes, we aimed to scope the existing literature on stress management interventions that have been trialed in stroke survivors. Methods We performed a database search for intervention studies conducted in stroke survivors which reported the effects on stress, resilience, or coping outcome. Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, and PsycInfo (OVID) were searched from database inception until March 11, 2019, and updated on September 1, 2020. Results Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. There was significant variation in the range of trialed interventions, as well as the outcome measures used to assess stress. Overall, just over half (13/24) of the included studies reported a benefit in terms of stress reduction. Acceptability and feasibility were considered in 71% (17/24) and costs were considered in 17% (4/24) of studies. The management of stress was rarely linked to the prevention of symptoms of stress-related disorders. The overall evidence base of included studies is weak. However, an increase in the number of studies over time suggests a growing interest in this subject. Conclusions Further research is required to identify optimum stress management interventions in stroke survivors, including whether the management of stress can ameliorate the negative impacts of stress on health.

AB  - Modern clinical research on psychedelics is generating interesting outcomes in a wide array of clinical conditions when psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is delivered to appropriately screened participants and in controlled settings. Still, a number of patients relapse or are less responsive to such treatments. Individual and contextual factors (i.e., set and setting) seem to play a role in shaping the psychedelic experience and in determining clinical outcomes. These findings, coupled with data from literature on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, frame the therapeutic context as a potential moderator of clinical efficacy, highlighting the need to investigate how to functionally employ environmental and relational factors. In this review, we performed a structured search through two databases (i.e., PubMed/Medline and Scopus) to identify records of clinical studies on psychedelics which used and described a structured associated psychotherapeutic intervention. The aim is to construct a picture of what models of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy are currently adopted in clinical research and to report on their clinical outcomes. Ad-hoc and adapted therapeutic methods were identified. Common principles, points of divergence and future directions are highlighted and discussed with special attention toward therapeutic stance, degree of directiveness and the potential suggestive effects of information provided to patients.

AB  - Background: Prior mental exertion consumes self-regulation and influences any subsequent physical or cognitive performance according to the strength model of self-regulation. However, the counteractive effect of self-regulatory strength training remains unclear. Objective: This study aims to report a comprehensive systematic review investigating self-regulatory strength training programmes on physical or cognitive performance. Methods: To select relevant studies from the available literature, a thorough search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost (CENTRAL, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, SPORTDicus), Scopus, and Google Scholar, as well as the sources of reference for gray literature. Only randomized controlled trials involving healthy humans, strength-based self-regulation training programmes with comparable protocols, and a physical or cognitive task associated with the study were selected for the current review. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to develop the summary of findings. Results: Twelve articles were included based on the selection criteria. Evidence certainty for outcomes was graded as either low or very low level. The majority of the studies reported that self-regulatory strength training programmes can significantly counter prior mental exertion and decrement of performance, while only one study did not find such improvement. According to the strength model, a period of training increased the 'self-regulatory muscle.' Conclusion: Strength is an important ingredient in the resource model of self-regulation and can be trained to counter prior mental exertion and improve subsequent physical and cognitive performance. The training effects are cross-domain (e.g., emotional and cognitive domains; higher and lower levels of executive functions). However, motivation plays a key role to mobilize this resource. Future studies should examine the mechanism that underlies the strength.

AB  - Dyadic coping (DC), how couples cope together to deal with a stressor like chronic illness, has received increased attention over the last three decades. The aim of the current study was to summarize the current state of research on DC in couples. We conducted a scoping review of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies published between 1990 and 2020, assessing DC in couples during three decades. 5,705 studies were identified in three electronic databases and hand searches. We included 643 sources in this review (with a total of N = 112,923 study participants). Most studies were based in the global North, particularly in the US and Europe. Publication numbers increased constantly over time. A third of study designs were cross-sectional studies followed by qualitative and longitudinal studies. The most prolific DC research areas were related to DC and minor stressors and DC and major physical health stressors. Overall, DC has been established internationally as a highly relevant construct in many disciplines (clinical, social, developmental, personality psychology, social work, nursing etc.). To conclude, the review reveals that future studies should focus on predictors, trajectories, and the importance of very specific DC behaviors for personal and dyadic functioning.

Sedentary behaviour and physical activity influence autonomic, haemodynamic, and inflammatory pathways under resting conditions, and these pathways become activated under acute psychological stress. However, it is unclear whether sedentary behaviour and physical activity relate to psychobiological responses to stress. Thus, the aim of this study is to systematically review sedentary behaviour and physical activity in the context of psychobiological reactivity to acute psychological stress.Methods: Sedentary behaviour, physical activity and psychobiological stress reactivity search terms were combined, and several databases were searched in duplicate. Eligibility criteria included: (1) a validated measure of sedentary behaviour/physical activity; (2) cardiovascular, inflammatory, neuroendocrine, or respiratory markers measured at rest and in response to laboratory-induced acute psychological stress.Results: 6084 articles were screened, with 11 included in a narrative synthesis. No studies measured postural components of sedentary behaviour, but 2/4 studies found that markers of sedentary behaviour (e.g., physical inactivity) were associated with elevated heart rate, dysregulated heart rate variability, or lowered cortisol responses to stress. Higher volumes of physical activity were linked to lower HR, cortisol, or immune responses to stress in 4/7 studies. Conclusions: Extensive methodological variability precludes conclusions from being drawn. This review should be used to guide a more homogeneous and gold-standard literature, which accounts for postural components of sedentary behaviour using inclinometery, and the whole physical activity intensity spectrum using universal and reproducible approaches.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) for patients with anxiety symptoms. Method: We searched the Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase and Medline for randomized control trials (RCTs) from the time of inception until November 15, 2021, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were the mean change scores for anxiety symptoms. The secondary outcomes were the mean change scores for depressive symptoms. Results: Eleven RCTs were eligible (n = 794, mean age: 41.4, mean population of female: 64.8%). CES significantly reduced the anxiety symptoms compared to the control group [k = 11, n = 692, Hedge's g = -0.625, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = -0.952 to -0.298, P < 0.001] with moderate effect size. The subgroup analysis showed that CES reduced both primary and secondary anxiety (primary anxiety, k =3, n = 288, Hedges' g = -1.218, 95% CIs = -1.418 to -0.968, P = 0.007; secondary anxiety, k = 8, n = 504, Hedges' g = -0.334, 95% CIs = -0.570 to -0.098, P = 0.006). After performing between group analysis, we found CES has significant better efficacy for patients with primary anxiety than those with secondary anxiety (P < 0.001). For secondary outcome, CES significantly reduced depressive symptoms in patients with anxiety disorders (k = 8, n = 552, Hedges' g = -0.648, 95% CIs = -1.062 to -0.234, P = 0.002). No severe side effects were reported and the most commonly reported adverse events were ear discomfort and ear pain. Conclusion: We found CES is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms with moderate effect size in patients with both primary and secondary anxiety. Furthermore, CES was well-tolerated and acceptable.

AB  - Purpose of Review Over the last 30 years, medical assistance in dying (MAiD) including euthanasia (EU) and physician-assisted death (or suicide, PAS) has become the center of a large debate, particularly when these practices have involved people with psychiatric illness, including resistant depression, schizophrenia, personality, or other severe psychiatric disorders. We performed a review utilizing several databases, and by including the most relevant studies in full journal articles investigating the problem of MAiD in patients with psychiatric disorders but not in physical terminal conditions (non-terminal, MAiD-NT). Recent Findings Literature has shown that a small percentage of people with psychiatric disorders died by MAiD-NT in comparison with patients with somatic diseases in terminal clinical conditions (e.g., cancer, AIDS). However, the problem in the field is complex and not solved yet as confirmed by the fact that only a few countries (e.g., the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg) have legalized MAiD-NT for patients with psychiatric disorders, while most have maintained the practices accessible only to people with somatic disease in a terminal phase. Also, how to make objective the criterion of irremediability of a mental disorder; how to balance suicide prevention with assisted suicide; how to avoid the risk of progressively including in requests for MAiD-NT vulnerable segments of the population, such as minors, elderly, or people with dementia, in a productive-oriented society, are some of the critical points to be discussed. The application of MAiD-NT in people with psychiatric disorders should be further explored to prevent end-of-life rights from contradicting the principles of recovery-oriented care.

AB  - Physical, socio-economic, cultural and mental challenges faced by students have been associated with adverse impacts on school wellbeing, resulting in increased school dropout and deviant behaviour. This systematic review has analysed the present knowledge on factors associated with school dropouts to identify psychological interventions for promoting school wellbeing. A systematic search was done of the ScienceDirect, APA PsycINFO, Emerald and Google Scholar electronic databases. A hand-search was also done of the reference list of the included studies. The initial search resulted in 448 studies, and the search of the references list of the considered studies resulted in 28 more articles. The application of the eligibility criteria resulted in the inclusion of 38 studies in the review. The study established several factors associated with school dropouts and social deviance, such as school climate, school structure, and those defining social interaction among students. Mental and emotional health was identified as the main factor influencing school dropout and social deviance. A positive school climate should be the primary consideration for promoting school wellbeing. School administrations, teachers, and parents should collaborate to positively improve conditions in schools.

AB  - Background: Gray matter volume (GMV) alteration in specific brain regions has been widely regarded as one of the most important neuroplasticity features in chronic pain patients with depressive symptoms (CP-D). However, the consistent and significant results were still lacking. Thus, further exploration was suggested to be performed. Objectives: This study aimed to comprehensively collect the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies on GMV alteration between CP-D and healthy controls (HCs). And a systemic review and meta-analysis were made to explore the characteristic brain regions in chronic pain and depression comorbidity. Methods: Search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases updated to July 13, 2021. The altered GMV between CP-D and HCs in VBM studies was included in this meta-analysis. In total, 18 studies (20 datasets) and 1320 participants (520 patients and 800 HCs) were included. The significant coordinate information (x, y, z) reported in standard space and the effect size (t-value or z-score) were extracted and analyzed by anisotropic effect size-signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) 5.15 software. Results: According to the main analysis results, CP-D showed significant and consistent increased GMV in the left hippocampus (HIP. L) and decreased GMV in the medial part of the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG. L, BA 10) compared to HCs. Subgroup analysis showed significant decreased GMV in the medial orbital part of SFG.R (BA 10) in neuropathic pain, as well as significant increased GMV in the right parahippocampal gyrus (PHG.R, BA 35), left hippocampus (HIP.L, BA 20), and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG.R) in musculoskeletal pain. Furthermore, meta-regression showed a positive relationship between the decreased GMV in the medial part of SFG.L and the percentage of female patients. Conclusion: GMV abnormality in specific brain areas (e.g., HIP.L and SFG) was robust and reproducible, which could be significantly involved in this comorbidity disease. The findings in this study may be a valuable reference for future research.Systematic Review Registration[].

AB  - The natural aging process as well as many age-related diseases is associated with impaired metabolic adaptation and declined ability to cope with stress. As major causes of disability and morbidity during the aging process, brain disorders, including psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, are likely to increase across the globe in the future decades. This narrative review investigates the link among exercise and brain disorders, aging, and inflammatory biomarkers, along with the function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. For this study, related manuscript from all databases, Google scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and ISI were assessed. Also, in the search process, the keywords of exercise, neurodegeneration, neurotrophin, mitochondrial dysfunction, and aging were used. Mitochondrial abnormality increases neuronal abnormality and brain disease during the aging process. Stress and inflammatory factors caused by lifestyle and aging also increase brain disorders. Evidences suggest that exercise, as a noninvasive treatment strategy, has antioxidant effects and can reduce neuronal lesions. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression following the exercise can reduce brain symptoms; however, careful consideration should be given to a number of factors affecting the results.

AB  - Background Numerous cortical and subcortical structures have been studied extensively concerning alterations of their integrity as well as their neurotransmitters in depression. However, connections between these structures have received considerably less attention. Objective This systematic review presents results from recent neuroimaging as well as neuropathologic studies conducted on humans and other mammals. It aims to provide evidence for impaired white matter integrity in individuals expressing a depressive phenotype. Methods A systematic database search in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines was conducted to identify imaging and postmortem studies conducted on humans with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, as well as on rodents and primates subjected to an animal model of depression. Results Alterations are especially apparent in frontal gyri, as well as in structures establishing interhemispheric connectivity between frontal regions. Translational neuropathological findings point to alterations in oligodendrocyte density and morphology, as well as to alterations in the expression of genes related to myelin synthesis. An important role of early life adversities in the development of depressive symptoms and white matter alterations across species is thereby revealed. Data indicating that stress can interfere with physiological myelination patterns is presented. Altered myelination is most notably present in regions that are subject to maturation during the developmental stage of exposure to adversities. Conclusion Translational studies point to replicable alterations in white matter integrity in subjects suffering from depression across multiple species. Impaired white matter integrity is apparent in imaging as well as neuropathological studies. Future studies should focus on determining to what extent influencing white matter integrity is able to improve symptoms of depression in animals as well as humans.

AB  - Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is associated with significant disability, and due to its high prevalence, it results in a substantive socio-economic burden at a global level. TRD is the inability to accomplish and/or achieve remission after an adequate trial of antidepressant treatments. Studies comparing repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and pharmacotherapy have revealed evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS in TRD. These findings suggest a crucial role for rTMS in the management of TRD. This article aims to conduct a comprehensive scoping review of the current literature concerning the use of rTMS and its therapeutic efficacy as a treatment modality for TRD. PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, and Cinahl were used to identify important articles on rTMS for TRD. The search strategy was limited to English articles within the last five years of data publication. Articles were included if they reported on a completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) of rTMS intervention for TRD. The exclusion criteria involved studies with rTMS for the treatment of conditions other than TRD, and study and experimental protocols of rTMS on TRD. In total, 17 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. The search strategy spanned studies published in the last five years, to the date of the data search (14 February 2022). The regional breakdown of the extracted studies was North American (n = 9), European (n = 5), Asian (n = 2) and Australian (n = 1). The applied frequencies of rTMS ranged from 5 Hz to 50 Hz, with stimulation intensities ranging from 80% MT to 120% MT. Overall, 16 out of the 17 studies suggested that rTMS treatment was effective, safe and tolerated in TRD. For patients with TRD, rTMS appears to provide significant benefits through the reduction of depressive symptoms, and while there is progressive evidence in support of the same, more research is needed in order to define standardized protocols of rTMS application in terms of localization, frequency, intensity, and pulse parameters.

AB  - Background Comorbid mental illnesses and substance use disorders are associated with adverse criminal, social, and health outcomes. Yet, their burden is not reliably known among prison populations. We therefore aimed to estimate the prevalence of comorbid serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders (dual disorders) among people in prison worldwide.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 15 electronic databases (ASSIA, CAB Abstracts, Criminal Justice Database, Embase, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, IBSS, MEDLINE, NCJRS, PAIS Index, PsycINFO, Russian Science Citation Index, Scielo, Social Services Abstracts, and Web of Science) and the grey literature (Open Grey and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global) for studies reporting the prevalence of serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders in prison populations published between Jan 1, 1980, and Sept 25, 2021, and contacted the authors of relevant studies. Empirical studies among unselected adult prison populations that applied representative sampling strategies and validated diagnostic instruments, and either reported the prevalence of dual disorders or had authors who could provide prevalence data in correspondence, were included. Two reviewers (GB and SDL) independently extracted data from the eligible studies; both current (up to 1 year) and lifetime prevalence were extracted, if available. We sought summary estimates. Our primary outcomes were comorbid nonaffective psychosis with substance use disorders and comorbid major depression with substance use disorders. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis, explored between-sample heterogeneity with meta-regression, and calculated odds ratios (ORs) to assess bidirectional relationships between mental and substance use disorders. Risk of bias was assessed by use of a standard tool. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020207301.
   Findings Of 11 346 records screened, we identified 34 studies reporting the prevalence of dual disorders among individuals in prison and received unpublished prevalence data for 16 studies, totalling 50 eligible studies and 24 915 people. The mean quality score of included studies was 7.8 (SD 1.2). We found that 3.5% (95% CI 2.2-5.0) had current non-affective psychosis with any comorbid substance use disorder, representing 443 (49.2%) of 900 people with non-affective psychosis, and 9.1% (5.6-13.3) had current major depression and comorbid substance use disorders, representing 1105 (51.6%) of 2143 people with major depression. Between-sample heterogeneity was high (I-2>80%). People in prison with current non-affective psychosis were significantly more likely to have substance use disorders compared with those without (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.2). People with major depression had higher odds of substance use disorders than those without (1.6, 1.3-2.0).
   Interpretation Around half of the prison population with non-affective psychosis or major depression have a comorbid substance use disorder. Consideration should be given to screening for dual disorders and implementing integrated and scalable treatments. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Disparities in mental health have persisted or worsened despite our awareness of their existence, increased understanding of their causes, and efforts at reduction and mitigation. Although much is known, there is still much to be done in mental health research to meaningfully impact disparities. In November 2020, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) co-sponsored a virtual workshop to explore the complexities of mental health disparities, which revealed several gaps and opportunities for the field to pursue to advance mental health disparities research. This article, the introduction to a Special Issue on Mental Health Disparities, provides a frame for four articles that stem from and are inspired by the virtual NIMH/NIMHD workshop, all of which illustrate innovative research on understanding the complex mechanisms of disparities and how this knowledge can be translated into effective intervention development that advances mental health equity.

AB  - Cognitive function is affected by low pressure and hypoxia in high-altitude environments, and is regulated by altitude and exposure time. With the economic development in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the increase in work and study activities, as well as the development of plateau tourism, mountaineering, and other activities, the number of plateau immigrants is increasing daily. Long-term hypoxia challenges human physical and mental health, restricts work efficiency, and thus affects plateau economic development and human wellbeing. Therefore, it is of scientific and social significance to study how long-term exposure to the hypoxic plateau environment affects the physical and mental health of lowlanders as part of the ongoing development of the current plateau region. In this paper, we reviewed the research progress and mechanism of the effects of long-term (>= 1 year) high-altitude (>2500 m) hypoxia exposure on the cognitive function of lowlanders, and suggested that the scope and sample size of the research should be expanded in the future, and that follow-up studies should be carried out to explore the time threshold of cognitive impairment and its compensatory or repair mechanism.

AB  - We aimed to review the data available to evaluate the long-term consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at 6 months and above. We searched relevant observational cohort studies up to 9 February 2022 in Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science. Random-effects inverse-variance models were used to evaluate the Pooled Prevalence (PP) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of long-term consequences. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was used to assess the quality of the included cohort studies. A total of 40 studies involving 10,945 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were included. Of the patients, 63.87% had at least one consequence at the 6 month follow-up, which decreased to 58.89% at 12 months. The most common symptoms were fatigue or muscle weakness (PP 6-12 m = 54.21%, PP >= 12 m = 34.22%) and mild dyspnea (Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, mMRC = 0, PP 6-12 m = 74.60%, PP >= 12 m = 80.64%). Abnormal computerized tomography (CT; PP 6-12 m = 55.68%, PP >= 12 m = 43.76%) and lung diffuse function impairment, i.e., a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) of < 80% were common (PP 6-12 m = 49.10%, PP >= 12 m = 31.80%). Anxiety and depression (PP 6-12 m = 33.49%, PP >= 12 m = 35.40%) and pain or discomfort (PP 6-12 m = 33.26%, PP >= 12 m = 35.31%) were the most common problems that affected patients' quality of life. Our findings suggest a significant long-term impact on health and quality of life due to COVID-19, and as waves of ASRS-CoV-2 infections emerge, the long-term effects of COVID-19 will not only increase the difficulty of care for COVID-19 survivors and the setting of public health policy but also might lead to another public health crisis following the current pandemic, which would also increase the global long-term burden of disease.

AB  - The psychosocial paradigm in the field of drugs focuses on the suffering individual in re-lation to the social reality and values the unique-ness of users and professionals for the development of health care. A concept that bases these charac-teristics, and that comes from different theoreti-cal frameworks, is the construction of autonomy. However, there is no study in the literature that summarizes it in its different meanings. This arti-cle aimed to systematize the concepts of autonomy construction under the psychosocial paradigm in the field of drugs. The methodology used was the integrative review. We searched, in the Psycin-fo, PubMed, BVS and Web of Science databases, studies that analyzed the care process using the construction of autonomy. These concepts, their theoretical references and their foundations were identified and systematized. Among the 22 stud-ies, there are concepts based on six theories, such as collective health and harm reduction. It could be considered that the construction of autonomy is a process that mobilizes different actions, such as co-responsibility and territorial sociopolitical action; which can be systematized in three inter-related dimensions; and which has different epis-temological roots, such as the psychiatry of dein-stitutionalization.

AB  - Background Lower incomes are associated with poorer mental health and wellbeing, but the extent to which income has a causal effect is debated. We aimed to synthesise evidence from studies measuring the impact of changes in individual and household income on mental health and wellbeing outcomes in working-age adults (aged 16-64 years).
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ASSIA, EconLit, and RePEc on Feb 5, 2020, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quantitative non-randomised studies. We had no date limits for our search. We included English-language studies measuring effects of individual or household income change on any mental health or wellbeing outcome. We used Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tools. We conducted three-level random-effects meta-analyses, and explored heterogeneity using meta-regression and stratified analyses. Synthesis without meta-analysis was based on effect direction. Critical RoB studies were excluded from primary analyses. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020168379.
   Findings Of 16 521 citations screened, 136 were narratively synthesised (12.5% RCTs) and 86 meta-analysed. RoB was high: 30.1% were rated critical and 47.1% serious or high. A binary income increase lifting individuals out of poverty was associated with 0.13 SD improvement in mental health measures (95% CI 0.07 to 0.20; n=42 128; 18 studies), considerably larger than other income increases (0.01 SD improvement, 0.002 to 0.019; n=216 509, 14 studies). For wellbeing, increases out of poverty were associated with 0.38 SD improvement (0.09 to 0.66; n=101 350, 8 studies) versus 0.16 for other income increases (0.07 to 0.25; n=62 619, 11 studies). Income decreases from any source were associated with 0.21 SD worsening of mental health measures (-0.30 to -0.13; n=227 804, 11 studies). Effect sizes were larger in low-income and middle-income settings and in higher RoB studies. Heterogeneity was high (I-2=79-87%). GRADE certainty was low or very low.
   Interpretation Income changes probably impact mental health, particularly where they move individuals out of poverty, although effect sizes are modest and certainty low. Effects are larger for wellbeing outcomes, and potentially for income losses. To best support population mental health, welfare policies need to reach the most socioeconomically disadvantaged.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a novel technique to stimulate the human brain through the scalp. Over the years, identifying the optimal brain region and stimulation parameters has been a subject of debate in the literature on therapeutic uses of repetitive TMS (rTMS). Nevertheless, the primary motor cortex (M1) has been a conventional target for rTMS to treat motor symptoms, such as hemiplegia and spasticity, as it controls the voluntary movement of the body. However, with an expanding knowledge base of the M1 cortical and subcortical connections, M1-rTMS has shown a therapeutic efficacy that goes beyond the conventional motor rehabilitation to involve pain, headache, fatigue, dysphagia, speech and voice impairments, sleep disorders, cognitive dysfunction, disorders of consciousness, anxiety, depression, and bladder dysfunction. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence on using M1-rTMS to treat non-motor symptoms of diverse etiologies and discuss the potential mechanistic rationale behind the management of each of these symptoms.

AB  - This paper aims to evaluate the effects of exercise intervention on students' test anxiety with a meta-analysis to serve as a reference to further relevant research. CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP, The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCOhost databases were electronically searched from inception to August 2021 in order to identify randomized and non-randomized controlled trials on exercise for treating students' test anxiety. Two researchers independently screened the study, extracted data, and evaluated the quality of the studies. Meta-analysis was carried out using Review Manager 5.4 software. Among the 4115 articles retrieved, 16 were qualitative analyses, 15 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that exercise intervention effectively alleviated students' test anxiety when compared with the blank control group. Subgroup analysis showed that a single exercise intervention lasting 10 similar to 15 min did not relieve students' test anxiety. The different scales used in the study are the source of inter-study heterogeneity. In conclusion, twenty minutes of aerobic exercise at any intensity performed two to three times a week for at least four weeks can reduce test anxiety levels. However, this is the minimum level and students should not be limited to the minimum amount of exercise when reducing test anxiety. In addition, exercise combined with psychotherapy can reduce students' test anxiety better than exercise intervention alone. Future studies should explore the minimum intervention period and whether the shorter intervention period can quickly and effectively reduce students' test anxiety.

AB  - Background Seafaring has frequently been reported to be a 'risky occupation' in terms of both physical and mental health. Individuals working in seafaring professions are exposed to various stressors in the workplace, including social isolation, exposure to poor physical conditions and long work hours. This systematic review aimed to update previous reviews by collating recent literature (published between 2012 and 2021) on the factors associated with mental health and wellbeing in seafaring personnel. Methods Four electronic databases were searched in April 2021 for primary peer-reviewed studies on factors associated with the mental health and psychological wellbeing of seafarers or interventions to improve the wellbeing of seafarers, published in English in or after the year 2012. Thematic analysis was used to synthesise the data and standardised measures of quality appraisal were used to assess risk of bias. Results Sixty-three studies were reviewed. Risk factors for poor mental health among seafarers appear to be younger age; being single; poor physical health; exposure to noise/vibration; feeling unsafe; high job demands; long working hours; night/irregular shifts; poor sleep; poor team cohesion; poor perception of management; poor social support; lack of autonomy; scheduling uncertainties; long duration at sea; and over-commitment. Conclusions There are numerous steps that maritime managers could take to improve the wellbeing of their personnel, including increased monitoring of the potential for poor mental health in their staff, increasing crew numbers and provision of education and support.

AB  - Background: Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent in people with cancer. Medical therapies are usually prescribed to alleviate anxiety and depression, but they are associated with a variety of adverse effects. Recently, aromatherapy showed potential as a complementary medicine to improve psychological health and wellbeing. However, its effectiveness on relieving anxiety and depression has not been established. Objective: This study explored the beneficial effects of aromatherapy on psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression in people with cancer. Methods: We searched international databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Ebscohost, ProQuest and Scopus from inception to 31 May 2021. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. The systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Quantitative analysis was performed on the studies that met our inclusion criteria, and Meta-analysis was performed on the studies with available data by RevMan software. Results: The quality of the literatures were assessed carefully by two researchers, a total of 17 studies were included in the systematic review and 10 articles were conducted in meta-analysis. The aromatherapy was effective in relieving anxiety (SMD = -0.49, p < 0.05) in people with cancer. Subgroup analysis suggested that most effective methods were aromatic massage (SMD = -0.70, p < 0.005), aromatherapy with lavender essential oils (SMD = -1.12, p < 0.01), short-time interventions (duration < 4weeks) (SMD = -0.87, p < 0.05) and studies in Asia (SMD = -0.83, p < 0.05). Regarding depression and psychological wellbeing, there were no difference between aromatherapy and control groups. Conclusion: In cancer patients, the aromatherapy was effective for relieving anxiety. However, there was no beneficial effect on depression and psychological wellbeing.

AB  - Background: A large number of anxious and concerned people refer to health centers during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing the workload of healthcare workers (HCWs) and violence against these professionals. The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of workplace violence (WPV) against HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted via searching in databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science, and observational articles reporting the prevalence of WPV against HCWs were selected. Heterogeneity between the studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test. A random-effects model was used to estimate the prevalence of WPV. Data analysis was performed in the Stata software version 16. Results: In the initial search, 680 articles were identified and screened based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) steps. In total, 17 studies with a sample size of 17,207 HCWs were analyzed. The total prevalence of violence was estimated at 47% (95% CI: 34-61%). In addition, the prevalence of physical and psychological violence was 17% (95% CI: 6-28%) and 44% (95% CI: 31-57%), respectively. The prevalence of WPV was higher among physicians (68%; 95% CI: 31-95%) compared to other HCWs. The WPV in the America and Asia was 58 and 44%, respectively. Conclusion: According to the results, WPV against nurses is prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, and intervention measures are required to protect the nursing staff against such violence.

AB  - Objective To determine if there is an association between antenatal hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonist exposure and congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes in the offspring. Methods Databases were searched to January 31, 2021. Cohort studies published in English on congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes in infants following exposure compared with those unexposed, were summarized and meta-analyzed where possible. Results Following screening, 25 studies were assessed for eligibility and seven included in the meta-analyses. Five studies were pooled for congenital malformations following first trimester exposure and not statistically significant (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56-1.36). The five studies that assessed for preterm birth following anytime exposure did pool to a statistically significant effect (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.19-1.86); study quality, control for other psychotropic drugs and psychiatric diagnosis did not appear to be moderators. There were two missing studies when examining for publication bias in both of the main analyses above but the revised estimates were similar to the original. Low birth weight (LBW) was significant (three studies, any time exposure, OR 1.51, 1.27-1.78) as was small for gestational age (SGA) (three studies with anytime exposure, OR 1.34, 1.22-1.48). There were too few studies to summarize birth weight, gestational age, respiratory difficulties, APGAR score at 5 min and NICU admission. Conclusions Pregnancy exposure to hypnotics was not associated with a higher risk for congenital malformations but was associated with an increased risk for preterm birth, LBW and SGA compared with those infants who were not exposed. These findings are consistent with the antidepressant and benzodiazepine literature.

AB  - Background d/Deaf people suffer from inequitable access to healthcare and health information. This results in worse health literacy and poorer mental and physical health compared to hearing populations. Various interventions aimed at improving health equity for d/Deaf people have been documented but not systematically analyzed. The purpose of this systematic review is to obtain a global overview of what we know about interventions aimed at improving health equity for d/Deaf people. Methods Medline Ovid SP, Embase, CINAHL EBSCO, PsycINFO Ovid SP, Central-Cochrane Library Wiley and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies on access to healthcare and health-related interventions for d/Deaf people following the PRISMA-equity guidelines. We focused on interventions aimed at achieving equitable care and equitable access to health information for d/Deaf people. Results Forty-six studies were identified and analyzed. Seven categories of interventions facing healthcare or health education inequities emerged: use of Sign Language (1), translation, validation and identification of clinical tools and scales (2), healthcare provider training program (3), development of adapted healthcare facilities (4), online interventions (5), education programs (6) and videos (7). Despite some methodological limitations or lack of data, these interventions seem relevant to improve equity of care and health education for d/Deaf people. Conclusion Interventions that promote healthcare equity, health education amongst d/Deaf patients and healthcare provider awareness of communication barriers and cultural sensitivity show promise in achieving more equitable care for d/Deaf patients. Meaningful engagement of d/Deaf individuals in the conceptualization, implementation and evaluation of health-related interventions is imperative.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include a broad range of compounds. Their production influences a large number of processes, having direct and secondary effects on different fields, such as climate change, economy and ecology. Although our planet is primarily covered with water (similar to 70% of the globe surface), the information on aquatic VOCs, compared to the data available for the terrestrial environments, is still limited. Regardless of the difficulty in collecting and analysing data, because of their extreme complexity, diversification and important spatial-temporal emission variation, it was demonstrated that aquatic organisms are able to produce a variety of bioactive compounds. This production happens in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, evidencing the fundamental role of these metabolites, both in terms of composition and amount, in providing important ecological information and possible non-invasive tools to monitor different biological systems. The study of these compounds is an important and productive task with possible and interesting impacts in future practical applications in different fields. This review aims to summarize the knowledge on the aquatic VOCs, the recent advances in understanding their diverse roles and ecological impacts, the generally used methodology for their sampling and analysis, and their enormous potential as non-invasive, non-destructive and financeable affordable real-time biomonitoring tool, both in natural habitats and in controlled industrial situations. Finally, the possible future technical applications, highlighting their economic and social potential, such as the possibility to use VOCs as valuable alternative source of chemicals and as biocontrol and bioregulation agents, are emphasized.

AB  - Objective: There is a high prevalence of burnout in nurses. This systematic review investigates the use of music to manage burnout in nurses.
   Data Source: MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE InProcess/ePubs, Embase, APA PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched.
   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Full-text articles were selected if the study assessed the use of music to manage burnout in nurses. Burnout was defined according to the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision.
   Data Extraction: Data were extracted using an Excel sheet. The second and third authors independently extracted study characteristics, frequency and type of music engagement, measures of burnout, and burnout outcomes (occupational stress, coping with stress, and related symptoms such as anxiety).
   Data Synthesis: Study and outcome data were summarized.
   Results: The literature search resulted in 2210 articles and 16 articles were included (n = 1205 nurses). All seven crosssectional studies reported upon nurses' self-facilitated use of music including music listening, playing instruments, and music entertainment for coping or preventing stress, supporting wellbeing, or enhancing work engagement. Externally-facilitated music engagement, including music listening, chanting, percussive improvisation, and song writing, was reported in the four randomized controlled trials and five cohort studies with reductions in burnout outcomes.
   Conclusions: Self-facilitated and externally-facilitated music engagement can help to reduce burnout in nurses.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Considerably less is known about self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) in preadolescence than older age groups, owing partly to the common view that young children are incapable of suicidal thoughts. Yet, preadolescent suicide has increased in recent years and is now the fifth leading cause of death in this age group, leading the National Institute of Mental Health to identify it as a priority for research and intervention.
   OBJECTIVE To assess prevalence estimates of preadolescent SITBs, identify correlates of these outcomes, and conduct head-to-head comparisons of preadolescent and adolescent SITBs in terms of associated characteristics.
   DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase were systematically searched from inception through December 23, 2021, for studies on the prevalence and correlates of preadolescent SITBs. The search was restricted to English language publications and peer-reviewed journals.
   STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently identified studies providing data on prevalence and correlates of preadolescent SITBs.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently extracted data from each study, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies was used to assess study quality. Pooled prevalence and Cohen d were derived from random-effects meta-analyses. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide deaths, and nonsuicidal self-injury among preadolescents.
   RESULTS Fifty-eight studies with 626 486 590 individuals were included. Lifetime prevalence of suicide in the general population was 0.79 per 1 million children. Prevalence for lifetime suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and nonsuicidal self-injury among preadolescents were 15.1%, 2.6%, and 6.2%, respectively, in community samples. These data suggest that approximately 17.0% of preadolescents with suicidal ideation transition to attempting suicide. Across several analyses, male individuals appear more likely to have SITBs in preadolescence than adolescence. Correlate data were modest for SITBs other than suicidal ideation, but among specific disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (suicidal ideation: d = 0.54 [95% CI, 0.34-0.75]) and depression (suicidal ideation: d = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.71-1.09]; suicide attempts: d = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.26-0.68]) emerged as the strongest correlates. Among interpersonal factors, child maltreatment (suicidal ideation: d = 2.62 [95% CI, 1.56-3.67]) and parental support (suicidal ideation: d = -0.34 [95% CI, -0.46 to -0.22]) yielded the largest effect sizes.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review anda meta-analysis, although preadolescent suicide deaths were rare, other SITB types occur with concerning frequency. Male individuals were at greater risk for SITBs in preadolescence relative to adolescence. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, child maltreatment, and parental support were especially relevant to suicidal ideation, as well as depression for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, in this age group. Further study, especially of SITBs other than suicidal ideation, is needed.

AB  - Loneliness and social isolation are growing public health problems in older adults, associated with physical and mental comorbidity and increased mortality. In the United States, Hispanic/Latinx individuals constitute the largest racial/ethnic minority. Studies retrieved from Psyclnfo, Embase, and PubMed were examined. The initial search yielded 1476 publications. Using the updated PRISMA Flow guidelines, a total of 17 studies met our review criteria. Eight studies assessed loneliness, six evaluated social isolation, and three investigated both. The reports varied in the details of methodology, preventing meta-analyses. Differences in the experience of loneliness and social isolation between Hispanic/Latinx and White adults are not consistent. Of the three studies of loneliness or social isolation among Hispanic/Latinx groups of different national origins, two reported significant differences. Loneliness was associated with greater overall comorbidity, but two studies found higher risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders in Hispanic/Latinx with loneliness. Social isolation was generally associated with worse physical health, being older, male, and unmarried, and having lower education and income, and more smoking, along with frailty and cognitive impairment. We make specific suggestions for future research on loneliness and social isolation in Hispanic/Latinx adults and offer guidelines for clinical management.

AB  - Background Pregnancy is a period when women are particularly vulnerable to suicidal ideation and a great opportunity for suicide risk prevention. Aims This study aimed to establish a comprehensive understanding of suicidal ideation prevalence, risk factors, screening tools, consequences and management during pregnancy. Method A literature search was performed in MEDLINE and PsycInfo databases from 2016 to 2021. A narrative synthesis of the literature and a critical overview of the current issues/questions to be addressed within the topic of suicidal ideation during pregnancy was performed. Results The prevalence of suicidal ideation during pregnancy was between 2.73 and 18% internationally. The risk factors identified were major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, difficulties with sleep, previous suicide attempts, high rumination, low incomes, being black, being young, low educational level, partner violence, having poor support, food insecurity, history of child abuse, high obstetric risk, multiparity, previous induced abortion and exposure to tobacco or human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis. The screening tools used for suicidal ideation during pregnancy were item 10 of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale and item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire. Results showed that suicidal ideation during pregnancy is associated with poor cognitive development in children and low birth weight. No case management studies on suicidal ideation were found. Limitations The main limitation of the available studies was the lack of articles with a high degree of methodological rigour on this subject. Conclusions This narrative review is a state-of-the-art paper about suicidal ideation during pregnancy. Further research is needed, and researchers should carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses, leading to Clinical Practice Guidelines in this area. This effort would improve our evidence-based practice in Perinatal Psychology and prevent associated suicidal behaviour.

AB  - Social-emotional skills are essential for preschool children's mental health and later school success. Considering the variety of school-based interventions aiming to target SEL development, it remains unclear what programs can be considered evidence-based, and what features characterize well-established programs. Hence, the current systematic review aimed (1) to classify classroom-wide SEL programs according to the criteria for evidence-based interventions; (2) to synthesize studies of programs categorized as well-established; and (3) to analyze study-level and overall risk of bias. Interventions were assessed for inclusion, and corresponding studies were systematically searched. A total of 81 studies corresponding to 38 programs were identified, and 24 studies corresponding to four programs classified as well-established were further analyzed. The results indicated that (1) a limited number of classroom-wide interventions (10.5%) meet the criteria for well-established interventions; (2) program implementation is associated with significant improvement in social-emotional competence, reduced risk of emotional, and behavioral problems, as well as with emerging evidence of positive effects on executive functions or school readiness; and (3) outcomes are reported in the context of mainly rigorously conducted experimental research, which could explain the low risk bias ratings for random assignment, baseline equivalence, or attrition. Taken together, these findings suggest that well-established classroom-based interventions could be promoted as examples of best practices which can be systematically implemented within schools. However, more research is needed to identify key ingredients of program effectiveness, as well as to understand the contextual school-related factors, which enable successful transfer from research to large-scale implementation of classroom-wide SEL practices.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by significant social functioning impairments, including (but not limited to) emotion recognition, mentalizing, and joint attention. Despite extensive investigation into the correlates of social functioning in ASD, only recently has there been focus on the role of low-level sensory input, particularly visual processing. Extensive gaze deficits have been described in ASD, from basic saccadic function through to social attention and the processing of complex biological motion. Given that social functioning often relies on accurately processing visual information, inefficient visual processing may contribute to the emergence and sustainment of social functioning difficulties in ASD. To explore the association between measures of gaze and social functioning in ASD, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. A total of 95 studies were identified from a search of CINAHL Plus, Embase, OVID Medline, and psycINFO databases in July 2021. Findings support associations between increased gaze to the face/head and eye regions with improved social functioning and reduced autism symptom severity. However, gaze allocation to the mouth appears dependent on social and emotional content of scenes and the cognitive profile of participants. This review supports the investigation of gaze variables as potential biomarkers of ASD, although future longitudinal studies are required to investigate the developmental progression of this relationship and to explore the influence of heterogeneity in ASD clinical characteristics. Lay Summary This review explored how eye gaze (e.g., where a person looks when watching a movie) is associated with social functioning in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found evidence that better social functioning in ASD was associated with increased eye gaze toward faces/head and eye regions. Individual characteristics (e.g., intelligence) and the complexity of the social scene also influenced eye gaze. Future research including large longitudinal studies and studies investigating the influence of differing presentations of ASD are recommended.

A systematic search in four databases between 2016 and 2021 retrieved 119 Ghanaian studies, and through screening, 16 were selected. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize extracted data. Prevalence of hypertension ranged from 13.0% to 28.4% and prehypertension 22.0% to 51.4%. The non-modifiable hypertension risk factors were age, marital status, gender, and residence. The modifiable risk factors were consuming additional table salt, salted meat, alcohol, canned meats, smoking, and psychological factors, including stress and anxiety. Also, higher education and socio-economic status, employment, access to medical insurance, overweight, and higher BMI were risk factors. Targeted, sustained, systematic, and effective intervention programs should target high-risk people.

AB  - Background: Comorbidity of psychiatric and medical illnesses among older adult populations is highly prevalent and associated with adverse outcomes. Care management is a common form of outpatient support for both psychiatric and medical conditions in which assessment, care planning, and care coordination are provided. Although care management is often remote and delivered by telephone, the evidence supporting this model of care is uncertain. Objective: To perform a systematic review of the literature on remote care management programs for older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and comorbid chronic medical illness. Methods: A systematic review was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A multidatabase search was performed. Articles were included for review if they studied fully remote care management for older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and chronic medical illness or poor physical health. A narrative synthesis was performed. Results: A total of 6 articles representing 6 unique studies met inclusion criteria. The 6 studies included 4 randomized controlled trials, 1 case-matched retrospective cohort study, and 1 pre-post analysis. Two studies focused on specific medical conditions. All interventions were entirely telephonic. Five of 6 studies involved an intervention that was 3 to 6 months in duration. Across the 6 studies, care management demonstrated mixed results in terms of impact on psychiatric outcomes and limited impact on medical outcomes. No studies demonstrated a statistically significant impact on health care utilization or cost. Conclusions: Among older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and comorbid chronic medical illness, remote care management may have favorable impact on psychiatric symptoms, but impact on physical health and health care utilization is uncertain. Future research should focus on identifying effective models and elements of remote care management for this population, with a particular focus on optimizing medical outcomes.

AB  - The current global refugee crisis revealed that refugee children, youth, and adults are uniquely vulnerable to traumatic events. Yet, there are only a few studies available that report robust systematic data on art therapy interventions with mental health in recent refugee populations. The purpose of the study is to synthesize and evaluate (a) the available research evidence on the use of art therapy in reducing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) levels in refugees, and (b) the quality of empirical evidence for each of the reviewed studies. The authors adopted the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) evidence-based practice (EBP) standards and quality indicators to evaluate the methodological soundness of the reviewed studies and the evidence-based classification of art therapy as a treatment intervention. We systematically searched electronic databases of pertinent review articles for the period from 2010 to 2020 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Systematic searches identified 70 research articles but yielded eight eligible journals as per the inclusion criteria. Results indicated that, though considered a promising treatment approach, art therapy is presently classified as an intervention that falls under the category of practice with insufficient evidence. The findings suggest the need for further methodologically sound experimental studies to strengthen the evidence behind art therapy as an intervention to reduce PTSD symptoms in refugees around the world.

AB  - Introduction: Previous research has identified reward sensitivity as an important factor that may contribute to the engagement in eating behavior (e.g., binge eating, emotional eating, etc.) and increase obesity risk. In the current study, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to determine the relationships between reward sensitivity, eating behavior, and obesity-related outcomes. The study focused on two commonly used measures of reward sensitivity in the literature: the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ) and the Behavioral Inhibition Scale/Behavioral Activation Scale (BIS/BAS Scale).Method: We conducted a systematic search to identify studies that analyzed reward sensitivity as a predictor of eating behavior or obesity-related outcomes, and measured reward sensitivity using the SPSRQ or BIS/BAS Scale. The search yielded N=19 total publications included in the review.Results: Findings indicated that reward sensitivity, primarily measured by summary scores on the SPSRQ or BIS/ BAS Scale, were positively associated with a variety of eating behaviors and obesity-related outcomes with small to moderate effect sizes. Findings were most consistent across studies that examined the association between reward sensitivity and eating behavior outcomes (e.g., binge eating, emotional eating) (r values= .08 to .41; p values < .001 to p < .05) and food consumption outcomes (e.g., palatable food intake) (r values = .21 to .40; p < .001 to p values < .05). Findings were less consistent for food craving and BMI outcomes, and revealed these relationships may depend on individual-level factors and/or environment-related factors, (e.g., food cues). A quality evaluation using the Critical Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS tool) indicated that most studies were rated as moderate to strong quality (84%).Conclusion: Findings indicate that elevated reward sensitivity may be a risk factor for engagement in eating behaviors that may increase obesity risk.

AB  - One of the indicators that symbolize the success of an academic field is its academic publications in well-established citation indices. This article first explored the bibliometric characteristics of publications on "teachers' emotional labor" (TEL) in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI), two prestigious citation indices available in the Web of Science (WoS). Search with the term "teacher emotional labor" retrieved 173 publications that included this term in their titles, abstracts, or keywords in the WoS database between 1900 and 2020. The bibliometric characteristics pertaining to numbers of publications, document types, research categories, research areas, authors, journals, universities, and countries were reported. Then, CiteSpace was utilized to visualize TEL research and to obtain insights into its research focuses and its future directions. The findings will contribute to TEL research by informing scholars in the fields of L2 research and psychology and others.

AB  - Cross-frequency coupling (CFC), an electrophysiologically derived measure of oscillatory coupling in the brain, is believed to play a critical role in neuronal computation, learning and communication. It has received much recent attention in the study of both health and disease. We searched for literature that studied CFC during resting state and task-related activities during electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography in psychiatric disorders. Thirty-eight studies were identified, which included attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's dementia, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder and schizophrenia. The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (ID#CRD42021224188). The current review indicates measurable differences exist between CFC in disease states vs. healthy controls. There was variance in CFC at different regions of the brain within the same psychiatric disorders, perhaps this could be explained by the mechanisms and functionality of CFC. There was heterogeneity in methodologies used, which may lead to spurious CFC analyses. Going forward, standardized methodologies need to be established and utilized in further research to understand the neuropathophysiology associated with psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Peripheral vision is fundamental for many real-world tasks, including walking, driving, and aviation. Nonetheless, there has been no effort to connect these applied literatures to research in peripheral vision in basic vision science or sports science. To close this gap, we analyzed 60 relevant papers, chosen according to objective criteria. Applied research, with its real-world time constraints, complex stimuli, and performance measures, reveals new functions of peripheral vision. Peripheral vision is used to monitor the environment (e.g., road edges, traffic signs, or malfunctioning lights), in ways that differ from basic research. Applied research uncovers new actions that one can perform solely with peripheral vision (e.g., steering a car, climbing stairs). An important use of peripheral vision is that it helps compare the position of one's body/vehicle to objects in the world. In addition, many real-world tasks require multitasking, and the fact that peripheral vision provides degraded but useful information means that tradeoffs are common in deciding whether to use peripheral vision or move one's eyes. These tradeoffs are strongly influenced by factors like expertise, age, distraction, emotional state, task importance, and what the observer already knows. These tradeoffs make it hard to infer from eye movements alone what information is gathered from peripheral vision and what tasks we can do without it. Finally, we recommend three ways in which basic, sport, and applied science can benefit each other's methodology, furthering our understanding of peripheral vision more generally.

AB  - Mapping the neural basis of the Affectome was certainly the goal of Jaak Panksepp as he extended the work of a long line of thinkers from William James to Paul Maclean. Jaak's contribution was not just an incremental step, but a move to embrace feelings as a key component of affective science. His goal was to develop objective behavioral measures as he identified the neural substrates associated with affective states. He dedicated his career to studying the biological roots of emotional operating systems and his 1998 book "Affective Neuroscience" stands as a seminal accomplishment that provided a foundation for a field of research that has flourished since. His influences can be seen in many of the reviews created for this project and his early references to comfort zones are central to the human affectome. Indeed, Jaak was a tireless investigator who challenged our thinking, and he gave us many insights and gifts. We are immensely grateful for his contributions and this special issue is dedicated to his memory.

AB  - There is interest in the role of peripheral interleukin-6 (IL-6) in depression and the effect of treatment (e. g., pharmacologic, psychosocial, neurostimulation). However, the relationship between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), IL-6 and depression has not yet been established. We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the association between CBT and change of peripheral IL-6 levels in depressive symptoms or major depressive disorder (MDD). A systematic search of online databases (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) was completed from inception to May 2021. In total, 10 eligible papers with 940 participants reporting peripheral IL-6 levels before and after CBT were included in the analysis. The main result indicates that peripheral levels of IL-6 were significantly lower after CBT intervention in individuals with depression, with a small effect (SMD = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.69, p = 0.02). The results of subgroup analyses demonstrate that (1) there was a significant decrease in IL-6 for studies that were equal to or < 8 weeks in duration vs. more than 8 weeks in duration, and (2) IL-6 was significantly reduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnosis (i.e., DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, or DSM-V) of MDD, but not for the subgroup without DSM diagnosis. Publication year was identified as a potential contributor to heterogeneity of the results from our analysis. Taken together, our findings support the notion that CBT influences peripheral IL-6 in individuals with depression and represents a point of commonality with other antidepressant treatment modalities (e.g., antidepressants).Systematic Review Registration, identifier: 10.17605/osf.io/tr9yh.

AB  - Introduction Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have a significantly higher risk of developing dementia in later disease stages, leading to severe impairments in quality of life and self-functioning. Questions remain on how deep brain stimulation (DBS) affects cognition, and whether we can individualize therapy and reduce the risk for adverse cognitive effects. Our aim in this systematic review is to assess the current knowledge in the field and determine if the findings could influence clinical practice. Methods We have conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines through MEDLINE and Embase databases, with studies being selected for inclusion via a set inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results Sixty-seven studies were included in this systematic review according to the selected criteria. This includes 6 meta-analyses, 18 randomized controlled trials, 17 controlled clinical trials, and 26 observational studies with no control arms. The total number of PD patients encompassed in the studies cited in this review is 3677, not including the meta-analyses. Conclusion Cognitive function in PD patients can deteriorate, in most cases mildly, but still impactful to the quality of life. The strongest evidence is present for deterioration in verbal fluency, while inconclusive evidence is still present for executive function, memory, attention and processing speed. Global cognition does not appear to be significantly impacted by DBS, especially if cognitive screening is performed prior to the procedure, as lower baseline cognitive function is connected to poor outcomes. Further randomized controlled studies are required to increase the level of evidence, especially in the case of globus pallidus internus DBS, pedunculopontine nucleus DBS, and the ventral intermediate nucleus of thalamus DBS, and more long-term studies are required for all respective targets.

AB  - Coral reefs are the fastest collapsing ecosystems from accelerating global warming, sea level, disease, and pollution. Urgent steps are essential to regenerate them, and their biodiversity and environmental services, if there is to be a sustainable "Blue Economy". Methods that greatly increase settlement, growth, survival and resistance to extremely high temperature and pollutant stress are critically needed to regenerate coral reef and coastal ecosystems now and in the future. Safe Extremely Low Voltage (SELV) electrical fields generated by the Biorock electrolytic reef process have been documented for more than 35 years to greatly increase settlement, growth, healing, and survival of marine organisms in general under extreme stress conditions. The visibly observable benefits of electrical stress relief on marine organisms are summarized, and testable hypotheses are proposed to determine mechanisms and improve applications. Although these field observations strongly imply that electricity in the proper range improves stress resistance and health, the mechanisms have never been studied at cellular, biophysical, biochemical, molecular, or genetic levels. Electrical stimulation is the only method known to reverse the impacts of extreme stresses on corals and other marine organisms. Widespread regeneration of coral reef ecosystems by electrotherapy is urgently needed before they become functionally extinct.

AB  - Objectives: Considerable literature has examined the COVID-19 pandemic's negative mental health sequelae. It is recognised that most people experiencing mental health problems present to primary care and the development of interventions to support GPs in the care of patients with mental health problems is a priority. This review examines interventions to enhance GP care of mental health disorders, with a view to reviewing how mental health needs might be addressed in the post-COVID-19 era. Methods: Five electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and WHO 'Global Research on COVID-19') were searched from May - July 2021 for papers published in English following Arksey and O'Malley's six-stage scoping review process. Results: The initial search identified 148 articles and a total of 29 were included in the review. These studies adopted a range of methodologies, most commonly randomised control trials, qualitative interviews and surveys. Results from included studies were divided into themes: Interventions to improve identification of mental health disorders, Interventions to support GPs, Therapeutic interventions, Telemedicine Interventions and Barriers and Facilitators to Intervention Implementation. Outcome measures reported included the Seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 'The Patient Global Impression of Change Scale'. Conclusion: With increasing recognition of the mental health sequelae of COVID-19, there is a lack of large scale trials researching the acceptability or effectiveness of general practice interventions. Furthermore there is a lack of research regarding possible biological interventions (psychiatric medications) for mental health problems arising from the pandemic.

AB  - A biomarker associated with cognition in neurodegenerative dementias would aid in the early detection of disease progression, complement clinical staging and act as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. The current systematic review evaluates the association between cerebrospinal fluid protein markers of synapse loss and neuronal injury and cognition. We performed a systematic search which revealed 67 studies reporting an association between cerebrospinal fluid markers of interest and neuropsychological performance. Despite the substantial heterogeneity between studies, we found some evidence for an association between neurofilament-light and worse cognition in Alzheimer's diseases, frontotemporal dementia and typical cognitive ageing. Moreover, there was an association between cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin and cognition in those with an Alzheimer's-like cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profile. Some evidence was found for cerebrospinal fluid neuronal pentraxin-2 as a correlate of cognition across dementia syndromes. Due to the substantial heterogeneity of the field, no firm conclusions can be drawn from this review. Future research should focus on improving standardization and reporting as well as establishing the importance of novel markers such as neuronal pentraxin-2 and whether such markers can predict longitudinal cognitive decline.

AB  - Background: Social isolation encompasses subjective and objective concepts. Both are associated with negative health consequences and are more prevalent among people with mental health problems than among the general population. To alleviate social isolation, digital interventions have potential as accessible alternatives or adjuncts to face-to-face interventions. This scoping review aimed to describe the types of digital interventions evaluated for feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness in alleviating social isolation among individuals with mental health problems, and to present an overview of the quantitative evidence yielded to inform future intervention design.
   Methods: We searched five electronic databases for quantitative and mixed methods studies published between January 2000 and July 2020. Studies were included if they evaluated digital interventions for individuals with mental health conditions, had subjective and/or objective social isolation as their primary outcome, or as one of their outcomes if no primary outcome was specified. Feasibility studies were included if feasibility outcomes were the primary outcomes and social isolation was among their secondary outcomes. A narrative synthesis was conducted to present our findings. The protocol was registered on Open Science Framework (doi:https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CNX8A).
   Results: Thirty-two studies were included for our review: 16 feasibility studies, seven single-group studies and nine effectiveness trials. There was great variation in the interventions, study designs and sample populations. Interventions included web-based programmes, phone-based programmes, blended interventions, socially assistive robots and virtual reality interventions. Many were feasibility studies, or otherwise not fully powered to detect an effect if one were present, thus preventing clear conclusions about clinical effectiveness. Satisfactory feasibility outcomes indicated potential for future trials to assess these interventions.
   Conclusion: Our scoping review identified a range of digital approaches utilized to alleviate social isolation among individuals with mental health disorders. Conclusions regarding clinical effectiveness cannot be reached due to variability of approaches and lack of large-scale randomized controlled trials. To make clear recommendations for digital social isolation interventions, future research needs to be based on rigorous methods and larger samples. Future studies should also focus on utilizing theory-driven approaches and improving existing approaches to advance the field.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion (SWI) into coastal aquifers is a growing problem for the drinking water supply of coastal communities worldwide, including for the sustainability of coastal ecosystems depending on freshwater inflow. The interface between freshwater and seawater in coastal aquifers is highly dynamic and is sensitive to changes in the hydraulic gradient between the sea-and groundwater levels. Sea level rise, storm surges, and drought are natural drivers changing the hydrostatic equilibrium between fresh-and saltwater. Coastal aquifers are further stressed by groundwater over pumping because of the increasing needs of coastal populations. A systematic literature review and analysis of the current state of understanding the SWI drivers is presented, focusing on recent (1980 to 2020) investigations in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Results confirm that SWI is an active research area in CONUS. The drivers of SWI are increasingly better understood and quantified; however, the need for increased monitoring is also recognized. Our study shows that the number of monitoring sites have not increased significantly over the review period. Additionally, geophysical, and geochemical investigation techniques and numerical modeling tools are not utilized to their full potential, and data on SWI is not readily available from some sources. We conclude that there is a need for more SWI monitoring networks and closer multi-disciplinary collaboration, particularly between practitioners in the field and emerging modeling technique experts. Though we focus primarily on CONUS, our insights may be of value to the broader SWI research community and coastal water quality managers around the globe.

AB  - As we enter the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, extensive efforts to reverse the decline of ocean health are taking place. Moreover, the need to utilize innovative and integrative approaches to aid in these efforts and address marine ecological questions are urgent. Transcriptomic technologies provide tools to further our understanding of an organism's biology by allowing researchers to rapidly gain information on the genetic variation of populations and the regulation of cellular processes and pathways through gene presence, absence, and expression. Here, we review the application of transcriptomics in the field of marine ecology over the last decade, following a systematic literature review approach. We found 478 articles that fit our search criteria of using transcriptomic approaches to address ecological hypotheses, with 70% of these studies occurring within the last 5 years. Among the analysed articles, 51.7% involved a type of stressor, 16.6% used transcriptomics to study adaptation, and another 15.9% researched ecological interactions. Most articles investigated species from kingdom Animalia, with a high representation from both molluscs (19.5%) and chordates (13.3%), and only 22% of studies had a fieldwork component. Our review demonstrates how the use of transcriptomic techniques in the field of marine ecology is increasing and how they are being applied. Although there are still challenges researchers experience using such techniques, particularly when annotating genes in non-model species and those with no prior genomic resources, these innovative technologies are extremely valuable in investigating differential gene expression, molecular pathways, and generating genomic resources.

AB  - Multilayered approaches to suicide prevention combine universal, selective, and indicated prevention interventions. These approaches may be more successful in reducing suicide rates among older adults if they link these layers more systematically: that is, if the programs are designed so that interventions at a lower level facilitate involvement at a higher level when appropriate. This study aimed to examine the effect on suicide rates of the structure of multilayered approaches, and in particular the types of interventions and the connections or linkages between them. We also wished to consider any different effects by sex. A literature search used PubMed and PsycINFO to identify systematic reviews of interventions in this age group. From the reference lists of these articles, we identified controlled studies assessing the impact of a multilayered program on suicide incidence among older adults. We were particularly interested in initiatives linking different kinds of prevention interventions. We found three relevant systematic reviews, and from these, we identified nine eligible studies. These included seven non-randomized controlled studies from rural areas in Japan (average eligible population: 3,087, 59% women, average duration: 8 years). We also found two cohort studies. The first was from a semi-urban area in Padua, Italy (18,600 service users, 84% women, duration: 11 years). The second was from urban Hong Kong, with 351 participants (57% women) over a 2-year follow-up period. We used a narrative synthesis of these studies to identify five different multilayered programs with different forms of connections or linkages between layers. Two studies/programs (Italy and Hong Kong) involved selective and indicated prevention interventions. One study/program (Yuri, Japan) included universal and selective prevention interventions, and the final six studies (two programs in northern Japan) involved linkages between all three layers. We also found that these linkages could be either formal or informal. Formal linkages were professional referrals between levels. Informal linkages included advice from professionals and self-referrals. Several of the studies noted that during the program, the service users developed relationships with services or providers, which may have facilitated movements between levels. All five programs were associated with reduced suicide incidence among women in the target groups or communities. Two programs were also associated with a reduction among men. The study authors speculated that women were more likely to accept services than men, and that the care provided in some studies did less to address issues that are more likely to affect men, such as suicidal impulsivity. We therefore suggest that it is important to build relationships between levels, especially between selective and indicated prevention interventions, but that these can be both formal and informal. Additionally, to reach older men, it may be important to create systematic methods to involve mental health professionals in the indicated prevention intervention. Universal interventions, especially in conjunction with systematically linked indicated and selective interventions, can help to disseminate the benefits across the community.

AB  - Experiences of discrimination such as everyday racism can negatively affect the mental and physical health of children and adolescents with an immigrant background and impair their integration process in the host societies. Although experiences of racism are part of the everyday life of many minors affected by the process of "Othering " (e.g., those with an immigrant background), an overview of empirical findings is missing for this age group worldwide. A systematic review was conducted to identify and analyze international research on the impact of discrimination on the developmental outcomes and integration of immigrant children and adolescents. Three scientific databases were systematically searched up to June 11, 2021. A total of k = 4,769 identified publications were reviewed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria in terms of the PICOS format by independent reviewers. Thirty-four primary studies published between 1998 and 2021 met all inclusion criteria. The samples examined were mainly migrant youth (k = 30), with only k = 2 studies assessing refugee youth and k = 1 study assessing both migrant and refugee youth. The majority of included studies assessed perceived discrimination, with only k = 1 study directly assessing experiences of racism. The association between discrimination or racism and developmental outcomes was assessed by the included studies within the three main topics of (a) mental and physical health-related outcomes (k = 30, e.g., self-esteem, depressive symptoms), (b) school-related outcomes (k = 6, e.g., academic achievement), and (c) other developmental outcomes (k = 13, e.g., misconduct or delinquency). Data collection procedures were implemented, and findings on minors' developmental outcomes and integration process who experience discrimination and racism were summarized and discussed. The current review suggests experienced (racial) discrimination as a negative predictor of children and adolescents' (mental) health-related outcomes, while no clear results could be found for the association between discrimination and school-related outcomes. A need for more empirical research focusing on the path and (possibly) indirect link between discrimination and children and adolescents' school-related outcomes as well as resulting school recommendations and the chosen career path was derived.

AB  - Background: Research assessing lipid levels in individuals diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has yielded mixed results. This study aimed to employ meta-analytic techniques to characterize the relationship between the levels of lipid profiles and PTSD. Methods: We performed meta-analyses of studies comparing profiles and levels of lipids between PTSD patients and healthy individuals by searching Embase, Ovid Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases for the studies until March 2021. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models with the restricted maximum-likelihood estimator to synthesize the effect size assessed by standardized mean difference (SMD) across studies. Findings: A total of 8,657 abstracts were identified, and 17 studies were included. Levels of total cholesterol (TC) (SMD = 0.57 95% CI, 0.27-0.87, p = 0.003), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI, 0.19-0.76, p = 0.004), and triglyceride (TG) (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.22-0.70, p = 0.001) were found to be higher, while levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (SMD = -0.47, -0.88 to -0.07, p = 0.026) were found to be lower in PTSD patients compared to healthy controls. Subgroup analysis showed that TG levels were higher in PTSD patients who were on or off of psychotropic medications, both < 40 and >= 40 years of age, and having body mass index of < 30 and >= 30 compared to healthy controls. Interpretation: This work suggested dysregulation of lipids in PTSD that may serve as biomarker to predict the risk. The study will be useful for physicians considering lipid profiles in PTSD patients to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of blue-light therapy in seasonal and non-seasonal major depressive disorder (MDD), by comparison to active and inactive control conditions. Methods We searched Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline, PsycInfo, and Clinicaltrials.gov through January 17, 2022, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using search terms for blue/blue-enhanced, light therapy, and depression/seasonal affective disorder. Two independent reviewers extracted data. The primary outcome was the difference in endpoint scores on the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - Seasonal Affective Disorder (SIGH-SAD) or the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement (SIGH-ADS) between blue light and comparison conditions. Secondary outcomes were response (>= 50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on a depression scale) and remission rates (endpoint score in the remission range). Results Of 582 articles retrieved, we included nine RCTs (n = 347 participants) assessing blue-light therapy. Seven studies had participants with seasonal MDD and two studies included participants with non-seasonal MDD. Four studies compared blue light to an inactive light condition (efficacy studies), and five studies compared it to an active condition (comparison studies). For the primary outcome, a meta-analysis with random-effects models found no evidence for the efficacy of blue-light conditions compared to inactive conditions (mean difference [MD] = 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.28 to 6.14, P = 0.20); however, blue-light also showed no differences compared to active conditions (MD = -0.11; 95% CI, -2.38 to 2.16, P = 0.93). There were no significant differences in response and remission rates between blue-light conditions and inactive or active light conditions. Blue-light therapy was overall well-tolerated. Conclusions The efficacy of blue-light therapy in the treatment of seasonal and non-seasonal MDD remains unproven. Future trials should be of longer duration, include larger sample sizes, and attempt to better standardize the parameters of light therapy.

AB  - Objective: We evaluated the effects of mental health interventions among people hospitalized with COVID-19.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and searched 9 databases (2 Chinese-language) from December 31, 2019 to June 28, 2021. Eligible randomized controlled trials assessed interventions among hospitalized COVID-19 patients that targeted mental health symptoms. Due to the poor quality of trials, we sought to verify accuracy of trial reports including results.
   Results: We identified 47 randomized controlled trials from China (N = 42), Iran (N = 4) and Turkey (N = 1) of which 21 tested the efficacy of psychological interventions, 5 physical and breathing exercises, and 21 a combination of interventions. Trial information could only be verified for 3 trials of psychological interventions (cognitive behavioral, guided imagery, multicomponent online), and these were the only trials with low risk of bias on at least 4 of 7 domains. Results could not be pooled or interpreted with confidence due to the degree of poor reporting and trial quality, the frequency of what were deemed implausibly large effects, and heterogeneity.
   Conclusion: Trials of interventions to address mental health in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, collectively, are not of sufficient quality to inform practice. Health care providers should refer to existing expert recommendations and standard hospital-based practices.

AB  - Background: Interest in astrology has surged recently, possibly due to the uncertain conditions in the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While belief in astrology is common and socially legitimized in many cultures, a few instances of excessive engagement with astrological services or "fortune-telling addiction" are indicating a risk of adverse mental health consequences. Aim: To understand the existing research base on correlates of belief in astrology and fortune-telling. Method: We have carried out a scoping review to synthesize the available literature base on belief in astrology and to review the evidence for "fortune-telling addiction" using Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. Databases of PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO, and SCOPUS were searched for relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Results: The search findings revealed the association of belief in astrology with cognitive, personality, and psychological factors such as thinking style, self-concept verification, and stress. Case studies on "fortune-telling addiction" have conceptualized it as a possible behavioral addiction and have reported symptoms such as distress, cravings, and salience. Conclusions: However, further research on the condition along with its psychosocial determinants is necessary for the development of preventative and curative intervention efforts.

AB  - Functioning and quality of life (QOL) are typical outcomes assessed in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD); however, meta-analytical evidence remains scarce. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess functioning and QOL antidepressant outcomes in this population. Eight electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts) were searched for double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to July 31, 2020. RCTs that compared antidepressants with placebo for treating functioning and QOL in children and adolescents with MDD were included. Primary outcomes were mean change scores of functioning and QOL scales from baseline to post-treatment. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine whether results were affected by moderator variables (e.g., medication type, age, sample size, and treatment duration). From 7284 publications, we included 17 RCTs (all 17 assessed functioning and 4 assessed QOL outcomes) including 2537 participants. Antidepressants showed significant positive effects on functioning (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.09-0.25, p < 0.0001) but not on QOL (SMD = 0.11, 95% CI = -0.02 to 0.24, p = 0.093), with no significant heterogeneity. The subgroup analysis showed that second-generation antidepressants (especially fluoxetine, escitalopram, and nefazodone), but not first-generation antidepressants, led to significant improvements in functioning. Antidepressants (especially second generation) improve functioning but not QOL in children and adolescents with MDD. However, well-designed clinical studies using large samples are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - The mental health initiatives at the workplace are growing in numbers over the past few years. Public and private sectors continue to explore avenues to navigate and adapt initiatives to promote employee's mental wellbeing. However, such initiatives in the Indian context are not thoroughly studied. We attempted to review existing literature on workplace mental health interventions in the Indian context. The scoping review was conducted following the standard process as recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for scoping reviews. We searched in the databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus. Scientific literature including gray literature of the past decade was searched to synthesize evidence on types of mental health interventions and their unique features. Of the 1,311 records, 30 records that met the inclusion criteria were included for the final review. The review highlights evidence on stress and mental health problems faced by the working population and various strategies adopted by organizations to address mental health problems. However, very few interventions were accompanied by comprehensive needs assessment, impact evaluation and workplace policy initiatives. Most interventions were curative-provisioning counseling services, limiting the scope of mental health promotion activities. Addressing mental health wellbeing comprehensively and aligning an organization's policies are crucial. Research on employee mental health, its risk factors, and cost-effectiveness analysis of workplace mental health interventions in the Indian context need to be prioritized.

AB  - Objective As the reproduction season's effect on the mental health status is unknown, this study aims to explore the association between seasons and postpartum depression. Methods A comprehensive search in databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE, was performed to identify studies reporting the relationship between reproduction season and postpartum depression. The latter was assessed using certain methods. Moreover, the study design and duration, sample size, the definition of four seasons, outcome assessment, method, and conclusion were extracted. Two independent authors screened the studies independently, and PRISMA 2020 was used as the reporting standard (PRISMA registration ID is 284524). Results A total of five studies including 103,986 participants met our criteria. In the sensitivity analysis, the result of the meta-analysis shows that women who gave birth in spring, summer, or autumn had a lower risk of postpartum depression compared to those who gave birth in winter (RR: 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78-0.88). Conclusion Women who gave birth in the other seasons were less likely to have postpartum depression compared to those who gave birth in winter. This result could help couples make overall decisions and help the puerpera take preventive measures against postpartum depression.

AB  - Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line psychotherapeutic treatment that has been recommended for psychiatric disorders. Prior neuroimaging studies have provided preliminary evidence suggesting that CBT can have an impact on the activity of brain regions and functional integration between regions. However, the results are far from conclusive. The present article aimed to detect characteristic changes in brain activation following CBT across psychiatric disorders.
   Method: Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and PubMed databases were searched to identify whole-brain functional neuroimaging studies of CBT through 4 August 2021. To be included in the meta-analysis, studies were required to examine functional activation changes between pre-and post-CBT. The included studies were then divided into subgroups according to different task paradigms. Then, an activation likelihood estimation algorithm (ALE) was performed in the different meta-analyses to identify whether brain regions showed consistent effects. Finally, brain regions identified from the meta-analysis were categorized into eight functional networks according to the spatial correlation values between independent components and the template.
   Results: In total, 13 studies met inclusion criteria. Three different meta-analyses were performed separately for total tasks, emotion tasks, and cognition tasks. In the total task ALE meta-analysis, the left precuneus was found to have decreased activation. For the cognition task ALE meta-analysis, left anterior cingulate (ACC) and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) were found to have decreased activation following CBT. However, the emotion task ALE meta-analysis did not find any specific brain regions showing consistent effects. A review of included studies revealed default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and salience network (SN) were the most relevant among the eight functional networks.
   Conclusion: The results revealed that the altered activation in the prefrontal cortex and precuneus were key regions related to the effects of CBT. Therefore, CBT may modulate the neural circuitry of emotion regulation. This finding provides recommendations for the rapidly developing literature.

AB  - L-glutamate (L-Glu) is a nonessential amino acid, but an extensively utilised excitatory neurotransmitter with critical roles in normal brain function. Aberrant accumulation of L-Glu has been linked to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. To investigate this further, we systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the effects of L-Glu on neuronal viability linked to the pathogenesis and/or progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). A search in PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection was conducted to retrieve studies that investigated an association between L-Glu and pathology for five NDDs: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). Together, 4060 studies were identified, of which 71 met eligibility criteria. Despite several inadequacies, including small sample size, employment of supraphysiological concentrations, and a range of administration routes, it was concluded that exposure to L-Glu in vitro or in vivo has multiple pathogenic mechanisms that influence neuronal viability. These mechanisms include oxidative stress, reduced antioxidant defence, neuroinflammation, altered neurotransmitter levels, protein accumulations, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, intracellular calcium level changes, and effects on neuronal histology, cognitive function, and animal behaviour. This implies that clinical and epidemiological studies are required to assess the potential neuronal harm arising from excessive intake of exogenous L-Glu.

AB  - Dementia is a neurological condition characterized by numerous types of central nervous system diseases, which gradually deteriorates an individual's reasoning, rational thinking, and judgment abilities. As a serious public health concern that currently affects more than 50 million older adults, dementia is one of the most significant causes of incapacity, disability, and dependency among older adults. As new cases are expected to increase exponentially in the next three decades, dementia, which is not a normal feature of healthy aging despite the fact that it generally affects older adults disproportionately, requires enormous management and care efforts due to its associated socioeconomic, psychological, and physical burdens that involve the patient, their caregivers, guardians, family members, and society at large. Presently, there is no cure for dementia; however, this condition could be prevented. This narrative review aimed to provide a broad overview of studies detailing the alternative lifestyle modification-centered preventive measures against dementia. A comprehensive search of key databases to find articles related to this topic revealed that participating in regular physical activities, healthy eating and dieting, avoiding all forms of smoking, avoiding air pollutants, halting or reducing alcohol consumption, exercising the mind and being socially dynamic, getting enough rest and establishing good sleeping habits, infection prevention, stress prevention, avoidance of injuries, preventing the effects of social isolation and lockdowns, continuing education, and depression prevention are protective measures against the development of dementia.

AB  - Sex differences are poorly studied within the field of mental health, even though there is evidence of disparities (with respect to brain anatomy, activation patterns, and neurochemistry, etc.) that can significantly influence the etiology and course of mental disorders. The objective of this work was to review sex differences in adolescents (aged 13-18 years) diagnosed with ADHD (according to the DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria) in terms of substance use disorder (SUD), prevalence, pharmacological therapy and mental health. We searched three academic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) and performed a narrative review of a total of 21 articles. The main conclusions of this research were (1) girls with ADHD are more at risk of substance use than boys, although there was no consensus on the prevalence of dual disorders; (2) girls are less frequently treated because of underdiagnosis and because they are more often inattentive and thereby show less disruptive behavior; (3) together with increased impairment in cognitive and executive functioning in girls, the aforementioned could be related to greater substance use and poorer functioning, especially in terms of more self-injurious behavior; and (4) early diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, especially in adolescent girls, is essential to prevent early substance use, the development of SUD, and suicidal behavior.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review (SR) of SRs was to assess the effectiveness of telerehabilitation based on behavior modification techniques (t-BMT) in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. We searched in PubMed, PEDro, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar (January 2022). The outcome measures were pain intensity, disability, psychological distress, pain-related fear of movement, disease impact, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and physical function. This review was previously registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO (CRD42021262192). Methodological quality was analyzed using the AMSTAR and ROBIS scales, and the strength of evidence was established according to the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee grading criteria. Four SRs with and without meta-analyses covering 25 trials and involving 4593 patients were included. Of the three SRs that assessed pain intensity, two reported a significant decrease compared to usual care. Contradictory results were also found in the management of psychological distress, and of depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, two reviews found that t-BMT has significant effects on disability, and one review found that t-BMT seems to be effective for improving pain-related fear of movement and disease impact. Finally, one review found that t-BMT does not seem to be an effective modality to improve physical function. The quality of evidence was limited for all outcomes assessed. The results obtained showed that t-BMT was effective in improving disability, disease impact, and pain-related fear of movement, but it was not effective in improving physical function in patients with chronic pain. Mixed evidence was found for pain intensity, psychological distress, and depressive and anxiety symptoms, with a limited quality of evidence.

AB  - Increasing numbers of individuals suffer from post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), which manifests with persistent symptoms, the most prevalent being dyspnea, fatigue, and musculoskeletal, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for individuals with PACS. We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, CINHAL, Scopus, Prospero, and PEDro databases and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2021. We screened 516 citations for eligibility, i.e., trials that included individuals with PACS exposed to exercise-based rehabilitation interventions. Five RCTs were included, accounting for 512 participants (aged 49.2-69.4 years, 65% males). Based on the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2.0), two RCTs had "low risk of bias", and three were in the "some concerns" category. Three RCTs compared experimental rehabilitation interventions with no or minimal rehabilitation, while two compared two active rehabilitation interventions. Rehabilitation seemed to improve dyspnea, anxiety, and kinesiophobia. Results on pulmonary function were inconsistent, while improvements were detected in muscle strength, walking capacity, sit-to-stand performance, and quality of life. Pending further studies based on qualitatively sound designs, these first findings seem to advocate for rehabilitation interventions to lessen disability due to PACS.

AB  - There was a surge in psychological distress and emotional burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual reality (VR) is helpful as a psychological intervention whilst maintaining physical or social distancing. The present systematic review assessed the role of VR as a psychological intervention tool for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic review that followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. This study used the search-related terms: (Virtual reality OR simulated-3D-environment OR VR) AND (covid! or corona!) AND (mental* OR psychologic* OR well* OR health*) AND (intervention) on six databases, i.e., MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Ovid Medline, EMBASE, ACM digital library, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from the inception date until 23 June 2021. We finally included four studies in the systematic review out of the 379 references imported for screening. These studies reveal that VR is beneficial as a psychological tool for intervention in individuals with mental health problems. Immersed in the telepresence, interacting in a 3-D format compared to a 2-D layout, having a sense of enjoyment and engagement, activating an affective-motivational state, "escaping" to a virtual from the real world are pivotal faucets of VR as a psychological tool for intervention.

AB  - Purpose of review There is increasing interest in the links between exposure to air pollution and a range of health outcomes. The association with mental health however is much less established. This article reviews developments in the field over the past 12 months, highlighting the evidence for causation, associations between multiple air pollutants and mental health outcomes, and assesses the challenges of researching this topic. Recent findings Increasingly rigorous methods are being applied to the investigation of a broader range of mental health outcomes. These methods include basic science, neuroimaging, and observational studies representing diverse geographical locations. Cohort studies with linked high-resolution air pollutant exposure data are common, facilitating advanced analytic methods. To date, meta-analyses have demonstrated small and significant positive associations between long-term exposure to fine particulate matter and depressive symptoms and cognitive decline. Methodological complexities in measuring exposure and outcome pose ongoing difficulties for the field. Literature on this topic has recently seen an appreciable expansion. Work that better estimates daily exposure, controls for complex confounders, and is driven by hypotheses founded in candidate causal mechanisms would help clarify associations, and inform targeted interventions and policymakers.

AB  - Purpose of review Understanding the association between urbanization and Internet addiction is essential to the design and implementation of Internet addiction prevention measures in urban areas. This epidemiological review explores the urbanization-Internet addiction association and its potential underlying factors. Recent findings Nine studies have reported that Internet addiction prevalence is higher in urban areas, but three studies have noted the opposite. Psychiatric disorders and stress are the most commonly mentioned factors underlying the association. The effects of urbanization on Internet availability, Internet cafes, online gaming, outdoor or interactive activities, and family regulation and monitoring have been suggested to lead to higher Internet addiction risk. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, obesity, sleep problems, and the migration of parents to urban areas in search of work have strengthened the effect of urbanization on Internet addiction. Early assessment and treatment provided by mental health services are crucial for mitigating the effect of urbanization on Internet addiction risk. Cities should be designed to provide adequate space for physical and interactive activities. To promote outdoor activities, air pollution, traffic congestion, and crime should be controlled. Prospective face-to-face studies involving analysis of data on pollution, traffic, and Internet addiction could provide evidence to elucidate the urbanization- Internet addiction association.

AB  - Background. Current medical literature suggests a symptomatic overlap between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which makes understanding their impact on the treatment process a challenging undertaking. Objective. The key aim of this work was to deliver a comprehensive overview of empirical and observational studies concerning the overlap between both psychopathologies. Method. Two independent authors searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases between April and July 2020 utilizing relevant MeSH terms. Subsequently, a systematic scoping review was undertaken according to the PRISMA-ScR Statement to identify all relevant publications concerning the overlap of OCD and PTSD symptomatology. We included peer reviewed studies published in any language that contributed quantitative or qualitative data that addressed the relationship between OCD and PTSD symptoms as the main aim or outcome of the study. Non-peer-reviewed articles, studies that did not address this phenomenon of interest, and gray literature documents were excluded. This review was not registered into the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, since, according to the National Institute of Health Research, scoping reviews are ineligible for registration into PROSPERO. Results. Twenty-five relevant studies were included (11 cross-sectional studies, 5 longitudinal-prospective studies, 4 case series, 4 case studies and 1 retrospective study). We did not conduct any statistical analysis due to the diversity of the included studies, thus proceeding to realize a thematic synthesis of the obtained data. Discussion and conclusion. A symptomatic overlap exists between both comorbidities in some clinical populations, and this relationship may hamper treatment outcomes.

AB  - Perinatal brain injury occurs in 5.14/1000 live births in England. A significant proportion of these injuries result from hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term infants and intracranial haemorrhage (NH) or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in preterm infants. Standardised care necessitates minimal handling from parents and professionals to reduce the progression of injury. This can potentially increase parental stress through the physical inability to bond with their baby. Recent research highlights the ability of music therapy (MT) to empower parental bonding without handling, through sharing culturally informed personal music with their infant. This review therefore aimed to systematically evaluate the use of MT with infants diagnosed with perinatal brain injury in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Search terms were combined into three categories (audio stimulation (MT), population (neonates) and condition (brain injury), and eight electronic databases were used to identify relevant studies following PRISMA guidelines. Eleven studies using music or vocal stimulation with infants diagnosed with perinatal brain injury were identified and quality assessed using Cochrane ROB2, the ROBINSI Tool and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Studies used either voice as live (n = 6) or pre-recorded (n = 3) interventions or pre-recorded instrumental music (n = 2). Studies had two primary areas of focus: developmental outcomes and physiological effects. Results suggested the use of music interventions led to a reduction of infants' pain scores during procedures and cardiorespiratory events, improved feeding ability (increase oral feeding rate, volume intake and feeds per day) and resulted in larger amygdala volumes than control groups. Additionally, MT intervention on the unit supported long-term hospitalised infants in the acquisition of developmental milestones. Vocal soothing was perceived to be an accessible intervention for parents. However, infants with PVL showed signs of stress in complex interventions, which also potentially resulted in an increase in maternal anxiety in one study. MT with infants diagnosed with perinatal brain injury can have positive effects on infants' behavioural and neurological parameters and support parental involvement in their infants' developmental care. Further feasibility studies are required using MT to determine appropriate outcome measures for infants and the support required for parents to allow future comparison in large-scale randomised control trials.

AB  - One-third of Canadian children experience some form of maltreatment in childhood, which is associated with poor mental, emotional, and behavioral outcomes in adulthood. Yet, exposure to child maltreatment is far from deterministic, with many children adapting in the face of adversity. Over the last 30 years, the study of resilience has centered on understanding how to reduce poor developmental outcomes and promote positive adaptation following exposure to risk and adversities, such as child maltreatment. The present paper provides a review of resilience theory as it pertains to child maltreatment. We review the literature to date examining resilience mechanisms following child maltreatment across the social ecology, including the individual, family, and community levels. We identify prevention and intervention strategies across the social ecology that are effective in promoting resilience for children who have been maltreated. Finally, we identify research gaps and discuss translational research directions for increasing positive outcomes for children who have experienced maltreatment.
   Public Significance Statement Child maltreatment is a significant public health concern in Canada and is a leading cause of mental health difficulties in adulthood. Despite these pernicious experiences, children can adapt in the face of maltreatment, demonstrating resilient outcomes. We examine the theories, mechanisms, and interventions for promoting resilience for children who have been maltreated. We discuss future directions for the field to increase the translation of knowledge into practice.

AB  - Despite growing international interest, the caregiving body of literature lacks a recent understanding of young carers' experiences and their contact with the health care system. We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies to (1) synthesize more recent qualitative evidence on young carers' experience, and (2) to identify how these young carers interact with the health care system in their caregiving role. Using a meta-ethnographic synthesis, a total of 28 empirical studies met inclusion. Key findings helped inform an overarching framework of the experience of young carers as illustrated by a journey map. The journey map is a visual depiction of the stages these young carers go through when in a caregiving role framed by three themes: (1) encountering caregiving; (2) being a young caregiver, and (3) moving beyond caregiving. The caregiving experience is perceived by young people as challenging and complex, which could be improved with more informational navigation and emotional support. Understanding these experiences provides insight into gaps in health services and potential solutions that align with the stages outlined in the journey map.

AB  - Yoga is recognized and practiced for different levels of prevention since antiquity. The current scoping review aimed to identify and document the evidence reporting the effect of yoga interventions on immunity against COVID-19 infection. Three databases--PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, were searched to identify eligible studies. Articles published in English after 2010 and assessing the impact of any form of yoga (such as yogasanas, meditations, or pranayamas) on immunological markers were included in the review. The studies without information of the intervention on immunity markers, and experience sharing reviews were excluded. The search yielded 45 eligible articles with majority of the studies being published from the USA and India. Most of the studies were randomized controlled trials, enrolling the adult population with a specific focus on diseases like HIV, cancer, and heart failure. It was observed that a variety of yoga interventions along with meditation and pranayama, in different combinations were used by the authors. However, all these studies unanimously reported improvement in immunological profile (indicated by improved biochemical markers) of an individual (irrespective of disease state and type) with yoga. Moreover, the beneficial effects of these traditional Indian interventions were also found to have a positive impact on overall physical and physiological wellbeing and quality of life. Findings from the existing literature indicate that the practice of yoga has the potential to strengthen cell-mediated immunity and hence could be used as an effective preventive measure against COVID-19 where immunity plays a critical role.

AB  - Background: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a third-generation cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), has proved its efficacy amidst various mental disorders. A growing body of studies has shown that ACT can improve obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) severity in recent years. To assess the effect of ACT on OCD, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a basis for therapists to use different psychological dimensions of ACT for OCD. Methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, EBSCO Host, and literature references were searched until May 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other study designs assessing the effect of ACT among adults suffering from OCD were examined. Results: Fourteen studies, including 413 participants, published between 2010 and 2021 were identified. ACT made statistically significant progress in the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) compared with control conditions. Conclusion: After reviewing all the ACT studies, we acknowledge the plausibility of ACT in treating OCD and improving its symptoms for the clinical population. ACT can also be an adjunct therapy for other well-established treatments. It also favors targeting psychological inflexibility. Further well-controlled and high-quality RCTs are required for a better conclusion in further studies.

AB  - Objective Meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in fibromyalgia on the domains of pain, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Method Publications were searched with the keywords "repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation" and "fibromyalgia" for randomized controlled trials that compare rTMS with sham stimulation for treating pain, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Trials available until April 2021 were searched through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The postintervention scores after 4 weeks for pain, depression, anxiety, and quality of life were extracted to compare the effects of rTMS and sham. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on the stimulation site. Results From 265 screened articles, 11 eligible randomized controlled trials involving 303 patients were included. The results show that rTMS is more effective than sham stimulation in improving pain (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.62 to -0.08; p = .01) and quality of life (SMD = -0.51; 95% CI = -0.78 to -0.23; p = .0003). It is not more effective than sham stimulation for depression, and anxiety. After sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis revealed that primary motor cortex stimulation was more effective than sham for improving pain (SMD = -0.57; 95% CI = -0.91 to -0.23; p = <0.01). Neither dorsolateral prefrontal cortex nor primary motor cortex stimulation was more effective than sham in improving depression and anxiety. Conclusions rTMS is more effective than sham in improving pain and quality of life, but it does not demonstrate reduction in depression or anxiety.

AB  - Replicated clinical trials have demonstrated rapid and robust antidepressant effects with ketamine in treatment resistant mood disorders. Sex (biological) and gender differences in therapeutic effects for any new intervention is an important consideration, however, the differential efficacy, safety and tolerability of ketamine in males versus females remains underexplored. The objective of the present systematic review is to identify and qualitatively synthesize all published clinical studies relevant to the sex differential effects of ketamine for mood disorders. A systematic search of PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo from inception until January 20, 2021, yielded 27 reports including 1715 patients (742 males and 973 females) that met inclusion criteria. Results from the vast majority of studies (88.8%) do not support significant sex differences in antidepressant response, tolerability or safety of ketamine. Nine (33.3%) of the reports included a bioanalytical component in the analysis and only one reported on sex differences. Evidence from the present review does not support clinically or statistically significant sex differences in therapeutic effects with ketamine. Nevertheless, future studies should continue to consider sex and biological sex differences in study design and data analytic plans.

AB  - Kelp forests are experiencing broad scale declines in abundance and shifts in latitudinal ranges in many areas of the world due to numerous environmental stressors, especially those associated with climate change. While the majority of studies on kelp ecology have focused exclusively on the macroscopic sporophyte life stage, a growing number of studies is showing quite convincingly that the microscopic zoospore and gametophyte life stages can be important to establishing spatial patterns in these marine forests, and in facilitating their recovery following deforestation. Unfortunately, their microscopic sizes have made them difficult to study in the field, leading to a 'black box' surrounding what we know about their ecologies. However, advances in experimental methodologies and a growing number of laboratories studying kelp microscopic life stages are revealing how they are affected by variability in environmental conditions, and are providing a clearer picture of how kelp forests might respond to a changing ocean climate. These studies have largely revealed that kelps can disperse over a wide range of distances, enhanced by the synchronous release and vertical transport of zoospores into shallower water, and by floating rafts of reproductive thalli. Settlement on the benthos is facilitated by both positive and negative chemotaxis, and by active selection of microhabitats that favor their growth and survival. Following settlement and subsequent germination, the haploid gametophytes can delay their development and form a bank of microscopic forms that persist during periods that are unfavorable for the large sporophyte populations, or they can develop and undergo sexual reproduction during which they respond to variability in environmental conditions. In particular, they are strongly affected by increases in irradiance (PAR, UVA + UVB) and temperature, decreases in nutrients and salinity, and by sedimentation and grazing. However, the manner in which they respond to these stressors varies among species and with their geographic distributions, which is integral to establishing biogeographic patterns in the large sporophyte populations. Given these factors are expected to change as the ocean climate changes, these species-specific responses have significant implications for future patterns of distribution and abundance of these iconic marine forests.

AB  - BackgroundThe neural activity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients in the resting state without any intervention has not been systematically studied. The purpose of this study was to compare the resting-state brain functions of IBS patients with healthy controls (HCs). MethodsThe published neuroimage studies were obtained from electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core, CNKI Database, Wanfang Database, VIP Database, and CBMdisc. Search dates were from inception to March 14th, 2022. The studies were identified by the preidentified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers compiled the studies and evaluated them for quality and bias. ResultsAltogether 22 fMRI studies were included in this review. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low. The findings indicated that in IBS patients, increased or decreased brain areas were mostly associated with visceral sensations, emotional processing, and pain processing. According to brain network research, IBS may exhibit anomalies in the DMN, CEN, and emotional arousal networks. The fluctuations in emotion (anxiety, sadness) and symptoms in IBS patients were associated with alterations in the relevant brain regions. ConclusionThis study draws a preliminary conclusion that there are insufficient data to accurately distinguish the different neurological features of IBS in the resting state. Additional high-quality research undertaken by diverse geographic regions and teams is required to reach reliable results regarding resting-state changed brain regions in IBS.

AB  - Ferroptosis is defined as an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death pathway, with specific morphological phenotypes and biochemical changes. There is a growing realization that ferroptosis has significant implications for several neurodegenerative diseases. Even though ferroptosis is different from other forms of programmed death such as apoptosis and autophagic death, they involve a number of common protein molecules. This review focuses on current research on ferroptosis and summarizes the cross-talk among ferroptosis, apoptosis, and autophagy that are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. We hope that this information provides new ideas for understanding the mechanisms and searching for potential therapeutic approaches and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The current bipolar disorder treatment guidelines focus mainly on the prevention of recurrence and stabilization of acute mood episodes while neglecting outcomes related to the longitudinal course of illness. We systematically reviewed studies that assess the impact of disease progression in the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for clinical trials that moderated treatment effects by number of previous episodes, disease length, or a clinical staging model. We retrieved 6,156 potential abstracts. After deduplication, 5,376 were screened and eight studies met inclusion criteria. Seven trials moderated results by number of prior episodes, and one of those also used a measure of disease length. One trial used a clinical staging model and yielded informing results. Only three studies evaluated pharmacological interventions, the other five assessing psychotherapeutic modalities. Most of the studies were post-hoc analysis of clinical trials not primarily aimed at studying variables associated with illness trajectory. Overall, a loss of efficacy was found according to clinical progression, which supports early intervention. Tailored recommendations according to disease stages cannot be made. Furthermore, we identified methodological weaknesses and strengths in this subfield of research, suggesting the use of clinical staging models for future studies.

AB  - Background People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) not fully accounted for by traditional or HIV-specific risk factors. Successful management of HIV does not eliminate this excess risk. Thus, there is a need to identify novel risk factors for CVD among people with HIV (PWH). Purpose Our objective was to systematically review the literature on one such candidate CVD risk factor in PWH-depression. Methods A systematic literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL was performed to identify published English-language studies examining associations of depression with clinical CVD, subclinical CVD, and biological mechanisms (immune activation, systemic inflammation, altered coagulation) among PWH between the earliest date and June 22, 2021. Results Thirty-five articles were included. For clinical CVD (k = 8), findings suggests that depression is consistently associated with an increased risk of incident CVD. For subclinical CVD (k = 5), one longitudinal analysis reported a positive association, and four cross-sectional analyses reported null associations. For immune activation (k = 13), systemic inflammation (k = 17), and altered coagulation (k = 5), findings were mixed, and there was considerable heterogeneity in sample characteristics and methodological quality across studies. Conclusions Depression may be an independent risk factor for CVD among PWH. Additional research is needed to confirm depression's association with clinical CVD and to determine whether depression is consistently and meaningfully associated with subclinical CVD and biological mechanisms of CVD in HIV. We propose a research agenda for this emerging area.

AB  - Autistic children's social skills do not always align with those of their neurotypical peers and research suggests that this can negatively impact quality of life. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of extended reality (XR) interventions in helping autistic children to enhance their social skills. Five electronic databases were systematically searched and seventeen studies were identified. The majority targeted social-emotional reciprocity and were of relatively low quality. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether effects were generalisable, sustained or important to autistic people. Research in this field is in its infancy and evidence of effectiveness should be viewed with caution. Future studies should aim for high-quality, theory-driven research, and involve autistic people to ensure meaningful outcomes. PROSPERO ID: CRD42021229442

AB  - Background and objectives: The human rights violation of human trafficking and modern slavery could be described as multiple and prolonged traumatisation. This corresponds to the type of trauma identified as most likely to be associated with 'complex post-traumatic stress disorder' (CPTSD) as identified in the new 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). This review aims to collate the evidence of complex post-traumatic stress disorder in populations that have been trafficked, with the intention to highlight important considerations to be made in terms of managing survivor's health care needs and minimising further traumatisation.
   Methods: Five databases were searched using key terms related to human trafficking, modern slavery, and complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Results: Five studies reporting on a total of 342 participants were included in the review. These studies indicated that an average of 41% of survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking had CPTSD. This was higher than the 14% diagnosed with PTSD. Post-trafficking stress, endured whilst living in refugee camps, was higher in individuals with CPTSD than in those living with PTSD. Healthcare was more difficult to access by populations with PTSD and CPTSD compared to those with no diagnosis.
   Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of CPTSD in modern slavery and trafficking survivors therefore a need for identification and specialised treatment. Consideration should be given to consequent biopsychosocial needs, particularly access to healthcare and minimisation of post-trafficking stress.

To systematically evaluate the evidence of dermatoglyphics, digit ratio and palmar crease hand biomarkers in relation to mental illness. Methods: Web of Science, Scopus and MEDLINE were searched for eligible studies, the review was performed according to PRISMA. Results: 29 papers comprising of 13,030 participants were selected. Palmar crease research presented the most consistent correlations. Dermatoglyphics presented significant findings, although there were specific biometric inconsistencies in some results. Digit ratio produced the least consistent results, with some non-significant and contrasting results. Conclusions: The evidence of this review suggests that all three fields, dermatoglyphics, palmar creases and digit ratio, can indicate mental disorders to varying degrees.

AB  - Sexual orientation is a key determinant of the identity of human beings. It has also been seen as a social determinant of health. People whose sexual orientation is non-heterosexual or sexual minorities or sexually diverse are included in the broad umbrella term LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) which is a commonly used acronym in activism, social policy, and subsequently cultural literature. For this reason, this Commission focuses primarily on sexual orientation i.e. lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) groups. We have used terms non-heterosexual, sexual minorities or sexual variation interchangeably. We have not considered asexual individuals as research in the field is too limited. We are cognisant of the fact that topics relating to mental health and sexual orientation discussed in this Commission will intersect with other issues of personal, cultural and social identity, and will thus be relevant to individuals including many transgender individuals. The inclusion of mental health issues relevant to gender-diverse individuals as well as gender identity is important and deserves its own separate detailed discussion. The exact number of sexually diverse individuals in a population is often difficult to estimate but is likely to be somewhere around 5% of the population. Rates of various psychiatry disorders and suicidal ideation and acts of suicide in LGB populations are higher than general population and these have been attributed to minority stress hypothesis. Elimination of inequality in law can lead to reduction in psychiatric morbidity in these groups. However, these are all diverse groups but even within each group there is diversity and each individual has a distinct and unique experiences, upbringing, responses to their own sexual orientation, and generating varying responses from families, peers and friends as well as communities (including healthcare professionals). The mental healthcare needs of sexual minority individuals vary and these variations must be taken into account in design, development and delivery of healthcare and policies. Improving access to services will help engagement and outcomes and also reduce stigma. The commission recommends that there is no role for so-called conversion therapies and other recommendations are made for clinicians, researchers and policymakers.

AB  - Network analyses have become increasingly common within the field of psychology, and temporal network analyses in particular are quickly gaining traction, with many of the initial articles earning substantial interest. However, substantial heterogeneity exists within the study designs and methodology, rendering it difficult to form a comprehensive view of its application in psychology research. Since the field is quickly growing and since there have been many study-to-study variations in terms of choices made by researchers when collecting, processing, and analyzing data, we saw the need to audit this field and formulate a comprehensive view of current temporal network analyses. To systematically chart researchers' practices when conducting temporal network analyses, we reviewed articles conducting temporal network analyses on psychological variables (published until March 2021) in the framework of a scoping review. We identified 43 articles and present the detailed results of how researchers are currently conducting temporal network analyses. A commonality across results concerns the wide variety of data collection and analytical practices, along with a lack of consistency between articles about what is reported. We use these results, along with relevant literature from the fields of ecological momentary assessment and network analysis, to formulate recommendations on what type of data is suited for temporal network analyses as well as optimal methods to preprocess and analyze data. As the field is new, we also discuss key future steps to help usher the field's progress forward and offer a reporting checklist to help researchers navigate conducting and reporting temporal network analyses.

AB  - The mechanism of action underlying ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects in patients with depression, both suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), including treatment resistant depression (TRD), remains unclear. Of the many speculated routes that ketamine may act through, restoring deficits in neuroplasticity may be the most parsimonious mechanism in both human patients and preclinical models of depression. Here, we conducted a literature search using PubMed for any reports of ketamine inducing neuroplasticity relevant to depression, to identify cellular and molecular events, relevant to neuroplasticity, immediately observed with rapid mood improvements in humans or antidepressant-like effects in animals. After screening reports using our inclusion/exclusion criteria, 139 publications with data from cell cultures, animal models, and patients with BD or MDD were included (registered on PROSPERO, ID: CRD42019123346). We found accumulating evidence to support that ketamine induces an increase in molecules involved in modulating neuroplasticity, and that these changes are paired with rapid antidepressant effects. Molecules or complexes of high interest include glutamate, AMPA receptors (AMPAR), mTOR, BDNF/TrkB, VGF, eEF2K, p70S6K, GSK-3, IGF2, Erk, and microRNAs. In summary, these studies suggest a robust relationship between improvements in mood, and ketamine-induced increases in molecular neuroplasticity, particularly regarding intracellular signaling molecules.

AB  - Objective People affected by chronic skin conditions suffer from elevated levels of psychological distress. There is a need for evidence-based treatments that integrate medical care. Mindfulness and Self-compassion programs (MCBPs) have proven effective in chronic diseases. This systematic review aims to narratively synthesize the literature on mindfulness and self-compassion as traits and interventions in chronic skin conditions. Design We searched four electronic databases for mindfulness and self-compassion trials and correlational studies in chronic skin conditions. We narratively synthetized results regarding the effects of mindfulness and self-compassion, both as traits and as interventions, on psychological and disease outcomes. Results Thirteen studies were included in our review. Evidence from cross-sectional studies suggest that mindfulness and self-compassion are linked to lower psychological distress and better adjustment to the disease. MCBPs appear feasible for this population and can lower psychological distress, reduce disease severity and improve quality of life. Methodological issues limit conclusions on MCBP efficacy. Based on our analysis, we propose possible mechanisms that future research could explore. Conclusions The integration of MCBPs in the care process of chronic skin conditions appears promising. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn due to a lack of strong evidence. Further studies with high methodological standards are needed.

AB  - Uric acid is commonly known for its bad reputation. However, it has been shown that uric acid may be actively involved in neurotoxicity and/or neuroprotection. These effects could be caused by oxidative stress or inflammatory processes localized in the central nervous system, but also by other somatic diseases or systemic conditions. Our interest was to summarize and link the current data on the possible role of uric acid in cognitive functioning. We also focused on the two putative molecular mechanisms related to the pathological effects of uric acid-oxidative stress and inflammatory processes. The hippocampus is a prominent anatomic localization included in expressing uric acid's potential impact on cognitive functioning. In neurodegenerative and mental disorders, uric acid could be involved in a variety of ways in etiopathogenesis and clinical presentation. Hyperuricemia is non-specifically observed more frequently in the general population and after various somatic illnesses. There is increasing evidence to support the hypothesis that hyperuricemia may be beneficial for cognitive functioning because of its antioxidant effects but may also be a potential risk factor for cognitive dysfunction, in part because of increased inflammatory activity. In this context, gender specificities must also be considered.

AB  - The use of cannabis is highly prevalent worldwide, with known short and long-term adverse effects. However, the relationship between cannabis use and suicidal behavior remains relatively unexplored and this paper aims to unify existing literature on the topic. A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and LILACS databases with a supplementary search to identify cohort articles published up to January 2020, with no age delimitation for the samples. This review aimed to address the relationship between cannabis use and sui-cidal behavior, defined as suicidal ideation, attempted suicide or completed suicide. Twenty-two articles were identified, with no clear consensus, irrespective of the outcome being investigated. This was the case even when taking into consideration only those studies with a sound methodology (according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale). Studies that identified an association explored the importance of the endocannabinoid system as well as the psychosocial context of the individual while developing suicidal behavior, with certain studies demon-strating that greater intensity or precocity of cannabis use increases the strength of this association. The rela-tionship between cannabis use and suicidal behavior is complex, with no consensus in the literature. Further studies with standardized definitions for cannabis use, including frequency of use, along with improved controls for confounding variables are needed.

AB  - There is emerging evidence that diet has a major modulatory influence on brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) interactions with important implications for brain health, and for several brain disorders. The BGM system is made up of neuroendocrine, neural, and immune communication channels which establish a network of bidirectional interactions between the brain, the gut and its microbiome. Diet not only plays a crucial role in shaping the gut microbiome, but it can modulate structure and function of the brain through these communication channels. In this review, we summarize the evidence available from preclinical and clinical studies on the influence of dietary habits and interventions on a selected group of psychiatric and neurologic disorders including depression, cognitive decline, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. We will particularly address the role of diet-induced microbiome changes which have been implicated in these effects, and some of which are shared between different brain disorders. While the majority of these findings have been demonstrated in preclinical and in cross-sectional, epidemiological studies, to date there is insufficient evidence from mechanistic human studies to make conclusions about causality between a specific diet and microbially mediated brain function. Many of the dietary benefits on microbiome and brain health have been attributed to anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the microbial metabolites of dietary fiber and polyphenols. The new attention given to dietary factors in brain disorders has the potential to improve treatment outcomes with currently available pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Depression has been associated with alterations in neurotransmitters, hormones, and inflammatory and neurodegenerative biomarkers, and biomarkers quantified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are more likely to reflect ongoing biochemical changes within the brain. However, a comprehensive overview of CSF biomarkers is lacking and could contribute to the pathophysiological understanding of depression.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate differences in quantified CSF biomarkers in patients with unipolar depression compared with healthy control individuals.
   DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for eligible trials from database inception to August 25, 2021.
   STUDY SELECTION All studies investigating CSF biomarkers in individuals 18 years and older with unipolar depression and healthy control individuals were included. One author screened titles and abstracts, and 2 independent reviewers examined full-text reports. Studies that did not include healthy control individuals or included control individuals with recent hospital contacts or admissions that might affect CSF biomarker concentrations were excluded.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by 2 reviewers following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses ( PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( MOOSE) reporting guidelines. Meta-analyses were performed using standardized mean differences (SMDs) calculated with random-effects models. A third investigator was consulted if the 2 reviewers reached different decisions or when in doubt.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Quantifiable CSF biomarkers.
   RESULTS A total of 167 studies met eligibility criteria, and 97 had available data and were included in the meta-analysis. These 97 studies comprised 165 biomarkers, 42 of which were quantified in 2 or more studies. CSF levels of interleukin 6 (7 studies; SMD, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.59; I-2 = 16%), total protein (5 studies; SMD, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.72; I-2 = 0%), and cortisol (2 studies; SMD, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.57; I-2 = 0%) were higher in patients with unipolar depression compared with healthy control individuals, whereas homovanillic acid (17 studies; SMD, -0.26; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.14; I-2 = 11%), gamma-aminobutyric acid (4 studies; SMD, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.92 to -0.08; I-2 = 55%), somatostatin (5 studies; SMD, -1.49; 95% CI, -2.53 to -0.45; I-2 = 91%), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (3 studies; SMD, -0.58; 95% CI, -0.97 to -0.19; I-2 = 0%), amyloid-beta 40 (3 studies; SMD, -0.80; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.46; I-2 = 0%), and transthyretin (2 studies; SMD, -0.82; 95% CI, -1.37 to -0.27; I-2 = 0%) were lower. The remaining 33 biomarkers had nonsignificant results.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis point toward a dysregulated dopaminergic system, a compromised inhibitory system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity, increased neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier permeability, and impaired neuroplasticity as important factors in depression pathophysiology.

AB  - Objectives Studies have suggested Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factors (BDNF) increase after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) although they were methodologically limited and enrolled small sample sizes. We aimed at updating a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore BDNF changes after ECT for the treatment of depression. Methods PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase and Global health were searched (March, 2021). Clinical trials that measured BDNF in the blood before and after ECT in adults (>= 18 years old) with depression (major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder) were eligible. Data were pooled through random-effects meta-analyses. Results Twenty-eight studies involving 778 participants were included. Meta-analysis showed a significant increase in BDNF levels after ECT (Hedges' g = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.46) while there was evidence of significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 67.64%) but not publication bias/small-study effect. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were underpowered to detect significant differences. Meta-analysis of depression severity scores demonstrated a considerable larger treatment effect in reducing depressive symptoms after ECT (Hedge's g = -3.72 95% CI: -4.23, -3.21). Conclusion This updated review showed that BDNF blood levels increased after ECT treatment. However, there was still evidence of substantial heterogeneity and there were limited sample sizes to investigate factors driving the variability of effects across studies. Importantly, the increase in BDNF levels was substantially smaller than the observed in depressive symptomatology, which could be indicative that the former was independent than the latter. Additional studies with larger sample sizes are currently required.

AB  - Background First responder populations, such as emergency services and the military, report elevated levels of mental health problems. Although post-deployment or post-incident psychosocial support interventions are widely implemented within these services, its effectiveness in preventing the development of mental disorders is unclear. Aims To systematically assess which, if any, post-deployment or post-incident psychosocial interventions are effective at preventing the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and common mental disorders (CMD) amongst military and emergency service worker (ESW) settings. Methods A systematic review was conducted by searching four databases for any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled trials of post-deployment or post-incident interventions. The primary outcomes assessed were differences in symptoms of PTSD and CMD. Study quality was examined using the Downs and Black checklist. Pooled effect sizes and 95% CI were calculated using random-effects modelling for main meta-analyses, planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Results From 317 articles, seven RCTs were included in the final meta-analysis. Interventions identified included psychological debriefing, screening, stress education, team-based skills training and a peer-delivered risk assessment. A very small but significant effect was found for team-based skills training in reducing CMD symptoms. Some evidence was also found for team cohesion training in reducing both PTSD and CMD. Conclusions Limited evidence was found for post-deployment or post-incident psychosocial interventions within military and ESW populations. More high-quality studies, particularly among ESW settings, are urgently needed to determine how to better prevent the development of trauma related disorders after exposure.

AB  - Evidence suggests that participation in plaza dancing may affect mental health. This study for the first time quantified the relationships between plaza dancing and psychological well-being and ill-being. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP to identify relevant studies published from the databases since their inception to July 25, 2021. The standardized mean differences (SMDs) of pre-to-post intervention data were calculated in the meta-analysis. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to test the potential moderating effects of age, outcome classification, measurement instruments, district, publication year, total sample size, and the duration, frequency, and length of the square dance intervention. A total of 25 original articles met all the eligibility criteria and were included in the review, and 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that plaza dancing improved psychological well-being (pooled SMD = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.95; I-2 = 86.9%) and reduced psychological ill-being (pooled SMD = -0.84; 95% CI: -1.00, -0.68; I-2 = 64.8%). The study participants' age and district did not seem to affect the effectiveness of the plaza dancing intervention. The duration and frequency of plaza dancing affected the association between square dance and psychological well-being (duration, beta = -0.044; 95% CI: -0.085, -0.004; frequency, beta = 0.122; 95% CI: 0.024, 0.221) and psychological ill-being (duration, beta = -0.029; 95% CI: -0.040, -0.018; frequency, beta = 0.154; 95% CI: 0.030, 0.278). Plaza dancing has a significant positive effect on psychological well-being and psychological ill-being, and the effects are moderated by intervention modality. Generalizing plaza dancing interventions to promote psychological well-being and prevent or treat psychological ill-being is needed.

AB  - BackgroundMany health research policies invoke the construct of Social Determinants of Health, and more recently the construct of Social Determinants of Mental Health. While frequently referred to in the literature, it is unclear how these constructs relate to each other. Some commentators conceptualise the Determinants of Mental Health as a subgroup of the Determinants of general Health and others describe the Determinants of Mental Health as an autonomous construct. The current review investigates the relationship between both constructs. MethodsComprehensive literature searches were conducted for both constructs separately within seven electronic databases. A template analysis was conducted to compare the conceptualisations of the Social Determinants of Health and the Social Determinants of Mental Health. ResultsOf 4250 search results, 50 papers (25 for each construct) fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were incorporated into a narrative synthesis. Discussions of the Social Determinants of both general and Mental Health listed the same determinants. Both constructs were conceptualised on multiple levels and factors. Stress and health behaviour were also described as mediators for both constructs. The constructs differed, however, with respect to two components of their aetiologies and epistemologies. First, the causal mechanisms invoked for the Determinants of general Health followed predominantly direct pathways, in contrast to indirect pathways for the Social Determinants of Mental Health. Second, the Social Determinants of Mental Health were reported to influence mental health mediated through individuals' perceptions and appraisal processes. Appraisal processes were considered of far less relevance in the construct of Social Determinants of Health. ConclusionThe constructs of Social Determinants of Health and Social Determinants of Mental Health align in many respects but differ on important aetiological and epistemological grounds. Similar social factors are considered important, but whereas physical health conditions are primarily conceptualised to be driven by objective realities, mental health is explained mainly in terms of perception of these realities. This differentiation between physical and mental health is in line with a modern understanding of mind-body-dualism, the naturalistic dualism after Chalmers. Differentiating the Social Determinants of Mental Health from the Social Determinants of Health might bear relevance for policy making and research.

AB  - Streambeds are an integral part of the river ecosystem. They provide habitat to a vast array of aquatic and benthic organisms as well as facilitate the bio-degradation and transformation of organic matter and vital nutrients. Increasing anthropogenic influence introduces multiple stressors to the stream networks resulting in pollution of streambeds, which in turn, have detrimental effects on the overall stream ecosystem health. There is a huge gap in the current understanding of streambed pollution and its impacts, and the widely practiced streambed pollution mitigation strategies lack a holistic approach. In this comprehensive review, we first synthesize the state-of-the-art knowledge of conventional and emerging forms of contaminants, their overall impacts on stream ecosystem functions, and present future directions to comprehend the problem of streambed pollution. We highlight that fine sediments and plastics (found especially in urban streambeds) are among the major physical pollutants causing streambed pollution and the chemical pollutants generally comprise hydrophobic compounds including various legacy contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a wide range of pesticides and a variety of heavy metals. Moreover, in recent years, highly polar and hydrophilic emerging contaminants such as micro-plastics, pharmaceutical waste and personal care products have been identified in riverbeds and streambeds across the world. We stress that the impacts of streambed pollution have been largely studied with discipline-driven perspectives amongst which the ecological impacts have received a lot of attention in the past. To present a comprehensive outlook, this review also synthesizes and discusses most of the understudied hydrological, geomorphological and biochemical impacts of different forms of streambed pollution. Subsequently, we also present a global inventory by compiling information from the published literature to highlight the status of streambed pollution around the globe. In the end,

TI  - Association Between Physical Activity and Risk of Depression A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
KW  - WORLD-HEALTH-ORGANIZATION
KW  - ADULTS
KW  - EXERCISE
KW  - COHORT
AB  - IMPORTANCE Depression is the leading cause of mental health-related disease burden and may be reduced by physical activity, but the dose-response relationship between activity and depression is uncertain.
   OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze the dose-response association between physical activity and incident depression from published prospective studies of adults.
   DATA SOURCES PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science. PsycINFO, and the reference lists of systematic reviews retrieved by a systematic search up to December 11, 2020, with no language limits. The date of the search was November 12, 2020.
   STUDY SELECTION We included prospective cohort studies reporting physical activity at 3 or more exposure levels and risk estimates for depression with 3000 or more adults and 3 years or longer of follow-up.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction was completed independently by 2 extractors and cross-checked for errors. A 2-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was used to synthesize data. Study-specific associations were estimated using generalized least-squares regression and the pooled association was estimated by combining the study-specific coefficients using restricted maximum likelihood.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcome of interest was depression, including (1) presence of major depressive disorder indicated by self-report of physician diagnosis, registry data, or diagnostic interviews and (2) elevated depressive symptoms established using validated cutoffs for a depressive screening instrument.
   RESULTS Fifteen studies comprising 191130 participants and 2110 588 person-years were included. An inverse curvilinear dose-response association between physical activity and depression was observed, with steeper association gradients at lower activity volumes; heterogeneity was large and significant (I-2 = 74%; P < .001). Relative to adults not reporting any activity, those accumulating half the recommended volume of physical activity (4.4 marginal metabolic equivalent task hours per week [mMET-h/wk]) had 18% (95% CI, 13%-23%) lower risk of depression. Adults accumulating the recommended volume of 8.8 mMET hours per week had 25% (95% CI, 18%-32%) lower risk with diminishing potential benefits and higher uncertainty observed beyond that exposure level. There were diminishing additional potential benefits and greater uncertainty at higher volumes of physical activity. Based on an estimate of exposure prevalences among included cohorts, if less active adults had achieved the current physical activity recommendations, 11.5% (95% CI. 7.7%45.4%) of depression cases could have been prevented.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This systematic review and meta-analysis of associations between physical activity and depression suggests significant mental health benefits from being physically active, even at levels below the public health recommendations. Health practitioners should therefore encourage any increase in physical activity to improve mental health.

AB  - Background: To contain the spread of COVID-19, governmental measures were implemented in many countries. Initial evidence suggests that women and men experience increased anger and aggression during COVID-19 lockdowns. Not surprisingly, media reports and initial empirical evidence highlight an increased risk for domestic violence (DV) during the pandemic. Nonetheless, a systematic review of studies utilizing participants' reports of potential changes in DV prevalence and severity during the pandemic as compared to pre-pandemic times is needed. Objective: To examine empirical, peer-reviewed studies, pertaining to the potential change in prevalence and severity of different types of DV during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported by study participants. Data Sources: Electronic EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL searches were conducted for the period between 2020 and January 5, 2022. References of eligible studies were integrated by using a snowballing technique. Study Selection: A total of 22 primary, empirical, peer-reviewed studies published in English or German were included. Results: Of the 22 studies, 19 were cross-sectional whereas 3 included both pre-pandemic and during pandemic assessments. Data synthesis indicates that severity of all types of DV as well as the prevalence of psychological/emotional and sexual DV increased for a significant number of victims in the general population during the pandemic. Evidence for changes in prevalence regarding economic/financial, physical, and overall DV remains inconclusive. There was considerable between-study variation in reported prevalence depending on region, sample size, assessment time, and measure. Conclusions: Data synthesis partly supports the previously documented increase in DV. Governmental measures should consider the availability of easily accessible, anonymous resources. Awareness and knowledge regarding DV need to be distributed to improve resources and clinical interventions.

AB  - Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common among children and adolescents who have experienced traumatic events. Exposure therapy (ET) has been shown to be effective in treating PTSD in adults. However, its efficacy remains uncertain in children and adolescents. Aims To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of ET in children and adolescents with PTSD. Method We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ProQuest, LILACS, and international trial registries for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed ET in children and adolescents (aged <= 18 years) with PTSD up to August 31, 2020. The primary outcomes were efficacy (the endpoint score from PTSD symptom severity rating scales) and acceptability (all-cause discontinuation), secondary outcomes included efficacy at follow-up (score from PTSD scales at the longest point of follow-up), depressive symptoms (end-point score on depressive symptom severity rating scales) and quality of life/social functioning (end-point score on quality of life/social functioning rating scales). This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020150859). Result A total of 6 RCTs (278 patients) were included. The results showed that ET was statistically more efficacious than control groups (standardized mean differences [SMD]: - 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: - 0.91 to - 0.03). In subgroup analysis, exposure therapy was more efficacious for patients with single type of trauma (SMD: - 1.04, 95%CI: - 1.43 to - 0.65). Patients with an average age of 14 years and older, ET was more effective than the control groups (SMD: - 1.04, 95%CI: - 1.43 to - 0.65), and the intervention using prolonged exposure therapy (PE) (SMD: - 1.04, 95%CI: - 1.43 to - 0.65) was superior than control groups. Results for secondary outcomes of efficacy at follow-up (SMD: - 0.64, 95%CI: - 1.17 to - 0.10) and depressive symptoms (SMD: - 0.58, 95%CI: - 0.93 to - 0.22) were similar to the previous findings for efficacy outcome. No statistically significant effects for acceptability and quality of life/social functioning were found. Conclusion ET showed superiority in efficacy at post-treatment/follow-up and depressive symptoms improvement in children and adolescents with PTSD. Patients with single type of trauma may benefit more from ET. And ET is more effective in patients 14 years or older. Moreover, PE could be a better choice.

AB  - Objective To systematically review published research studies and ongoing clinical trials investigating nitrous oxide (N2O) in psychiatric disorders, providing an up-to-date snapshot of the clinical research landscape. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted for studies published until June 2021 using the OVID databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo) and the clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP). Results In total, five relevant published articles were identified, among which four investigated N2O for depression. One single-dose randomized controlled trial (RCT) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), one triple crossover RCT comparing 50% vs. 25% N2O for TRD, and one repeated-dose RCT for major depressive disorder (MDD) suggest that N2O has preliminary feasibility with rapid-acting effects on symptoms of depression. From the public registries, 10 relevant ongoing clinical trials were identified. They aim to explore the use of N2O for MDD, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidal ideation. To date, the typical treatment protocol parameters were a single session of 50% N2O delivered for 60 min, although the concentration of 25% is also being explored. Projected enrolment numbers for ongoing trials (M = 55.0) were much higher than sample sizes for published studies (M = 13.0), suggesting that there potentially will be more large-scale RCTs published in the next few years. Conclusion Preliminary studies support the feasibility of administering N2O for depression; however, appropriate blinding is a critical challenge. Larger-scale RCTs with repeated doses of N2O and follow-up times beyond 1 month are needed to confirm the feasibility, therapeutic efficacy, and sustainability of response.

AB  - Light constitutes one of the most important environmental factors for plant growth and development. Besides its regulatory roles in plant growth and productivity, light also affects synthesis and emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). The influences of light dependence and combined factors (e.g., canopy and leaf development stages with light) on the emissions of biogenic isoprene (ISO) and monoterpenes (MTs) are reviewed, and their emission mechanisms with different light intensities and quality are summarized. The results show that in the range between zero to the saturation points of ISO and MTs, their emission rates increase with an increment of photosynthetically active radiation, and then remain unchanged or fluctuated. After the light-off action, the emission rates of ISO and MTs rapidly drop to near zero, and there is a low-intensity re-emission phenomenon with the peak appeared within 10-20 min. ISO concentration is the highest at the height of the strong ISO-emitting species inside the canopy. Changes of ISO concentration are consistent with its emission rate, peaking at 12:00-14:00. MTs are emitted and accumulated at night, leading to a lag in the canopy concentration. MTs peak concentrations mostly occur near the ground (0-2 m) in the morning of the next day. The ISO emission rates of mature leaves are 90-130% higher than those of young leaves and senescent leaves. MTs are mainly synthesized during the bud stage when the leaf age is 1-30 days. The highest and lowest emission rates of MTs are in the bud stage and mature leaves, respectively. This review provides references for reducing the uncertainty of BVOC emission factors and for optimizing regional BVOC emission models.

AB  - Not only did the ongoing CoronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic cause a massive number of casualties, but also there is growing concern that the burden of its psychological aftermaths will only show up years down the road. This systematic review summarises the existing literature reporting the impact of COVID-19 on personality disorders (PDs)-related violence. MEDLINE and APA PsycINFO were independently searched for relevant studies by two authors. Eligible studies had to be identifiable through database searching, published and fully accessible. This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. An initial pool of 241 studies were found, out of which 69 met the selection criteria and were, therefore, included. The majority reported a worse Mental Health Outcome (MHO) during the pandemic as related to dysfunctional personality and positive personality traits predicting a better outcome. Furthermore, increased levels of interpersonal violence (IV) and self-directed violence were reported. Further research should be conducted on the reciprocal interaction of PDs and IV during the time of pandemic. Nevertheless, the dramatic impact of restrictive measures on PDs has still to be appropriately addressed.

AB  - Background: The effects of psychological interventions on symptoms and psychology of functional dyspepsia (FD) remain unclear. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of psychological interventions on symptoms and psychology of FD.
   Methods: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the role of psychological interventions in FD patients published before July 2021. Standardized mean differences (SMDs), risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by a random effects model. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were also performed.
   Results: Fourteen RCTs with a total of 1,434 FD patients were included. Compared with the control group, psychological interventions were significantly more likely to symptom improvement [RR = 1.74, 95% CI (1.12, 2.72), p = 0.01], relieve gastrointestinal symptoms scores at follow up [SMD = -1.06, 95% CI (-1.55, -0.57), p < 0.0001], relieve gastrointestinal symptoms scores at end of treatment [SMD = -0.98, 95% CI (-1.29, -0.67), p < 0.001], decrease anxiety [SMD = -0.8, 95% CI (-1.38, -0.22), p = 0.006] and depression levels [SMD = -1.11, 95% CI (-1.62, -0.61), p < 0.001]. The results of the subgroup analysis showed that psychotherapy was more likely to symptom improvement, relieve gastrointestinal symptoms scores and decreased depression levels compared to the control.
   Conclusions: Psychological interventions may be effective in alleviating the symptoms and psychology of FD, but the effect appears to be limited to psychotherapy with fewer trials for other psychological interventions. More data from high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm their use in the treatment of FD.

AB  - Emotion dysregulation is a transdiagnostic factor in the development of various mental and behavioral disorders, thus requiring ample evidence for prevention and intervention approaches. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the association between parenting dimensions/styles and emotion dysregulation in childhood and adolescence. Following the PRISMA guidelines, the review was registered (PROSPERO CRD42021251672) and search terms were entered in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and PubMed in May 2021. Articles needed to report on empirical studies that examined the association between parenting dimensions/styles and emotion dysregulation in children/adolescents with primary data, and be published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. Additionally, articles were excluded based on certain designs and focus on special populations. The narrative synthesis includes 30 articles, and of which 27 are included in the meta-analysis. An NHLBI tool with 14 items (e.g., validity) was utilized for assessing the quality of the included studies. General trends indicate that positive parenting (e.g., warmth, supportiveness) is negatively associated with emotion dysregulation, whilst negative parenting (e.g., psychological control, authoritarian) is positively associated. The meta-analysis reveals an overall small yet significant effect, however, the heterogeneity of the studies is moderate to high. A funnel plot demonstrated no evidence of publication bias. Limitations include the varying conceptualizations of emotion dysregulation, as well as a lacking focus on specific types of emotion. Although more research is needed, addressing factors such as culture, gender, and age, the review provides first indications of the significance of parenting dimensions/styles for emotion dysregulation.

AB  - IntroductionCOVID-19 has been causing huge disruptions in mental healthcare services worldwide, including those related to ADHD. Some consequences of the pandemic, such as virtual schooling and remote work, as well as increased telemedicine, have posed new challenges for ADHD diagnosis and treatment. In this narrative review, we summarize existing COVID-19 and ADHD literature especially focusing on ADHD diagnostic during the pandemic and treatment adherence. MethodsThe databases searched were: PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Google Scholar and medRxiv. We included all English language articles and preprints that reported on medication/pharmacological treatment among the terms "ADHD" and "COVID-19" resulting in a total of 546 articles. The final search was done on Dec-23 2021. We selected fifteen articles focusing on the challenges of ADHD diagnostic during COVID-19 pandemic. ResultsOf the fifteen studies included, most were cross-sectional and perspective pieces. Most of them discussed that individuals with ADHD present risk factors that may make them more vulnerable to health negative consequences of the pandemic, which in turn may have an impact on treatment efficacy and adherence. Telemedicine is also addressed as a potential powerful instrument on monitoring ADHD treatment. ConclusionDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic on monitoring ADHD treatment, the available literature stressed that the current scenario also may offer new opportunities that could lead to the development of individualized treatment interventions, such as the remote monitoring of symptoms.

AB  - Purpose The stay-at-home orders were necessary to contain the spread of COVID-19 but have worsened social isolation and loneliness among older persons. Strategies to maintain social connections have been proposed. It is unclear if the reported experiences of social isolation and loneliness are comparable for older immigrants and if the proposed strategies are relevant to this vulnerable population. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach This scoping review addressed two questions: What evidence exists on the experience of social isolation and loneliness in older immigrants? What strategies can be beneficial to keep older immigrants socially connected during the COVID-19 pandemic? The search for relevant articles was done in several databases covering the scientific and gray literature, using keywords that reflect the diversity of terminology referring to the main concepts (isolation and loneliness) and target population (older immigrants). Discussion papers and research studies were reviewed, and the main points or findings were documented on data abstraction forms and summarized in a table. The information in the table was compared and contrasted to identify common themes. Findings Only six articles (four discussion papers and two studies) met the scoping review's eligibility criteria. Concerns about interruptions of older immigrants' social connection during the pandemic were partially corroborated with the studies' results. Most participants shifted the medium of their contacts from in-person to telephone or social media, and perceived no change in the experience of loneliness. Those with high levels of loneliness reported heightened anxiety and depression. The proposed strategies entailed the use of technology to connect with others and to deliver services, outdoor group activities within the constraints of containment measures and provision of culturally tailored social programs or services. Research limitations/implications The acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategies should be examined to determine the best practices aimed to promote social connection among older immigrants within and outside the context of the pandemic. Originality/value The scoping review identified strategies that can be used to address social isolation and loneliness among older immigrants during the pandemic.

AB  - Background: The experience sampling method (ESM) is an increasingly popular data collection method to assess interpersonal dynamics in everyday life and emotions contextualized in real-world settings. As primary advantages of ESM sampling strategies include minimization of memory biases, maximization of ecological validity, and hypothesis testing at the between- and within-person levels, ESM is suggested to be appropriate for studying the daily lives of educational actors. However, ESM appears to be underutilized in education research. We, thus, aimed to systematically evaluate the methodological characteristics and quality of published ESM studies of social interactions among children and adolescents in school settings, as well as to explore how much variance in social interaction variables could be attributed to the within-person level.Method: Using Academic Search Complete, APA PsycINFO, APA PsycArticles, ProQuest, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, and SAGE Journals, and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and pre-defined eligibility criteria, we conducted a systematic literature search of experience sampling studies up to November 2020. To assess methodological quality, we used a modified checklist for reporting of ESM studies.Results: Of the originally 2 413 identified studies, a final 52 experience sampling studies were included in the present review. Findings on sample and study design characteristics generally revealed wide variability. Even if high-quality studies were associated with higher scores on the training of participants in using the ESM procedure, and use of incentives, these design strategies did not reveal a statistically significant impact on compliance. The intraclass correlation coefficient was reported in nine studies and on average 58% of the variance in social interaction variables could be attributed to within-person fluctuation between timepoints.Conclusion: The current study is the first to systematically review ESM-based studies on social interactions among children and adolescents in the school context. These observations suggest that ESM is a potentially favorable technique for extracting complex social phenomena in real-world settings. We hope that this review will contribute to improving the quality assessment of ESM studies as well as to inform and guide future experience sampling studies, particularly regarding social phenomena with children and adolescents in educational settings.

AB  - Objective: For individuals with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best-evaluated treatment. This systematic review and meta-analyses identify clinical patient characteristics associated with the treatment outcome of CBT for MUS.
   Methods: A systematic literature search (PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science) resulted in 53 eligible studies; of these 32 studies could be included in meta-analyses. Pooled correlation coefficients between predictors and treatment outcome were calculated with a random-effects model. Moderator analyses were conducted to examine differences between subgroups of MUS and different levels of methodological study quality.
   Results: Meta-analyses demonstrated that individuals with higher symptom intensity (r = 0.38; p < 0.001), lower physical functioning (r = -0.29; p < 0.001), lower emotional and social functioning (r = -0.37; p < 0.001), more potential symptom-related incentives (r = -0.15; p = 0.001), or longer symptom duration (r = 0.10; p = 0.033) at the beginning of treatment reported less change of symptom severity until the end of therapy or higher end-of treatment symptom severity. The pooled effect sizes did not differ between certain subgroups of MUS or between different levels of methodological quality.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicated that clinical characteristics of MUS patients are associated with treatment outcome of CBT. We discuss how the results can be used to optimize and personalize future treatments for MUS.

AB  - Background: Though primarily a pulmonary disease, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus can generate devastating disease states that affect multiple organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS). The various neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 range in severity from mild symptoms such as headache, or myalgias to more severe symptoms such as stroke, psychosis, and anosmia. While some of the COVID-19 associated neurological complications are mild and reversible, a significant number of patients suffer from stroke. Studies have shown that COVID-19 infection triggers a wave of inflammatory cytokines that induce endothelial cell dysfunction and generate coagulopathy that increases the risk of stroke or thromboses. Inflammation of the endothelium following infection may also destabilize atherosclerotic plaque and induce thrombotic stroke. Although uncommon, there have also been reports of hemorrhagic stroke associated with COVID-19. The proposed mechanisms include a blood pressure increase caused by infection leading to a reduction in angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) levels that results in an imbalance of the renin-angiotensin system ultimately manifesting inflammation and vasoconstriction. Coagulopathy, as demonstrated by elevated prothrombin time (PT), has also been posited as a factor contributing to hemorrhagics stroke in patients with COVID-19. Other neurological conditions associated with COVID-19 include encephalopathy, anosmia, encephalitis, psychosis, brain fog, headache, depression, and anxiety. Though there are several hypotheses reported in the literature, a unifying pathophysiological mechanism of many of these disorders remains unclear. Pulmonary dysfunction leading to poor oxygenation of the brain may explain encephalopathy and other disorders in COVID-19 patients. Alternatively, a direct invasion of the CNS by the virus or breach of the blood-brain barrier by the systemic cytokines released during infection may be responsible for these conditions. Notwithstanding, the relationship between the inflammatory cytokine levels and conditions such as depression and anxiety is contradictory and perhaps the social isolation during the pandemic may in part be a contributing factor to some of the reported CNS disorders. Objective: In this article, we review the current literature pertaining to some of the most significant and common neurological disorders such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, encephalopathy, encephalitis, brain fog, Long COVID, headache, Guillain-Barre syndrome, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders in the setting of COVID-19. We summarize some of the most relevant literature to provide a better understanding of the mechanistic details regarding these disorders in order to help physicians monitor and treat patients for significant COVID-19 associated neurologic impairments. Methods: A literature review was carried out by the authors using PubMed with the search terms "COVID-19" and "Neurology", "Neurological Manifestations", "Neuropsychiatric Manifestations", "Stroke", "Encephalopathy", "Headache", "Guillain-Barre syndrome", "Depression", "Anxiety", "Encephalitis", "Seizure", "Spasm", and "ICUAW". Another search was carried out for "Long-COVID" and "Post-Acute COVID-19" and "Neurological Manifestations" or "Neuropsychiatric Manifestations". Articles such as case reports, case series, and cohort studies were included as references. No language restrictions were enforced.
   In the case of anxiety and depression, attempts were made to focus mainly on articles describing these conditions in infected patients. Results: A total of 112 articles were reviewed. The incidence, clinical outcomes, and pathophysiology of selected neurological disorders are discussed below. Given the recent advent of this disease, the incidence of certain neurologic sequelae was not always available. Putative mechanisms for each condition in the setting of COVID-19 are outlined.

AB  - Background: In today's performance-oriented society, burnout symptoms, defined as consequences of chronic work stress, are an increasing problem. To counteract this development, the important aims are (1) to find protective and modifiable factors that reduce the risk of developing and harboring burnout symptoms and (2) to understand the underlying mechanisms. A phenomenon potentially furthering both aims is flow experience. Based on the earlier literature, we developed a psycho-physiological "Flow-Burnout-Model", which postulates positive or negative associations between flow and burnout symptoms, depending on the prevailing situational and personal conditions. Methods: To test our Flow-Burnout-Model, we conducted a systematic literature search encompassing flow and burnout symptoms. Eighteen empirical studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Results: The findings of the systematic review as a whole suggest a negative association between flow and burnout symptoms, both cross-sectional and longitudinal. According to the findings from longitudinal studies, flow can be interpreted as a protective factor against burnout symptoms, and burnout symptoms can be interpreted as a factor inhibiting flow. In our conclusion, we maintain the assumption of a bidirectional association between flow and burnout symptoms in the Flow-Burnout-Model but modify the initially suggested positive and negative associations between flow and burnout symptoms towards a predominantly negative relationship. Discussion: Mindful of the heterogeneous findings of earlier studies, the resulting comprehensive Flow-Burnout-Model will lay the foundations for future hypothesis-based research. This includes physiological mechanisms explaining the relationship between flow and burnout symptoms, and likewise, the conditions of their longitudinal association.

AB  - Introduction: To continue to inform sleep health guidelines and the development of evidence-based healthy sleep interventions for children and adolescents, it is important to better understand the associations between sleep timing (bedtime, wake-up time, midpoint of sleep) and various health indicators. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the associations between sleep timing and 9 health indicators in apparently healthy children and adolescents 5 to 18 years old.
   Methods: Studies published in the 10 years preceding January 2021 were identified from searches in four electronic databases. This systematic review followed the guidelines prescribed in PRISMA 2020, the methodological quality and risk of bias were scored, and the summary of results used a best-evidence approach for accurate and reliable reporting.
   Results: Forty-six observational studies from 21 countries with 208 992 unique participants were included. Sleep timing was assessed objectively using actigraphy in 24 studies and subjectively in 22 studies. The lack of studies in some of the health outcomes and heterogeneity in others necessitated using a narrative synthesis rather than a meta-analysis. Findings suggest that later sleep timing is associated with poorer emotional regulation, lower cognitive function/academic achievement, shorter sleep duration/poorer sleep quality, poorer eating behaviours, lower physical activity levels and more sedentary behaviours, but few studies demonstrated associations between sleep timing and adiposity, quality of life/well-being, accidents/injuries, and biomarkers of cardio-metabolic risk. The quality of evidence was rated as "very low" across health outcomes using GRADE.
   Conclusion: The available evidence, which relies on cross-sectional findings, suggests that earlier sleep timing is beneficial for the health of school-aged children and adolescents. Longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to better advance this field of research.

AB  - (1) Background: The motivational determinants of health professionals to choose and remain in the public sector have been increasingly addressed, including the customized approach of Public Service Motivation (PSM). However, to date, no systematic research overview has been performed in this domain, leaving the body of literature unstructured. This article fills this gap by assessing the motivational factors of choice for the public sector in the health field, and the conceptual and methodological trends of this research stream. (2) Methods: This study follows the PRISMA protocol to ascertain patterns in past research and inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Eighty-nine documents published between 1998 and 2021 were retained after selecting them according to their theme and outlined goals. (3) Results: Common motivational determinants are remuneration, available resources, work conditions, and frequency of contact and interaction with patients. The PSM construct and scale are often employed as main frameworks, but there is also a concern in assessing motivation drawing on psychological constructs that reflect the challenging line of work and environment that is health care, such as presenteeism, stress, and perception of hindrances. (4) Conclusions: By focusing on health professionals' motivation, this study contributes to a timely systematization in challenging times for health institutions and their human resources.

AB  - The study of the origin and implications of fatigue in exercise has been widely investigated, but not completely understood given the complex multifactorial mechanisms involved. Then, it is essential to understand the fatigue mechanism to help trainers and physicians to prescribe an adequate training load. The present narrative review aims to analyze the multifactorial factors of fatigue in physical exercise. To reach this aim, a consensus and critical review were performed using both primary sources, such as scientific articles, and secondary ones, such as bibliographic indexes, web pages, and databases. The main search engines were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. Central and peripheral fatigue are two unison constructs part of the Integrative Governor theory, in which both psychological and physiological drives and requirements are underpinned by homeostatic principles. The relative activity of each one is regulated by dynamic negative feedback activity, as the fundamental general operational controller. Fatigue is conditioned by factors such as gender, affecting men and women differently. Sleep deprivation or psychological disturbances caused, for example, by stress, can affect neural activation patterns, realigning them and slowing down simple mental operations in the context of fatigue. Then, fatigue can have different origins not only related with physiological factors. Therefore, all these prisms must be considered for future approaches from sport and clinical perspectives.

AB  - Dementia-related suicide is not well known. This study aimed to understand the characteristics of suicide risk among people with dementia and dementia family caregivers in South Korea. According to a systematic review of PRISMA guidelines, six electronic databases were searched for research published from 2010 to 2021. Ten studies were included. Among the included studies on people with dementia, one study (25%) showed no increase in the death risk of suicide, while three studies (75%) revealed suicide risk. Furthermore, in the dementia family caregivers, one study (17%) reported suicides and five studies (83%) reported suicide ideation (SI). Early dementia and independence or partial dependence in activities of daily living and home-based care are related to suicide risk in people with dementia. Meanwhile, suicide risk in dementia family caregivers is related to care burden, dementia severity, and poor approaches to coping with the family member's dementia. The studies reviewed, which demonstrate heterogenous methodologies, suggest that both people with dementia and dementia family caregivers face suicide risk. The results of the current study offer insights useful for the prevention and treatment of mental health issues in both groups.

AB  - (1) Background: Tinnitus is the awareness of a sound in the absence of an external source. It affects around 10-15% of people, a significant proportion of whom also experience symptoms such as depression or anxiety that negatively affect their quality of life. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique involving constant low-intensity direct current delivered via scalp electrodes. It is a potential treatment option for tinnitus, as well as tinnitus-related conditions such as depression and anxiety. This systematic review estimates the effects of tDCS on outcomes relevant to tinnitus. In addition, it sheds light on the relationship between stimulation parameters and the effect of tDCS on these outcomes; (2) Methods: Exhaustive searches of electronic databases were conducted. Randomised controlled trials were included if they reported at least one of the following outcomes: tinnitus symptom severity, anxiety, or depression. Where available, data on quality of life, adverse effects, and neurophysiological changes were also reviewed. GRADE was used to assess the certainty in the estimate; (3) Results: Meta-analyses revealed a statistically significant reduction in tinnitus (moderate certainty) and depression (low certainty)-but not anxiety-following active tDCS compared to sham control. Network meta-analyses revealed potential optimal stimulation parameters; (4) Conclusions: The evidence synthesised in this review suggests tDCS has the potential to reduce symptom severity in tinnitus and depression. It further narrows down the number of potentially optimal stimulation parameters.

AB  - Background: Men who have sex with men experience disproportionately high levels of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), sexual risk behavior, substance use, and mental ill-health. These experiences are interrelated, and these interrelations are potentiated by structural conditions of discrimination, stigma, and unequal access to appropriate health services, and they magnify each other and have intersecting causal pathways, worsening both risk for each condition and risk for the negative sequelae of each condition. eHealth interventions could address these issues simultaneously and thus have wide-ranging and greater effects than would be for any 1 outcome alone.
   Objective: We systematically reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in addressing these outcomes separately or together.
   Methods: We searched 19 databases for randomized trials of interactive or noninteractive eHealth interventions delivered via mobile phone apps, internet, or other electronic media to populations consisting entirely or principally of men who have sex with men to prevent HIV, STIs, sexual risk behavior, alcohol and drug use, or common mental illnesses. We extracted data and appraised each study, estimated meta-analyses where possible by using random effects and robust variance estimation, and assessed the certainty of our findings (closeness of the estimated effect to the true effect) by using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations).
   Results: We included 14 trials, of which 13 included active versus control comparisons; none reported mental health outcomes, and all drew from 12 months or less of follow-up postintervention. Findings for STIs drew on low numbers of studies and did not suggest consistent short-term (<3 months postintervention; d=0.17, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.52; I-2=0%; 2 studies) or midterm (3-12 months postintervention, no meta-analysis, 1 study) evidence of effectiveness. Eight studies considering sexual risk behavior outcomes suggested a short-term, nonsignificant reduction (d=-0.14, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.03) with very low certainty, but 6 studies reporting midterm follow-ups suggested a significant impact on reducing sexual risk behavior (d=-0.12, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.05) with low certainty. Meta-analyses could not be undertaken for alcohol and drug use (2 heterogeneous studies) or for HIV infections (1 study for each of short-term or midterm follow-up), and alcohol outcomes alone were not captured in the included studies. Certainty was graded as low to very low for most outcomes, including all meta-analyses.
   Conclusions: To create a comprehensive eHealth intervention that targets multiple outcomes, intervention evaluations should seek to generalize both mechanisms and components that are successfully used to achieve change in 1 outcome over multiple outcomes. However, additional evaluations of interventions seeking to address outcomes other than sexual risk behavior are needed before development and evaluation of a joined-up intervention.

AB  - Nostalgia, a sentimental longing for one's past, has been garnering keen empirical attention in the psychological literature over the last two decades. After providing a historical overview, we place the emotion in cross-cultural context. Laypeople in many cultures conceptualize nostalgia similarly: as a past-oriented, social, self-relevant, and bittersweet emotion, but more sweet (positively toned) than bitter (negatively toned). That is, the nostalgizer reflects on a fond and personally important event-often their childhood or valued relationships-relives the event through rose-colored glasses, yearns for that time or relationship, and may even wish to return briefly to the past. Also, triggers of nostalgia (e.g., adverts, food, cold temperatures, loneliness) are similar across cultures. Moreover, across cultures nostalgia serves three key functions: it elevates social connectedness (a sense of belongingness or acceptance), meaning in life (a sense that one's life is significant, purposeful, and coherent), and self-continuity (a sense of connection between one's past and present self). Further, nostalgia acts as a buffer against discomforting psychological states (e.g., loneliness) similarly in varied cultural contexts. For example, (1) loneliness is positively related to, or intensifies, nostalgia; (2) loneliness is related to, or intensifies, adverse outcomes such as unhappiness or perceived lack of social support; and (3) nostalgia suppresses the relation between loneliness and adverse outcomes. Additionally, nostalgia facilitates one's acculturation to a host culture. Specifically, (1) nostalgia (vs. control) elicits a positive acculturation orientation toward a host culture; (2) nostalgia (vs. control) amplifies bicultural identity integration; and (3) positive acculturation orientation mediates the effect of host-culture nostalgia on bicultural identity integration. We conclude by identifying lacunae in the literature and calling for follow-up research.

AB  - Apart from the severe impact on public health and well-being, the chain effect resulting from the COVID-19 health crisis is a profound disruption for various other sectors, notably in education. COVID-19 has driven massive transformation in many aspects of the educational landscape, particularly as teaching and learning shifted online due to school closure. Despite the many impacts of the health crises on school populations, a systematic review regarding this particular issue has yet to be conducted. This study, therefore, attempts to comprehensively review the impact of health crises on school populations (student, teacher, parent, and school administration). An extensive literature search guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting checklist was performed in two selected databases, namely Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus to identify how this particular topic was previously studied. Exclusion and inclusion criteria were set to ensure that only research papers written in English from the year 2000 to the present (April 2021) were included. From a total of 457 studies screened, only 41 of them were deemed eligible to be included for qualitative synthesis. The findings revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic was the only health crisis discussed when it comes to investigating the impact of health crises on school populations. This study found four notable consequences of health crises on school populations, which are impacts on mental health, teaching and learning, quality of life, and physical health. Among factors associated with the impact of the health crises are; demographic factors, concerns about the pandemic, education-related factors, health-related factors, geographic factors, economic concerns, teaching challenges, and parenting in the pandemic. This study is expected to be a reference for future works in formulating crises mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of health crises on schools by exploring the contexts of the crises.

AB  - Visual snow syndrome (VSS) is an emerging clinical entity, mainly characterized by persistent, bilateral, whole-visual field, disturbing, small flickering dots or pixelation, floaters, palinopsia, nyctalopia, photopsia, and photophobia. Patients with VSS also describe associated symptoms such as tinnitus, concentration difficulty, lethargy, depression, anxiety, and irritability, all of which affect the patients' quality of life. The consistency of these visual and nonvisual symptoms has recently led to proposed criteria for VSS. The diagnosis relies on the exclusion of other ophthalmic or neuropsychiatric disorders. Interestingly, many patients may have a comorbid migraine, and the symptoms were previously attributed as a persistent visual phenomenon in migraine. VSS is listed in the International Classification of Headache Disorders-Third Edition Appendix as a complication of migraine; however, VSS is a new disease entity distinct from persistent migraine aura. Some patients with VSS recall exposure to illicit hallucinogenic drugs, amphetamines, cannabis, or Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The stereotypic clinical characteristics of VSS are currently well defined, and the pathophysiology is under investigation. Due to the subjective perceptual descriptions of patients with VSS, objective electrophysiologic parameters and functional brain imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography are warranted for defining the quantifiable and reliable outcome measures. Patients with migraine, idiopathic occipital epilepsies, patients with Alice in Wonderland syndrome, patients with Charles Bonnet syndrome, visual hallucinations in recovery from cortical blindness, and recreational 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine/ecstasy users have been suggested to have occipital cortex hyperexcitability. VSS is attributed to involving a dysfunctional magnocellular pathway, thalamocortical dysrhythmia, dysfunctional central visual processing, and occipital cortex hyperexcitability as possible underlying mechanisms. This review will focus on the role of occipital cortex hyperexcitability in VSS and hopefully provide insight into its pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological treatments and identify required adaptations to increase acceptability and improve outcomes for people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment who experience psychological distress. Design/methodology/approach The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register and other databases were searched for eligible studies. Inclusion criteria identified nine randomised controlled trials comparing a psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation training therapies, multimodal therapies, psychodynamic therapy, counselling and cognitive rehabilitation) with usual care, with measures of depression and/or anxiety as an outcome. The appraisal of papers was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data was analysed using meta-analysis. Findings A small, significant effect size before to after intervention was revealed, suggesting that psychological treatments may be effective in reducing psychological distress in people with dementia, with several therapy adaptations identified. Research limitations/implications Because of methodological limitations and a small number of studies evaluated, the quality of evidence was low for outcomes for depression, and there were no significant outcomes in anxiety. Originality/value The current review offers a unique contribution in identifying specific adaptations deemed helpful in improving the accessibility and acceptability of therapy for people with dementia, suggesting therapy can be adjusted enough to support this client-group. Future studies should use high-quality trials using standardised psychological interventions, of sufficient length, with long-term follow-up and offer of specific adaptations to increase accessibility and outcomes.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical developmental period characterized by enhanced social interactions, ongoing development of the frontal cortex and maturation of synaptic connections throughout the brain. Adolescents spend more time interacting with peers than any other age group and display heightened reward sensitivity, impulsivity and diminished inhibitory self-control, which contribute to increased risky behaviors, including the initiation and progression of alcohol use. Compared to adults, adolescents are less susceptible to the negative effects of ethanol, but are more susceptible to the negative effects of stress, particularly social stress. Juvenile exposure to social isolation or binge ethanol disrupts synaptic connections, dendritic spine morphology, and myelin remodeling in the frontal cortex. These structural effects may underlie the behavioral and cognitive deficits seen later in life, including social and memory deficits, increased anxiety-like behavior and risk for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Although the alcohol and social stress fields are actively investigating the mechanisms through which these effects occur, significant gaps in our understanding exist, particularly in the intersection of the two fields. This review will highlight the areas of convergence and divergence in the fields of adolescent social stress and ethanol exposure. We will focus on how ethanol exposure or social isolation stress can impact the development of the frontal cortex and lead to lasting behavioral changes in adulthood. We call attention to the need for more mechanistic studies and the inclusion of the evaluation of sex differences in these molecular, structural, and behavioral responses.

It remains unclear whether more complex CBT contributes to greater depression reduction. Aims To (a) compare the effectiveness of core, complex and ultra-complex CBT against other psychological intervention, medication, treatment-as-usual and no treatment in reducing depression at post-treatment and in the long term and (b) explore important factors that could moderate the effectiveness of these interventions. Method MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched to November 2021. Only randomised controlled trials were eligible for the subsequent network meta-analysis. Results We included 107 studies based on 15 248 participants. Core (s.m.d. = -1.14, 95% credible interval (CrI) -1.72 to -0.55 [m.d. = -8.44]), complex (s.m.d. = -1.24, 95% CrI -1.85 to -0.64 [m.d. = -9.18]) and ultra-complex CBT (s.m.d. = -1.45, 95% CrI -1.88 to -1.02 [m.d. = -10.73]) were all significant in reducing depression up to 6 months from treatment onset. The significant benefits of the ultra-complex (s.m.d. = -1.09, 95% CrI -1.61 to -0.56 [m.d. = -8.07]) and complex CBT (s.m.d. = -0.73, 95% CrI -1.36 to -0.11 [m.d. = -5.40]) extended beyond 6 months. Ultra-complex CBT was most effective in individuals presenting comorbid mental health problems and when delivered by non-mental health specialists. Ultra-complex and complex CBT were more effective for people younger than 59 years. Conclusions For people without comorbid conditions healthcare and policy organisations should invest in core CBT. For people <59 years of age with comorbid conditions investments should focus on ultra-complex and complex CBT delivered without the help of mental health professionals.

AB  - Vocalisations play a central role in rodent communication, especially in reproduction related behaviours. In adult mice (Mus musculus) the emission of ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) has been observed in courtship and mating behaviour, especially by males. These have been found to have distinctive individual signatures that influence female choice of mating partner. The most recent findings show that vocal communication also has a role in parental cooperation, in that female mice communicate with male partners in ultrasonic frequencies to induce paternal behaviour. Infant vocalisations form the other important part of reproductive vocal communication. Although born deaf, neonatal mice are capable of producing vocalisations since birth. As an altricial species, successful mother-infant communication is essential for survival, and these vocalisations are important modulators of maternal behaviour. Three main types of infant vocalisations have been identified and characterised. Most research has addressed pure USVs, related to stressful situations (e.g., cold, isolation, handling, presence of unfamiliar males or predators), which usually elicit maternal search and retrieval. In addition, broad-band spectrum signals, emitted post-partum during cleaning of foetal membranes, inhibit biting and injury by adults and "wriggling calls," emitted during suckling, release maternal behaviour (such as licking). Several variables have been identified to modulate vocalisations in mice, including individual characteristics such as strain/genotype, age, sex, and experimental factors such as pharmacological compounds and social context. In recent years, there has been a big increase in the knowledge about the characteristics of vocal communication in rodents due to recent technological advances as well as a growing interest from the neuroscience community. Vocalisation analysis has become an essential tool for phenotyping and evaluating emotional states. In this review, we will (i) provide a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge on mouse reproductive vocal communication and (ii) discuss the most recent findings in order to provide a broad overview on this topic.

AB  - Obesity is a complex disease with many co-morbidities, including impaired cognitive functions. Obese individuals often contain an aberrant microbiota. Via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the altered microbiota composition can affect cognition or induce anxiety- or depressive-like behavior. Probiotics have been shown to alleviate both obesity- and neurobehavioral disorder-related symptoms. Here, we evaluated previously published results on the effectiveness of probiotic intervention in alleviating obesity- or high-fat diet (HFD)-related cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar until June 2021 to identify relevant articles. Seventeen studies were included: one human and sixteen animal studies. Overall, the findings support the beneficial health effect of probiotics on HFD-induced cognitive impairment and anxiety. However, the results suggest that multi-strain probiotic treatments should be used with caution, especially in the absence of HFD-induced impairment. Future studies should overcome the large variation in study design and high risk of bias found in the current evidence. Nevertheless, probiotic treatment, in particular using the Lactobacillus genus, seems promising.

AB  - As emerging pollutants, direct and indirect adverse impacts of micro(nano)plastics (MPs/NPs) are raising an increasing environmental concern in recent years due to their poor biodegradability and difficulty in recycling. MPs/NPs can act as carriers of bacteria, viruses, or pollutants (such as heavy metals and toxic organic compounds), and may potentially change the toxicity and bioavailability of pollutants. Ingested or attached MPs/NPs can also be transferred from low-trophic level organisms to high-nutrient organisms or even the human body through the food chain transfer process. This article reviews the emerging field of micro- and nanoplastics on organisms, including the separate toxicity and toxicity of compound after the adsorption of organic pollutants or heavy metals, as well as possible mechanism of toxicological effects and evaluate the nano- and microplastics potential adverse effects on human health. The inherent toxic effects MPs/NPs mainly include the following: physical injury, growth performance decrease and behavioral alteration, lipid metabolic disorder, induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and disruption of the gut's epithelial permeability, neurotoxicity, damage of reproductive system and offspring, oxidative stress, immunotoxicity, etc. Additionally, MPs/NPs may release harmful plastic additives and toxic monomers such as bisphenol A, phthalates, and toluene diisocyanate. The vectors' effect also points out the potential interaction of MPs/NPs with pollutants such as heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluorinated compounds, pharmaceuticals, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Nevertheless, these potential consequences of MPs/NPs being vectors for contaminants are controversial.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions may contribute to a deterioration in mental health; individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be particularly affected. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of the current pandemic on people diagnosed with OCD, and whether pandemics may affect the development of OCD symptoms. Methods: We conducted a systematic search using NCBI PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar on February 9, 2021. Research articles related to OCD and COVID-19 or other pandemics were attempted to be identified using pre-defined search terms. Case reports, clinical guidelines, letters, and clinical research articles including >= 100 participants were included; reviews were excluded. The systematic review adheres to PRISMA guidelines and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the included clinical research articles. Results: A total of 79 articles were included in the full-text assessment. Of these, 59 were clinical research articles, two were clinical guidelines, six were case reports, and 12 were letters. The research articles examined OCD symptoms in adult patients with diagnosed OCD, the general population, pregnant women, healthcare workers, students, and young adults, children, and adolescents. Only one study on OCD in previous pandemics was identified. Conclusion: This systematic review found that people both with and without diagnosed OCD prior to the pandemic generally experienced a worsened landscape of symptoms of OCD during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the responses are heterogeneous and many factors other than the pandemic seemed to affect the development of OCD symptoms. To prevent the impairment of symptoms and the development of new cases, close monitoring of patients with OCD and education of the general public is essential. Literature is still limited; thus, multinational and cross-cultural, longitudinal studies are warranted to gain further insights on this topic.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Task sharing, the training of nonspecialist workers with no formal experience in counseling, is a promising strategy for addressing the large gap in treatment for depression in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   OBJECTIVE To examine the outcomes and moderators of task-shared psychological interventions associated with depression severity, response, and remission. DATA SOURCES Systematic literature searches in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library up to January 1, 2021.
   STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of task-shared psychological interventions compared with control conditions for adults with depressive symptoms in LMICs were included.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two researchers independently reviewed the titles, abstracts, and full text of articles from an existing generic meta-analytic database that includes all RCTs on psychotherapy for depression. A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was used to estimate the outcomes of task-shared psychological interventions across patient characteristics using mixed-effects models. Procedures for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomewas reduction in depression symptom severity measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Response and remission rates were also estimated.
   RESULTS Of 13 eligible trials, 11 (4145 participants) contributed IPD. Task-shared psychological interventions were associated with a greater decrease in depressive symptom severity than control conditions (Hedges g, 0.32; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.38). Participants in the intervention groups had a higher chance of responding (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.60 to 2.80) and remitting (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.99). The presence of psychomotor symptoms was significantly associated with the outcomes of task-shared psychological interventions (ss [SE], -1.21 [0.39]; P =.002). No other significant associations were identified. Heterogeneity among the trials with IPD was 74%(95% CI, 53%-86%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis of IPD, task-shared psychological interventions were associated with a larger reduction in depressive symptom severity and a greater chance of response and remission than control conditions. These findings show potential for the use of task-sharing of psychological interventions across different groups of patients with depression. Further research would help identify which people are most likely to benefit and strengthen larger-scale implementation of this strategy to address the burden of depression in LMICs.

AB  - Objective: In psychiatric literature, few original studies exist on the topic of demoralization in suicide. In this review, we aim to identify original studies on suicidal ideation (SI)/suicidal behavior (SB) and demoralization in populations of community-dwellers and patients with somatic or psychiatric disorders. Methods: We employed a systematic approach that followed PRISMA guidelines, searching through four major electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Science Direct, and PsychINFO) for relevant titles/abstracts published from January 1980-June 2021. We included original studies that explicitly mentioned the investigation of a potential association between SI/SB and demoralization. Results: A total of 18 studies met our inclusion criteria. Their synthesis revealed that demoralization can be associated with SI/SB in a wide range of populations (community dwellers, patients with somatic or psychiatric disorders) and lead to significantly higher suicide risk (odds ratios of > 6 were encountered in community dwellers experiencing financial hardship or isolation). Moreover, demoralization alone (about half the patients who were demoralized did not meet the criteria for an affective disorder nor were they clinically depressed) or together with depression has been identified as a major risk factor for SI/SB. Regarding the crucial issue of progression from SI to SA, in the context of the "ideation-to-action " frame, some authors found that the interaction of demoralization and over-arousal could be a useful predictor for this progression, while others found that depression alone was sufficient to differentiate attempters from non-attempters or the interaction with shutdown (helplessness and low positive emotions). Conclusion: These results emphasize the possibility to identify demoralization as an independent risk factor for suicide. In patients with psychiatric disorders, the association between demoralization and SI/SB may be transnosographic. Overall, from the clinical implications perspective, our findings highlight that: i. Assessment of demoralization may contribute to a more comprehensive suicide risk detection. This appears particularly relevant in Emergency Departments (EDs) where heterogeneous population typologies are usually admitted and a clinical diagnosis of depression is often difficult to be defined. ii. Additionally, since meaninglessness is considered one of the demoralization subcomponents, meaning-centered psychotherapeutic approaches prove to be indicated and they can be initiated already at the EDs upon first contact with the patient. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

AB  - The 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is an auxinic herbicide widely used in agriculture that is effective in controlling weeds. It is directly applied to the soil, to ponds or sprayed onto crops; thus, it can progressively accumulate in environmental compartments and affect non-target organisms. The aim of the present meta-analytic review is to investigate the toxic effects of 2,4-D, based on a compilation of results from different studies, which were synthesized to form a statistically reliable conclusion about the lethal effect of potentially ecological concentrations of 2,4-D in several animal species. The search was carried out in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. After the selection process was over, 87 datasets were generated and analyzed. The overall effect has indicated significant increase in the mortality rate recorded for animals exposed to environmental concentrations of 2,4-D compared to the control in the experiment (unexposed animals). The segregation of animals into taxonomic categories has shown that fish and birds presented higher mortality rates after exposure to the investigated substance. The present meta-analysis indicated larval and adult animals were susceptible among the ontogenetic development stages. Juvenile individuals exposed to different 2,4-D concentrations did not show significant difference in comparison to the control. Organisms exposed to 2,4-D immersion were the most impacted compared to those exposed by oral, spray and contact. Animals subjected to commercial formulation presented higher mortality rate than the analytical standard. Thus, 2,4-D can, in fact, increase mortality rate in animals, but it depends on species sensitivity, life stage and exposure route. This is the first meta-analytical study evaluating the mortality rate after 2,4-D exposure in several animal species.

   Procedure: Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, Informit A+ Education, PubMed, Web of Science and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global) were searched to find English language, grey literature and peer-reviewed articles up to November 2020.
   Results: A narrative synthesis of 23 articles indicated that therapy dogs may enhance students' mood and positive emotionality, social and communication skills, confidence and their relationship with teachers. Inconsistently, other studies reported that therapy dogs may not enhance the social and emotional wellbeing of students.
   Conclusion: The current research is characterised by methodological limitations and an overreliance on the perceptions of students and teachers. To enhance the quality and reliability of the evidence, future researchers are encouraged to adopt more rigorous methodologies with larger sample sizes and control procedures. It is also recommended that the perceptions of school leaders, other educational personnel and interdisciplinary health professionals are incorporated into future studies. This may contribute to a greater level of consensus in the educational sector about the impacts of therapy dogs on the social and emotional wellbeing of K-12 students.

During the pandemic, the nurses were affected physically and mentally when in contact with and caring for patients infected with COVID-19, especially those in intensive care units (ICUs). Objective: To summarize and evaluate the actual psychological experience of nurses caring for patients with severe pneumonia in the ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Relevant publications were identified by systematic searches across 11 databases in December 2021. All qualitative and mixed-method studies in English and Chinese from 2019 that explored the experiences of nurses who cared for severe COVID-19 patients in ICUs were included. The qualitative meta-synthesis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and assessed the quality of each study. Meta-synthesis was performed to integrate the results. Results: A total of 12 studies revealed 9 sub-themes and 3 descriptive themes: physical reactions and psychological changes, the need for support from multiple sources, and increased adaptation and resilience. Conclusion:Nurses who treated severe COVID-19 patients have experienced severe work trials and emotional reactions during the pandemic. They have also developed personally in this process. Managers should develop strategies that address the nurse's needs for external support, reasonably respond to public health emergencies, and improve nursing care outcomes.

AB  - Across neurodegenerative diseases, common mechanisms may reveal novel therapeutic targets based on neuronal protection, repair, or regeneration, independent of etiology or site of disease pathology. To address these mechanisms and discuss emerging treatments, in April, 2021, Glaucoma Research Foundation, BrightFocus Foundation, and the Melza M. and Frank Theodore Barr Foundation collaborated to bring together key opinion leaders and experts in the field of neurodegenerative disease for a virtual meeting titled "Solving Neurodegeneration". This "think-tank" style meeting focused on uncovering common mechanistic roots of neurodegenerative disease and promising targets for new treatments, catalyzed by the goal of finding new treatments for glaucoma, the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and the common interest of the three hosting foundations. Glaucoma, which causes vision loss through degeneration of the optic nerve, likely shares early cellular and molecular events with other neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. Here we discuss major areas of mechanistic overlap between neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system: neuroinflammation, bioenergetics and metabolism, genetic contributions, and neurovascular interactions. We summarize important discussion points with emphasis on the research areas that are most innovative and promising in the treatment of neurodegeneration yet require further development. The research that is highlighted provides unique opportunities for collaboration that will lead to efforts in preventing neurodegeneration and ultimately vision loss.

AB  - Depression is a prevalent mental disorder in older adults, but the prevalence in older adults varies largely across studies due to differences in regional cultures and screening tools. The objective of this review is to systematically evaluate the global prevalence of depression in older adults. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochran Library databases were searched independently from 2000 to 2021. Subgroups, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses were performed to address heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test. Forty-eight eligible studies were included in this review. The global prevalence of depression in older adults was 28.4%, with high between-study heterogeneity. The meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression in older adults is high although it varied with geographic regions, screening tools, sample sizes and representativeness, and study quality. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider appropriate screening tools to estimate the prevalence in different regions of a population.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) poses an ongoing challenge to society, to health systems, and to the trauma victims themselves. Today PTSD is often considered an incurable chronic problem that lacks effective treatment. While PTSD is closely related to memory, it also affects many physiological systems. PTSD is usually treated with medications and psychotherapy with moderate success, leaving a substantial proportion of patients with enduring distress and disability. Therefore, a search for better treatment options is vital. In this paper, we propose a model in which a conversation-based technique is integrated with bodily manipulation through acupuncture. This approach first emerged in clinical experience showing intriguing results from treating PTSD patients using acupuncture as a main strategy. Its theoretical foundations derive from the clinic and rely on contemporary neuroscience's understanding of memory consolidation and reconsolidation processes. Research shows that acupuncture can have potentially positive effects at three levels: (a) achieving a balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic neural activity; (b) reducing activation in the limbic system, hence inducing a calming effect; (c) reshaping the functional connectivity map within important and relevant cortical regions that encompass the default-mode network. We suggest that coupling traumatic memory retrieval leading to reconsolidation, combined with acupuncture, offers considerable potential for positive clinical improvement in patients with PTSD. This may explain the positive results of the described case studies and can pave the path for future advances in research and treatment in this field.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Currently, there is a lack of consensus in the literature on the association between screen time (eg, television, video games) and children's behavior problems.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the association between the duration of screen time and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems among children 12 years or younger.
   DATA SOURCES For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles published from January 1960 to May 2021. Reference lists were manually searched for additional studies.
   STUDY SELECTION Included studies measured screen time (ie, duration) and externalizing or internalizing behavior problems in children 12 years or younger, were observational or experimental (with baseline data), were available in English, and had data that could be transformed into an effect size. Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded. Of 25 196 nonduplicate articles identified and screened for inclusion, 595 met the selection criteria.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Extracted variables were child age, sex, and socioeconomic status; informants and measurement type for screen time and behavior problems; study publication year; and study design and quality. Data were extracted by 2 independent coders and were pooled using a random-effects model.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the association of screen time duration with externalizing (eg, aggression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms) and internalizing (eg, depression, anxiety) behaviors or diagnoses.
   RESULTS Of the 595 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 87 studies met all inclusion criteria, comprising 98 independent samples and 159 425 participants (mean [SD] age, 6.07 [2.89] years; 83 246 [51.30%] male). Increased duration of screen time had a small but significant correlation with more externalizing problems (90 samples; r, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.10-0.12) and internalizing problems (43 samples; r, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08) in children. Several methodological moderators explained between-study heterogeneity. There was evidence of significant between study heterogeneity (I-2 = 87.80).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This systematic review and meta-analysis found small but significant correlations between screen time and children's behavior problems. Methodological differences across studies likely contributed to the mixed findings in the literature.

AB  - Purposes Healthcare workers are at risk of stress-related disorders. Risk communication can be an effective preventive health measure for some health risks, but is not yet common in the prevention of stress-related disorders in an occupational healthcare setting. The overall aim is to examine whether risk communication was part of interventions aimed at the prevention of stress-related disorders in healthcare workers. Method We performed a scoping review using the framework of Arksey and O'Malley. We searched in Medline, Web of Science and PsychInfo for studies reporting on preventive interventions of stress-related disorders in healthcare workers between 2005 and December 2020. Studies were included when the intervention reported on at least one element of risk communication and one goal. We predefined four elements of risk communication: risk perception, communication of early stress symptoms, risk factors and prevention; and three goals: inform, stimulate informed decision-making and motivate action. Results We included 23 studies that described 17 interventions. None of the included interventions were primarily developed as risk communication interventions, but all addressed the goals. Two interventions used all four elements of risk communication. The prominent mode of delivery was face to face, mostly delivered by researchers. Early stress symptoms and risk factors were measured by surveys. Conclusions Risk communication on risk factors and early signs of stress-related disorders is not that well studied and evaluated in an occupational healthcare setting. Overall, the content of the communication was not based on the risk perception of the healthcare workers, which limited the likelihood of them taking action.

AB  - Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are stressful and/or traumatic experiences associated with an increased lifetime risk of negative health outcomes. The Allostatic Load (AL) is a measure of multisystem dysregulation, resulted by chronic stress. We systematically reviewed the English language literature on the association between ACEs and AL to identify the clinical risk profile, with the exclusion of reviews and preclinical studies. Searches covered the publication period up to the 1st of February 2022 and identified 25 studies in which ACEs such as maltreatment, abuse, poverty, psychological abuse, and discrimination were investigated in the context of AL. The selected studies used different sets of AL biomarkers resulting in substantial heterogenicity of calculating the AL index. Overall, we found that ACEs are associated with elevated AL and poorer health outcomes in adulthood. Furthermore, health risk behaviors, social support, and coping resources either moderate or mediate this asso-ciation. These findings suggest that targeting individuals at risk and starting interventions early might reduce AL and its deleterious health consequences.

AB  - Background: Detection of depression gained prominence soon after this troublesome disease emerged as a serious public health concern worldwide.
   Objective: This systematic review aims to summarize the findings of previous studies concerning applying machine learning (ML) methods to text data from social media to detect depressive symptoms and to suggest directions for future research in this area.
   Methods: A bibliographic search was conducted for the period of January 1990 to December 2020 in Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, ERIC, PsycINFO, and BioMed. Two reviewers retrieved and independently assessed the 418 studies consisting of 322 articles identified through database searching and 96 articles identified through other sources; 17 of the studies met the criteria for inclusion.
   Results: Of the 17 studies, 10 had identified depression based on researcher-inferred mental status, 5 had identified it based on users' own descriptions of their mental status, and 2 were identified based on community membership. The ML approaches of 13 of the 17 studies were supervised learning approaches, while 3 used unsupervised learning approaches; the remaining 1 study did not describe its ML approach. Challenges in areas such as sampling, optimization of approaches to prediction and their features, generalizability, privacy, and other ethical issues call for further research.
   Conclusions: ML approaches applied to text data from users on social media can work effectively in depression detection and could serve as complementary tools in public mental health practice.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a disease characterized by clinical polymorphism: a combination of diverse syndromes defined by differences in structure, course and outcome. The etiology and pathogenesis of this mental disorder is still not completely understood, in spite of the achievements in the fields of neuroscience, genetics, neuroimaging and others. Different treatment strategies have been developed for patients with schizophrenia, but the search for new pharmacological agents continues with the mission of achieving a more effective control over the disease manifestations (positive and negative symptoms), improvement of the patients' social functioning and quality of life. The accumulated clinical experience has revealed that drug treatment and the inclusion in various rehabilitation programs and social skills training shows promising results in these patients. In recent years a plethora of evidence has been compiled regarding the role of music therapy as a possible alternative in the combination treatment of patients with mental disorders, schizophrenia included. Thus, the purpose of this review is to present the reader with a more detailed and science-based account of the beneficial effect of music therapy on the general wellbeing of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. To fulfill our goal, we will focus mainly on the evidence provided by modern neuroimaging research.

AB  - Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with a broad range of deficits in cognitive functions which has significant implications for quality of life. Psychostimulants are demonstrated to improve symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, however, their impact on cognition remains incompletely characterized. Herein, the aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the extant literature reporting on the effects of psychostimulants on cognitive function in individuals with ADHD.Method: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to July 2021 was conducted. Additional studies were identified through Google Scholar and a manual search of the reference lists of relevant articles. Inclusion criteria were original studies that evaluated the cognitive function of individuals with ADHD taking psychostimulants drugs. We assessed the quality of the included papers using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS).Results: A total of 10 studies involving 753 subjects with ADHD and 194 healthy controls were identified and eligible for inclusion. Nine studies evaluated the impact of methylphenidate on cognitive function and one study investigated the use of lisdexamfetamine. Results indicated that attentional deficits such as memory, vigilance, divided attention, phasic and tonic alertness, and focused attention were improved in ADHD patients treated with psychostimulants. The efficacy of psychostimulants in improving other domains of cognition remains inconclusive due to conflicting evidence or insignificant findings (ie. academic performance and executive function).Overall, results indicate that psychostimulants may improve only select domains of cognition (ie. memory and attention).Conclusion: Psychostimulants are reported to improve several disparate aspects of cognition among individuals with ADHD. Further research is needed to better understand the complex relationships between cognition and behavior in ADHD, as well as the impact of medication on these distinct aspects of functioning. Further research is also needed to determine whether the pro-cognitive effect of stimulants would be transferable to other mental disorders.

AB  - It is well established that exercise can improve depressive symptoms in the general population; however, it is not clear if these benefits are also seen in pregnancy. This review aimed to synthesize the evidence that examines whether exercise during pregnancy impacts depressive and associated symptoms (e.g. anxiety) during the perinatal period. The review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and reporting criteria; literature was searched using PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science database engines. Clinical trials published in English evaluating the effects of a defined exercise protocol during pregnancy on depressive and/or anxiety symptoms during the perinatal period were included. Studies without a control group were excluded. Risk of bias was conducted by Cochrane assessment to appraise the quality of the included studies. Twenty-seven articles, between 1994 and 2019, were included. Of these, only 5 specifically recruited women with depression (n = 334), which all assessed a yoga-based intervention; 4 of these studies showed a statistically significant improvement in depressive and/or anxiety symptoms in the intervention group compared to baseline; however, 2 of these studies also showed an improvement in the control group. The remaining 22 studies used various exercise interventions in pregnant women (n = 4808) with 20 studies reporting that exercise during pregnancy has the ability to improve depressive and/or anxiety measures in the perinatal period compared to either baseline or control. The evidence suggests that exercise of various types in pregnancy can reduce depressive and/or anxiety symptoms in the perinatal period in otherwise healthy women. Specifically in women with antenatal depression, the incorporation of yoga in pregnancy can improve depressive/anxiety symptoms in the perinatal period; however, this is based on a small number of studies, and it is not clear whether this is superior to non-exercise controls. Further studies are needed to determine the potential therapeutic effects of exercise of various types during pregnancy on symptoms of antenatal depression.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Socioeconomic factors are associated with the prevalence of depression, but their associations with prognosis are unknown. Understanding this association would aid in the clinical management of depression.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether employment status, financial strain, housing status, and educational attainment inform prognosis for adults treated for depression in primary care, independent of treatment and after accounting for clinical prognostic factors.
   DATA SOURCES The Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases were searched from database inception to October 8, 2021.
   STUDY SELECTION Inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized clinical trials that used the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R; the most common comprehensive screening and diagnostic measure of depressive and anxiety symptoms in primary care randomized clinical trials), measured socioeconomic factors at baseline, and sampled patients with unipolar depression who sought treatment for depression from general physicians/practitioners or who scored 12 or more points on the CIS-R. Exclusion criteria included patients with depression secondary to a personality or psychotic disorder or neurologic condition, studies of bipolar or psychotic depression, studies that included children or adolescents, and feasibility studies. Studies were independently assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria by 2 reviewers.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted and cleaned by data managers for each included study, further cleaned by multiple reviewers, and cross-checked by study chief investigators. Risk of bias and quality were assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tools, respectively. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses-Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD) reporting guidelines.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depressive symptoms at 3 to 4 months after baseline. RESULTS This systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis identified 9 eligible studies that provided individual patient data for 4864 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.5 (14.0) years; 3279 women [67.4%]). The 2-stage random-effects meta-analysis end point depressive symptom scale scores were 28%(95% CI, 20%-36%) higher for unemployed patients than for employed patients and 18%(95% CI, 6%-30%) lower for patients who were homeowners than for patients living with family or friends, in hostels, or homeless, which were equivalent to 4.2 points (95% CI, 3.6-6.2 points) and 2.9 points (95% CI, 1.1-4.9 points) on the Beck Depression Inventory II, respectively. Financial strain and educational attainment were associated with prognosis independent of treatment, but unlike employment and housing status, there was little evidence of associations after adjusting for clinical prognostic factors.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that unemployment was associated with a poor prognosis whereas home ownership was associated with improved prognosis. These differences were clinically important and independent of the type of treatment received. Interventions that address employment or housing difficulties could improve outcomes for patients with depression.

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious stress-related disorder caused by traumatic experiences. However, identifying a key therapy that can be used for PTSD treatment remains difficult. Ketamine, a well-known dissociative anesthetic, is considered safe to be used in anesthesia, pain management, and antidepressant actions since 1970. At present, it is still controversial whether PTSD can be treated with ketamine. The authors performed a meta-analysis to determine whether the use of perioperative ketamine lowers the incidence of PTSD.& nbsp;Methods: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched to examine the use of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD among soldiers with combating experience. Studies were included if they were randomized placebo-controlled, case-control, and cohort studies. The primary outcome was the incidence of PTSD in the later stage of the wounded or burn soldiers. The secondary outcome was the influence of ketamine on PTSD-scale scores for early and chronic PTSD, respectively.& nbsp;Results: Our search yielded a total of three studies (n = 503 patients) comparing the use of ketamine (n = 349) to control (n = 154). The available evidence showed no significant difference in the incidence of PTSD between combatant soldiers on the battlefield with or without ketamine treatment (risk ratio = 0.81, 95% CI, 0.63-1.04; P = 0.10). In 65 patients from three trials, ketamine was not only ineffective in treating early PTSD but also lead to exacerbation of the disease (risk ratio = 2.45, 95% CI, 1.33-3.58; P < 0.001). However, in 91 patients from the other three trials, ketamine is effective in treating chronic PTSD (risk ratio = -3.66, 95% CI, -7.05 to -0.27; P = 0.03).& nbsp;Conclusion: Ketamine was not effective on lower the PTSD incidence for soldiers on the battlefield, nor on the PTSD-scale scores in early PTSD patients. However, it may improve the PTSD-scale scores for chronic conditions.& nbsp;

AB  - Purpose Psychometrically sound measures are essential for clinical practice to provide appropriate therapeutic input. Vlissides et al. (2016) reviewed measures used in psychological therapies with people who have intellectual disabilities (ID). This paper aims to review the evidence for the psychometric properties of recent clinical measures published since/overlooked by Vlissides et al. (2016). Design/methodology/approach A literature search was conducted to identify relevant clinical measures. Experts in the field also were contacted. Twenty papers were identified, relating to five novel clinical measures: psychological therapies outcome scale - intellectual disabilities, clinical outcome in routine evaluation - learning disabilities scale 30, quality of early relatedness rating scale, scale of emotional development - short and the Frankish assessment of the impact of trauma. Findings Evidence was found supporting a proportion of the psychometric properties of each measure, and some measures were found to be useful in directing interventions and informing clinical decisions. None of the measures identified, however, are yet to be fully psychometrically investigated, requiring further research. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to review the evidence of psychometric properties for these five emerging clinical measures and as such contributes an original perspective on their current state and requirements for future development.

AB  - There is an accumulating data that shows relation between childhood adversity and vulnerability to chronic diseases as well as epigenetic influences that in turn give rise to these diseases. Asthma is one of the chronic diseases that is influenced from genetic regulation of the inflammatory biomolecules and therefore the hypothesis in this research was childhood adversity might have caused epigenetic differentiation in the asthma-related genes in the population who had childhood trauma. To test this hypothesis, the literature was systematically reviewed to extract epigenetically modified gene data of the adults who had childhood adversity, and affected genes were further evaluated for their association with asthma. PRISMA guidelines were adopted and PubMed and Google Scholar were included in the searched databases, to evaluate epigenetic modifications in asthma-related genes of physically, emotionally or sexually abused children. After retrieving a total of 5245 articles, 36 of them were included in the study. Several genes and pathways that may contribute to pathogenesis of asthma development, increased inflammation, or response to asthma treatment were found epigenetically affected by childhood traumas. Childhood adversity, causing epigenetic changes in DNA, may lead to asthma development or influence the course of the disease and therefore should be taken into account for the prolonged health consequences.

AB  - Background: Depression is screened by many psychological tools, whereas the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is one of the most commonly used self-administered tools. Uganda is a culturally diverse country with a wide variety of tribes, ethnic groups, languages, and disease conditions; it is urgent to know the psychometrics of the used PHQ-9 across different cohorts. However, there is no prior review to assess its reliability in this culturally diverse country, where this review fulfills the knowledge gap.& nbsp;Methods: Adhering to the PRISMA guideline, a systematic search was performed in several databases (i.e., PubMed, Africa-Wide Information, AJOL, and PsycINFO, among others), and a total of 51 articles were included in this review, confirming the study inclusion criteria (e.g., using the PHQ-9).& nbsp;Results: The PHQ-9 has been used among individuals above 10 years and both genders, and the tool has been used most among the HIV patient group (n = 28). The tool is frequently administered by interviews and has been translated into several languages (mostly Luganda, n = 31). A cutoff of 10 was commonly used to identify clinical or major depression (n = 23), and its prevalence ranged from 8 to 67%. It has been validated for use in two populations, (i) HIV-positive participants and (ii) the general population attending a health facility. The sensitivity and specificity were 92 and 89%, respectively, at a cutoff score of 10, whereas 67 and 78%, respectively, at a cutoff score of 5. The Cronbach alpha ranged between 0.68 and 0.94.& nbsp;Conclusion: The PHQ-9 has been used in several studies in Uganda but validated in only two populations and is commonly used in one language. Thus, validation of the tool in various populations and languages is warranted to improve the tool's acceptance in Uganda.

Methods We searched the Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Education Research Complete until 30 November 2021, to identify relevant studies using relevant key words. Job or occupational stress was used as the outcome measure. Stress was defined as Perceived Stress Scale, Teacher Stress Inventory, Maslach Burnout Inventory, Teacher's Distress, Brief Symptoms Inventory or Global Severity Index. Study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment was performed by two independent reviewers. The pooled estimate of the effect by the type of outcome measurement tool and by type of interventions used was calculated using random effects meta-analysis. We used Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to assess the overall quality of the evidence. Results We reviewed 26 studies, of which 24 were randomised trials and 2 pre-test/post-test studies. Based on meta-analysis, a positive effect of intervention (pooled estimate -1.13, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.73) with high heterogeneity among studies (chi(2)=426.88, p<0.001, I-2=94%) was found by type of interventions used. Cognitive-behavioural therapy had the strongest positive effect, followed by meditation among the types of interventions studied. We identified evidence of a moderate quality for interventions aiming to manage the stress level of schoolteachers. Conclusions The meta-analysis showed a positive effect of interventions, suggesting that interventions might reduce the stress level among teachers. The quality of the evidence was moderate.

AB  - With 4 to 12 million tons of plastic entering the marine environment each year, plastic pollution has become one of the most ubiquitous sources of pollution of the Anthropocene threatening the marine environment. Beyond the conspicuous physical damages, plastics may release a cocktail of harmful chemicals, i.e. monomers, additives and persistent organic pollutants. Although known to be highly toxic, plastic leachates seemingly appear, however, as the "somewhat sickly child" of the plastic pollution literature. We reviewed the only 26 studies investigating the impact of plastic leachates on marine microbes and invertebrates, and concluded that the observed effects essentially depend on the species, polymer type, plastic composition, accumulated contaminants and weathering processes. We identified several gaps that we believe may hamper progress in this emerging area of research and discussed how they could be bridged to further our understanding of the effects of the compounds released by plastic items on marine organisms. We first stress the lack of a consensus on the use of the term 'leachate', and subsequently introduce the concepts of primary and secondary leachates, based on the intrinisic or extrinsic origin of the products released in bulk seawater. We discuss how methodological inconsistencies and the discrepancy between the polymers used in experiments and their abundance in the environment respectively limit comparison between studies and a comprehensive assessment of the effects leachate may actually have in the ocean. We also discuss how the imbalanced in the variety of both organisms and polymers considered, the mostly unrealistic concentrations used in laboratory experiments, and the lack of investigation on key ecosystem engineers may considerably narrow the spectrum of our understanding of the plastic leachates' effects. We finally discuss how increasing multi-disciplinarity through collaborations between different research fields may benefit to an area of research which is still in its early infancy.

AB  - Background Suicidal ideation is an increasingly common presentation to the paediatric emergency department. The presence of suicidal ideation is linked to acute psychiatric hospital admission and increased risk of suicide. The paediatric emergency department plays a critical role in reducing risk of suicide, strengthening protective factors and encouraging patient engagement with ongoing care. Aims This rapid review aims to synthesise evidence on interventions that can be implemented in the paediatric emergency department for children and adolescents presenting with suicidal ideation. Method Six electronic databases were searched for studies published since January 2010: PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane. Outcomes of interest included suicidal ideation, engagement with out-patient services, incidence of depressive symptoms, hopelessness, family empowerment, hospital admission and feasibility of interventions. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Results Six studies of paediatric emergency department-initiated family-based (n = 4) and motivational interviewing interventions (n = 2) were narratively reviewed. The studies were mainly small and of varying quality. The evidence synthesis suggests that both types of intervention, when initiated by the paediatric emergency department, reduce suicidal ideation and improve patient engagement with out-patient services. Family-based interventions also showed a reduction in suicidality and improvement in family empowerment, hopelessness and depressive symptoms. Conclusions Paediatric emergency department-initiated interventions are crucial to reduce suicidal ideation and risk of suicide, and to enhance ongoing engagement with out-patient services. Further research is needed; however, family-based and motivational interviewing interventions could be feasibly and effectively implemented in the paediatric emergency department setting.

AB  - Background: The depressive phase of bipolar disorder causes significant functional impairment and disease burden. The efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression has long been a subject of debate.
   Aims: To synthesize evidence of the effectiveness, risk of mood switching, and tolerability of adjunctive antidepressants in acute bipolar depression compared to using mood stabilizers or antipsychotics alone.
   Method: Multiple databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, including open label and double-blinded, for patients ages 18 or older with acute bipolar depression, comparing efficacy and adverse events in those who used adjunctive antidepressants versus without. Risk of bias and outcomes were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. This study has PROSPERO registration CRD42016037701.
   Results: Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. Adjunctive antidepressants showed no significant effect on improving response rate (RR=1.10, 95%CI: 0.98-1.23). Subgroup analysis showed that adjunctive antidepressants with antipsychotics had a small but significantly better response rate compared to antipsychotics alone, which was not seen with adjunctive antidepressants with mood stabilizers. However, that finding was limited by studies predominantly using olanzapine as the antipsychotic medication. Adjunctive antidepressants had no clinically significant impact (but a small statistically significant impact) on improving depressive symptoms (SMD=-0.13, 95%CI: -0.24 to -0.02). There was no association with increased mood switch (RR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.68-1.39) and there was an association with lower dropout due to inefficacy (RR=0.66, 95%CI: 0.45 similar to 0.98).
   Conclusions: There is no evidence of adjunctive antidepressants clinically improving response rate or depressive symptoms for acute bipolar depression. They are well tolerated, without increasing the risk of short-term mood switch.

AB  - Drought is a costly natural disaster characterized by water shortages that impact water availability, agriculture, ecosystems, and the economy. The driving mechanisms of drought operate on a wide range of spatial scales, from the movement of soil water on a hillslope to global atmospheric circulation. Additionally, drought impacts vary across spatial scales, from drought induced crop stress on a specific agricultural field to widespread continental water shortages. As a result, multiscalar drought monitoring and early warning systems are needed to utilize observational data sets obtained at different spatial scales and to communicate drought impacts to various levels of decision-makers in government and industry. However, scaling must be employed to translate information across scales, either to fix incongruencies in the spatial scale of input data sets or to modify the model output scale. These scaling techniques have several challenges and limitations that hinder drought accuracy and interpretability, such as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and increased model uncertainty. This paper reviews the role of spatial scale in drought monitoring and early warning systems, the associated challenges, and techniques to minimize their impact. Finally, this review identifies several knowledge gaps and future directions.

AB  - Several lines of research suggest that reproductive-related hormonal events may affect the course of bipolar disorder in some women. However, data on associations between bipolar disorder and menarche, menstrual cycle, and menopause are mixed. This article reviews the literature on the potential effects of menarche, menstrual cycle, and menopause on bipolar disorder. A narrative review of published articles on bipolar disorder and menstrual cycle events was conducted. The primary outcome assessed was the impact of menarche, menstrual cycle and menopause on the course of bipolar illness. Databases searched were PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, PsycINFO, Medline, and Cochrane Libraries from inception to August 2021.
   Twenty-two studies were identified and included in the narrative synthesis. Research suggested that a subset of women with bipolar disorder are vulnerable to the impact of menstrual cycle events. Menarche seems to be associated with age at onset of bipolar illness especially in case of bipolar disorder type I and the specific age at menarche may predict some clinical features of the disorder. Menstrual cycle likely affects the course of bipolar disorder but the pattern of mood variability is not clear. Menopause appears to be not only a period of vulnerability to mood alteration, especially depressive episodes, and impairment of quality of life, but also a potential trigger of bipolar illness onset.
   The impact of menarche, menstrual cycle, and menopause on bipolar disorder is largely understudied. Preliminary evidence suggests that a subset of women with bipolar disorder may have their mood shifts affected by menstrual cycle events, with different patterns depending on the type of bipolar disorder also. Further researches are needed to deep the impact of menarche, menstrual cycle, and menopause on bipolar illness.

AB  - Human flourishing is a thriving concept, whose use has greatly increased among academic researchers from a variety of fields, from the arts and humanities and psychology to the social and environmental sciences and economics. To better understand the concept's success, this work proposes a bibliometric review, in which statistical methods and data mining were used to analyze 1829 documents, chosen from the Scopus database by searching the term "human flourishing". Through cluster and network analyses, the study shows the concept's evolution and composition, as well as its current tensions and trends, in which the predominantly psychological approach is being compensated with social concerns and the search for justice. Furthermore, the concept's strong philosophical roots provide it with abstract richness and great fertility, which can be seen in keywords, such as virtue or eudaimonia. This bibliometric review proved to be useful for this type of study, despite the limitations imposed by the characteristics of the Scopus database itself.

AB  - (1) Background: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the relationship between identifying as transgender and substance use. (2) Methods: We searched for relevant studies in PubMed, Scopus, the Web of Science, and PsycINFO on 21 July 2021. (3) Results: Twenty studies comparing transgender and cisgender people were included in this work, accounting for a total of 2,376,951 participants (18,329 of whom were transgender). These articles included data on current tobacco use, current tobacco use disorder, current alcohol use, current alcohol use disorder, lifetime substance (all) use, current substance use (excluding tobacco and alcohol), current use of specific substances (excluding tobacco and alcohol and including cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, ecstasy, stimulants, heroin, opiates, cannabis, marijuana, LSD, hallucinogens, steroids, inhalants, sedatives, Ritalin or Adderall, diet pills, cold medicine, prescription medications, polysubstance, other club drugs, and other illegal drugs), and current substance use disorder (excluding tobacco and alcohol). We used the ORs and their 95% CIs to state the association between identifying as transgender and those variables. The control reference category used in all cases was cisgender. We employed a random-effects model. Transgender people were more likely to use tobacco (odds ratio (OR) = 1.65; 95% CI [1.37, 1.98]), have used substances throughout their lives (OR = 1.48; 95% CI [1.30, 1.68]), and present current use of specific substances (OR = 1.79; 95% CI [1.54, 2.07]). When current alcohol and substance use in general and tobacco, alcohol, and substance use disorders specifically were considered, the likelihood did not differ from that of cisgender people. (4) Conclusions: The presence of substance use disorders did not differ between transgender and cisgender people. Considering this population as consumers or as addicted may be a prejudice that perpetuates stigma. Nonetheless, transgender people were more likely to use tobacco and other substances, but not alcohol. Hypothetically, this might be an emotional regulation strategy, a maladaptive mechanism for coping with traumatic experiences, or could respond to minority stress, produced by stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and harassment. It is of particular importance to implement policies against discrimination and stigmatisation and to adapt prevention and treatment services so that they are inclusive of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.

AB  - Research on climate change and mental health is a new but rapidly growing field. To summarise key advances and gaps in the current state of climate change and mental health studies, we conducted a scoping review that comprehensively examined research methodologies using large-scale datasets. We identified 56 eligible articles published in Embase, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science between Jan 1, 2000, and Aug 9, 2020. The primary data collection method used was surveys, which focused on self-reported mental health effects due to acute and subacute climate events. Other approaches used administrative health records to study the effect of environmental temperature on hospital admissions for mental health conditions, and national vital statistics to assess the relationship between environmental temperature and suicide rates with regression analyses. Our work highlights the need to link population-based mental health outcome databases to weather data for causal inference. Collaborations between mental health providers and data scientists can guide the formation of clinically relevant research questions on climate change.

AB  - Cognitive impairments are core features of established schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). However, it remains unclear whether specific cognitive functions are differentially impaired pre-onset and at what age these impairments can be detected. The purpose of this review was to elucidate these issues through a systematic summary of results from longitudinal studies investigating impairment in specific cognitive domains as antecedents of SSD. Relevant studies were identified by electronic and manual literature searches and included any original study of cognitive domains any time pre-onset of SSDs that included a control group. Effect sizes were calculated by domain for studies comparing high-risk participants who developed SSD with those who did not. The strongest evidence for impairment pre-onset was for mental processing speed, verbal learning and memory, executive function, and social cognition. Some verbal impairments, like language abilities at age 3 and verbal learning and memory at age 7, may develop as static deficits. Conversely, some non-verbal impairments, like mental processing speed, visuospatial abilities, and visual working memory manifest as developmental lag and become significant later in life. Most effect sizes were small to moderate, except for verbal fluency (d' = 0,85), implying this impairment as central in high-risk participants who develop SSD. The present review documents extensive cognitive impairments pre-onset of SSD, and that these impairments start early in life, in line with the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. Increased knowledge about cognitive impairments preonset can provide a better basis for understanding the complex pathogenesis of SSD as well as informing cognitive remediation programs.

AB  - Objective: Maintaining healthful, safe, and productive work environments for workers in correctional settings is a matter of deep consequence to the workers themselves, the institutions they serve, the incarcerated individuals with whom they share space, and inevitably, to our wider community. We hypothesized that an examination of the academic literature would reveal opportunities for an improved approach to research in these settings. Methods: We performed a scoping literature review using search terms related to the occupational and environmental health of workers in correctional environments, limited to studies performed in the United States. Results: A total of 942 studies underwent title and abstract screening, 342 underwent full-text review, and 147 underwent data extraction by a single reviewer. The results revealed a body of literature that tends strongly toward analyses of stress and burnout of correctional staff, largely based on self-reported data from cross-sectional surveys. Those studies related to physical health were predominantly represented by topics of infectious disease. There were few or no studies examining exposures or outcomes related to diagnosable mental health conditions, musculoskeletal injury, environmental hazards, medical or mental health staff, immigration detention settings, or regarding incarcerated workers. There were very few studies that were experimental, longitudinal, or based on objective data. Discussion: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has promulgated a research strategy for correctional officers that should guide future research for all workers in correctional settings, but realization of these goals will rely upon multidisciplinary collaboration, specific grants to engage researchers, and an improved understanding of the barriers inherent to correctional research, all while maintaining rigorous protection for incarcerated persons as an especially vulnerable population.

AB  - Objective Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a disorder with a significantly high prevalence. Affective disorders, including depressive disorder (DD), often coexist with this eating disorder (ED). In this review we will focus on its prevalence, associated vulnerability factors, clinical manifestations, possible etiological factors and its prognosis. Methods A bibliographic search was carried out in the PubMed database selecting those articles that approached the subject of comorbidity between AN and DD. The search was limited to articles published from January 1990 to December 2021. Results Of the 1891 abstracts reviewed, 33 studies met inclusion criteria. The prevalence of this comorbidity was extremely variable between studies, which exposed their heterogeneity. As to symptomatology this comorbidity presents itself with more severity, greater expression of psychological traits and greater cognitive impairment. Certain personality traits are postulated as vulnerability factors. Genetic factors such as neurochemicals seem to be involved in its pathogenesis. Conclusion The comorbidity between DD and ED have important influence in its symptomatic expression, severity and prognosis. Some of the analyzed studies provide consistent data, but there are others that are contradictory. It would be necessary to increase the number of studies and use a unified methodology.

AB  - Background Globally, xenophobia towards out-groups is frequently increased in times of economic and political instability, such as in infectious disease outbreaks. This systematic review aims to: (1) assess the xenophobic attitudes and behaviors towards migrants during disease outbreaks; and (2) identify adverse health outcomes linked to xenophobia. Methods We searched nine scientific databases to identify studies measuring xenophobic tendencies towards international migrants during disease outbreaks and evaluated the resulting adverse health effects. Results Eighteen articles were included in the review. The findings were grouped into: (1) xenophobia-related outcomes, including social exclusion, out-group avoidance, support for exclusionary health policies, othering, and germ aversion; and (2) mental health problems, such as anxiety and fear. Depending on the disease outbreak, different migrant populations were negatively affected, particularly Asians, Africans, and Latino people. Factors such as perceived vulnerability to disease, disgust sensitivity, medical mistrust individualism, collectivism, disease salience, social representation of disease and beliefs in different origins of disease were associated with xenophobia. Conclusions Overall, migrants can be a vulnerable population frequently blamed for spreading disease, promoting irrational fear, worry and stigma in various forms, thus leading to health inequities worldwide. It is urgent that societies adopt effective support strategies to combat xenophobia and structural forms of discrimination against migrants.

AB  - Background: Mental health issue among college students is routinely a major public health concern, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have exacerbated the students' mental health issues which include psychological distress, panic disorder, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. However, few studies reached a consensus on the impact of COVID-19 fear on mental health among college students. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis that quantitatively synthesized the fear among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO electronic databases were systematically searched to identify cross-sectional study reporting the state of COVID-19 fear examined by the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) published up until November 20, 2021. Methodological quality was complied with the evaluation criteria of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The random effects model was employed to estimate the pooled mean of FCV-19S score. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were also conducted. Publication bias was assessed by Begg's test and funnel plot.
   Results: A total of 16 studies with a sample size of 11,872 were included. A pooled mean of FCV-19S score was 17.60 [95% confidence interval (CI): 16.41-18.78]. The mean of COVID-19 fear in women (17.11, 95% CI: 16.59-17.64) was higher than that in men (15.21, 95% CI: 14.33-16.08). The highest and lowest pooled means of FCV-19S score were observed in the studies conducted in multiple countries that include Israel, Russian, and Belarus (21.55, 95% CI: 20.77-22.33) and in Europe (16.52, 95% CI: 15.26-17.77), respectively. No significant publication bias was detected by Begg's test.
   Conclusions: College students experienced a moderate level of fear caused by COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary to design and implement prevention programs that target the mental health of college students.

AB  - Labels serve as identifiers and convenient descriptors of inanimate and animate objects. In humans, given labels can easily become part of an individual's self-perceived identity. Negative labels ascribed to a person can result in internalized stigma, a state that will shape the subject's biography. This can ultimately impact the person's mental and physical health since perceived and/or anticipated stigma discourages the use of social and health services. Per definition, stigma involves labeling of persons with physical, mental, or social characteristics that do not match the observer's arbitrarily conditioned and calibrated sense of norms (public stigma); such labeling may eventually become embedded in rules, regulations, and laws (structural stigma). Internalized stigma projects onto a person's emotions and actions. Public (enacted) stigma results from stereotyping (collectively agreed-upon notions about a group of persons that are used to categorize these people) and devaluation, which subsequently leads to social distancing, discrimination, and blatant abuse of human rights. Much of what we know about stigma results from research in the psychosocial sciences and, more recently, from social neuroscience. The stigma around mental health has generated much attention in the field of psychiatry where, to date, most research has focussed on epidemiology and anti-stigma interventions. This essay intends to stimulate thought, debate, and research within the behavioral neuroscience community and, therefore, to inform evidence-based design and implementation of neuroscience-based approaches by other professionals working towards the elimination of the stigma attached to mental illness. The article starts by considering the concept of stigma and the psychological processes that give rise to the phenomenon; it also considers how projected and perceived stigma are multiplied. Finally, after a brief review of the few existing neuroscientific explorations of stigma, gaps in our knowledge of the neurobiological basis of stigma are identified and discussed.

AB  - Background: With the increasing frequency and magnitude of disasters internationally, there is growing research and clinical interest in the application of social media sites for disaster mental health surveillance. However, important questions remain regarding the extent to which unstructured social media data can be harnessed for clinically meaningful decision-making.
   Objective: This comprehensive scoping review synthesizes interdisciplinary literature with a particular focus on research methods and applications.
   Methods: A total of 6 health and computer science databases were searched for studies published before April 20, 2021, resulting in the identification of 47 studies. Included studies were published in peer-reviewed outlets and examined mental health during disasters or crises by using social media data.
   Results: Applications across 31 mental health issues were identified, which were grouped into the following three broader themes: estimating mental health burden, planning or evaluating interventions and policies, and knowledge discovery. Mental health assessments were completed by primarily using lexical dictionaries and human annotations. The analyses included a range of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, statistical modeling, and qualitative techniques. The overall reporting quality was poor, with key details such as the total number of users and data features often not being reported. Further, biases in sample selection and related limitations in generalizability were often overlooked.
   Conclusions: The application of social media monitoring has considerable potential for measuring mental health impacts on populations during disasters. Studies have primarily conceptualized mental health in broad terms, such as distress or negative affect, but greater focus is required on validating mental health assessments. There was little evidence for the clinical integration of social media-based disaster mental health monitoring, such as combining surveillance with social media-based interventions or developing and testing real-world disaster management tools. To address issues with study quality, a structured set of reporting guidelines is recommended to improve the methodological quality, replicability, and clinical relevance of future research on the social media monitoring of mental health during disasters.

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychiatric disorder marked by severe affective instability and poor interpersonal functioning. Existing literature has highlighted that individuals with BPD are at greater risk for a wide range of adverse physiological and psychosocial outcomes in the perinatal period compared to perinatal individuals without BPD. However, to date, no systematic review has addressed the prevalence of BPD and borderline personality features (BPF) in pregnant and postpartum individuals. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching three databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase) on April 6th, 2021. Research articles and conference abstracts that evaluated BPF or BPD in pregnant, postpartum, or mixed perinatal populations were included. Sixteen publications were included in the systematic review (n = 14 research articles, n = 2 conference abstracts), seven of which were included in the meta-analysis. Among non-clinical samples, prevalence rates of BPF during pregnancy ranged from 6.9 to 26.7%, while rates of BPD across the perinatal period ranged from 0.7 to 1.7%. Among clinical samples, rates of BPF and BPD across the perinatal period spanned 9.7-34% and 2.0-35.2%, respectively. Results from the meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence rate of BPD in clinical samples during the perinatal period is 14.0% (95% CI [7.0, 22.0]). Among clinical perinatal samples, there is a high prevalence of borderline personality pathology. This review highlights the need for appropriate validated screening methods to identify and treat BPD in the perinatal population.

AB  - The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in psychiatry has risen over the past several years to meet the growing need for improved access to mental health solutions. Additionally, shortages of mental health providers during the COVID-19 pandemic have continued to exacerbate the burden of mental illness worldwide. AI applications already in existence include those enabled to assist with psychiatric diagnoses, symptom tracking, disease course prediction, and psychoeducation. Modalities of AI mental health care delivery include availability through the internet, smartphone applications, and digital gaming Here we review emerging AI-based interventions in the form of chat and therapy bots, specifically conversational applications that teach the user emotional coping mechanisms and provide support for people with communication difficulties, computer generated images of faces that form the basis of avatar therapy, and intelligent animal-like robots with new advances in digital psychiatry. We discuss the implications of incorporating AI chatbots into clinical practice and offer perspectives on how these AI-based interventions will further impact the field of psychiatry.

AB  - Background Mental health crises are common in people with complex emotional needs (our preferred working term for people diagnosed with a 'personality disorder'), yet this population is often dissatisfied with the crisis care they receive. Exploring their experiences and views on what could be improved, and those of carers and healthcare staff, is key to developing better services. Aims We aimed to synthesise the relevant qualitative literature. Method Five databases were searched. Eligible studies included service users with a diagnosis of personality disorder and their carers or relevant staff, focused on crisis responses and used a qualitative design. Data were analysed with thematic synthesis. Results Eleven studies were included, most focusing on emergency departments. Four meta-themes emerged: (a) acceptance and rejection when presenting to crisis care: limited options and lack of involvement of carers; (b) interpersonal processes: importance of the therapeutic relationship and establishing a framework for treatment; (c) managing recovery from a crisis: clear recovery plan and negotiating collaboration; and (d) equipping and supporting staff: training and emotional support. Conclusions Our findings suggest that emergency departments have major limitations as settings to provide crisis care for people with complex emotional needs, but there is a lack of research exploring alternatives. The quality of the therapeutic relationship was central to how care was experienced, with collaborative and optimistic staff highly valued. Staff reported feeling poorly supported in responding to the needs of this population. Research looking at experiences of a range of care options and how to improve these is needed.

AB  - The burden of mental illness both in world and India is increasing at an alarming rate. Adding to it, there has been an increase in mental health challenges during covid-19 pandemic with a rise in suicide, loneliness and substance use. Artificial intelligence can act as a potential solution to address this shortage. The use of artificial intelligence is increasingly being employed in various fields of mental health like affective disorders, psychosis, and geriatric psychiatry. The benefits are various like lower costs, wider reach but at the same time it comes with its own disadvantages. This article reviews the current understanding of artificial intelligence, the types of Artificial intelligence, its current use in various mental health disorders, current status in India, advantages, disadvantages and future potentials. With the passage of time and digitalization of the modern age, there will be an increase in the use of artificial intelligence in psychiatry hence a detailed understanding will be thoughtful. For this, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct, China national Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Globus Index Medicus search engines by using keywords. Initial searches involved the use of each individual keyword while the later searches involved the use of more than one word in different permutation combinations.

AB  - Although mental health (MH) services and psychological support are tailored to fit the MH needs of those requiring these services in the UK, underutilisation persists. Current evidence suggests that ethnic minorities underutilise MH services with culture implicated in this trend. However, there is limited evidence from systematic reviews integrating the findings of primary studies on the role of culture in MH service utilisation among ethnic minorities. This review aims to synthesise and summarise evidence on the role of culture in MH service utilisation among ethnic minorities in the UK. Two reviewers searched CINAHL, APA PsycINFO and Medline databases using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Two other reviewers screened the abstracts and full text, while three conducted data extraction and assessed study quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative studies. One's culture was repeatedly identified to play a role in MH service utilisation among the ethnic minorities in the UK. The impact of cultural factors on service utilisation was through its effects on structure/institution, beliefs, stigma and perception of service. In addition, discrimination and other racism-related negative experiences during service use were found to inform perception and use of MH services. These findings suggest that MH services should be tailored to cultural differences to optimise service utilisation.

AB  - Mercury is a highly toxic and highly mobile heavy metal. It has been regarded as more toxic than other nonessential and toxic nonradioactive heavy metals. Moreover, it has a high tendency of bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the ecosystem. This study aimed to assess the environmental and health risks related to Hg. Seventy studies related to Hg in environmental media, aquatic biota, and food stuffs across Pakistan were reviewed, and their concentrations were used for ecological and human health risk assessments. High concentrations of Hg were reported in the environment, with maximum concentrations of 72 mg L-1, 144 mg kg(-1), 887 mg kg(-1), and 49,807 ng m(-3) in surface water, surface soil, surface sediments, and urban atmosphere, respectively. The possible non-carcinogenic health risk (hazard quotient) of Hg was assessed in soil, water, and fish. High risks were calculated for seafood and vegetable consumption, while low risks were estimated for soils and groundwater ingestion and exposure. Overall, children showed higher risks than adults. Last, the risk quotient analysis (RQ) revealed significant risks for aquatic species. RQs showed that multiple species, especially those with smaller resilience, could face long-term detrimental impacts. High, medium, and low risks were calculated from 66.66, 16.17, and 16.17% of the reported Hg concentrations.

AB  - One of the major goals for research on adolescent development is to identify the optimal conditions for adolescents to grow up in a complex social world and to understand individual differences in these trajectories. Based on influential theoretical and empirical work in this field, achieving this goal requires a detailed understanding of the social context in which neural and behavioral development takes place, along with longitudinal measurements at multiple levels (e.g., genetic, hormonal, neural, behavioral). In this perspectives article, we highlight the promising role of team science in achieving this goal. To illustrate our point, we describe meso (peer relations) and micro (social learning) approaches to understand social development in adolescence as crucial aspects of adolescent mental health. Finally, we provide an overview of how our team has extended our collaborations beyond scientific partners to multiple societal partners for the purpose of informing and including policymakers, education and health professionals, as well as adolescents themselves when conducting and communicating research.

AB  - This review analyzes the predictive validity of the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), considering cognitive function. Electronic searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases. Overall, 20 studies were reviewed, including 3,499 older adults, with and without dementia, who satisfied the selection criteria. Participants were stratified into the dementia, non-dementia, and mixed groups, and the diagnostic performance of the CSDD was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In the dementia and non-dementia groups, the area under the curve was >= 0.9, confirming high accuracy of the test. The pooled sensitivity was the highest in the dementia group (0.87), followed by the mixed group (0.84) and non-dementia group (0.82). In the subgroup analysis based on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the ROC curve was 0.90 for older adults with MMSE scores < 15 and 0.87 for those with an MMSE score >= 15. Therefore, the CSDD can be considered excellent tool for assessing depression in all older adults, although its predictive ability is better for older adults with dementia compared to that in those without dementia. It can be used as a first-line screening tool for depression, regardless of cognitive function.

KW  - CONSISTENCY
AB  - Background Family interventions are efficacious for relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Multiple different models have been developed. We aimed to compare the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of family interventions for relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched for randomised controlled trials that investigated family intervention models aimed at preventing relapse in patients with schizophrenia. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to Jan 20, 2020 and PubMed up to July 15, 2021. We included blinded and open-label randomised controlled trials in which at least 80% of patients had schizophrenia spectrum disorders. We excluded studies in which all patients were acutely ill, had a concurrent medical or psychiatric disorder, or were prodromal or "at risk of psychosis". Study selection and data extraction were done by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted about overall, positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia, quality of life, adherence, overall functioning, family burden, expressed emotion, and discontinuations due to inefficacy. The primary outcome was relapse, measured with operationalised criteria, psychiatric hospital admissions, or clinical judgement. We did a frequentist, random-effects, network meta-analysis to calculate odds ratios ([ORs]; dichotomous outcomes) or standardised mean differences (continuous outcomes) with 95% CIs. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020169951. Findings We identified 28 395 studies through the database search and 334 from references of previous studies. We compared 11 family intervention models tested on a total of 90 randomised controlled trials with 10 340 participants (3579 females and 5632 males with sex indicated; median age 31 years [range 14-65]) in the network meta-analysis. Ethnicity data were not available. All interventions, with the exception of crisis-oriented interventions and family psychoeducation with two sessions or fewer, reduced the relapse rate significantly when compared with treatment as usual at the primary timepoint of 12 months. ORs compared with treatment as usual ranged from 0middot18 (95% CI 0middot12-0middot27) for family psychoeducation alone to 0middot63 (0middot42-0middot94) for community-based interventions involving family members. The results were robust in various sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The confidence in the estimates ranged from moderate to very low for different comparisons. Interpretation Almost all family intervention models were efficacious in preventing relapse in schizophrenia. Family psychoeducation alone, without behavioural or skills training, was superior to the more complex models. Our results suggest that in contexts where there are financial constraints, family psychoeducation alone should be implemented.

AB  - Background: The collaborative care model (CoCM) is a well-established system of behavioral health care in primary care settings. There is potential for digital and mobile technology to augment the CoCM to improve access, scalability, efficiency, and clinical outcomes.
   Objective: This study aims to conduct a scoping review to synthesize the evidence available on digital and mobile health technology in collaborative care settings.
   Methods: This review included cohort and experimental studies of digital and mobile technologies used to augment the CoCM. Studies examining primary care without collaborative care were excluded. A literature search was conducted using 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar). The search results were screened in 2 stages (title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review) by 2 reviewers.
   Results: A total of 3982 nonduplicate reports were identified, of which 20 (0.5%) were included in the analysis. Most studies used a combination of novel technologies. The range of digital and mobile health technologies used included mobile apps, websites, web-based platforms, telephone-based interactive voice recordings, and mobile sensor data. None of the identified studies used social media or wearable devices. Studies that measured patient and provider satisfaction reported positive results, although some types of interventions increased provider workload, and engagement was variable. In studies where clinical outcomes were measured (7/20, 35%), there were no differences between groups, or the differences were modest.
   Conclusions: The use of digital and mobile health technologies in CoCM is still limited. This study found that technology was most successful when it was integrated into the existing workflow without relying on patient or provider initiative. However, the effect of digital and mobile health on clinical outcomes in CoCM remains unclear and requires additional clinical trials.

AB  - Apathy and depression are frequently observed as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, respectively, and are important for ensuring adequate care. This study aims to explore effective non-pharmacological interventions for apathy and depression with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Five search engines including PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Web of Science were used to extract relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were studies that involved participants who were diagnosed with MCI or dementia, included quantitative assessments of each symptom, and employed randomized controlled trials. Twenty studies were extracted, with interventions have been conducted in care facilities, the community, and hospitals. Participants in many studies had MCI or mild-to-moderate dementia but were not diagnosed with the subtypes of dementia. Few studies had set apathy and depression as the primary outcomes of non-pharmacological interventions. The findings suggested that emotional and stimulation-oriented approaches to apathy and depression would be useful for people with MCI or mild-to-moderate dementia. It would be helpful for therapists to assess the clinical features of the target symptoms for selecting suitable interventions. Additionally, increasing the number of randomized controlled trials focusing on apathy or depression as primary outcomes would offer a more definite conclusion for future systematic reviews.

AB  - This scoping review focused on parents' resolution of their reactions to receiving a diagnosis for their child, based on Marvin and Pianta's model and Reaction to Diagnosis Interview (RDI). We aimed to map the populations examined, the prevalence of parents' narrated resolution, and what is known about its outcomes and determinants. A structured search identified 47 peer-reviewed papers published between 1992-2021. All employed the RDI and most had a cross-sectional design. Studies focused on a wide range of children's health and mental health diagnoses. Days to years after receiving the diagnosis, RDI narratives of 18.43% to 72.49% of the parents (44% on average) indicated lack of resolution. Studies reported associations between unresolved narratives and children's insecure attachment, higher parenting stress, and poorer parental health. However, findings on the associations of narrated resolution with parents' representations of their child, sensitivity, and psychological symptoms were equivocal, and findings on factors that may shape narrated resolution were limited. To advance the understanding of parents' narrated resolution and its effects, we recommend researchers employ prospective and longitudinal designs, evaluate narrated resolution as a continuous phenomenon, focus on outcomes derived from attachment theory, and systematically sample families from heterogenous cultures.

AB  - Introduction Fears of relapse in people diagnosed with schizophrenia have long been recognised as an impediment to recovery and wellbeing. However, the extent of the empirical basis for the fear of relapse concept is unclear. A systematic review is required to collate available evidence and define future research directions. Methods A pre-registered systematic search (PROSPERO CRD42020196964) of four databases (PubMED, MEDLINE-Ovid, PsycINFO-Ovid, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) was conducted from their inception to 05/04/2021. Results We found nine eligible studies. Five were quantitative (4 descriptive and 1 randomised controlled trial), and four were qualitative. The available quantitative evidence suggests that fear of relapse may have concurrent positive relationships with depression (r = 0.72) and suicide ideation (r = 0.48), and negative relationship with self-esteem (r = 0.67). Qualitative synthesis suggests that fear of relapse is a complex phenomenon with behavioural and emotional components which has both direct and indirect effects on wellbeing. Conclusions Evidence in this area is limited and research with explicit service user and carer involvement is urgently needed to develop new and/or refine existing measurement tools, and to measure wellbeing rather than psychopathology. Nonetheless, clinicians should be aware that fear of relapse exists and appears to be positively associated with depression and suicide ideation, and negatively associated with self-esteem. Fear of relapse can include fears of losing personal autonomy and/or social/occupational functioning. It appears to impact carers as well as those diagnosed with schizophrenia.

AB  - Sometimes called the "lab rat" of coral research, Stylophora pistillata (Esper, 1797) has been extensively used in coral biology in studies ranging from reef ecology to coral metabolic processes, and has been used as a model for investigations into molecular and cellular biology. Previously thought to be a common species spanning a wide distribution through the Indo-Pacific region, "S. pistillata" is in fact four genetically distinct lineages (clades) with different evolutionary histories and geographical distributions. Here, we review the studies of stress responses of S. pistillata sensu lato (clades 1-4) and highlight research trends and knowledge gaps. We identify 126 studies on stress responses including effects of temperature, acidification, eutrophication, pollutants and other local impacts. We find that most studies have focused on the effect of single stressors, especially increased temperature, and have neglected the combined effects of multiple stressors. Roughly 61% of studies on S. pistillata come from the northern Red Sea (clade 4), at the extreme limit of its current distribution; clades 2 and 3 are virtually unstudied. The overwhelming majority of studies were conducted in laboratory or mesocosm conditions, with field experiments constituting only 2% of studies. We also note that a variety of experimental designs and treatment conditions makes it difficult to draw general conclusions about the effects of particular stressors on S. pistillata. Given those knowledge gaps and limitations in the published research, we suggest a more standardized approach to compare responses across geographically disparate populations and more accurately anticipate responses to predicted future climate conditions.

AB  - Listening in noisy or complex sound environments is difficult for individuals with normal hearing and can be a debilitating impairment for those with hearing loss. Extracting meaningful information from a complex acoustic environment requires the ability to accurately encode specific sound features under highly variable listening conditions and segregate distinct sound streams from multiple overlapping sources. The auditory system employs a variety of mechanisms to achieve this auditory scene analysis. First, neurons across levels of the auditory system exhibit compensatory adaptations to their gain and dynamic range in response to prevailing sound stimulus statistics in the environment. These adaptations allow for robust representations of sound features that are to a large degree invariant to the level of background noise. Second, listeners can selectively attend to a desired sound target in an environment with multiple sound sources. This selective auditory attention is another form of sensory gain control, enhancing the representation of an attended sound source while suppressing responses to unattended sounds. This review will examine both "bottom-up" gain alterations in response to changes in environmental sound statistics as well as "top-down" mechanisms that allow for selective extraction of specific sound features in a complex auditory scene. Finally, we will discuss how hearing loss interacts with these gain control mechanisms, and the adaptive and/or maladaptive perceptual consequences of this plasticity.

AB  - We describe work in progress to conduct a systematic review of research on effects of arts-based programs for mental health in young people. We are at the stage of searching for relevant studies through major databases and screening extant systematic reviews for additional research which meet our inclusion criteria. At this stage, however, concerns have arisen regarding both the quality of existing primary studies and of recently published systematic reviews in this area of arts and health. As a case in point, in this paper we focus on one research report on art therapy with adolescent girls and its inclusion in three systematic reviews. We demonstrate that the reviews fail to undertake a robust critique of the Bazargan and Pakdaman paper and that the paper and reviews are flawed. Drawing on recent criticisms of systematic reviewing, we consider the value of proceeding with our systematic review as initially planned.

AB  - Background Social connections have been linked to the genesis and amelioration of mental health problems and thus have potential therapeutic value. Purpose To identify the current evidence base, assess risk of bias and synthesise findings on the effectiveness of social network interventions for people with mental health problems. Methods Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus) and grey literature databases were systematically searched from inception to October 2021 using free text syntax combining synonyms for 'mental health problems' and 'social network interventions'. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they reported data from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve social networks for adults (18+) with mental health problems. Papers were independently reviewed for inclusion with conflicts resolved through consensus. Included papers were quality assessed and data extracted and synthesized narratively. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Results Nine studies randomising 2226 participants were included. Four focused on those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, one on major depressive disorder and four included all types of mental health diagnoses. The current evidence base is of unclear quality. However, interventions which focused on supporting social activities appear to hold the most promise for enhancing social networks. Data on cost-effectiveness and research acceptability were limited, but suggest the potential economic feasibility of and acceptability for evaluating these interventions. Conclusion There is emerging evidence that social network interventions can be effective in improving social connections for people with mental health problems. However, further evaluations with robust methodological approaches are required to inform evidence-based recommendations for health services.

AB  - Lithium remains the gold standard maintenance treatment for Bipolar Disorder (BD). However, weight gain is a side effect of increasing relevance due to its metabolic implications. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at summarizing evidence on the use of lithium and weight change in BD. We followed the PRISMA methodology, searching Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science. From 1003 screened references, 20 studies were included in the systematic review and 9 included in the meta-analysis. In line with the studies included in the systematic review, the meta-analysis revealed that weight gain with lithium was not significant, noting a weight increase of 0.462 Kg (p = 0158). A shorter duration of treatment was significantly associated with more weight gain. Compared to placebo, there were no significant differences in weight gain. Weight gain was significantly lower with lithium than with active comparators. This work reveals a low impact of lithium on weight change, especially compared to some of the most widely used active comparators. Our results could impact clinical decisions.

AB  - Background and purpose of article Crisis Resolution Teams (CRT) for rapid assessment and short-term treatment of mental health problems have increasingly been implemented internationally over the last decades. Among the Nordic countries, the CRT model has been particularly influential in Norway, where 'Ambulante akutteam (AAT)' is a widespread psychiatric emergency service for adult patients. However, the clinical practice of these teams varies significantly. To aid further development of the service and guide future research efforts, we carried out a scoping review to provide an up-to-date overview of research available in primary studies focusing on phenomena related to CRTs in English and Scandinavian literature. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in the bibliometric databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, Scopus, and SveMed+. Included studies were thematically analyzed using a qualitative method. Results The search identified 1516 unique references, of which 129 were included in the overview. Thematic analysis showed that the studies could be assigned to: (1) Characteristics of CRTs (k = 45), which described key principles or specific interventions; (2) Implementation of CRTs (k = 54), which were descriptive about implementation in different teams, or normative about what clinical practice should include; and (3) Effect of CRTs (k = 38). Conclusions The international research literature on CRTs or equivalent teams is extensive. Many sub-themes have been studied with various research methodologies. Recent studies provide a better evidence base for how to organize services and to select therapeutic interventions, but there is still a need for more controlled studies in the field.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ) have been considered distinct categories of diseases despite their overlapping characteristics and symptomatology. We aimed to provide an indepth review elucidating the role of glutamate/Glx and white matter (WM) abnormalities in these disorders from a transdiagnostic perspective. The PubMed online database was searched for studies published between 2010 and 2021. After careful screening, 401 studies were included. The findings point to decreased levels of glutamate in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in both SZ and BD, whereas Glx is elevated in the Hippocampus in SZ and MDD. With regard to WM abnormalities, the Corpus Callosum and superior Longitudinal Fascicle were the most consistently identified brain regions showing decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) across all the reviewed disorders, except GAD. Additionally, the Uncinate Fasciculus displayed decreased FA in all disorders, except OCD. Decreased FA was also found in the inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus, Thalamic Radiation, and Corona Radiata in SZ, BD, and MDD. Decreased FA in the Fornix and Corticospinal Tract were found in BD and SZ patients. The Cingulum and Anterior Limb of Internal Capsule exhibited decreased FA in MDD and SZ patients. The results suggest a gradual increase in severity from GAD to SZ defined by the number of brain regions with WM abnormality which may be partially caused by abnormal glutamate levels. WM damage could thus be considered a potential marker of some of the main neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Objective The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of pharmacological interventions to diminish cognitive side effects of ECT. Methods Electronic databases of Pubmed, PsycInfo, Embase and Scopus were searched from inception through 1 April, 2021, using terms for ECT (e.g. electroconvulsive therapy), cognitive outcome (e.g. cogni*) and pharmacological intervention (e.g. calcium channel blocker and general terms, like protein). Original studies with humans receiving ECT were included, which applied pharmacological interventions in comparison with placebo or no additive intervention to diminish cognitive side effects. Data quality was assessed using Risk of Bias and GRADE. Random-effects models were used. PROSPERO registration number was CRD42021212773. Results Qualitative synthesis (systematic review) showed 52 studies reporting sixteen pharmacological intervention-types. Quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) included 26 studies (1387 patients) describing twelve pharmacological intervention-types. Low-quality evidence of efficacy was established for memantine (large effect size) and liothyronine (medium effect size). Very low-quality evidence shows effect of acetylcholine inhibitors, piracetam and melatonin in some cognitive domains. Evidence of no efficacy was revealed for ketamine (very low-quality), herbal preparations with anti-inflammatory properties (very low to low-quality) and opioid receptor agonists (low-quality). Conclusion Memantine and liothyronine are promising for further research and future application. Quality of evidence was low because of differences in ECT techniques, study populations and cognitive measurements. These findings provide a guide for rational choices of potential pharmacological intervention research targets to decrease the burden of cognitive side effects of ECT. Future research should be more uniform in design and attempt to clarify pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive side effects of ECT.

AB  - Background: Management actions that address local-scale stressors on coral reefs can rapidly improve water quality and reef ecosystem condition. In response to reef managers who need actionable thresholds for coastal runoff and dredging, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies that explore the effects of sediment on corals. We identified exposure levels that 'adversely' affect corals while accounting for sediment bearing (deposited vs. suspended), coral life-history stage, and species, thus providing empirically based estimates of stressor thresholds on vulnerable coral reefs.
   Methods: We searched online databases and grey literature to obtain a list of potential studies, assess their eligibility, and critically appraise them for validity and risk of bias. Data were extracted from eligible studies and grouped by sediment bearing and coral response to identify thresholds in terms of the lowest exposure levels that induced an adverse physiological and/or lethal effect. Meta-regression estimated the dose-response relationship between exposure level and the magnitude of a coral's response, with random-effects structures to estimate the proportion of variance explained by factors such as study and coral species.
   Review findings: After critical appraisal of over 15,000 records, our systematic review of corals' responses to sediment identified 86 studies to be included in meta-analyses (45 studies for deposited sediment and 42 studies for suspended sediment). The lowest sediment exposure levels that caused adverse effects in corals were well below the levels previously described as 'normal' on reefs: for deposited sediment, adverse effects occurred as low as 1 mg/cm(2)/day for larvae (limited settlement rates) and 4.9 mg/cm(2)/day for adults (tissue mortality); for suspended sediment, adverse effects occurred as low as 10 mg/L for juveniles (reduced growth rates) and 3.2 mg/L for adults (bleaching and tissue mortality). Corals take at least 10 times longer to experience tissue mortality from exposure to suspended sediment than to comparable concentrations of deposited sediment, though physiological changes manifest 10 times faster in response to suspended sediment than to deposited sediment. Threshold estimates derived from continuous response variables (magnitude of adverse effect) largely matched the lowest-observed adverse-effect levels from a summary of studies, or otherwise helped us to identify research gaps that should be addressed to better quantify the dose-response relationship between sediment exposure and coral health.
   Conclusions: We compiled a global dataset that spans three oceans, over 140 coral species, decades of research, and a range of field- and lab-based approaches. Our review and meta-analysis inform the no-observed and lowest-observed adverse-effect levels (NOAEL, LOAEL) that are used in management consultations by U.S. federal agencies. In the absence of more location- or species-specific data to inform decisions, our results provide the best available information to protect vulnerable reef-building corals from sediment stress. Based on gaps and limitations identified by our review, we make recommendations to improve future studies and recommend future synthesis to disentangle the potentially synergistic effects of multiple coral-reef stressors.

AB  - Introduction: Western nations have increasingly moved to a blended military-civilian (mil-civ) workforce for their armed forces. Much attention to the use of civilians in military organizations focuses on a macro perspective (e.g., policy, military doctrine). This article addresses the paucity of micro-level analyses of American mil-civ blended armed forces organizations and develops a theoretical model to link these findings to macro-level outcomes important to military readiness. Methods: A systematic search of sociological literature was conducted to examine several key mil-civ integration micro-level outcomes. Results of this review are situated in a theoretical model that specifies how micro-level findings link to macro-level outcomes. Results: Connections between civilian contractors' social identities and pro-military values and behaviours is present but limited. Perceived contractors' effects on military culture indicates they are believed to have numerous benefits, but also key negative effects on elements such as clarity of mission, accomplishing mission, and maintaining good order and discipline. Mil-civ social comparisons were found to decrease organizational commitment and retention among uniformed personnel but not civilians. Finally, mental health issues for deployed civilians and mil-civ differences in mental health were identified. Systematic application of a proposed theoretical model illustrates how these varied findings can be understood in a more holistic way by linking micro and macro levels of analysis. Discussion: Significant challenges are examined across key domains that have relevance for military readiness at the macro-level, but also important micro-level implications for health, safety, perceived cohesion, and satisfaction of military and civilian personnel.
   LAY SUMMARY The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan changed how civilians are integrated in military units, which has key implications for both personnel and the larger organization. Examining micro-effects is important because they reveal unintended consequences of personnel policies based on macro-level goals and assumptions. This article reviews 15 years of sociological research on micro-level outcomes across several key domains. Extant literature presents consistent findings of negative impacts of civilian integration on social comparisons, retention, cohesion, and mental health. Conversely, mixed results are found on military-civilian (mil-civ) integration on military culture and customs. This article also proposes a novel theoretical model to explain how these micro-effects affect macro-level military readiness. As such, this article provides a framework to organize extant literature and identify new research linking micro-macro levels in military organizations. It is clear mil-civ blended forces produce unintended challenges for military readiness and individual personnel. Moving forward, more research is needed to examine unintended effects based on race and gender representation in a mil-civ blended force. There is much still unknown about the micro-level effects of systematically integrating civilians - for both military and civilian personnel-but what is clear is that it produces numerous unintended challenges for military readiness and individual service members.

AB  - Background While chronic workplace stress is known to be associated with health-related outcomes like mental and cardiovascular diseases, research about day-to-day occupational stress is limited. This systematic review includes studies assessing stress exposures as work environment risk factors and stress outcomes, measured via self-perceived questionnaires and physiological stress detection. These measures needed to be assessed repeatedly or continuously via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) or similar methods carried out in real-world work environments, to be included in this review. The objective was to identify work environment risk factors causing day-to-day stress. Methods The search strategies were applied in seven databases resulting in 11833 records after deduplication, of which 41 studies were included in a qualitative synthesis. Associations were evaluated by correlational analyses. Results The most commonly measured work environment risk factor was work intensity, while stress was most often framed as an affective response. Measures from these two dimensions were also most frequently correlated with each other and most of their correlation coefficients were statistically significant, making work intensity a major risk factor for day-to-day workplace stress. Conclusions This review reveals a diversity in methodological approaches in data collection and data analysis. More studies combining self-perceived stress exposures and outcomes with physiological measures are warranted.

AB  - During the postpartum period, the paternal brain suffers extensive and complex neurobiological alterations, through the experience of father-infant interactions. Although the impact of such experience in the mother has been increasingly studied over the past years, less is known about the neurobiological correlates of fatherhood-that is, the alterations in the brain and other physiological systems associated with the experience of fatherhood. With the present study, we aimed to perform a scoping review of the available literature on the genetic, neuroendocrine, and brain correlates of fatherhood and identify the main gaps in the current knowledge. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were searched for eligible studies on paternal neuroplasticity during the postpartum period, over the past 15 years. Reference lists of relevant key studies and reviews were also hand-searched. The research team independently screened the identified studies based on the established inclusion criteria. Extracted data were analyzed using tables and descriptive synthesis. Among the 29 studies that met our inclusion criteria, the vast majority pertained to neuroendocrine correlates of fatherhood (n = 19), followed by brain activity or connectivity (n = 7), association studies of candidate genes (n = 2), and brain structure correlates (n = 1). Collectively, studies published during the past 15 years suggest the existence of significant endocrine (testosterone, oxytocin, prolactin, and cortisol levels) and neurofunctional alterations (changed activity in several brain networks related to empathy and approach motivation, emotional processing and mentalizing, emotion regulation, dorsal attention, and default mode networks) as a result of fatherhood, as well as preliminary evidence of genetic variability accounting for individual differences during the postpartum period in fathers. No studies were so far published evaluating epigenetic mechanisms associated with the paternal brain, something that was also the focus of the current review. We highlight the need for further research that examines neuroplasticity during the experience of fatherhood and that considers both the interplay between hormones and simultaneous assessment of the different biomarkers (e.g., associations between hormones and neural activity); data collection protocols and assessment times should also be refined.

AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects more than one in three women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is associated with both pregnancy and HIV, adversely affecting women in this region. This is the first systematic examination of the effects of IPV on HIV-positive (HIV+) pregnant women in SSA.
   Methods: A systematic review of the literature on HIV+ pregnant women experiencing IPV in SSA was carried out. Searches were carried out in PubMed, Web of Science and African Journals Online databases. Articles published between January 2010 and June 2020, in English, were included. Data extraction included details on study locations, study design, study participants and the study outcome variables (depression, IPV, medication adherence, postpartum unsafe sex, and HIV disclosure).
   Results: Fourteen studies (ten cross-sectional studies, four cohort studies) were included. Results indicate a high prevalence of IPV amongst pregnant women with HIV in SSA (18.0 to 63.1%). The results suggest an association between HIV-positive status and consequences of IPV during pregnancy, particularly mental health effects, such as depression symptoms and suicidal ideation. HIV-related stigma has a key role within the relationship between HIV and IPV during pregnancy. One study described that the presence of IPV reduces adherence to Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) medication. Three studies reported no association between HIV positive status or HIV status disclosure and IPV during pregnancy.
   Discussion/conclusions: The systematic review confirms interconnections between IPV and HIV seropositivity amongst pregnant women in SSA. Importantly, stigma, social isolation and poor mental health hinder help-seeking, disclosure, and treatment adherence among HIV+ pregnant women exposed to IPV in SSA. As a result, the potential of community interventions to tackle issues associated with IPV in HIV-positive pregnant women in this area should be explored in research, policy, and practice.

AB  - Background: A previous meta-analysis suggested that zinc status may be linked to depression status. However, it remains unclear whether zinc status can predict the risk of depression development, or whether the monotherapy of zinc is superior to the combination of zinc supplementation and antidepressant medications in the treatment of depression. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to clarify the impact of zinc status and supplementation on depression development and status across all available evidence.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ISI web of science were searched, up to 14 May 2020, for relevant publications. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) in observational studies, and mean and standard deviation (SD) for the change in depression score in RCTs were calculated using a random-effects model.
   Results: The meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that zinc supplementation significantly lowered depressive symptom scores of depressed patients [weighted mean difference (WMD = 4.15 point; 95% CI: 6.56, 1.75 point; P < 0.01)], and the improvement in depression status occurred only when zinc supplementation was prescribed as a monotherapy. The cohort studies showed that the highest level of zinc intake was associated with a 28% reduced risk of depression (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.82; I-2 = 13.90). Dose-response analyses revealed a significant nonlinear effect of baseline mood status on depression score.
   Conclusion: Current evidence from observational studies and RCT's supports the potential benefits zinc to reduce the risk of, and alleviate, depression. However, further trials are needed to confirm the beneficial effect of zinc as a monotherapy versus adjunctive therapies.

AB  - Objective: A combination of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psychological comorbidities can influence the natural course of IBD. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to examine whether a standard IBD medical therapy without any antipsychotic intervention has beneficial effects on depression/anxiety in IBD patients.
   Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for related literature from their inception to March 2020. The random-effects model was used to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD). A total of 16 eligible studies were included in the present meta-analysis.
   Results: Compared with baseline assessments, IBD patients with standard IBD medication had significantly reduced depression assessment scores (pooled SMD = 0.500; 95% confidence interval: 0.207, 0.793; P = 0.001). These results were obtained without any psychological interventions. Additionally, no significant differences in anxiety-related scores were detected between the baseline assessments and the end of therapy assessments (pooled SMD = 0.083; 95% confidence interval: 0.120, 0.285; P = 0.425). The meta-regression and subgroup analyses revealed that differences in assessment tools and medications might be the main source of heterogeneity.
   Conclusion: Standard IBD treatments can significantly alleviate the depressive symptoms in IBD patients. However, more studies are needed to analyze this association.

AB  - Alexithymia, a difficulty identifying and expressing emotions experienced by oneself or others, measurably harms quality of sleep. Research has observed the association between alexithymia and sleep problems; however, the cumulative effect of this association is still unknown. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to present scientific evidence regarding the relationship between alexithymia and sleep quality.
   Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, and using relevant keywords, we searched six databases: Scopus, PubMed Central, ProQuest, ISI Web of Knowledge, EMBASE, and Science Direct. We selected observational studies on the association between alexithymia and sleep. We conducted meta-analysis using a random-effect model to calculate the effect size (ES) with Fisher's z transformation.
   Eligible studies (N = 26) in 24 papers included 7546 participants from 12 countries. The entire ES for the association between alexithymia and sleep was 0.44 (95 % CI: 0.31, 0.56). Additionally, patient populations had a larger ES (ES = 0.55; 95 % CI: 0.30, 0.79) than healthy populations (ES = 0.30; 95 % CI: 0.20, 0.41).
   The results of the present systematic review and meta-analysis revealed a significant association between alexithymia and sleep problems, especially among people with any medical condition.

AB  - Mental health is especially important as women transition into parenthood. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the rapid reconfiguration of maternity services, including perinatal mental healthcare, as offered by Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Midwives, in NHS Trusts in the United Kingdom. This article represents work undertaken in rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic and aims to document the findings from March 2020 up until May 2021 in literature published on perinatal mental health through the pandemic, as well as to engage in a knowledge mapping exercise across five NHS Trusts in London. In this research, we utilised a critical review methodology which purposefully selects and synthesises materials after extensive literature searching to provide a broad and informed narrative around an issue. For our knowledge mapping exercise, we utilised an inclusive stance to gather, pool, and synthesise data from five NHS Trusts regarding the provisions and reconfigurations of their perinatal mental health services, creating a comparable and translatable snapshot in time. Our rapid, critical review highlighted two themes: 'Increased Perinatal Distress' and 'Inaccessible Services and Support'. Our knowledge mapping exercise produced four themes: 'Retention of Existing Service Provision'; 'Additional Services Provided'; 'Reconfiguration of Service Provision'; 'Additional Provision to Support StaffWellbeing'. We conclude by offering best practice guidance in order to provide shared learning to aid the transition through para-pandemic circumstances to service delivery in a post-pandemic 'new normal'.

AB  - Background: Medicine requires the brightest minds, regardless of gender. Women working in the health sciences have time and again demonstrated the value of their technical training, communication skills, emotional support, and ability to provide understandable explanations to their patients. The objective of this work was to carry out a historical review of the main female authors linked to classic sensorimotor neurorehabilitation techniques throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as female authors linked to eponymous tests or assessments, exposing their scientific trajectory and main contributions to the field of neurological rehabilitation. A literature review was conducted. The databases of Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Scopus, CINAHL Medical Science, Medline through EBSCO and PubMed were used to obtain the biographical information of each author, searches of papers were limited until August 2021 in English and Spanish languages. Seventeen female authors were identified who linked to the main rehabilitation techniques or approaches described for neurological rehabilitation and for scales or tests with an eponymous origin as an example of female contribution on neurorehabilitation. Biographical information based on the computerized search in the electronic databases showed 57 potentially relevant articles. Of those articles, 43 were subsequently excluded. Fourteen articles were used to show their contribution to neurorehabilitation. This paper demonstrates the influential role of women in the history of sensorimotor neurorehabilitation throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, linked to the methods, techniques, concepts, or approaches used in physical therapy or occupational therapy.

AB  - Background A sizeable literature highlighted that negative affectivity and craving are both known to be implicated in relapses. Objectives The present study synthetized the existing litterature to determine strength of the interaction between negative affectivity and craving for substance-related disorders including illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Methods We conducted a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines followed by a meta-analysis. Online computer databases PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched systematically and thoroughly. Jamovi 1.8.1 Current version was used to conduct meta-analysis. Results Thirty studies were included in the review, and 14 of these, including 2257 subjects, were used for meta-analysis. The raw correlation ranged from 0.17 to 0.58, which indicated weak to moderate association between negative affects and craving. In total, approximately 90% of the selection revealed a positive correlation between negative affects and craving. Alcohol and tobacco use disorders have received the most attention. Additionally, negative affectivity was often defined as a transient state rather than a stable personality trait. Conclusions In both of our meta-analyses and in the narratively reported studies, we found that negative affectivity is an important component related to craving, but individual differences in craving reactivity existed.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based technology on emotional response and symptoms in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We systematically searched major electronic databases, including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane central, up to April 14, 2021, with no data or language limits. We performed reference, related articles, and citation searches to find additional articles. We included original articles comparing and studying VR-based technology in patients with OCD against the control group. We observed that VR significantly increases in anxiety (SMD = 2.92; 95% CI 1.89-3.94, p < 0.0001; I-2 = 95%), disgust (SMD = 2.52; 95% CI 1.36-3.68, p < 0.0001; I-2 = 95%), urge to wash (SMD = 3.12; 95% CI 1.92-4.32, p < 0.0001; I-2 = 94%), checking time (SMD = 1.06; 95% CI 0.71-1.4, p < 0.0001; I-2 = 44%), number of checking behavior (SMD = 1.45; 95% CI 0.06-2.83, p = 0.04; I-2 = 93%), and uncertainty (SMD = 2.59; 95% CI 0.90-4.27, p = 0.003; I-2 = 70%) in OCD patients compared with healthy controls using a random-effect model. This meta-analysis found that this environment has a moderate enhancement in emotional response and symptoms test scores of patients with OCD. However, our findings should be generalized with caution due to the lack of standardized methods and high heterogeneity among included evidence. The appropriate mode of integrating VR-based technology for patients with OCD requires more exploration.

AB  - This study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis of the randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of attachment- and relationship-based interventions in the NICU. A systematic search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase (OVID), PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted in February 2021. Of the 32,904 studies examined, 15 were identified as relevant, and 10 RCTs were eligible for meta-analysis. Cochrane's risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the trial reporting. Interventions were categorized as (1) parent-infant interactions, (2) parent education, and/or (3) support through qualitative synthesis. The attachment- or relationship-based intervention was effective in relieving maternal traumatic stress, maternal depression, infant weight growth, and infant development. Subgroup analyses suggested that interventions significantly improved sub-domains of mothers' and children's interactive behavior. Tailored, staged interventions may contribute to better health outcomes in preterm infants and their families.

AB  - Studies in human subjects have revealed that autonomic responses provide objective and biologically relevant information about cognitive and affective states. Measures of autonomic responses can also be applied to studies of non-human primates, which are neuro-anatomically and physically similar to humans. Facial temperature and pupil size are measured remotely and can be applied to physiological experiments in primates, preferably in a head-fixed condition. However, detailed guidelines for the use of these measures in non-human primates are lacking. Here, we review the neuronal circuits and methodological considerations necessary for measuring and analyzing facial temperature and pupil size in non-human primates. Previous studies have shown that the modulation of these measures primarily reflects sympathetic reactions to cognitive and emotional processes, including alertness, attention, and mental effort, over different time scales. Integrated analyses of autonomic, behavioral, and neurophysiological data in primates are promising methods that reflect multiple dimensions of emotion and could provide tools for understanding the mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders and vulnerabilities characterized by cognitive and affective disturbances.

AB  - The Covid-19 physical distancing measures had a detrimental effect on adolescents' mental health. Adolescents worldwide alleviated the negative experiences of social distancing by spending more time on digital devices. Through a systematic literature search in eight academic databases (including Eric, Proquest Sociology, Communication & Mass Media Complete, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Pubmed, and Web of Science), the present systematic review and meta-analysis first summarized the existing evidence from 30 studies, published up to September 2021, on the link between mental health and digital media use in adolescents during Covid-19. Digital media use measures included social media, screen time, and digital media addiction. Mental health measures were grouped into conceptually similar dimensions, such as well-being, ill-being, social well-being, lifestyle habits, and Covid-19-related stress. Results showed that, although most studies reported a positive association between ill-being and social media use (r = 0.171, p = 0.011) and ill-being and media addiction (r = 0.434, p = 0.024), not all types of digital media use had adverse consequences on adolescents' mental health. In particular, one-to-one communication, self-disclosure in the context of mutual online friendship, as well as positive and funny online experiences mitigated feelings of loneliness and stress. Hence, these positive aspects of online activities should be promoted. At the same time, awareness of the detrimental effects of addictive digital media use should be raised: That would include making adolescents more aware of adverse mechanisms such as social comparison, fear of missing out, and exposure to negative contents, which were more likely to happen during social isolation and confinement due to the pandemic.

AB  - When an individual is faced with adversity, the brain and body work cooperatively to adapt to it. This adaptive process is termed psychological resilience, and recent studies have identified several neurophysiological factors ("neurophysiological resilience"), such as monoamines, oscillatory brain activity, hemodynamics, autonomic activity, stress hormones, and immune systems. Each factor is activated in an interactive manner during specific time windows after exposure to stress. Thus, the differences in psychological resilience levels among individuals can be characterized by differences in the temporal dynamics of neurophysiological resilience. In this review, after briefly introducing the frequently used approaches in this research field and the well-known factors of neurophysiological resilience, we summarize the temporal dynamics of neurophysiological resilience. This viewpoint clarifies an important time window, the more-than-one-hour scale, but the neurophysiological dy-namics during this window remain elusive. To address this issue, we propose exploring brain-wide oscillatory activities using concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) techniques.

AB  - Background: Comorbidity between diabetes mellitus and depression is highly prevalent. The risk of depression in a person with diabetes is approximately twice that of a person without this disease. Depression has a major impact on patient well-being and control of diabetes. However, despite the availability of effective and specific therapeutic interventions for the treatment of depression in people with diabetes, 50% of patients do not receive psychological treatment due to insufficient and difficult accessibility to psychological therapies in health systems. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has therefore been proposed as a useful tool for the delivery of psychological interventions, but it continues to be a field in which scientific evidence is recent and controversial. This systematic review aims to update the available information on the efficacy of psychological interventions delivered through ICTs to improve depressive symptomatology in patients with diabetes. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed following the PRISMA guidelines and using MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases to search for randomized clinical trials of eHealth treatments for patients with diabetes and comorbid depression from 1995 through 2020. In addition, studies related to follow-up appointments were identified. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) randomized clinical trials (RCTs); (b) patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes; (c) adult population over 18 years of age; (d) presence of depressive symptomatology assessed with standardized instruments; (e) treatments for depression based on established psychotherapeutic techniques and principles; (f) delivered through eHealth technologies. We did not limit severity of depressive symptomatology, delivery setting or comparison group (treatment as usual or other treatment). Two coauthors independently reviewed the publications identified for inclusion and extracted data from the included studies. A third reviewer was involved to discuss discrepancies found. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of the RCTs. No meta-analysis of the results was performed. The protocol used for this review is available in PROSPERO (Reg; CRD42020180405). Results: The initial search identified 427 relevant scientific publications. After removing duplicates and ineligible citations, a total of 201 articles were analyzed in full text. Ten articles met the criteria of this review and were included, obtaining very good scientific quality after evaluation with the PEDro scale. The main results show that the eHealth psychological intervention for depression in patients with diabetes showed beneficial effects both at the end of treatment and in the short (3 months) and long term (6 and 12 months) for the improvement of depressive symptomatology. The methodology used (type of diabetes, eHealth technology used, recruitment context, implementation and follow-up) was very heterogeneous. However, all studies were based on cognitive-behavioral tools and used standardized assessment instruments to evaluate depressive symptomatology or diagnosis of MDD. Glycemic control was assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin, but no benefits were found in improving glycemic control. Only four studies included psychoeducational content on diabetes and depression, but none used tools to improve or enhance adherence to medical prescriptions or diabetes self-care.
   Conclusions: ICT-based psychological interventions for the treatment of depression in people with diabetes appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptomatology but do not appear to provide significant results with regard to glycemic control. Nonetheless, the scientific evidence reported to date is still very limited and the methodology very diverse. In addition, no studies have implemented these systems in routine clinical practice, and no studies are available on the economic analysis of these interventions. Future research should focus on studying and including new tools to ensure improvements in diabetes outcomes and not only on psychological well-being in order to advance knowledge about these treatments. Economic evaluations should also be undertaken to analyze whether these treatment programs implemented using eHealth technologies are cost-effective

AB  - Social isolation (SI) stress results from a combination of intrinsic and environmental factors and is associated with a variety of negative developmental outcomes. Oxytocin (OXT) might play a role in the consequences of SI in the brain and periphery. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compile data about the effects of SI in the oxytocinergic system of rats and mice, and its relation to behavioral alterations. Five databases (EMBASE, PsychNet, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched in March 2021, using ("Social Isolation" AND (mouse OR rat) AND (oxytocin OR oxytocin receptor)). This review followed the PRISMA guidelines, including registration in PROSPERO, and risk of bias assessment. The twelve articles included in this review indicated that SI was associated with decreased OXTR levels, resulting in behavioral alterations like increased aggression and anxiety-like behavior, hyperactivity, and diminished social behaviors and memory. No significant effects on OXT levels were observed. Administration of synthetic OXT or its agonists partially de-creases those unwanted behaviors to similar levels of control animals.

AB  - The efficacy of psychodynamic therapy (PDT) on social anxiety disorder (SAD) is controversial among different randomized controlled trials (RCTs), so we decide to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis to study the efficacy of PDT on SAD. Relevant literatures were searched in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Clinical Trails, and Ovid Medline. Twelve RCTs including 1,213 patients were identified. The primary analysis showed that the efficacy of PDT was weaker than the active group (SMD = 0.15 [0.02, 0.28]) and stronger than the inactive group (SMD =-0.77 [-0.95,-0.58]). It suggested that there was significant difference between individual PDT and group PDT (Chi(2) = 2.84, P = 0.09), and no difference between PDT and CBT on SAD and in the dropout rate. Secondary analysis suggested that depression may be alleviated concurrently (SMD =-0.20 [-0.40, 0.00]). Meta-regression analysis revealed no linear associations between dropout rate and effect size (t = 0.79, P = 0.449), neither does the dose-response relationship between session and effect size (t =-0.01, P = 0.992). These findings demonstrated that PDT could produce significant SAD symptoms reduction and supported its application in treating SAD.

AB  - Introduction Disproportionate rates of psychiatric disorders, like substance use and posttraumatic stress disorders (SUD and PTSD), exist among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals. This review examines substance use and trauma in existing AI/AN literature and utilizes an AI/AN-specific model to culturally inform the relationship between these factors and provide recommendations for future research. Methods We searched three databases through April 2021 for peer-reviewed articles that examined substance use and trauma in AI/AN individuals. Results The search identified 289 articles and of those, 42 were eligible for inclusion, including 36 quantitative and 6 qualitative studies. Rates of lifetime trauma exposure varied from 21 to 98% and were correlated with increased rates of SUDs. A dose response of traumatic events also increased the likelihood of an SUD among reservation-based AI populations. Factors from the Indigenist Stress Coping model included cultural buffers such as traditional healing and cultural identity, which aided in recovery from SUD and trauma, and social stressors like boarding school attendance, discrimination, and historical loss. Conclusions SUD and trauma are highly correlated among AI/AN individuals though rates of PTSD are lower than might be expected suggesting resilience. However, this pattern may not be consistent across all AI/AN groups and further research is needed to better explain the existing relationship of SUD and PTSD and relevant historical and cultural factors. Further research is needed to culturally tailor, implement, and validate PTSD and SUD assessments and treatments to ameliorate these health inequities.

AB  - In the current review, peer-reviewed publications from the Web of Science and SCOPUS databases concerning the impact of exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA) on sunflower growth in stressful environments were analyzed. Nine studies reported that SA application improved sunflower growth under salinity stress by enhancing K+ uptake and depressing Na+ and Cl- in the plant, increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase in the leaves, as well as raising chlorophyll a and b, leaf turgor, and Ca2+ concentrations in the leaves and root. Seven studies reported improvement of growth under drought by improving water relations, leaf free proline, leaf glycine betaine, and total soluble sugars. Five studies showed reduction of toxic metal stress through the promotion of endogenous SA anabolism (biosynthesis), higher enzymatic activity of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase, coupled with lower activity of superoxide dismutase and guaiacol peroxidase, and accumulation of osmolytes that protect the photosynthetic pigments. Three studies showed protection of sunflower growth under chilling after seed conditioning, which decreased electrolyte leakage and stimulated dehydrogenases activity. One study found higher values of total chlorophyll, carotenoids, and water content under the effect of the herbicide fluorochloridone. Overall, SA could be used as a promising compound for increasing sunflower tolerance to abiotic stress, yet more information is required regarding the number of SA applications per growing season, the appropriate dosage, and the appropriate growth stage of sunflower for maximum yield benefit, along with the economic feasibility of the SA applications.

AB  - Objectives Family income is an important determinant of child and parental health. In Canada, cash transfer programs to families with children have existed since 1945. This systematic review aimed to examine the association between cash transfer programs to families with children and health outcomes in Canadian children (ages 0 to 18) as well as family economic outcomes. Methods We reviewed academic and grey literature published up to November 2021. Additional studies were identified through reference review. We included any study that examined children 0-18 years old and/or their parents, took place in Canada and reported Canada-specific data, and reported child, youth and/or parental health outcomes, as well as family economic outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed by two reviewers using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Synthesis Our search yielded 23 studies meeting the inclusion criteria out of 7052 identified. Eight studies in total measured child health outcomes, including birth outcomes, child overall health, and developmental and behavioural outcomes, and four directly addressed parental health, including mental health, injuries, and obesity. Most studies reported generally positive associations, though some findings were specific to certain subgroups. Some studies also examined fertility and labour force participation outcomes, which described varying effects. Conclusion Cash transfer programs to families with children in Canada are associated with better child and parental health outcomes. Additional research is needed to evaluate the mechanisms of effects, and to identify which types and levels of government transfers are most effective, and target populations, to optimize the positive effects of these benefits.

A total of 49 articles written in Persian or English, without time limitation, were gathered. Databases of Scientific Information Database, MagIran, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched during the period from February 13 to March 13, 2018. The following keywords and their possible combinations were used: Iran, student, Internet dependency, Internet addiction, and problematic Internet use. The Cochran's Q test was used to test the heterogeneity among the studies, and because heterogeneity was not significant, the random effects model was used to estimate the overall prevalence of Internet addiction. Data analysis was performed using STATA, version 12. Meta-analysis of 49 selected articles with a total sample size of 16,585 indicated that the overall prevalence of Internet addiction among Iranian students was 31.51 percent (95% confidence interval: 26.47-36.55). In addition, meta-regression analysis showed no significant relationship between Internet addiction and year of publication (p = 0.972) and sample size (p = 0.915). About one-third of Iranian students have Internet addiction. It is necessary to provide training workshops on learning about the consequences of Internet addiction and its management.

AB  - Mania, the diagnostic hallmark of bipolar disorder, is an episodic disturbance of mood, sleep, behavior, and perception. Improved understanding of the neurobiology of mania is expected to allow for novel avenues to address current challenges in its diagnosis and treatment. Previous research focusing on the impairment of functional neuronal circuits and brain networks has resulted in heterogenous findings, possibly due to a focus on bipolar disorder and its several phases, rather than on the unique context of mania. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the evidence regarding the functional neuroanatomy of mania. Our interpretation of the best available evidence is consistent with a convergent model of lateralized circuit dysfunction in mania, with hypoactivity of the ventral prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere, and hyperactivity of the amygdala, basal ganglia, and anterior cingulate cortex in the left hemisphere of the brain. Clarification of dysfunctional neuroanatomic substrates of mania may contribute not only to improve understanding of the neurobiology of bipolar disorder overall, but also highlights potential avenues for new circuit-based therapeutic approaches in the treatment of mania.

AB  - Mental health clinicians frequently study the religion and spirituality (R/S) of their patients. There is, however, a paucity of empirical research concerning R/S of patients with bipolar disorder. This lack is exacerbated by the absence of an evaluation of how these studies relate to each other. Reviews to date concern almost exclusively quantitative studies; a review that synthesizes quantitative and qualitative research is needed. The aim of this paper is to provide a synthesis of empirical studies that is useful in clinical practice. Systematic searches for relevant journal articles in SCOPUS, PubMed, and PsycInfo found 14 quantitative and four qualitative studies. The research reveals that intrinsic religiosity and positive religious coping are the dimensions of R/S that have the most positive correlations with improvement of bipolar disorder symptoms as revealed by measures of clinical outcomes. Patients struggle with their religious experiences, and they wish that R/S would be taken into account by mental health professionals. The quantitative studies are not in conflict with the patient/person-centered focus of qualitative studies. This integration of quantitative data with a patient/person-centered focus shows how belief and illness affect each other. The tensions inherent in such an integration provide new insights for research and treatment. Unfortunately, the qualitative literature has not caught up with quantitative approaches in terms of diagnostic rigor.

AB  - Background Antenatal depression is associated with intrauterine growth retardation, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Infants born to mothers with postnatal depression also may suffer from malnutrition and other health problems. Even though there are few single studies conducted so far, a systematic review of these studies is highly important to highlight the effect of antenatal and perinatal depression on adverse birth and infant health outcomes in Africa. Methods We used the Preferred Report Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) when conducting this study. Databases like CINAHL (EBSCO), MEDLINE (via Ovid and PubMed), PsycINFO, Emcare, Psychiatry Online, and Scopus were searched. In addition, Google Scholar and references from a list of eligible studies were explored. We included good quality observational studies based on Newcastle Ottawa Scale which are published in the English language between 2007 and 2018. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. Meta-analysis with a random effect model was employed to determine the pooled effect sizes with a 95% confidence interval. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018106714). Result We found three studies (1511 participants) and 11 studies (22,254 participants) conducted on the effect of antenatal depression on birth outcomes and perinatal depression on adverse infant health outcomes, respectively. The overall risk of having adverse birth outcomes was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.43, 3.58) times higher among pregnant mothers with depression. The risk of preterm birth and low birth weight was 1.77 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.04) and 2.98 (95% CI: 1.60, 5.55) respectively. Similarly, the risk of having adverse infant health outcomes namely malnutrition and febrile illness was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.34, 1.95) times higher among mothers who had perinatal depression. Conclusions We have found a significant association between antenatal depression and adverse birth outcomes, low birth weight and preterm birth. Similarly, a significant effect of perinatal depression on adverse infant health outcomes namely, malnutrition, and febrile illnesses was observed. The findings highlight that it is time to integrate mental health services with routine maternal health care services to improve birth outcomes and reduce infant morbidity.

AB  - It is well established that math anxiety has a negative relationship with math performance (MP). A few theories have provided explanations for this relationship. One of them, the Attentional Control Theory (ACT), suggests that anxiety can negatively impact the attentional control system and increase one's attention to threat-related stimuli. Within the ACT framework, the math anxiety (MA)-working memory (WM) relationship is argued to be critical for math performance. The present meta-analyses provides insights into the mechanisms of the MA-MP relation and the mediating role of WM. Through database searches with pre-determined search strings, 1,346 unique articles were identified. After excluding non-relevant studies, data from 57 studies and 150 effect sizes were used for investigating the MA-MP correlation using a random-effects model. This resulted in a mean correlation of r = -0.168. The database search of WM as a mediator for the MA-MP relation revealed 15 effects sizes leading to a descriptive rather than a generalizable statistic, with a mean indirect effect size of -0.092. Overall, the results confirm the ACT theory, WM does play a significant role in the MA-MP relationship.

AB  - The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is a critical part of the homeostatic machinery with both central and peripheral components. However, little is known about the integration of these components and their joint role in the maintenance of health and in allostatic derailments leading to somatic and/or neuropsychiatric (co) morbidity. Based on a comprehensive literature search on the ANS neuroanatomy we dissect the complex integration of the ANS: (1) First we summarize Stress and Homeostatic Equilibrium - elucidating the responsivity of the ANS to stressors; (2) Second we describe the overall process of how the ANS is involved in Adaptation and Maladaptation to Stress; (3) In the third section the ANS is hierarchically partitioned into the peripheral/spinal, brainstem, subcortical and cortical components of the nervous system. We utilize this anatomical basis to define a model of autonomic integration. (4) Finally, we deploy the model to describe human ANS involvement in (a) Hypofunctional and (b) Hyperfunctional states providing examples in the healthy state and in clinical conditions.

AB  - Stereotactic neurosurgery emerged in the mid-20th century following the development of a stereotactic frame by Spiegel and Wycis. Historically women were underrepresented in clinical and academic neurosurgery. There is still a significant deficit of female scientists in this field. This article aims to demonstrate the career and scientific work of some of the most important women who contributed to the development of stereotactic and functional neurosurgery. Exceptional women from all over the world, represented in this review, assisted the evolution of modern stereotactic and functional neurosurgery as neurosurgeons, neuropathologists, neurologists, neurophysiologists and occupational therapists. Fortunately, we could conclude that in the last two decades the number of female researchers has increased significantly.

AB  - Bariatric surgery is the branch of surgery aimed at helping a person with obesity lose weight. The implementation of surgical treatment of obesity is growing at an impressive rate. As expected, the expanding implementation of bariatric procedures has progressively revealed critical issues that were not evident when the number of obese patients treated with surgery was relatively small. One critical issue is the importance of mental health assessment and care of bariatric patients. The aim of this review is to provide readers with an up-to-date summary of the goals, methods, and clinical strategies of bariatric psychiatry. The aims can be grouped into three distinct categories. First, to ascertain that there are no psychiatric contraindications to safe bariatric surgery. Second, to diagnose and treat pre-surgery mental conditions that could predict poor weight loss. Third, to diagnose and treat post-surgery mental conditions associated with poor quality of life. Although bariatric psychiatry has gained the status of a new subspecialty within the field of mental health and psychopathology, many clinical questions remain unsolved. We need more long-term data on outcome measures such as quality of life, adherence to behavioral guidelines, risk of suicide, and post-surgery prevalence of psychological disturbances and mental disorders.

AB  - Introduction Rapid cycling bipolar disorder (RCBD) is defined as four or more affective episodes (depression, mania or hypomania) within 1 year. RCBD has a high point of prevalence (from 10% to 20% among clinical bipolar samples) and is associated with greater severity, longer illness duration, worse global functioning and higher suicidal risk, but there is no consensus on treatment option. The use of several pharmacological agents has been reported (levothyroxine, antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers). Objective The main objective of this review was to propose a critical review of the literature and to rank the pharmacological agent using a level of evidence (LEO) adapted from the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, and to illustrate it with a case report on off-label intravenous ketamine. Method We conducted a review using the MeSH terms and keywords (bipolar [Title/Abstract]) AND (rapid [Title/Abstract]) AND (cycling [Title/Abstract]) AND (treatment [Title/Abstract]). Alexis Bourla and Stephane Mouchabac screened 638 documents identified through literature search in Medline (PubMed) or by bibliographic references and 164 abstracts were then analyzed. Nonpharmacological treatments were excluded. Result Seventy articles were included in the review and divided into six categories: mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, hormonal treatments, ketamine and other pharmacological treatments. Discussion Our review highlights the heterogeneity of the pharmacological treatment of RCBD and no clear consensus can emerge.

AB  - Introduction: The majority of people who die by suicide have never seen a mental health professional or been diagnosed with a mental illness. To date, this majority group has largely been ignored, with most existing research focusing on predictors of suicide such as past suicide attempts. Identifying the characteristics of people who die by suicide without receiving services, often with a fatal first attempt, is crucial to reduce suicide rates through guiding improvements to service pathways and "just in time " interventions.Methods: In this systematic review, PsycInfo, PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for peer-reviewed articles published from 1980 to 1st March 2021. Included studies examined predictors of non-receipt of formal mental health services among people who died by suicide. Data were extracted from published reports and the quality of included studies was assessed using a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Analytical Cross Sectional Studies. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD 42021226543.Results: Sixty-seven studies met inclusion criteria, with sample sizes ranging from 39 to 193,152 individuals. Male sex, younger or older age, and rural location were consistently associated with non-receipt of mental health services. People not receiving mental health services were also less likely to have a psychiatric diagnosis, past suicidal behavior or contact with general health services, and more likely to use violent means of suicide. There was some evidence that minority ethnicity and psychosocial stressors were associated with service non-receipt.Conclusion: People who die by suicide without receiving mental health services are likely to have diverse profiles, indicating the need for multifaceted approaches to effectively support people at risk of suicide. Identifying the needs and preferences of individuals who are at risk of suicide is crucial in developing new support pathways and services, and improving the quality of existing services.

AB  - Children and adolescents could benefit from the use of predictive tools that facilitate personalized diagnoses, prognoses, and treatment selection. Such tools have not yet been deployed using traditional statistical methods, potentially due to the limitations of the paradigm and the need to leverage large amounts of digital data. This review will suggest that a machine learning approach could address these challenges and is designed to introduce new readers to the background, methods, and results in the field. A rationale is first introduced followed by an outline of fundamental elements of machine learning approaches. To provide an overview of the use of the techniques in child and adolescent literature, a scoping review of broad trends is then presented. Selected studies are also highlighted in order to draw attention to research areas that are closest to translation and studies that exhibit a high degree of experimental innovation. Limitations to the research, and machine learning approaches generally, are outlined in the penultimate section highlighting issues related to sample sizes, validation, clinical utility, and ethical challenges. Finally, future directions are discussed that could enhance the possibility of clinical implementation and address specific questions relevant to the child and adolescent psychiatry. The review gives a broad overview of the machine learning paradigm in order to highlight the benefits of a shift in perspective towards practically oriented statistical solutions that aim to improve clinical care of children and adolescents.

AB  - Background: Up to 43% of patients with anxiety disorders (ADS) use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), however, many healthcare providers receive little training on this topic. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are relied upon to guide decision-making, especially with respect to topics less familiar to healthcare providers. In the present study, we identified the quantity and assessed the quality of CAM recommendations in CPGs for the treatment and/or management of ADS.
   Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were systematically searched from 2009 to April 2020 to identify eligible CPGs. In addition, the Guidelines International Network and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health websites were also searched. Eligible CPGs containing CAM recommendations were evaluated using AGREE II.
   Results: Eleven CPGs were eligible, of which six made CAM recommendations. Average scaled domain percentages for these six CPGs from highest to lowest were as follows (% overall, % CAM): clarity and presentation (83.3%, 73.6%); scope and purpose (77.8%, 76.4%); editorial independence (69.4%, 36.8%); stakeholder involvement (55.6%, 31.9%); rigour of development (53.1%, 46.9%); and applicability (43.8%, 29.2%).
   Conclusions: A need exists to improve the quality of CAM recommendations in anxiety CPGs through insight from AGREE II and other CPG development resources.

AB  - Objective: Emerging evidence suggests that people with severe mental illness (SMI) have an increased risk of frailty. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the prevalence and correlates of frailty, as well as the efficacy of frailty interventions, in this population.Methods: We searched databases from inception to 21 September 2021 for studies that assessed or intervened for frailty in relation to an SMI diagnosis. A narrative synthesis explored the characteristics and adverse health outcomes associated with frailty and the efficacy of interventions. The prevalence of frailty was investigated, and its relationship with age was analysed by a meta-regression.Results: Twenty-five studies involving 2499 patients, primarily older adults, were included in the narrative synthesis. Frailty was associated with higher rates of physical comorbidity, cognitive deficits, falls and mortality among those with SMI. The efficacy of a yoga intervention was investigated in one study, without sustained reductions in frailty. The prevalence of frailty varied between 10.2 and 89.7% and was high in comparison to the general population.Conclusions: The prevalence of frailty was high in those with SMI and ranged widely due to heterogeneity of study populations. Assessing frailty enables the identification of patients who could benefit from interventions and assists in treatment-related decision making. Further research is required to develop appropriate frailty interventions for this population.

Subject and methods Published and unpublished literature was searched for studies reporting prevalence of depression in women with low-income in developed countries. A subsection of studies taking place during pregnancy and postpartum periods was used for analysis. Using meta and metafor packages in R, a random-effects model to account for estimation was used. Results Sixty-four studies, involving 218,035 participants, were located through the search process. Among low-income women who were pregnant or postpartum, the prevalence of depression was 33.82%. Conclusion High rates of depression among women living in low-income conditions is of serious public health concern due to generational effects, with several possible adverse biological, psychological, and social effects on children. Women's social determinants of health need to be addressed, as these contribute to both depression and recovery.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently the second most common neurodegenerative disease, being characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. The therapeutic options available for its treatment are limited, do not slow the progression of the disease, and have serious side effects. For this reason, many studies have sought to find compounds with neuroprotective properties that bring additional benefits to current therapy. In this context, resveratrol is a phenolic compound, found in many plant species, capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and having multiple biological properties. Experimental studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that it can prevent or slow the progression of a variety of diseases, including PD. In this systematic review, we summarize the effects of resveratrol in experimental in vivo and in vitro models of PD and discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in its action. The bibliographic search was performed in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, SciELO, and Google Scholar, and based on the inclusion criteria, 41 articles were selected and discussed. Most of the included studies have demonstrated neuroprotective effects of resveratrol. In general, resveratrol prevented behavioral and/or neurological disorders, improved antioxidant defenses, reduced neuroinflammatory processes, and inhibited apoptosis. In summary, this systematic review offers important scientific evidence of neuroprotective effects of resveratrol in PD and also provide valuable information about its mechanism of action that can support future clinical studies.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is now having a strong momentum in research to evaluate the neural fibers of the CNS. This technique can study white matter (WM) microstructure in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested cerebellar involvement in the pathogenesis of PD, and these cerebellum alterations can correlate with PD symptoms and stages. Using the PRISMA 2020 framework, PubMed and EMBASE were searched to retrieve relevant articles. Our search revealed 472 articles. After screening titles and abstracts, and full-text review, and implementing the inclusion criteria, 68 papers were selected for synthesis. Reviewing the selected studies revealed that the patterns of reduction in cerebellum WM integrity, assessed by fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity measures can differ symptoms and stages of PD. Cerebellar diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes in PD patients with "postural instability and gait difficulty" are significantly different from "tremor dominant" PD patients. Freezing of the gate is strongly related to cerebellar involvement depicted by DTI. The "reduced cognition," "visual disturbances," "sleep disorders," "depression," and "olfactory dysfunction" are not related to cerebellum microstructural changes on DTI, while "impulsive-compulsive behavior" can be linked to cerebellar WM alteration. Finally, higher PD stages and longer disease duration are associated with cerebellum white matter alteration depicted by DTI. Depiction of cerebellar white matter involvement in PD is feasible by DTI. There is an association with disease duration and severity and several clinical presentations with DTI findings. This clinical-imaging association may eventually improve disease management.

AB  - In the past half century, the research on emotions of foreign language learners (FLL) has shifted the focus from an exclusive analysis of negative emotions to a more holistic study of both negative emotions and positive emotions, and currently to mediators of multiple emotions. Of the FLL's negative emotions, foreign language anxiety (FLA) attracts the most attention. Researchers have widely discussed the relationship between FLA and foreign language achievement, the influencing factors of FLA, the dynamicity of FLA as well as regulation and intervention strategies of FLA. Foreign language enjoyment (FLE) is the most heavily studied research subject on FLL's positive emotions. Researchers generally focus on the influencing factors of FLE, the dynamicity of FLE and the relationship between FLE and FLA. With the implementation of holistic education, emotional intelligence (EI), a mediator of multiple emotions of FLL, has been becoming a newly hot topic in the field of FLL's emotions. By reviewing the previous studies, this paper proposes that the future research on FLL emotion needs to expand the research perspectives, enrich the research topics, and innovate the research methods.

AB  - Over the last few decades, the global prevalence of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative illnesses has risen rapidly. Although the aetiology remains unclear, evidence is mounting that exposure to persistent hydrocarbon pollutants is a substantial risk factor, predisposing a person to neurological diseases later in life. Epidemiological studies correlate environmental hydrocarbon exposure to brain disorders including neuropathies, cognitive, motor and sensory impairments; neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Particulate matter, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and endocrine-disrupting chemicals have all been linked to neurodevelopmental problems in all class of people. There is mounting evidence that supports the prevalence of petroleum hydrocarbon becoming neurotoxic and being involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. More study is needed to fully comprehend the scope of these problems in the context of unconventional oil and natural gas. This review summarises in vitro, animal and epidemiological research on the genesis of neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting evidence that supports inexorable role of hazardous hydrocarbon exposure in the pathophysiology of AD and PD. In this review, we offer a summary of the existing evidence gathered through a Medline literature search of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the most important epidemiological studies published so far.

AB  - Objective: This review aimed to measure the degree of placebo response in panic disorder. Data Sources: We searched major databases up to 31 January 2021, for randomized pharmacotherapy trials published in English. Study Selection: A total of 43 studies met inclusion criteria to be in the analysis (with 174 separate outcome measurements). Data Extraction: Changes in outcome measures from baseline in the placebo group were used to estimate modified Cohen's d effect size. Results: A total of 43 trials (2392 subjects, 174 outcomes using 27 rating scales) were included in the meta-analysis. Overall placebo effect size was 0.57 (95% confidence interval = [0.50, 0.64]), heterogeneity (I-2: 96.3%). Higher placebo effect size was observed among clinician-rated scales compared to patient reports (0.75 vs 0.35) and among general symptom and anxiety scales compared to panic symptoms and depression scales (0.92 and 0.64 vs 0.56 and 0.54, respectively). There was an upward trend in effect size over the publication period (r = 0.02, p = 0.002) that was only significant among clinician-rated scales (r = 0.02, p = 0.011). There was no significant publication bias, Egger's test (p = 0.08). Conclusion: We observed a substantial placebo effect size in panic disorder. This effect was more prominent for some aspects of panic disorder psychopathology than for others and was correlated with the source of the assessment and publication year. This finding has implications both for research design, to address the heterogeneity and diversity in placebo responses, and for clinical practice to ensure optimal quality of care.

AB  - Water management is becoming a critical issue for sustainable agriculture, especially in the semi-arid region, where problems with water scarcity are rising. More accurate water status recovery in crops is required for precise irrigation through remote sensing technologies. These technologies have a lot of potential in intelligent irrigation because they allow for real-time environmental data collection. Nowadays, digital practices have been used, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which plays an essential role in various applications related to crop management. Drones offer an exciting opportunity to track crop fields with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing to enhance water stress management in irrigation. Farmers have historically depended on soil moisture measurements and weather conditions to detect crop water status for irrigation scheduling. This review paper summarizes the use of UAV remote sensing data in crops for estimating the water status and gives a detailed summary of the potential capacity of UAV remote sensing for water stress application. The remote sensing techniques help modify agricultural practices to meet this significant challenge by providing repeated information on crop status at different scales and various performances during the season. UAVs successful implementation in water stress estimations depends on UAV features, such as flexibility of use in flight planning, low cost, reliability, autonomy, and capability of timely provision of high-resolution data. UAV with a thermal sensor is considered the most effective technique for detecting water stress using specific indices. Thermal imaging can identify water status variations and crop water stress index (CWSI). This CWSI acquired through UAV thermal sensors imagery can be acceptable for managing real-time irrigation to achieve optimum crop water efficiency.

AB  - Objectives People with severe mental illnesses (SMI: schizophrenia, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder) have a high risk of being infected by viruses and suffer a more severe infection illness course than the general population. The aim of this literature review was to elucidate rates as well as immunogenicity and side effects of vaccinations in SMI. Methods All studies in the English or German language, which investigated either prevalence rates or effects of vaccinations in the target groups, were systematically searched in the databank PubMed by three independent authors using the PRISMA guidelines and discussed in more detail. Results The search found 24 studies reporting epidemiological data and 16 investigating immunogenicity of vaccinations. The results on prevalence rates, antibody production, inflammation response and side effects were inconsistent. About interactions with psychotropic medication, only two studies on clozapine were found. Conclusions Only a few trials with heterogeneous samples have investigated prevalence and effects of vaccinations in SMI. Sex, age and other factors such as somatic comorbidities and special vaccination programmes have not been considered continuously and may influence rates as well. As individuals with SMI might be at special risk, further research on the willingness to be vaccinated as well as efficacy of vaccinations is needed.

AB  - This review aimed to identify and assess existing evidence of the impact of sport and physical activity programs on mental health and social and emotional wellbeing outcomes within young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The review also aimed to highlight limitations of current practice within the research area. A systematic search of literature was undertaken on three peer-reviewed databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE and SPORTSDiscus) and grey literature from January to March 2021. Studies were included if they described a sport and physical activity program for young (10-24 years) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and reported mental health or social and emotional wellbeing outcomes. Seventeen studies were selected for this review. Within these studies, the most commonly reported outcomes were related to psychosocial development (N = 12) and a sense of connectedness (N = 12). Mental illness related outcomes (N = 1) were rarely reported, as were substance use (N = 2) and social and emotional literacy (N = 1). Promising outcomes included increased connection to culture, self-esteem and confidence. Nonetheless, due to indirectness and suboptimal study design the precise impact on these outcomes could not be determined. A relevant evidence base is emerging on the impact sport and physical activity programs have on the mental health and social and emotional wellbeing of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However, further research that utilises robust, culturally appropriate methodologies and tools needs to be undertaken before the effects of sport and physical activity programs can reliably be discerned.

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and EMBASE+EMBASE CLASSIC were searched for relevant work on SCCs in psychiatric classifications (ADHD, autism, mood disorders, schizophrenia) in two phases: 1 identify instruments, 2 relevant studies. 35 studies with varying study quality were included. SCCs are most commonly studied in ADHD and mood disorders, but are found in all psychiatric classifications. SCCs show inconsistent and low associations to objective cognition across disorders, but higher and consistent relations are found with behavioral outcomes.
   SCCs are not qualitatively different for ADHD compared to other psychiatric classifications, and should thus not be seen as analogous to well validated measures of objective cognition. However, SCCs do reflect suffering, behavioral difficulties and problems experienced by across those with psychiatric problems in daily life.

AB  - Night eating syndrome (NES) is currently classified as an Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) under the Diagnostic Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5). This systematic review aims to consolidate the studies that describe the sociodemographic, clinical and psychological features of NES in a population of patients with eating disorders (ED), obesity, or those undergoing bariatric surgery, and were published after the publication of the DSM-5. A further aim was to compare, where possible, NES with BED on the aforementioned variables. Lastly, we aimed to appraise the quality of the studies being included in the review. We conducted a systematic search on three databases (MEDLINE, PubMed and Embase) which resulted in the selection of 22 studies for the review. We included the articles that studied patients with NES and their sociodemographic, clinical and psychological features in a clinical (i.e., ED, obese or bariatric surgery) population, through a quantitative study design. Articles were excluded if the NES patients included in the study had a comorbid psychological disorder, and/or the sample was collected from a university/non-clinical population, and/or the study design was qualitative, and/or NES features were compared with any other disorder, except BED. Our study found that no conclusions about the link between any sociodemographic feature (such as, age, gender, income, etc.) and an NES diagnosis could be made. Further, NES patients presented with elevated ED pathology (including emotional eating and loss of control eating) and higher occurrence of depressive symptoms than controls. Contrary to the literature suggesting that NES and Binge Eating Disorder (BED; an ED subtype which is also comorbid with obesity) patients often report overlapping features, questioning the validity of NES as an ED diagnosis, we found that BED can be differentiated from NES by the higher occurrence of emotional eating, body related concerns and abnormal eating episodes. The review also suggested an overlap between NES and Sleep-Related Eating Disorder. We recommend that it is essential to study NES as an independent disorder to further develop its diagnostic criteria and treatment options, thereby, increasing the quality of life of the patients suffering from this syndrome.

AB  - Neuropathic pain and chronic pain constitute an interdisciplinary problem on the border of medicine, psychology, sociology and economics. While it seems to be underestimated, the scale of this problem will continue to increase due to the population aging and the growing incidence of lifestyle disorders. People employed in various occupational sectors may also wrestle with these disease units, which affect the quality of their life, mental health and work productivity. A narrative review provided an overview of neuropathic pain and chronic pain, and their relationship to such fac-tors as job type, work absenteeism and productivity decline, as well mental well-being. A systematic literature search was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to identify appropriate literature by searching the elec-tronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Pain Journal and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Studies were published in Polish, English and French. Research shows an increasing number of musculoskeletal diseases in professionally active people, which lead to disability or provoke work absences. However, sickness presenteeism and/or absenteeism caused by pain not only leads to economic burdens, but also to burnout, fatigue and depression syndromes in employees. These disorders may require specialized effective interventions to support the return to work or maintaining employment despite experiencing pain. Every patient with chronic or neuropathic pain should be correctly assessed to determine the best method of treatment and its effectiveness. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2022;35(3)

AB  - Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is the leading cause of women's homelessness. However, what works best to respond to the needs of women experiencing IPV and homelessness remains unclear. We aimed to systematically review the effects of housing interventions on the physical, psychosocial, and economic wellbeing of women experiencing IPV. Methods In this systematic review, we searched 15 electronic databases and conducted an extensive grey literature and hand reference search between Jan 29, 2020, and May 31, 2021. We included controlled quantitative studies of housing interventions (from emergency shelter to permanent supportive housing) that were reported in English, without time restrictions, and examined any physical, psychosocial, or economic outcomes among women experiencing IPV. We critically appraised included studies using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care criteria and extracted data using a piloted extraction form. We synthesised our results using harvest plots to summarise whether the weight of the evidence suggested benefits, disadvantages, or null effects; patterns by study quality; and evidence gaps. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020176705. Findings We screened 23 902 unique records and identified 34 eligible studies with quantitative data on the outcomes of housing interventions among women experiencing IPV. Most studies evaluated the outcomes of either shelter interventions (18 studies [53%]) or shelter plus some other programming (eight [24%]). The remaining eight studies evaluated longer-term housing solutions, including supportive housing (five studies [15%]), critical time interventions (one [3%]), transitional housing (one [3%]), and stay-at-home models (one [3%]). There was no cumulative evidence of disadvantages following any IPV-housing intervention. Evidence of benefits was strongest for mental health outcomes, intent to leave partner, perceived safety, and housing and partner-related stress. Included studies were at high risk of bias across most domains (eg, confounding). Interpretation There is promising evidence on the continuum of IPV-housing services for women, especially in terms of proximal outcomes, such as mental health, intent to leave partner, safety, and housing stress. However, more research of higher quality is needed, particularly on long-term housing solutions and from outside of the USA.

AB  - Background: Exercise interventions are increasingly incorporated in the management of severe mental illness; however, best practice screening and outcome monitoring for this unique population are yet to be established. This review aims to explore assessment measures reported in publications of exercise interventions in severe mental illness.
   Methods: A scoping review was implemented with a structured search of Embase, PubMed, Medline, PsychINFO, Scopus, and SportDiscus using terms related to severe mental illness, exercise, and health. Studies were included if they incorporated an exercise intervention for people with severe mental illness and measured physical and/or mental health outcomes. Studies were analysed for population, assessment measures, and methodological quality.
   Results: 1832 studies were identified and following screening and full text review 38 studies involving 2854 participants were included for analysis, primarily psychotic (n = 13), depressive disorder (n = 9) and mixed severe mental illness populations (n = 13). The most frequently reported health domains and assessment measures used included body composition (weight and body mass index), symptom severity, cardiorespiratory fitness (volume of oxygen consumption), cardiometabolic health (blood pressure and metabolic blood sampling), and quality of life. Methodological quality varied with 13 determined as good, 12 fair, and 13 poor.
   Conclusion: The review identified domains and assessment tools frequently reported in the exercise and severe mental illness literature. However, given the heterogeneity and scarcity of the research, along with lack of reporting of sufficient detail, best-practice clinical recommendations are still limited. There remains a need to establish best practice assessment and monitoring procedures within exercise interventions in severe mental illness.

AB  - Objectives: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes. Low vitamin D levels are more common among people who experience mental health issues. This is particularly vital due to the outdoor restrictions which arose from the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review assessed vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among psychiatric inpatients. Methods: A literature search was performed using the key words 'vitamin D', 'mental health', 'mental illness' and 'inpatient' and articles were selected by two independent reviewers. Eighteen studies were identified as eligible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Vitamin D deficiency (29 - 96%) and insufficiency (20 - 63%) were common among psychiatric inpatients. Over half of the studies recommended or advised consideration of vitamin D level screening among psychiatric inpatients, while nine recommended consideration of vitamin D supplementation. Conclusions: Screening for vitamin D deficiency during psychiatric admission may be clinically indicated and improve patient wellbeing and outcomes.

AB  - Khat is an evergreen plant and its fresh green leaves and buds are chewed for several hours a day for its psychostimulant response. This study aimed to review the effects of khat chewing on the body. PubMed was searched for literature on the different aspects of khat chewing to summarize its effects on different body systems. The major effects of khat chewing are those on the cardiovascular system including increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and increased risk of myocardial infarction. It causes insomnia, stress, depression, hallucination, and increased risk of brain stroke. It causes dental caries, bad oral hygiene, periodontitis, increased oral mucosal ulcers, and increased gingival bleeding and recession. Khat chewing causes loss of appetite, gastritis, constipation, and hemorrhoids, and increased risk of hepatotoxicity and liver cirrhosis. Ultimately, it causes weak micturition, decreased sperm motility and count, and low birth-weight offspring in khat chewing mothers. The published articles about khat chewing in journals indexed in the PubMed was reviewed. Inclusion criteria involved each article available with English language and have a reported new effect of khat chewing.

AB  - Objective: To examine personality/temperament features and mental health vulnerability in offspring of mothers with bipolar disorders (BD), including dimensions which may impact psychological characteristics or therapeutic measures. Methods: A systematic review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, was conducted to search for original articles that investigated personality/temperament features of offspring of women with BD and emotional factors involved in the mother-child relationship. The electronic search was performed in the PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases from February 2010 to February 2017. Results: Ten quantitative studies were included in the analysis: seven from the United States, two from Brazil, and one from Canada. The narrative synthesis was categorized into three dimensions: 1) reliability of instruments for prediction of future psychopathology in offspring; 2) environmental risk factors for offspring; and 3) early interventions. The findings showed impairments in the offspring's lives, high rates of behavior and temperament problems, and psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: BD is a frequent psychiatric disorder, and the offspring of mothers with this condition are exposed to complex family relationships and psychosocial difficulties. If they are to ensure a good provision of mental health and psychosocial care to this unique population, early interventions must not neglect their contextual specificities.

AB  - Background: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of the third wave therapies that came as a response to certain limitations of cognitive-behavioral therapies and other existent psychotherapeutic models, which emphasizes changing the context of cognition rather than the content. ACT has a fast-growing evidence base, and its literature among the adolescent population is in its infancy. Objective: The authors attempted to consolidate findings of ACT's effectiveness for clinical problems among the adolescent population. Methods: Electronic databases of PubMed, PsycArticles, PsycINFO, Sage, and ProQuest were searched for published studies and unpublished doctoral dissertations until April 2021. After adopting a two-staged screening process, 19 studies were selected, which included randomized controlled trials, case reports, and other quasi-experimental studies reporting results from ACT or ACT-based intervention given to a population of adolescents for any clinical conditions or concern. The authors present a narrative systematic review of these 19 studies, including a methodological assessment. Results: Results showed ACT to be effective in reducing objectively measured clinical symptoms and interference caused by them. Subjective accounts by adolescents and caregivers also corroborated that. More rigorous RCTs and comparisons with other active treatments are needed to improve the evidence base as such studies were few and had some methodological flaws. The authors also discuss certain limitations in assessing the effectiveness of ACT in such studies. Conclusion: The ACT model could serve as a promising alternative approach to be used with adolescents across many concerns, with an emphasis on improving the quality of life and their engagement with valued goals.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review summarizes the impact of sleep disturbances on AD patients and their caregivers and the effects of currently available sleep therapies.
   Methods: Published studies (January 1985-March 2020) assessing the burden associated with insomnia/sleep disturbances in the AD population and insomnia treatment effects were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library and screened against inclusion criteria.
   Findings: This review included 58 studies which assessed patient and caregiver burden, institutionalization, and insomnia treatments in AD patients with sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances were associated with worse cognition, functional ability, and behavioral and neuropsychological functioning, including increased depression and anxiety. Health status and quality of life of both patients and caregivers were reduced in the presence of sleep disturbances, with caregiver burden driven largely by disruptive nocturnal behaviors including nighttime awakenings and wanderings. Sleep disturbances were also associated with institutionalization. Although significant associations between sleep problems and clinical outcomes were apparent, there was generally no control for other influencing factors (e.g. cognitive status). With respect to insomnia treatments, bright light, and behavioral therapies as well as drugs such as trazodone, risperidone and suvorexant showed some promise in AD patients, but studies were primarily small and limited data were available, particularly in regard to insomnia treatment effects on associated clinical burden.
   Interpretation: Sleep disturbances are a significant problem for AD patients and caregivers. They are associated with behavioral and psychological problems and cognitive decline and impose a burden on caregivers, but remain poorly characterized and under-researched. As the global population is aging and AD is on the rise, data from larger, prospective trials are required to fully understand the clinical correlates of sleep disturbances and the impact of insomnia treatments on AD patients and their caregivers.

AB  - Background: Human neurodegenerative diseases occur as a result of various factors. Regardless of the variety in the etiology of development, many of these diseases are characterized by the accumulation of pathological, misfolded proteins; hence, such diseases are considered as proteinopathies. While plenty of research study has been conducted in order to identify the pathophysiology of these proteinopathies, there is still a lack of understanding in terms of potential therapeutic targets. Molecular chaperones present the main workforce for cellular protection and stress response. Therefore, considering these functions, molecular chaperones present a promising target for research within the field of conformational diseases that arise from proteinopathies. Since the association between neurodegenerative disorders and their long-term consequences is well documented, the need for the development of new therapeutic strategies becomes even more critical Key message: In this review, we summarized the molecular function of heat shock proteins and recent progress on their role, involvement, and other mechanisms related to neurodegeneration caused by different etiological factors. Based on the relevant scientific data, we will highlight the functional classification of heat shock proteins, regulation, and their therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Hispanic Latino farmworkers have been widely recognized as a particularly vulnerable population in the U.S., with among the lowest levels of income and education in the country. Existing research has identified and explored factors, including cultural and demographic characteristics, that increase the vulnerability of these workers to adverse occupational health and safety outcomes. This review assesses Hispanic/Latino farmworkers' vulnerability to increasing temperatures and intense heat events, focusing on the role of demographic and cultural factors in heat-related health outcomes. A systematic literature search was conducted using the search terms "heat" and "(Hispanic or Latino) farmworkers" and "health" over the years 2000 to 2020. A total of 348 articles were screened through a title review. The articles included in this review focused on heat-related illnesses (HRIs) and related symptoms among the population of interest. Hispanic/Latino workers were at heightened risk of HRI symptoms as a result of their work environments, working conditions, acculturative stressors, and other cultural factors.

AB  - Background: Depressive disorders are recognized as a common neuropsychiatric disorder of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reported frequencies vary widely among studies and depend on the diagnostic criteria, the methods of ascertainment used, and the population sampled.
   Objective: We aimed to evaluate the frequency of depressive disorders in PD and to investigate the relationship with PD clinical variables.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies (community-based, prospective and retrospective cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies) reporting the frequency of depressive disorders in PD patients.
   Results: Electronic database search wielded 3,536 articles; an additional 91 were identified through citation chaining. 163 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 49 met the inclusion criteria for our analysis. The pooled frequency of depressive disorders was 30.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.6 to 36.2; I-2 = 95%; 49 studies; combined n = 10,039). The pooled frequency of major depressive disorder was 14.0% (95% CI 10.5 to 18.5; I-2 = 88%; 23 studies; combined n = 5,218). Subgroup/meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between frequency and study inclusion criteria, methodology used for diagnosis, and study design. We found a statistically significant correlation between study design and depressive disorders frequency (ranging from 8% in the community-based study to 44% in the retrospective studies) and a statistically significant positive correlation between mean baseline PD duration and major depressive disorder frequency.
   Conclusion: The current meta-analysis found a global frequency of depressive disorders of 30.7% and major depressive disorder of 14.0%. Study design influenced the frequency of depressive disorders in PD. Mean baseline PD duration and major depressive disorder frequency were positively correlated.

AB  - Background: The relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is unclear.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate whether PD and CAD are associated through systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.
   Methods: Electronic database search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for observational studies published from 1 January 2010 to 1 August 2021 was conducted using terms related to PD and CAD. Unadjusted risk ratios (RR) and odds ratios (OR) of included cohort and case-control studies respectively were used to ascertain the association between PD and CAD. Study heterogeneity was evaluated using the I-2 test.
   Results: Forty-one full-text studies were initially retrieved for eligibility assessment. Five studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria, consisting of three cohort and two case-control studies, were eventually included in this meta-analysis. The five studies enrolled 35,237 PD patients and 650,866 non-PD patients. PD and CAD were found to be significantly associated in cohort studies (RR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.08-4.59, p = 0.03; Fig. 2), which held after sensitivity analysis (RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.31-1.60, p < 0.001; Fig. 3). Case-control studies found a trend towards association of PD and CAD approaching significance (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.84-2.56, p = 0.18; Fig. 2).
   Conclusion: Overall, this meta-analysis suggests that PD is associated with CAD. The underlying mechanisms, as well as the role of ethnicity and other comorbidities on the relationship between PD and CAD should be further explored.

AB  - Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction, associated with the presence of restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Cannabis has been used to alleviate symptoms associated with ASD.
   Method: We carried out a systematic review of studies that investigated the clinical effects of cannabis and cannabinoid use on ASD, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA checklist). The search was carried out in four databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Scopus, and Web of Science. No limits were established for language during the selection process. Nine studies were selected and analyzed.
   Results: Some studies showed that cannabis products reduced the number and/or intensity of different symptoms, including hyperactivity, attacks of self-mutilation and anger, sleep problems, anxiety, restlessness, psychomotor agitation, irritability, aggressiveness perseverance, and depression. Moreover, they found an improvement in cognition, sensory sensitivity, attention, social interaction, and language. The most common adverse effects were sleep disorders, restlessness, nervousness and change in appetite.
   Conclusion: Cannabis and cannabinoids may have promising effects in the treatment of symptoms related to ASD, and can be used as a therapeutic alternative in the relief of those symptoms. However, randomized, blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials are necessary to clarify findings on the effects of cannabis and its cannabinoids in individuals with ASD.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental illness that affects one percent of the population, affecting how people think, feel, and behave. Evidence suggests glial cell alteration and some researchers have found genetic risk loci and epigenetic marks that may regulate glia-related genes implicated in SCZ.
   Aim: The aim of this study is to identify genetic and epigenetic changes that have been reported in glial cells or glial-associated genes in SCZ.
   Materials and Methods: We searched the articles from PubMed, PubMed Central, Medline, Medscape, and Embase databases up to December 2020 to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles in English. The titles and abstracts were screened to eliminate irrelevant citations.
   Results: Twenty-four original articles were included in the review. Studies were categorized into the following four thematic via: (1) oligodendrocytes, (2) microglia, (3) astrocytes, and (4) perspectives.
   Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to review research on genetic variants and epigenetic modifications associated with glia-related genes implicated in SCZ. Epigenetic evidence is considerably less than genetic evidence in this field. Understanding the pathways of some risk genes and their genetic and epigenetic regulation allows us to understand and find potential targets for future interventions in this mental illness.

AB  - Although negative early life experiences are associated with an increased risk of developing psychopathology, some individuals exposed to childhood adversity demonstrate psychological resilience. Little is known about the neural correlates of resilience, especially in young people. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of neuroimaging studies of resilience in youth. The PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases were searched; 5,482 studies were identified. Following title/abstract screening, and full reading of the remaining articles, 22 studies based on 19 unique datasets were included. We found preliminary evidence that resilience is associated with structural, functional, and connectivity differences in young people, as assessed using structural and functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging methods. Despite heterogeneity in definitions/ assessment of resilience and a limited number of studies, the neuroimaging literature suggests some convergence across modalities regarding brain regions linked to resilience (especially the prefrontal cortex). Future studies would benefit from adopting longitudinal designs, broader conceptualisations of resilience that capture the impact of adversity exposure, and a dimensional approach to psychopathology.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) affect millions worldwide and both cause significant morbidity and mortality. While clinically distinctive, patients with MDD can present with memory dysfunction and patients with AD commonly report symptoms of depression. Additionally, brain pathology in MDD and AD both demonstrate decreased hippocampal volumes, and severe disease is associated with smaller hippocampal volumes in both disorders. Hippocampal neurogenesis occurs daily in healthy individuals, an impaired process in AD and MDD. MDD is thus suggested to be a risk factor for developing AD later in life; moreover, depression onset alongside AD indicates a worse prognosis. Treatment options that target hippocampal neurogenesis are being evaluated for both diseases, and aerobic exercise has shown promising results. We searched PubMed for relevant review articles published since 2000 encompassing the topics of hippocampal neurogenesis and exercise in relation to depression and AD, including novel clinical trials if they contributed information not in the chosen reviews. While much data indicates that exercise increases hippocampal neurogenesis in both MDD and AD, mood improvement in MDD, mild quality of life and cognitive improvement in AD, and reduced risk of those with MDD developing AD in response to various exercise regimens, this result was not universal. Some data indicated no difference between exercise groups and controls. Further randomized control trials into exercise as an intervention in treating MDD and preventing AD is required. However, exercise is a low-risk, affordable treatment option and is a feasible additive therapy in patients with AD and MDD.

AB  - Background: Previous reviews indicated positive effects of resistance training (RT) on motor outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, inconsistencies between the included studies exist, and non-motor outcomes have only scarcely been considered in a review on RT in PD.
   Objective: To analyze the RT effects on motor- and non-motor outcomes in PD patients compared to passive and physically active control groups (i.e., other structured physical interventions).
   Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials of RT in PD. After identifying 18 studies, a meta-analysis was conducted for the outcomes muscle strength, motor impairment, freezing of gait (FoG), mobility and balance, quality of life (QoL), depression, cognition, and adverse events. Meta-analyses with random models were calculated using mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: When comparing RT with passive control groups, the meta-analyses showed significant large effects on muscle strength (SMD = -0.84, 95% CI -1.29--0.39, p = 0.0003), motor impairment (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI -1.34--0.27, p = 0.003), mobility and balance (MD = -1.81, 95% CI -3.13-0.49, p = 0.007), and small significant effects on QoL (SMD = -0.48, 95% CI -0.86-0.10, p = 0.01). RT compared with physically active control groups reached no significant results for any outcome.
   Conclusion: RT improves muscle strength, motor impairment, mobility and balance, QoL, and depression in PD patients. However, it is not superior to other physically active interventions. Therefore, exercise is important for PD patients but according to this analysis, its type is of secondary interest.

AB  - Background: There has been much speculation about untoward effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on psychological symptoms. OCD may be expected to be especially impacted. Our aim was to distil the current evidence base on relationships between the pandemic and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, in patients, and general population samples. Methods: We conducted a rapid scoping review, in the form of a systematic literature search, coupled with narrative review. 32 relevant papers were identified. Results and interpretation: (1) A sizable proportion of people with OCD (but not all) experienced/reported symptom worsening during the pandemic, especially during initial restrictions (approximately 20-65 % of cases in longitudinal studies); (2) contamination/washing symptoms appeared particularly susceptible; and (3) OCD symptoms in general population samples were associated with trait compulsivity and pandemic-related-stress. The literature was heterogeneous with various methodological issues being commonplace. Future directions: The review identified important unaddressed issues: how should exposure based therapy be adapted during pandemics? How can we minimise harm from exacerbation of OCD in vulnerable individuals arising from public health messaging? Why do some but not all OCD patients experience worsening? And does Covid-19 infection affect (or lead to) OCD symptoms?

AB  - Virtual client applications created with technology are seen to have been used in recent years in various health disciplines as an alternative to traditional practice and training methods. Even more recently, they have become a topic in the field of mental health. This study aims to systematically examine the empirical studies in the literature to get a clearer picture of the virtual client applications that are specific to the mental health field but have yet to become widespread. To broaden the scope of the search, the Web of Science and Scopus databases were scanned according to the search terms created using the relevant keywords. The study has systematically reviewed 16 empirical studies on virtual simulations in the field of psychology and psychiatry education in line with the inclusion criteria. The findings have been evaluated within the scope of the scientific studies' aims, the characteristics of the virtual applications used in these studies, the measurement tools used for evaluating the studies, and finally the results from these studies. As a result of the findings from this review, virtual client applications were seen to have been developed with various designs and technical features. When examining the measurement methods used according to the aims of the studies, the methods were found to differ from one another. When considering the findings from these studies, studies measuring users' experiences with virtual client applications indicated the participants to have predominantly evaluated the virtual client applications positively. In addition, these studies indicated the virtual client applications to have improved various aspects of the participants, such as their psychopathological assessment skills, empathic communication skills, and interviewer self -efficacies. However, some problems were experienced during the applications, and feedback was found on how to improve the applications. In this context, the use of virtual client applications as a safe and supportive tool for gaining experience in psychological interview training can be concluded as promising. Still, when considering the limitations of the current studies, more experimental studies are needed that take different methods into account in terms of both virtual client design and research design in order to be able to use technology for psychological interview training more effectively and successfully and for understanding the effectiveness of the proposed applications more comprehensively.

AB  - Why has computational psychiatry yet to influence routine clinical practice? One reason may be that it has neglected context and temporal dynamics in the models of certain mental health problems. We develop three heuristics for estimating whether time and context are important to a mental health problem: Is it characterized by a core neurobiological mechanism? Does it follow a straightforward natural trajectory? And is intentional mental content peripheral to the problem? For many problems the answers are no, suggesting that modeling time and context is critical. We review computational psychiatry advances toward this end, including modeling state variation, using domain-specific stimuli, and interpreting differences in context. We discuss complementary network and complex systems approaches. Novel methods and unification with adjacent fields may inspire a new generation of computational psychiatry.

AB  - Background: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) carry higher risks of cognitive consequences and psychological burden. An optimal anticoagulant therapy would be expected to better preserve neuropsychological function in addition to effective prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism.
   Objective: The aim of this review is to explore the effects of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, on cognitive and psychological function as well as dementia pathogenesis.
   Methods: We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed/Medline for all types of relevant articles using a combination of dabigatran and associated keywords updated to August 31, 2021. All titles and abstracts were screened for eligibility, and potentially relevant papers were collected for inclusion.
   Results: The pooled results demonstrated neutral to positive impacts of dabigatran on cognitive and psychological outcomes, including laboratory results in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, and reduced incidences of anxiety/depression and dementia for AF patients. Dabigatran also exhibited better therapeutic profiles than warfarin in preclinical and observational research.
   Conclusion: Given limited strength of evidence from heterogeneous studies, our review proposed modest beneficial effects of dabigatran on neuropsychological function. Further clinical trials are warranted to affirm the pleiotropic protective effects of NOACs on dementia treatment.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present the possible role of the endocannabinoid system in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyo- trophic lateral sclerosis. The endocannabinoid system includes the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, as well as endogenous cannabinoids and enzymes regulat- ing the synthesis and biodegradation of endocannabi- noids. Endocannabinoids are arachidonic acid deriva- tives conjugated with ethanolamine or glycerol. The most important of them are arachidonylethanolamide, also known by the name anandamide, and 2-arachido- nylglycerol. The most important cannabinoids are tet- rahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol. The endocannabi- noid system plays an important role in the mechanisms of learning and memory, emotion, behavior, pain per- ception, and neuroprotection. The activity of the CB1 receptor plays an important role in memory processes. CB1 receptor agonists disrupt memory processes, while CB1 receptor antagonists reverse these deficits or act as memory enhancers. In neurodegenerative diseases, mi- croglia is activated. When activated, microglia signifi- cantly increases endocannabinoid synthesis and expres- sion of CB2 receptors. Their expression has a protective effect by increasing the production of neuroprotective factors and reducing the production of pro-inflammato- ry factors. Endocannabinoids reduce the activity of the stress axis - hypothalamus-pituitary -adrenal - and reg- ulate the stress response by influencing the noradren- ergic pathways. The endocannabinoid system mod- ulates the phenomena associated with neurodegen- eration. This is due to the effects dependent on CB1 receptors' activation, causing normalization of gluta- matergic transmission and increasing autophagy, and activation of CB2 receptors, resulting in weakening of inflammatory features, and reduction of oxidative stress - independent of cannabinoid receptors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with cancer experience challenges when they return to work (RTW) following cancer diagnosis and treatment. Psycho-educational support is important to facilitate the RTW process.
   OBJECTIVE: This scoping review examined published reports on psycho-educational support for patients with cancer who RTW.
   METHODS: We followed the preferred reported items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement and the framework of Arksey and O'Malley. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database, PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and ICHUSHI and performed manual searches.
   RESULTS: We retrieved 1,586 articles and retained 48 for analysis (published January 2000 to December 2020). Physicians, occupational physicians, nurses, social workers, and psychologists provide considerable support in hospitals. Delivery modes included individual, face-to-face, and workbook. Psychological support included emotional, stress coping, counseling, and knowledge. Educational support included information or advice provision, communication skills, problem discussion, and work planning. Employment status was typically the primary outcome. We included 50 measurement scales across quality of life, cognitive functioning and illness, self-efficacy, psychological distress, and fatigue.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review elucidated psycho-educational support for patients with cancer who RTW, and measurement tools for related effects. Based on the characteristics of the psycho-educational support revealed in this study, future studies should examine the development, intervention, and implementation of support programs for patients' RTW.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, with its rapid contagion and deadly effect, emerged in China and surrounded the whole world. This pandemic, unlike other pandemics has emerged in the global age. Due to the disappearance of borders as a result of globalization, both the physiological and psychological spread of the virus has been rapid. The transmission of the Covid-19 virus through contact and droplets has provided its physiological spread, while digital media channels have provided its psychological spread. The negativities experienced in health, economy, politics and cultural structures have shaken the societies in the context of political-psychology. Anxiety and fear caused by the pandemic have negatively affected the psychology of individuals and therefore the whole society. In this study, the effects of the COVID-19 process on Turkey and how Turkey responded to the pandemic were tried to be evaluated in the context of political psychology. By examining the researches published in the process, the improvements made in the field of health against the pandemic, the regulations covering the whole society and the measures to overcome the process with the least damage were mentioned. It has been concluded that, as a result of the negative factors that directly affect mental health such as compulsory social isolation, losses, death anxiety brought by the pandemic, as well as processes such as unemployment and bankruptcy caused by inadequate socio-economic policies, a pandemic of mental disorders may occur in future.

AB  - Information and communication technology are promising channels in delivering the mindful-ness-based intervention. A common problem in these interventions is the lack of study of treat-ment adherence. The current article summarizes the state of measuring and reporting adherence, the rate of adherence, and possible predictors of adherence in the form of a systematic review following the PRISMA statement. A database search of PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Scopus, and PsychINFO identified 3104 poten-tially relevant articles published up to the end of December 2019. The review focuses only on the SARS-CoV-2 pre-pandemic time because the accelerated development of the eHealth Mind-fulness-based interventions and a vast amount of newly published interventions in the follow-ing years was expected. A total of 69 studies met all the eligibility criteria. Out of these studies, 61% reported some measure of adherence and 36% reported the adherence rate. The adherence rate in clinical populations ranged from 41% to 92%; in non-clinical populations, it ranged from 1% to 85%. Predictors of adherence were inves-tigated in 48% of the studies; however, the ma-jority of assessed variables had mixed findings about predicting adherence. There was a huge variety in the definitions and measurements of adherence. A standardized system of measuring and reporting adherence and further investiga-tion of its predictors is needed.

AB  - Objectives Working in high-stress and male-dominated occupations is associated with an elevated risk of suicide. The current study sought to conduct the first systematic literature review and meta-analysis aimed at determining suicide risk across the diverse, high pressure and male-dominated transport industry (commercial aviation, merchant seafaring, transit/driving) as compared to the general/employed population.
   Methods Searches of PubMed/Medline, Scopus and PsycINFO databases were conducted without date restriction until March 2021. Studies were included if they were written in English, were peer reviewed, and presented primary observational research data. Studies referring exclusively to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, selfharm, and/or accidents were excluded.
   Results Following deletion of duplicates and non-English titles, a total of 4201 titles/abstracts were screened and 92 full-texts were read against inclusion/exclusion criteria. The final included sample consisted of 23 articles (16 used for meta-analysis). Results from the meta-analysis indicated that transport workers had a significantly elevated risk for suicide as compared to the general/employed population. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses, and there was some variation across subgroup analyses.
   Conclusions Overall, we found transport workers had a significantly higher risk for suicide than the general/employed population, and this appeared to be driven by the association for those working in merchant seafaring/maritime occupations. The findings are discussed in relation to an identified need for the development, implementation, and evaluation of tailored workplace suicide prevention strategies for transport industry workers.

AB  - Bioethicists have long advocated for patients' rights by deliberating on what physicians should or should not do for the well-being of patients. Part of this advocacy has involved challenging a paternalistic medical model where physicians are seen as authoritative figures above reproach. Through ombudsperson offices, patients can submit complaints that may lead to medical examiners conducting detailed examinations of physicians' conduct and decision-making. Prior research indicates that complaints can have serious and broad effects on physicians. We conducted a scoping review to explore and evaluate the extent of the quantitative and qualitative literature examining the effects of complaints on physicians in European and Commonwealth countries. We systematically searched electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsycInfo) and grey literature for primary research that collected information directly from physicians on at least one potential effect of formal complaints. After screening the titles/abstracts of 14,913 records and reviewing 137 full-texts, 25 studies were included. The 25 studies reported on several potential effects, including the patient-physician relationship (3 studies), defensive medicine (14 studies), anxiety (8 studies), depression (8 studies), one's identity as a physician (5 studies), and anger (5 studies). Generally, the effects evaluated in the included studies were negative. Although the existing literature covered a range of possible effects, few studies assessed the same effects via different methods, and in different regions and contexts. The findings of this scoping review suggest that complaints processes can have negative effects on physicians.

AB  - Plastic production has inevitably increased in the past few decades and is one of the diverse material used in today's world. With this increasing production and wider use, the aquatic ecosystems have become the trash barrel for all kinds of plastic resulting in it becoming a looming spectre to the habitat and functions of both inland and offshore ecosystems. Plastic pollution is considered as an emerging global environmental concern which could significantly affect the biological diversity and may have potential to cause inimical effects on human health. These plastics have shown to gradually degrade into micro fragments and are reported to cause toxic effects on the aquatic organisms. In comparison to the studies on presence of microplastic in marine ecosystems, the studies on the presence of it in freshwater ecosystems have received relatively lesser attention although some studies have shown that the contamination is as grievous as that of in marine environment. This review article focuses on the literature available on the reports of microplastic occurrence, its distribution in freshwater ecosystems across the world and its insidious effects which are of emerging concern. The effect of such microplastic ingestion in both aquatic organisms and the potential health hazards due to such plastic consumption in humans have also been examined. The paper also discusses the existing knowledge gaps so that future research directions can be taken accordingly and the findings in this paper would significantly help all the countries across the world to understand the present plastic pollution scenario and work towards the mitigation of the same.

AB  - Objectives. - This review examined the existing empirical literature on trauma histories of female sex offenders to investigate the effects of childhood sexual abuse along with other traumatic experiences that lead to developmental traumas.
   Material and methods. - For this, validated questionnaire were used; we searched for articles in PsycInfo, PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. The inclusion criteria comprised studies that employed the Adverse Childhood Experience Questionnaire and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and that were published in English from 2007-2020. To direct this review, the articles-selection followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. After reviewing 2039 abstracts, 78 met the criteria; after removing duplicates, 12 articles were assessed for eligibility. Eventually, four abstracts that used the validated questionnaires were considered admissible and their methods involved non-randomized convenience samples of sex offenders either in prison or in treatment programs.
   Results. - Statistics on female sex offender prosecutions were relatively low compared to victim reports of sexual abuse committed by females. Compared with males, sexual abuse perpetrated by females had more damaging effects on the victims. The results indicated that childhood sexual abuse history was the most common type of maltreatment, along with physical abandonment, emotional abandonment, mental illness at home, and family instability due to divorced or unmarried parents, contributing to the development of sex offending behaviors.
   Conclusion. - Future research should address policies that allow for early intervention and treatments that target the understanding of maltreatment histories to ameliorate the child sexual abuse effects in life-s early stages.

AB  - Background: Medication-induced psychotic disorder (MIPD) is a diagnostic term for a syndrome with symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions directly related to drug intake. The purpose of this review is to report and comment on the current knowledge about pathomechanisms, risk factors, symptoms, and treatment of MIPD caused by selected widely used medications.
   Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched for articles on MIPD published prior to January 2021 using search terms 'psychosis' OR 'psychotic disorder' AND 'side effects' combined with certain medications group. The initial search was then narrowed to medications with more pathomechanisms than only direct dopamine-inducing activity that are widely used by clinicians of various medical specialties.
   Results: Steroids, antiepileptic drugs, antimalarial drugs, and antiretroviral drugs can induce psychosis with persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations as the most frequently reported symptoms. Mood changes and anxiety may precede psychosis after steroids and antimalarials. Psychiatric history and female sex are risk factors for most of the MIPD. Treatment involves cessation of the suspected drug. Administration of atypical antipsychotic drugs may be helpful, although there is insufficient data to support this approach. The latter should be done with careful consideration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions.
   Conclusions: MIPD is a rare condition. The appearance of psychotic symptoms during systemic treatment may be associated with administered medications, psychiatric comorbidity, or be a part of the clinical picture of a certain disorder. Furthermore, sometimes it may be challenging to distinguish MIPD from delirium. Therefore, we consider that the key to proper management of MIPD is a thorough differential diagnosis.

AB  - Enuresis is a common childhood condition treated by pediatricians and psychiatrists. Enuresis is also commonly referred as bedwetting. It is more prevalent among boys than girls. Enuresis is an involuntary voiding of urine continuing after an anticipated age of control in the absence of any organic abnormality. This review summarizes the current knowledge about epidemiology, diagnosis, etiological factors, psychiatric comorbidities, and behavioral (enuresis alarm and star charts) as well as pharmacological (desmopressin and imipramine) management of enuresis. It is important to understand the epidemiology, etiology, behavioral as well as pharmacological management, and screening for psychiatric comorbidities for the better outcome among the children with enuresis. Enuresis can be stressful physically as well as mentally for both child and parents. Many times, parents of children with enuresis either do not show willingness or hesitate to report the bedwetting behavior of their children due to perceived stigma related to enuresis. Hence, there is a paucity of data in this field that the detailed evaluation of the prevalence, causative factors, and risk factors is needed and of great value to understand the psychiatric comorbidities associated with enuresis for the better outcome. Psychological support and motivation are needed for both children and their parents for improving their treatment-seeking behavior and for an effective management of enuresis.

AB  - Background: Although some meta-analyses have identified potential moderators associated with treatment outcomes for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), there is as yet no consensus regarding the influence of anxiety and depression symptoms on the recovery from pediatric OCD. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of depression and anxiety symptoms and their comorbidities on the efficacy of CBT in pediatric OCD, as well as other potential moderators that may be associated with outcomes. Method: An exhaustive literature search from 1983 to March 2021 located 22 published articles that applied cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to pediatric OCD, producing a total of 26 treatment groups. Some of the moderator variables analyzed included age, gender, comorbidity baseline in anxiety; depression and obsession, and methodological quality. Results: Results showed that the psychological treatment of OCD achieves clinically significant effectiveness, both for measures of obsessions and compulsions (d(+)=2.030), and for anxiety (d(+)= 0.613) and depression (d(+)= 0.451). An explanatory model for the CY-BOCS effect sizes showed that three moderator variables were statistically related: the mean of the CY-BOCS (Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale) in pretest, the effect size for anxiety, and the mean age of the sample. Conclusions: CBT reduced obsessive-compulsive symptoms and, to a lesser extent, anxiety and depression symptoms. Since anxiety symptoms arc reduced with the same therapy, resources would be saved compared to other treatments.

AB  - Background: Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. Evidence suggests self-management (SM) interventions benefit cancer patients. This review aims to determine the effectiveness of SM interventions for lung cancer patients. Method: Searches occurred in PubMed, Cinahl, ProQuest, Psych Info, Scopus, and Medline, using predefined criteria, assessing randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Results: Five hundred and eighty-seven studies were yielded, 10 RCTs met criteria. Of the total patient pool, 1001 of 1089 had Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Six studies tested home-based SM exercise, two studies SM education, and one each for diary utilisation and symptom reporting. Fatigue was the most targeted function. Other functions targeted included exercise capacity, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), sleep quality, and symptom burden. Six studies met their primary endpoints (five SM exercise, one SM education). Positive outcomes are described for fatigue, anxiety/depression, sleep quality, self-efficacy, and exercise capacity. With exception to fatigue, early-stage NSCLC, younger age, female, never smokers, partnered patients experienced increased treatment effect. Conclusions: SM interventions improve outcomes among some lung cancer patients. Interventions targeting fatigue yield benefit despite histology, stage or gender and could encourage broader cohort engagement. Consideration of patient characteristics may predict SM effect. Effectiveness of home-based SM exercise by NSCLC stage and SM tailored to sociodemographic variables requires further research.

AB  - Background: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that was earlier intended to treat only patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), but researchers have found DBT to treat several psychological disorders, including depression. Aim: The article aims to review the clinical shreds of evidence regarding the use of DBT to treat depression. Methods: PubMed literature search was done by applying the year filter range, 2010 to 2021. Another filter applied was "Randomized controlled trial", so that the strength of evidence could be enhanced. The keywords used were "Dialectical Behavior Therapy" AND "Depression". Results: 33 articles were found, out of which only 20 relevant articles were reviewed. DBT was found to alleviate depressive symptoms associated with different psychological disorders like bipolar disorder and BPD but the number of studies that validated the aforementioned were less than those studies which showed that DBT had no significant effect on the patients with depressive difficulties. The long-term effect of DBT for treating depression is under suspect, as studies showed that DBT got ineffective during the follow-ups. Conclusion: DBT shows benefits in depression, but further studies are still required to validate this concretely as DBT did not show a significant effect when compared to its control counterparts. There is much need for future studies which can evaluate the long-term efficacy of DBT in depression, which is another challenging area because follow-up data did not favor DBT.

AB  - Background: Anger is commonly experienced by family caregivers of people living with dementia yet its effect on caregivers' physical health remains unknown.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study was to systematically review current evidence on the effects of anger and hostility on caregivers' physical health.
   Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, and PsycINFO up to January 2022. Two review authors independently extracted data on study characteristics, study quality, and effect sizes of associations of anger and hostility with caregiver health outcomes.
   Results: We found eight studies examining the effects of anger and hostility on caregivers' physical health reporting on a total of 937 participants, of which four were cross-sectional and four were longitudinal. Overall findings indicated that higher levels of anger and hostility exerted a negative effect on caregivers' physical health. Higher anger control was longitudinally associated with increased weight gain (beta = 1.13, p < 0.001), whereas higher anger out predicted higher glucose dysregulation at long-term follow-up (r = 0.27, p < 0.05). Higher levels of caregiver hostility were associated with increased risk of chronic low-grade inflammation long-term (r = 0.18, p < 0.05), and increased risk of cognitive decline over time (r = -0.16, p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our review provides the first systematic synthesis of the evidence demonstrating the harmful effects of anger and hostility on dementia caregivers' health and highlights the need for preventative interventions to support family caregivers experiencing high levels of anger.

AB  - Background: Poor and insufficient social support to the mother in the post-partum period impairs the effective functioning of her new role as a mother, and it is an important risk factor for the maternal depression and stress after childbirth. Thus, interventions to improve social support to mothers in their postpartum period are required. The present review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the existing interventions aimed at improving social support among postpartum women.
   Methods: In this systematic review, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, Google Scholar, IranDoc, IranMedex, MagIran and SID were searched until January 2022. Full-text articles on the social support outcome, published in English or Persian, which used the design of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or comparison groups and involved postpartum or pregnant women as participants were included. The quality of the studies was assessed based on the seven criteria offered by Cochrane guidelines.
   Results: Our review included 10 studies involving 3328 women. According to our results, the following interventions were successful in increasing social support compared to the controlled conditions: counseling with men in the prenatal period, interventions based on interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), advanced practice nurse (APN), internet support, and home visiting in the postpartum period.
   Conclusion: These interventions could be provided to mothers during their prenatal or postpartum care. However, which one of these interventions is the most effective in improving social support among postpartum mothers was not identified in the present study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurses experience many job tensions, which lead to job burnout. The consequences of nurses' job burnout include absenteeism, reduced quality of patient care, interpersonal conflicts with colleagues, physical and mental problems, reluctance to provide care with patients, and quitting the job.
   OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of job burnout among nurses in Iran using a meta-analysis method.
   METHOD: The study was conducted through a meta-analysis method based on the PRISMA checklist. An unlimited search was conducted until 2020 to access the Persian and English papers in national databases, including Medlib, SID, Iranmedex, and Magiran, and databases including Cochrane, Science-Direct, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The keywords were "job burnout, nurse, and Iran." The data were searched and extracted by two researchers independently. All analyses were performed using version 2.0 of the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of job burnout was investigated in 14 papers with a sample size of 2271 individuals with an average age of 31.44 years old, and a confidence interval of 55% (44-66%). Fars province, with 89.2%, had the highest, and Zanjan province, with 25.9%, experienced the lowest prevalence of job burnout. The overall prevalence of job burnout was 44% in males and 66% in females so that the highest prevalence was in women.
   CONCLUSION: The prevalence of job burnout in nurses was high in some areas of Iran. A special attention by managers is needed in this field because of the several roles played by the nurses in the healthcare system and the improvement of public health. Implementation of plans to reduce the job burnout and to improve the mental health of nurses by reducing work hours, giving more opportunities to them to express their opinion(s) in amount of salary and benefits, and creating better working conditions are recommended.

AB  - War regardless of where it occurs, causes widespread devastation for everyone on the planet. Civilians who are directly affected by war are subjected to unspeakable atrocities. They cross national borders in search of safety. The total number of refugees in the world reached 26.4 million in 2020 and now with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the number is escalating. As of May 2021 the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Malaysia has registered 179,570 refugees and asylum seekers. With the growing number of refugees around the world, the prevalence of their mental health disorders is significant for public health. These people are among the most vulnerable people on the planet. The purpose of this review is to look at the short and long term psychological impact on refugees, in particular the Vietnamese refugees who once fled their country for safety in Malaysia and then resettled in other countries. From the review, recommen-dations for handling the growing number of refugees world-wide in the hope of reducing the impact their psychological problem in future. #SayNoToWar

AB  - Background: As the demand for dementia care grows rapidly worldwide, heavy "caregiver burden" has been associated with stress and depression. Even so, standard metrics for interdisciplinary research of caregiver burden are limited.
   Objective: The objective of the present review is to recommend valid, reliable, and comprehensive self-report instruments of caregiver burden.
   Methods: A systematic review was performed using four databases, searched in April 2021. Articles that established or evaluated self-report instruments for dementia caregiver burden were included, while studies that involved non-dementia caregivers or did not clearly define caregiver burden were excluded. Established guidelines for reliability and agreement studies were used to assess quality and risk of bias. Assessments of self-report instruments were made based on reliability, validity, feasibility, and quality of psychometric evaluations, and comparative evaluations were presented in visual form using radar graphs.
   Results: Search terms yielded 1,720 articles, and 40 were included in the systematic review after excluding those of low quality. Based on the results of these studies, we recommend the Zarit Burden Interview, Screen for Caregiver Burden, Caregiver Burden Interview, and Burden Scale for Family Caregivers, due to their validity, reliability, and inclusion of multiple subjective and objective dimensions of burden.
   Conclusion: Targeting specific sources of caregiver burden can help prevent negative outcomes for both dementia patients and caregivers. Future studies should apply self-report instruments to measure and address caregiver burden longitudinally.

AB  - The legalization of cannabis in many countries has allowed many Parkinson's disease (PD) patients to turn to cannabis as a treatment. As such there is a growing interest from the PD community to be properly guided by evidence regarding potential treatment benefits of cannabis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compile the best available evidence to help guide patients and their family, clinicians and researchers make informed decisions. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in June 2021. Five randomized controlled studies and eighteen non-randomized studies investigated cannabis treatment in PD patients. No compelling evidence was found to recommend the use of cannabis in PD patients. However, a potential benefit was identified with respect to alleviation of PD related tremor, anxiety, pain, improvement of sleep quality and quality of life. Given the relative paucity of well-designed randomized studies, there is an identified need for further investigation, particularly in these areas.

AB  - Background. The technological innovation of smartphones and various software has made our lives more convenient. However, the negative effects of our excessive dependence on them cannot be overlooked.
   Objectives. The purpose of this scoping review was to understand the relationship between the use of smartphones and our cognitive functions, as well as to present important research directions for the future.
   Material and methods. All relevant literature, published as of 1 March 2020, was searched using the following databases: CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO. The framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley, which has a review process of five stages, was used for the review.
   Results. Overuse of smartphones was found to be related to decrease concentration, working memory and cognitive suppression. In particular, the results of concentration and cognitive restraint function could be interpreted as a result of the impulsive behaviour pattern of an individual, and the results of working memory could be explained by the principle of overload due to the limitation of the user's working memory capacity. The association between smartphone usage levels and cognitive functions was compared. The results of this scoping review highlight the need for future research to thoroughly assess the user's impulse and associated cognitive functions for smartphone use.
   Conclusions. Furthermore, it will be necessary to consider ways to improve user convenience by developing therapeutic paradigms that can reduce the overuse of smartphones.

AB  - Diabetes is one of the most common non-communicable diseases, which have far-reaching economic and social consequences and threaten the national production and economy of countries. However, diabetes is a disease of self-control. Therefore, self-care strategies can maintain patients' independence while reducing the burden imposed on health care resources. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting self-care behaviors in diabetic patients. This study is a systematic review; Google Scholar, SID, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, and ISI databases were used; 17,500 articles were found including the keywords "self-care", "diabetes" and "affecting factors" in the search process, and all studies after 2010 were included. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, 51 studies were included. The studies' reports on self-care behaviors and their prevalence were very different depending on the tools used. The studies show the relationship between self-care behaviors in patients with diabetes and various factors, including demographic, socio-economic, and psychological factors. The most important variables included are educational status, age, gender, marital status, BMI, occupational status, duration of illness, comorbidities, income, having glucometer, perceived severity of the disease and its complications, perceived barriers, diabetes distress, diabetes knowledge, perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, social and family support, depression, and anxiety. Due to the relationship of demographic, socio-economic, and psychological factors with self-care behaviors in patients with diabetes, it is suggested that a comprehensive program for the management of caring behaviors in diabetic patients should be designed to include all of the above.

AB  - Background Depression comm only co-exists with hum an immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the HIV burden is greatest, mental health resources are limited. These settings may benefit from psychosocial interventions delivered to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) by non-mental health specialists. We aimed to systematically review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions delivered by non-mental health specialists to prevent depression in PLWH in LMICs.
   Methods We used a comprehensive electronic search strategy to identify RCTs of any stage, including pilot studies, which reported on the effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention on depression among adults living with HIV/AIDS in a LMIC setting. Screening, study selection and data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool and performed a narrative synthesis.
   Results We identified 3431 studies, from which we included 15 studies corresponding to 14 RCTs and a total of 3997 PLWH. Eleven studies were parallel RCTs, one was a stepped-wedged RCT, one was a full factorial RCT, one was a three-arm RCT and four were pilot studies. Studies were generally small, with eight including depression as a primary outcome. All but four trials included men and women and most studies followed participants for less than one year. Twelve trials had at least one domain in which there was a high risk of bias, with the remaining two trials having at least one domain of concern, due to lack of reporting of items. in 12 studies people in the intervention arm had statistically significantly (P< 0.05) lower or more reduced depressive symptom scores, or were less likely to have major depression, at final follow-up than people in the control group.
   Conclusions Psychosocial interventions delivered by non-specialist mental health workers may be effective in preventing or reducing depression in PLWH in LMICs. However, existing studies are small with a relatively short follow-up period and have methodological limitations. Future trials should address these shortcomings, establish whether intervention effects are clinically meaningful and investigate cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Background The association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and diabetes is unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quan-tify the association between the number and types of ACEs and diabetes during adulthood based on available observational studies.Methods A comprehensive literature search of studies exploring the association between ACEs and diabetes was conducted in PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases until 15 April 2022. A random-effects model was used to pool odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the number and types of ACEs with diabetes. Regarding the association between the number of ACEs and diabetes, we used funnel plots to examine publication bias, subgroup analysis to explore sources of heterogeneity, and sensitivity analysis to explore the robust-ness of the pooled results.Results A total of 49 studies were included. Individuals with higher continu-ous ACEs (per each additional ACE: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02-1.10), any ACE (OR= 1.22, 95% CI = 1.16-1.28), or >= 4 ACEs (OR= 1.44, 95% CI = 1.27-1.63) were at an increased risk of diabetes in adulthood when compared with indi-viduals without ACEs. Across specific ACE types, childhood economic adversi-ty (OR= 1.11, 95% CI=1.04-1.19), physical abuse (OR= 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.21), sexual abuse (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.12-1.39), verbal abuse (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.03-1.20), and incarceration (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.03-1.45) were associated with diabetes. However, neglect, emotional abuse, domestic violence, parental divorce or separation, parental death, and living with a family member with substance abuse or mental disorders were not significantly associated with diabetes.Conclusions Individuals with ACEs may have a cumulative risk for diabetes in adulthood. It is critical to prevent ACEs and build resilience in individuals af-fected by ACEs.

AB  - Objective: The association between a low socioeconomic status and poor health, also known as social inequalities in health, has been shown in numerous studies. This also applies to most mental illnesses, such as somatization or anxiety disorders. It is unclear, however, whether social inequalities are evident in health anxiety as well. Therefore, this review and meta-analysis systematically examines social inequalities in health anxiety. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted covering all studies published until August 2021. The databases PubMED, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PSYNDEX were screened to identify quantitative studies using validated tools to measure health anxiety and examining the association with socioeconomic status. Meta analytic methods were applied by using random-effect models. The study quality was assessed with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. Results: Overall, 37 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Effect sizes of 27 studies using screening scales and 10 studies using diagnostic interviews to measure health anxiety were calculated separately. Meta-analyses revealed a significant association between socioeconomic status and health anxiety (r 0.14, 95%-CI-0.18 to-0.09 (screening scales) and OR 0.63, 95%-CI 0.43 to 0.92 (diagnostic interviews)), indicating a lower risk for health anxiety in people with higher socioeconomic status. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the health-related disadvantage of socially deprived people is also evident regarding health anxiety. This should be considered in programs to reduce social inequalities in health. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021237550.

AB  - Background: The long term effects of exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) for frequencies from 100 kHz to 300 GHz on cognitive performance are best assessed using observational studies. In recent years, the use of mobile (cell) phones has been the main source of RF EMF exposure to the brain, although other sources of exposure may be significant. Cognitive function includes various mental and psychological abilities, which can be measured in a range of domains, such as learning, memory, reasoning, problem solving, decision making and attention. Although effects on cognitive function may be most evident later in life, in the experimental setting acute and immediate effects can only be studied. Observational studies are needed when effects are observed after months or years following short or long-term exposure. The importance of the effects of exposure on children has also been recently identified. Objectives: To assess the long-term effects of RF EMF local and whole-body exposure compared to no or a lower level of exposure on indicators of cognition, including complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, perceptual motor ability and social cognition, but excluding cognitive effects caused by neurodegenerative diseases or neurodevelopmental disorders, and to assess if there is evidence of a dose response relationship. Study eligibility and criteria: We will include observational studies that have evaluated cognitive effects of RF energy including a comparator group with a different level of exposure. Studies must report at least one validated measure of cognitive function, including global or domain specific measures, or cognitive impairment, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Cohort or case-control studies published in the peer review literature in any language are eligible. We will exclude cross-sectional studies and any that only report brain structure or biomarkers. Study appraisal and synthesis method: We will conduct searches of PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and the EMFPortal. At least two authors will independently screen the titles/abstracts of all records, with any conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Full-text screening will also be conducted independently by two authors with conflicts resolved by consensus. Data will be extracted from the studies included, such as identifiers and characteristics of the study design, exposure and comparator groups, participants, outcomes assessed and results. Risk of bias will be assessed with the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) tool. We will conduct a meta-analysis of similar studies with a random effects model in STATA or similar software, if two or more studies are available for a given exposure-outcome combination. Confidence in the body evidence will be judged using GRADE methods as adapted by OHAT for reviews of environmental exposures.

AB  - Objective Psychological trauma (e.g., abuse, neglect) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) commonly occur in pediatric pain populations and may be related to various maladaptive coping strategies, which may in turn affect short- and long-term pain-related outcomes in youth. Accordingly, the current scoping review and conceptual framework seeks to identify important gaps in the field's current understanding of how coping impacts outcomes in youth who have experienced trauma/PTSS and pediatric chronic pain and explores avenues for future investigation. Methods A scoping review of the literature was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, and Sociological Abstracts. Eligibility criteria included pediatric populations experiencing chronic pain, trauma, adverse childhood events, and/or PTSS and associated coping mechanisms. Nine research papers were selected and used to support the conceptual framework. The framework builds upon the work of Compas et al.'s' model of control-based coping (; ) and outlines the potential effects of trauma and/or PTSS and pain on coping and pain-related outcomes (e.g., pain chronicity, functional outcomes) in pediatric chronic pain populations. Results A history of chronic pain and psychological trauma and/or PTSS in youth may contribute to increased risk for maladaptive coping and in turn, poorer pain-related and psychosocial outcomes long-term. Conclusions Findings from the current scoping review and proposed conceptual framework will guide future research and treatment efforts for youths experiencing pain and trauma and/or PTSS and thereby enhance long-term outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUNDBipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by mood swings. Psychosocial interventions, such as psychoeducation, play an essential role in promoting social rehabilitation and improving pharmacological treatment.AIMTo investigate the role of psychoeducation in BD.METHODSA systematic review of original studies regarding psychoeducation interventions in patients with BD and their relatives was developed. A systematic literature search was performed using the Medline, Scopus, and Lilacs databases. No review articles or qualitative studies were included in the analysis. There were no date restriction criteria, and studies published up to April 2021 were included.RESULTSA total of forty-seven studies were selected for this review. Thirty-eight studies included patients, and nine included family members. Psychoeducation of patients and family members was associated with a lower number of new mood episodes and a reduction in number and length of stay of hospitalizations. Psychoeducational interventions with patients are associated with improved adherence to drug treatment. The strategies studied in patients and family members do not interfere with the severity of symptoms of mania or depression or with the patient's quality of life or functionality. Psychoeducational interventions with family members do not alter patients' adherence to pharmacotherapy.CONCLUSIONPsychoeducation as an adjunct strategy to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of BD leads to a reduction in the frequency of new mood episodes, length of hospital stay and adherence to drug therapy.

AB  - Background Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. It is also one of the most common geriatric psychiatric disorders and a major risk factor for disability and mortality in elderly patients. Even though depression is a common mental health problem in the elderly population, it is undiagnosed in half of the cases. Several studies showed different and inconsistent prevalence rates in the world. Hence, this study aimed to fill the above gap by producing an average prevalence of depression and associated factors in old age. Objective This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a precise estimate of the prevalence of depression and its determinants among old age. Method A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of sciences, Google Scholar, and Psych-info from database inception to January 2020. Moreover, the reference list of selected articles was looked at manually to have further eligible articles. The random-effects model was employed during the analysis. Stata-11 was used to determine the average prevalence of depression among old age. A sub-group analysis and sensitivity analysis were also run. A graphical inspection of the funnel plots and Egger's publication bias plot test were checked for the occurrence of publication bias. Result A search of the electronic and manual system resulted in 1263 articles. Nevertheless, after the huge screening, 42 relevant studies were identified, including, for this meta-analysis, n = 57,486 elderly populations. The average expected prevalence of depression among old age was 31.74% (95% CI 27.90, 35.59). In the sub-group analysis, the pooled prevalence was higher among developing countries; 40.78% than developed countries; 17.05%), studies utilized Geriatrics Depression Scale-30(GDS-30); 40.60% than studies that used GMS; 18.85%, study instrument, and studies having a lower sample size (40.12%) than studies with the higher sample; 20.19%. Conclusion A high prevalence rate of depression among the old population in the world was unraveled. This study can be considered as an early warning and advised health professionals, health policymakers, and other pertinent stakeholders to take effective control measures and periodic care for the elderly population.

AB  - Radix Polygalae (also known as Yuanzhi in China) is the dried rhizome of Polygala tenuifolia Willd. or Polygala sibirica L., which is a famous Chinese herb and has been widely used for centuries in traditional medicines including expectorants, tonics, tranquilizers, antipsychotic, and so on. This article reviews the neuroprotective effects of Radix Polygalae in preclinical models of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, especially anxiety, depression, declining cognition, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The chemical composition of Radix Polygalae as well as the underlying mechanisms of action were also reviewed. We found that Radix Polygalae possesses a broad range of beneficial effects on the abovementioned conditions. The multifold mechanisms of action include several properties such as antioxidant and associated apoptotic effects; anti-inflammatory and associated apoptotic effects; neurogenesis, regeneration, differentiation, and neuronal plasticity improvement; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) regulation; neurotransmitter release; and receptor activation (A(2A)R, NMDA-R, and GluR). Nevertheless, the detailed mechanisms underlying this array of pharmacological effects observed in vitro and in vivo still need further investigation to attain a coherent neuroprotective profile.

CiteSpace was used to analyze the number of publications, countries, institutions, journals, authors, cited references, and keywords using standard bibliometric indicators.Results: A total of 1,576 publications on pain catastrophizing were retrieved from 2010 to December 31, 2020. The number and rate of the annual publications gradually increased totally. Pain (130) was the most productive journal. Meanwhile, Pain ranked first in the frequency (1,432) and centrality (0.31) of the cited journals. The most productive country and institution in this frequency field were the United States (642) and the University of Washington (73), respectively. Jensen MP (34) was the most prolific author, and Sullivan MJL (1,196) ranked first among the cited authors. In the ranking of frequency in the cited references, the first article was a critical review about pain catastrophizing published by Quartana (100). The keyword "Low back pain" had the highest frequency (556). "Total hip" was identified as a frontier research item for 2016-2020.Conclusion: The findings of this bibliometric study provide the current status and trends in the clinical research of pain catastrophizing and may help researchers to identify hot topics and explore new research directions in this field.

Aims This study aims to examine personal recovery and its challenges in forensic mental health settings in relation to the established framework for personal recovery in mental illness: connectedness, hope, identity, meaning and empowerment (CHIME). Method This study is an updated and expanded systematic review and thematic synthesis of the qualitative literature. A systematic search of six electronic databases (Web of Science, Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and SocIndex) was carried out in January 2019, using the terms [Recover*] AND [Forensic OR Secure] AND [Patient* OR Offend* OR Service User*]. Only studies that included service user's own perceptions and were published from 2014 onward were included in the review. Data were examined with thematic synthesis and subsequently analysed in relation to the CHIME framework. Results Twenty-one studies were included in the review. Findings suggest that some adjustments to the original CHIME framework are needed for it to be more relevant to forensic populations, and that an additional recovery process regarding feeling safe and being secure (safety and security) could be added to CHIME, providing the CHIME-Secure framework (CHIME-S). Specific challenges and barriers for forensic recovery were identified and found to represent the opposite of the recovery processes defined by CHIME (e.g. hopelessness). Conclusions We present the CHIME-S as a framework for the personal recovery processes of forensic mental health service users. The CHIME-S may guide the recovery-oriented work of forensic mental health services.

AB  - Introduction Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offer a promising alternative to psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments for depression. This paper aims to present a practical guide for its clinical implementation based on evidence from the literature as well as on the experience of a group of leading German experts in the field. Methods The current evidence base for the use of rTMS in depression was examined via review of the literature. From the evidence and from clinical experience, recommendations for the use of rTMS in clinical practice were derived. All members of the of the German Society for Brain Stimulation in Psychiatry and all members of the sections Clinical Brain Stimulation and Experimental Brain Stimulation of the German Society for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, Psychosomatics and Mental Health were invited to participate in a poll on whether they consent with the recommendations. Findings Among rTMS experts, a high consensus rate could be identified for clinical practice concerning the setting and the technical parameters of rTMS treatment in depression, indications and contra-indications, the relation of rTMS to other antidepressive treatment modalities and the frequency and management of side effects.

AB  - Mental health literacy (MHL) encompasses understanding mental health and learning how to obtain and maintain good mental health. Increasing MHL may increase help-seeking behaviors and positive mental health. This study aimed to identify school-based MHL interventions for children/youth using a scoping review methodology following the Johanna Briggs Model. The interventions were assessed for quality of evidence using the National Institutes of Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. Six databases were searched: Scopus, APA PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, ERIC, PubMed, and ProQuest Psychology. Search terms included "mental health literacy," "intervention," and "children." The search yielded 27 studies after applying inclusion criteria. Eight of these studies were assessed as "poor" quality, twelve as "fair" quality, and seven as "good" quality. The results highlight the need for more research to implement and evaluate interventions to sustainably and feasibly incorporate school-based MHL interventions for children and youth into practice. Impact Statement Mental health literacy interventions are needed to improve knowledge of mental health, promote help-seeking for mental illness, and reduce stigma and negative attitudes toward mental illness. This review identifies that more good quality research is required of school-based mental health literacy interventions. New research is urgently needed to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of interventions that reduce the prevalence of mental illness for children and youth.

AB  - Aim Emotional stress reactivity may be a mediating factor in the association between trauma and psychosis. This review aimed to (i) identify, summarise and critically evaluate the link between emotional stress reactivity and psychotic experiences (ii) examine evidence for a 'dose-response' relationship between stress reactivity and psychosis in the wider psychosis phenotype (i.e., sub-clinical symptoms). Methods Electronic database searches (PsychINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE) were conducted for studies which investigated the link between stress reactivity and psychosis, psychotic symptoms, or a vulnerability to developing psychosis (wider phenotype). Cross-sectional, experimental and experience sampling method study designs were eligible for inclusion. Results Fourty five eligible articles were identified (N participants = 8830). Narrative synthesis showed that increased emotional stress reactivity was associated with psychosis and subclinical psychotic experiences across all study designs, however, findings were inconsistent across studies. The preliminary meta-analysis (k = 4, n = 383) showed increases in emotional stress reactivity was associated with higher negative affect in response to event-related stress, in those with psychosis compared to controls (mean difference in beta coefficients = 0.05, 95% CI 0.02-0.08, p = .004). However, this difference was small with a considerable degree of heterogeneity (p = .001, I-2 = 81%) so results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions Overall, the evidence suggests that there is a link between emotional stress reactivity and psychosis in those with psychosis, those at high risk of developing psychosis and in relation to subclinical psychotic-like experiences in the general population.

AB  - The frequent co-occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) leads to manifestations of both conditions that are more severe and more resistance to treatment than single disorders. One hypothesis to explain this synergy is the impact of intrusive memories on craving which, in turn, increases the risk of relapse among patients with substance use disorders. The aim of this systematic review is to examine this possibility by assessing the impact of PTSD and its symptoms on craving among dual disorder patients. Using PRISMA criteria, four databases were comprehensively searched up to June, 2021, in order to identify all candidate studies based on broad key words. Resulting studies were then selected if they examined the impact of PTSD or PTSD symptoms on craving, and if they used standardized assessments of PTSD, SUD, and craving. Twenty-seven articles matched the selection criteria and were included in this review. PTSD was found to be significantly associated with increased craving levels among patients with alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, tobacco, and other substance use disorders. Exposition to traumatic cues among dual disorder patients was also shown to trigger craving, with an additive effect on craving intensity when exposure to substance-related cues occurred. In addition, certain studies observed a correlation between PTSD symptom severity and craving intensity. Concerning mechanisms underlying these associations, some findings suggest that negative emotional states or emotion dysregulation may play a role in eliciting craving after traumatic exposure. Moreover, these studies suggest that PTSD symptoms may, independently of emotions, act as powerful cues that trigger craving. These findings argue for the need of dual disorder treatment programs that integrate PTSD-focused approaches and emotion regulation strategies, in addition to more traditional interventions for craving management.

AB  - Recently there has been an expansion of the literature on creative arts therapy (CAT) interventions in the United States (U.S.) school system. However, findings across studies in the field have yet to be systematically investigated on a national level. The present review is an integrative systematic review of empirically evaluated CAT intervention studies in U.S. schools from the past decade. This synthesis seeks to advance CATs in schools' evidence base and increase research and practice throughout the U.S. Three online databases were searched alongside a manual review of relevant journals. Inclusion criteria required studies to feature a CAT modality, implementation in a U.S. K-12 school during the school day, and an empirical methodology. The systematic search yielded a total qualifying sample of six studies. General findings indicated that across studies, targeted improvement in psychosocial and behavioral domains was achieved, suggesting that CATs hold major promise due to their ecological responsiveness and versatility. Although the current scope of empirically evaluated CAT interventions in U.S. schools is minimal, findings suggest encouraging avenues for formulating a useful research trajectory and advancing practice. Further research recommendations for the promotion of CATs in schools are provided and situated within the school mental health literature.

AB  - Background: The mind-body therapies of traditional Chinese medicine include several intervention types and combine physical poses with conscious relaxation and breathing techniques. The purpose of this Evidence Map is to describe these different interventions and report related health outcomes.Methods: This evidence map is based on the 3iE Evidence Gap Map methodology. We searched seven electronic databases (BVS, PUBMED, EMBASE, PEDro, ScienceDirect, Web of Sciences, and PschyInfo) from inception to November 2019 and included systematic reviews only. Systematic reviews were analyzed based on AMSTAR 2. We used Tableau to graphically display quality assessment, the number of reviews, outcomes, and effects.Results: The map is based on 116 systematic reviews and 44 meta-analyses. Most of the reviews were published in the last 5 years. The most researched interventions were Tai Chi and Qi Gong. The reviews presented the following quality assessment: 80 high, 43 moderate, 23 low, and 14 critically low. Every 680 distinct outcome effect was classified: 421 as potential positive; 237 as positive; 21 as inconclusive/mixed; one potential negative and none no effect. Positive effects were related to chronic diseases; mental indicators and disorders; vitality, well-being, and quality of life. Potential positive effects were related to balance, mobility, Parkinson's disease, hypertension, joint pain, cognitive performance, and sleep quality. Inconclusive/mixed-effects justify further research, especially in the following areas: Acupressure as Shiatsu and Tuina for nausea and vomiting; Tai Chi and Qi Gong for acute diseases, prevention of stroke, stroke risk factors, and schizophrenia.Conclusions: The mind-body therapies from traditional Chinese medicine have been applied in different areas and this Evidence Map provides a visualization of valuable information for patients, professionals, and policymakers, to promote evidence-based complementary therapies.

AB  - Loneliness is a relatively common problem in young people (14-24 years) and predicts the onset of depression and anxiety. Interventions to reduce loneliness thus have significant potential as active ingredients in strategies to prevent or alleviate anxiety and depression among young people. Previous reviews have focused on quantitative evidence and have not examined potential mechanisms that could be targets for intervention strategies. To build on this work, in this review we aimed to combine qualitative and quantitative evidence with stakeholder views to identify interventions that appear worth testing for their potential effectiveness in reducing loneliness, anxiety and depression in young people aged 14-24 years, and provide insights into the potential mechanisms of action. We conducted a Critical Interpretative Synthesis, a systematic review method that iteratively synthesises qualitative and quantitative evidence and is explicitly focused on building theory through a critical approach to the evidence that questions underlying assumptions. Literature searches were performed using nine databases, and eight additional databases were searched for theses and grey literature. Charity and policy websites were searched for content relevant to interventions for youth loneliness. We incorporated elements of Rapid Realistic Review approaches by consulting with young people and academic experts to feed into search strategies and the resulting conceptual framework, in which we aimed to set out which interventions appear potentially promising in terms of theoretical and empirical underpinnings and which fit with stakeholder views. We reviewed effectiveness data and quality ratings for the included randomised controlled trials only. Through synthesising 27 studies (total participants n = 105,649; range 1-102,072 in different studies) and grey literature, and iteratively consulting with stakeholders, a conceptual framework was developed. A range of 'Intrapersonal' (e.g. therapy that changes thinking and behaviour), 'Interpersonal' (e.g. improving social skills), and 'Social' Strategies (e.g. enhancing social support, and providing opportunities for social contact) seem worth testing further for their potential to help young people address loneliness, thereby preventing or alleviating depression and/or anxiety. Such strategies should be co-designed with young people and personalised to fit individual needs. Plausible mechanisms of action are facilitating sustained social support, providing opportunities for young people to socialise with peers who share similar experiences, and changing thinking and behaviour, for instance through building positive attitudes to themselves and others. The most convincing evidence of effectiveness was found in support of Intrapersonal Strategies: two randomised controlled studies quality-rated as 'good' found decreases in loneliness associated with different forms of therapy (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or peer network counselling), although power calculations were not reported, and effect sizes were small or missing. Strategies to address loneliness and prevent or alleviate anxiety and depression need to be co-designed and personalised. Promising elements to incorporate into these strategies are social support, including from peers with similar experiences, and psychological therapy.

AB  - Everyday life often requires considerable creativity in dealing with challenging circumstances. This implies that creativity regularly operates in an affective context, however, this "C" of creativity is rarely addressed in contemporary research. In this brief review article, we address some important milestones in this nascent field of research. Starting with early accounts on emotional creativity, we discuss seminal research intertwining creativity and mood states, and finally introduce two recent developments in this field: reappraisal inventiveness as the capacity to generate manifold cognitive reappraisals for aversive situations, and malevolent creativity as creative ideation intentionally used to damage others. We discuss the conceptual origins of reappraisal inventiveness and malevolent creativity and provide an extensive review of past behavioral and neuroscientific findings regarding these differently motivated instances of affective creativity. Additionally, novel pilot findings and prospects on both lines of research will be provided, which may help to advance investigations into more real-world applications of creative cognition.

AB  - Aim: To assess the effectiveness of supported employment interventions for improving competitive employment in populations of people with conditions other than only severe mental illness. Background: Supported employment interventions have been extensively tested in severe mental illness populations. These approaches may be beneficial outside of these populations. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus, JSTOR, PEDro, OTSeeker, and NIOSHTIC for trials including unemployed people with any condition and including severe mental illness if combined with other co-morbidities or other specific circumstances (e.g., homelessness). We excluded trials where inclusion was based on severe mental illness alone. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias (RoB v2.0) and four reviewers extracted data. We assessed rates of competitive employment as compared to traditional vocational rehabilitation or waiting list/services as usual. Findings: Ten randomised controlled trials (913 participants) were included. Supported employment was more effective than control interventions for improving competitive employment in seven trials: in people with affective disorders [risk ratio (RR) 10.61 (1.49, 75.38)]; mental disorders and justice involvement [RR 4.44 (1.36,14.46)]; veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [RR 2.73 (1.64, 4.54)]; formerly incarcerated veterans [RR 2.17 (1.09, 4.33)]; people receiving methadone treatment [RR 11.5 (1.62, 81.8)]; veterans with spinal cord injury at 12 months [RR 2.46 (1.16, 5.22)] and at 24 months [RR 2.81 (1.98, 7.37)]; and young people not in employment, education, or training [RR 5.90 (1.91-18.19)]. Three trials did not show significant benefits from supported employment: populations of workers with musculoskeletal injuries [RR 1.38 (1.00, 1.89)]; substance abuse [RR 1.85 (0.65, 5.41)]; and formerly homeless people with mental illness [RR 1.55 (0.76, 3.15)]. Supported employment interventions may be beneficial to people from more diverse populations than those with severe mental illness alone. Defining competitive employment and increasing (and standardising) measurement of non-vocational outcomes may help to improve research in this area.

AB  - Stroke is the second largest cause of death worldwide, causing disease with long-term consequences and considerable healthcare costs. The application of new nursing interventions aimed at reducing distressing behaviors and at increasing patient comfort is an important part of the care and, until now, there are no defined guidelines. Aromatherapy has been demonstrated to be efficient in several other neurological disorders for the treatment of somatic and emotional diseases and to promote patient health. In the management of stroke patients, aromatherapy is still in its infancy. The first evidence coming from animal models demonstrated a consistent and reliable neuroprotective effect in reducing cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. In the last few years, some preliminary data being to be collected in humans revealed significant influence in reducing patients' pain and emotional distress. In this perspective study, we sought to summarize, for the first time, the main findings emerging from this new field of study, discussing the future opportunities to be translated into primary care practice.

AB  - Background and objective People with psychosis report experiences of highly traumatic events. Positive change or post-traumatic growth (PTG) can occur as a result of traumatic experiences. Yet there is limited attention on PTG in psychosis, possibly due to the negative impact of psychotic symptoms on functioning and quality of life. The aim of this review was to identify significant correlates and mediators of PTG in psychosis, and to develop a conceptual framework synthesising facilitators of PTG in psychosis. Method Ten electronic databases were searched in seven languages, and five journals and grey literature were searched in English. Quantitative studies were eligible if examining correlates, mediators, or the temporal relationship between PTG and one or more variables. Qualitative studies were eligible if describing PTG arising from experiences of psychosis. Findings from quantitative papers were grouped by analysis method, with significant correlates, mediators, and temporal relationships descriptively reported upon. Narrative synthesis was conducted on findings in qualitative papers. Results Thirty-seven papers were included. Significant correlates and mediators of PTG were identified. Mediators of PTG in psychosis included meaning in life, coping self-efficacy, core beliefs, and self-reported recovery. No studies describing the temporal relationship between PTG and psychosis were identified. The narrative synthesis identified seven facilitators of PTG in psychosis: Personal identity and strength, Receiving support, Opportunities and possibilities, Strategies for coping, Perspective shift, Emotional experience, and Relationships, giving the acronym PROSPER. Conclusions Individuals with psychosis can be supported to grow from traumatic experiences. Clinicians can support PTG through the provision of trauma-informed care that supports positively valued identity changes. For researchers, the findings provide an evidence-based theoretical framework for conceptualising PTG, which can be validated through longitudinal cohort studies and underpin the development of new clinical interventions.

AB  - Background Children with hearing loss are at increased risk of mental health conditions, including behavioural problems, but there is limited evidence about available mental health support. Aims We aimed to map the evidence on mental health support for children and adolescents with hearing loss. Method Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and grey literature databases were searched until April 2021. Articles of any study design were eligible if they described an intervention supporting the mental health of children with hearing loss. No restrictions were placed on geography or publication date. Four reviewers independently screened results by title, abstract and full text. Study characteristics and outcome data were extracted, with results narratively synthesised. Results From 5629 search results, 27 articles were included. A large majority of the studies (81%, n = 22) were from high-income settings, with two-thirds (67%, n = 18) conducted in the USA. Less than half (41%, n = 11) of the articles adopted experimental research designs, and the majority of studies included small samples. The interventions presented were diverse, with the majority either therapy based (30%, n = 8) or skills training (30%, n = 8). Interventions included ice-skating, parent-child interaction therapy and resilience training. When measured, interventions demonstrated at least some evidence of effectiveness, although this was not always assessed with gold-standard methodology. Conclusions The evidence is lacking in breadth, study quality and geographical spread. That said, what is available indicates a range of effective approaches to support the mental health of children with hearing loss. Additional research is needed to improve the breadth of evidence on mental health support for this population.

There has not, however, been a broad systematic review in the field of Positive Psychology exploring the relationship between social media and wellbeing, to inform healthy social media use, and to identify if, and how, social media can support human flourishing.Objectives: To investigate the conditions and activities associated with flourishing through social media use, which might be described as 'Flourishing through Social Media'.Method and Results: A systematic search of peer reviewed studies, identifying flourishing outcomes from usage, was conducted, resulting in 118 final studies across 7 social media platforms, 50,000+ participants, and 26 countries.Conclusions: The interaction between social media usage and flourishing is bi-directional and nuanced. Analysis through our proposed conceptual framework suggests potential for a virtuous spiral between self-determination, identity, social media usage, and flourishing.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have described higher rates of psychotic disorder diagnoses in transgender, as compared to cisgender, individuals. With the exception of this work and a small number of published case studies, however, there has been little consideration of gender diversity in psychosis research or clinical care. In this paper, we will review and critically evaluate the limited literature on gender diversity and clinical psychosis and articulate the critical need for more work in this field, more specifically on the following areas and how they bear on clinical care: 1) diagnostic biases; 2) how chronic non-affirmation and bias, gender dysphoria, and other gender minority stressors may operate as trauma and can contribute to clinically significant psychotic symptoms; 3) the potential impact of gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapies, on mental health and barriers for receiving such care in transgender and nonbinary individuals; and 4) culturally-sensitive and gender-affirming approaches for addressing psychosis. Finally, we consider ways in which researchers may engage in ethical, gender-affirming, and accurate approaches to better address gender identity in psychosis research. We hope that such research will aid in the creation of clinical guidelines for understanding, diagnosing, and treating psychosis in gender diverse individuals.

AB  - Introduction: Neuroimaging studies of intellectual disability (ID) have been published over the last three decades, but the findings are often inconsistent, and therefore, the neural correlates of ID remain elusive. This article aims to study the different publications in task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and different ID populations to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis on this field.
   Methods: After duplicates were removed, only 10 studies matching our inclusion criteria were incorporated. Moreover, a quality assessment of the included studies was done. Qualitative results of the different articles were analyzed, separated by type of task and type of ID. Seed-based d mapping (SDM) software was used.
   Results: The right temporal gyms was more activated in control subjects than in ID. Concretely, the right temporal gyms is implicated in many cognitive domains as semantic memory processing and language. Moreover, it can be highly influenced by the type of task used in every study. Heterogeneity was not detected. A jackknife sensitivity analysis was also estimated to improve the analysis reliability, and both results were confirmed.
   Conclusions: More task-fMRI studies on ID must be published to add larger samples to address the pathophysiological questions more directly.

AB  - Depression is a major mental health disorder, and its pathophysiology is still largely unknown, as is the action mechanism of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Some evidence suggests that inflammation might play a role in depression, and several studies have attempted to demonstrate a link between ECT and cytokines. This systematic review used a qualitative analysis to assess the effect of ECT on inflammatory markers as it relates to the clinical response of depressive symptoms in major depressive disorders. The bibliographic search engines CINAHL, Embase, PsychInfo, and PubMed were used to identify articles published up to July 2020. Search terms related to depression, ECT, and inflammation were used. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to relate changes in inflammatory markers to clinical response to ECT. Twenty-five studies were included in the analysis. No systematic increases or decreases were found in a given inflammatory marker over the ECT; however, we observed that tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were more often found to be decreased after ECT, whereas IL-8 and IL-10 were more often found to be increased after treatment. No trend in correlation was found between the degree of clinical improvement of depressive symptoms and the variation of any inflammatory markers, despite positive clinical response to ECT. Great heterogeneity with regard to methodology used and lack of power of the studies included in this review could explain the lack of systematic change and correlation found in this study. Future research conducted on this subject should take into account these methodological limitations to allow subsequent meta-analysis.

AB  - Objectives. - Body expression of mental disorders is common in adolescence. Only two literature reviews over the last five years have been identified about somatoform disorders in children., The present article provides a systematic review of articles in English, which concern "Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders" according to the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 5th Edition) among adolescents. Methods. - The article search was made on Medline, Psychinfo, Google Scholar, BiomedCentral, Central and tripdatabase (for grey literature) according to PRISMA criteria and with the items "somatoform disorders" or "somatic symptom disorders". An age filter was applied for "adolescents", and a selection was done from the last five years. All articles concerning adolescents (often associated with children) were initially included, except for articles concerning eating disorders, dysmorphic disorders or adult population. Comments, editorials, opinion or descriptive articles were also excluded. The authors then carried out an analysis of the main topics, themes and questions covered in the selected publications and presented a descriptive synthesis. Results. - A total of seventy-seven publications were included in the analysis, from three hundred and seventy-two publications. First, the terms used to refer to these "somatic symptom disorders" were varied, such as "somatization", "somatic complaints/symptoms", "functional disorder", "unexplained symptoms" and "somatoform disorders". Then, studies related just to adolescents were limited: most of studies inclu-ded children and adolescents in their methodologies; and some of them questioned somatic symptoms from a developmental perspective. Case reports were the most represented articles among all medical spe-cialties, with clinical descriptions about "functional neurological symptom disorder", "factitious disorder" and "somatic symptom disorder" with a medical disease, among children and adolescents. We sometimes observed a controversial borderline between psychological and somatic disorders. Various explanatory models appeared, especially the trauma path; familial and social environment was also pointed out, with a possible peer group effect; neurocognitive theories were finally described. The literature highlights the effectiveness of psychosocial therapies (especially the cognitive-behavioral therapy) and the importance of multidisciplinary management. Finally, a few studies with a qualitative methodology are represented. Conclusions. - Only nine articles included "somatic symptom disorder" in their titles, despite a terminology valued by many authors (compared to "somatoform disorders" from the DSM-IV). The heterogeneity of terminologies, case reports and explanatory models witness a lack of connexions between medical specialties. This could explain in part the wandering of adolescents and their families in the health care system. It could also contribute to the delay before diagnosis, especially when neurological symptoms exist, and a late referral for psychiatric consultation. Further studies are needed to understand difficulties to use a clinical pathway among medical specialties, when the benefit of amultidisciplinary approach seems to be unanimous.

AB  - Simple Summary Postpartum depression (PPD) is a public health problem. Exercise is a nonpharmacologic alternative to deal with PPD. This study conducted a systematic review of previous meta-analyses and an exploratory pooled analysis regarding the effects of exercise on depressive symptoms among women during the postpartum period. We searched for previous meta-analyses of experimental studies. Of the 52 records selected, we included five in the analyses, because they were focused on PPD. From the results, it was clear that exercise had a significant but small effect on depressive symptoms. This study shows that exercise is effective in reducing PPD symptoms.

The results revealed a significant moderate effect of exercise on depressive symptoms among women during the postpartum period (SMD = -0.53; 95% CI: -0.80 to -0.27, p < 0.001). The pooled effect of the five meta-analyses established that exercise had a significant, small effect on depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.41; 95% CI: -0.50 to -0.32, p < 0.001). Our study indicates that exercise is effective in reducing PPD symptoms. Compared with traditional control approaches (psychosocial and psychological interventions), exercise seems have a superior effect on PPD symptoms. The implications of the present synthesis of past meta-analytical findings to guide health policies and research are discussed.

AB  - Aims Retirement is a major life transition that may improve or worsen mental health, including depression. Existing studies provide contradictory results. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to quantitatively pool available evidence on the association of retirement and depressive symptoms. Methods We applied PRISMA guidelines to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to retrieve, quantitatively pool and critically evaluate the association between retirement and both incident and prevalent depression and to understand better the potential role of individual and contextual-level determinants. Relevant original studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library, through 4 March 2021. Subgroup and sensitivity meta-analyses were conducted by gender, study design (longitudinal v. cross-sectional studies), study quality score (QS) and considering studies using validated scales to diagnose depression. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with I-2 statistics. Results Forty-one original studies met our a priori defined inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis on more than half a million subjects (n = 557 111) from 60 datasets suggested a protective effect of retirement on the risk of depression [effect size (ES) = 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74-0.93], although with high statistical heterogeneity between risk estimates (chi(2) = 895.19, df = 59, I-2 = 93.41%, p-value < 0.0001). Funnel plot asymmetry and trim and fill method suggested a minor potential publication bias. Results were consistent, confirm their robustness and suggest stronger protective effects when progressively restricting the included studies based on quality criteria: (i) studies with the highest QS [55 datasets, 407 086 subjects, ES = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.71-0.91], (ii) studies with a high QS and using validated assessment tools to diagnose depression (44 datasets, 239 453 subjects, ES = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.65-0.88) and (iii) studies of high quality, using a validated tool and with a longitudinal design (24 datasets, 162 004 subjects, ES = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.64-0.90). We observed a progressive reduction in funnel plot asymmetry. About gender, no statistically significant difference was found (females ES = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.61-1.02 v. men ES = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.68-1.11). Conclusions Pooled data suggested that retirement reduces by nearly 20% the risk of depression; such estimates got stronger when limiting the analysis to longitudinal and high-quality studies, even if results are affected by high heterogeneity. As retirement seems to have an independent and protective effect on mental health and depressive symptoms, greater flexibility in retirement timing should be granted to older workers to reduce their mental burden and avoid the development of severe depression. Retirement may also be identified as a target moment for preventive interventions, particularly primary and secondary prevention, to promote health and wellbeing in older ages, boosting the observed impact.

AB  - Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments able to reverse nigral degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), hence the unmet need for the provision of neuroprotective agents. Cannabis-derived phytocannabinoids (CDCs) and resveratrol (RSV) may be useful neuroprotective agents for PD due to their anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. To evaluate this, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature to assess the neuroprotective effects of CDCs and RSV treatments in pre-clinical in vivo animal models of PD. The literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science core collection were systematically searched to cover relevant studies. A total of 1034 publications were analyzed, of which 18 met the eligibility criteria for this review. Collectively, the majority of PD rodent studies demonstrated that treatment with CDCs or RSV produced a significant improvement in motor function and mitigated the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Biochemical analysis of rodent brain tissue suggested that neuroprotection was mediated by anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. This review highlights the neuroprotective potential of CDCs and RSV for in vivo models of PD and therefore suggests their potential translation to human clinical trials to either ameliorate PD progression and/or be implemented as a prophylactic means to reduce the risk of development of PD.

AB  - Background: In recent years, the possibility of intervening humans with animal-assisted therapy (AAT) has been growing due to numerous physical, psychological, and social benefits provided to humanity, enabling them to maintain or improve their quality of life. There exist different animals through which this therapy can be performed. The purpose of this systematic review will focus on the effects of AAT in several neurological diseases. Methods: The search of clinical trials was carried out in the PubMed, Scielo, Embase and PEDro databases. The selection of articles was made according to the different inclusion and exclusion criteria, incorporating those that approached neurological diseases to be reviewed. Results: Twenty-five clinical trials were identified, seventeen of which were finally included in the review. The results indicate that animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in different neurological diseases has many benefits in several areas, for example, in motor and physical ability as well as in mental and behavioural health. Conclusions: This systematic review provides occupational therapy practitioners with evidence on the use of activity based on animal-assisted therapy as a novel field of intervention that can complement other therapies and obtain benefits in different populations.

AB  - Objective Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has attracted considerable attention as a serious mental and public health issue worldwide. Currently, there are no established treatment guidelines for IGD. Herein, we review the latest findings on the efficacy and related neural effects of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for individuals with IGD. Methods A database search of relevant studies published between 2007 and 2020 was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Twenty-seven studies were reviewed for current evidence related to the efficacy and neural effects of pharmacological and psychosocial IGD treatments. Results Pharmacological studies suggest that bupropion may play a significant role in IGD. Additionally, nuclear imaging studies on IGD have demonstrated functional impairment of the dopamine system, providing a neurobiological basis for the efficacy of dopamine enhancing drugs. Among the various psychosocial interventions, current evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy may be an effective intervention for IGD. Cognitive behavioral therapy and bupropion were found to influence resting-state functional connectivity within the cortico-subcortical circuit and default mode network, suggesting a possible neural mechanism. Innovative approaches, including virtual reality treatment, residential camps, voluntary abstinence, and transcranial direct current stimulation, have shown promising results. However, methodological limitations, such as the absence of proper controls, small sample sizes, short duration, inconsistency of inclusion criteria across studies, and self-report measures of outcome, hamper conclusions regarding the efficacy of treatments. Conclusion Ongoing basic research and clinical trials overcoming these limitations could add to the existing knowledge on IGD and contribute to the development of evidence-based treatments

AB  - Introduction: Memory is defined as the ability to store, maintain and retrieve information. Learning is the acquisition of information that changes behavior and memory. Stress, dementia, head trauma, amnesia, Alzheimer's, Huntington, Parkinson's, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) may be mentioned among the diseases in which memory and learning are affected. The task of understanding deficits in memory and learning in humans is daunting due to the complexity of neural and cognitive mechanisms in the nervous system. This job is made more difficult for clinicians and researchers by the fact that many techniques used to research memory are not ethically acceptable or technically feasible for use in humans. Thus, animal models have been necessary alternative for studying normal and disordered learning and memory. This review attempts to bridge these domains to allow biomedical researchers to have a firm grasp of "memory" and "learning" as constructs in humans whereby they may then select the proper animal cognitive test. Results and conclusion: Various tests (open field habituation test, Y-maze test, passive avoidance test, stepdown inhibitory avoidance test, active avoidance test, 8-arms radial maze test, Morris water maze test, radial arm water maze, novel object recognition test and gait function test) have been designed to evaluate different kinds of memory. Each of these tests has their strengths and limits. Abnormal results obtained using these tasks in nonhuman animals indicate malfunctions in memory which may be due to several physiological and psychological diseases of nervous system. Further studies by using the discussed tests can be very beneficial for achieving a therapeutic answer to these diseases.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its component factors, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, have shown a bidirectional relationship with the prevalence and severity of bipolar disorder (BD). A systematic search of electronic databases (Pubmed, PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov) was conducted to explore and integrate current evidence about the role of MetS and its component factors with clinical outcomes of BD. Thirty-four articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies were grouped by the metabolic factors assessed, which included MetS, obesity and body mass index (BMI), dyslipidaemia, impaired glucose metabolism (IGM), diabetes mellitus and hypertension. They were then classified according to outcomes such as course of episodes, rapid cycling, suicidal behavior, treatment response, and global and cognitive functioning. Although current evidence remains controversial in most aspects of clinical outcomes, metabolic risk factors could alter the course of BD, with worse global functioning, poorer treatment response and a chronic course of illness, as well as enhancing rapid cycling. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of each risk factor in the mentioned outcomes.

AB  - Introduction The bioethics literature reflects significant interest in and concern with the use of genetic and genomic information in various settings. Because psychiatric treatment and research raises unique ethical, legal, and social issues, we conducted a scoping review of the biomedical, bioethics, and psychology literature regarding the application of genetic and genomic tools to psychiatric disorders (as listed in the DSM-5) and two associated behaviors or symptoms to provide a more detailed overview of the state of the field. Objectives The primary objective was to examine the available bioethics, biomedical, and psychology literature on applying genetic and genomic tools to psychiatric disorders (other than neurodevelopmental disorders) and two behaviors or symptoms sometimes associated with them (aggression or violence and suicidality) to identify the disorders to which these tools have been applied, the contexts in or purposes for which they have been applied, the ethical, legal, or social concerns associated with those uses, and proposed recommendations for mitigating those concerns. Methods We used Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework: (1) identify the research question; (2) identify relevant studies; (3) select studies; (4) chart the data; and (5) collate, summarize, and report results (2005). We relied on Levac et al. to inform our application of the framework (2010). The PRISMA extension for scoping reviews checklist informed our reporting (2018). We searched three electronic databases MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and PsycInfo (EbscoHost) for peer-reviewed journal articles in English to identify relevant literature. One author screened the initial results and additional screening was done in consultation with other authors. A data extraction form using DSM-5 diagnostic categories (excluding neurodevelopmental disorders) was developed and two authors independently each reviewed approximately half of the articles. Inter-rater reliability was ensured by double-coding approximately 10% of the papers. An additional author independently coded 10% of the articles to audit the data. Results In 365 coded publications, we identified 15 DSM-5 diagnostic categories in addition to the two pre-selected behaviors or symptoms (aggression or violence and suicidality) to which genetic or genomic tools have been applied. We identified 11 settings in or purposes for which these tools were applied. Twenty-two types of ethical, legal, or social concerns associated with the application of genetic or genomic tools to these disorders or behaviors/symptoms were identified along with 13 practices or policies that could mitigate these concerns. Conclusion Genetic and genomic tools have been applied to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. These raise a range of ethical, legal, and social concerns. Additional research is warranted to better understand the concerns and effective ways to address them. Advancing the literature to identify relevant ethical, legal, or social concerns and solutions to those problems likely requires greater attention to specific applications of genetic or genomic tools to particular psychiatric disorders and associated behaviors/symptoms as well as broad stakeholder engagement.

AB  - Childhood adversity is associated with a host of mental and physical health problems across the lifespan. Individuals who have experienced childhood adversity (e.g., child abuse and neglect, family conflict, poor parent/child relationships, low socioeconomic status or extreme poverty) are at a greater risk for morbidity and premature mortality than those not exposed to childhood adversity. Several mechanisms likely contribute to the relationship between childhood adversity and health across the lifespan (e.g., health behaviors, cardiovascular reactivity). In this paper, we review a large body of research within the field of psychoneuroimmunology, demonstrating the relationship between early life stress and alterations of the immune system. We first review the literature demonstrating that childhood adversity is associated with immune dysregulation across different indices, including proinflammatory cytokine production (and its impact on telomere length), illness and infection susceptibility, latent herpesvirus reactivation, and immune response to a tumor. We then summarize the growing literature on how childhood adversity may alter epigenetic processes. Finally, we propose future directions related to this work that have basic and applied implications.

AB  - Experiencing bereavement due to the death of a close person is rife in the lives of young people. This review aimed to investigate how bereavement affects educational outcomes of students at various educational levels and what factors may be involved in moderating these outcomes. The systemic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines with searches of peer-reviewed literature in Embase, Emcare, Medline, PsycINFO and Scopus. Twenty-two studies (17 quantitative and 5 qualitative) were included. In general, bereavement can constitute a barrier to educational achievement in young people compromising academic performance, and educational engagement and attainment. Several factors can place young people at greater risk of experiencing this disadvantage and further research into these mechanisms and interventions to mitigate short- and long-term consequences, especially among high-risk groups, is warranted.

AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare disease that severely compromises health and interferes with the lives of those who suffer from it and is especially challenging in adolescence. The use of tools such as MHealth may benefit the physical and psychological health of adolescents with CF. Therefore, this study aims to examine the benefits of MHealth in adolescents with CF through a systematic review. A search of the scientific literature following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted in the ProQuest Central, PubMed, Web Of Science, Embase and inDICE databases, resulting in 186 studies, of which seven were selected (based on inclusion and exclusion criteria). Two blinded evaluators conducted the searches, the selection and data extraction process and the quality evaluation of the studies. The agreement between evaluators was excellent in all cases (Kappa ranged from .78 to .96). 214 pediatric CF patients (61.71% female) participated in the final analysis. The mean age was 12.76 years. The studies evaluated different types of mHealth tools, with greater homogeneity in the independent and dependent variables. The quality of the studies analyzed was poor, since these had small samples selected for convenience, conducted non-experimental and low-quality designs, recorded few variables, and their statistical analyses were not sufficiently robust. Further research is needed in this field, improving research designs and considering physical and psychological adjustment variables, as well as patients and family members in the process of health improvement.

AB  - Resilience to stressful life events has received considerable attention in both clinical and preclinical studies. A number of neural substrates have been identi-fied as putatively mediating resilience to stress. However, there remains consid-erable diversity in how resilience is defined and studied. This article aims to examine how resilience is defined and conceptualized in social psychology, public health, and related fields, to better inform the understanding of stress re-silience in the neurobiological context, and to differentiate resilience from other patterns of response to stressful experiences. An understanding of resilience through the lens of clinical and applied sciences is likely to lead to the identifica-tion of more robust and reproducible neural substrates, though many challenges remain.

AB  - Background: Families are integrally involved in day-to-day caregiving of children with neurodevelopmental and intellectual disabilities (NDID). Given the widespread and increasing prevalence of children with NDID and the impact of family caregiving on psychological, social, and economic implications for both the child and family, understanding and supporting these families is an important public health concern.Objective: We conducted a scoping review on peer support networks to understand their implications on families. Considering increasing prevalence of NDID's, understanding the implications of existing networks is critical to improve and nurture future support networks that can complement and reduce the burden on existing formal support systems.Design: A comprehensive search of multiple databases was conducted. Articles were screened by two reviewers and any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. We explored existing research on parent-to-parent peer support networks, which included networks that developed informally as well as those that involved a formal facilitator for the group interpersonal processes. There were no limits on the study design, date and setting of the articles. We included all research studies in English that included an identifier for (i) "peer support networks," (ii) "children with neurodevelopmental and intellectual disabilities" and (iii) "family caregiver outcomes."Results: We identified 36 articles. Majority of the studies were conducted in North America, and were face to face networks. They included families of children with a wide range of NDIDs. Relevant information extracted from different studies highlighted peer support network characteristics and development process, needs of family caregivers attending these networks, factors affecting caregiver participation and the impact of peer support networks on family caregivers. These networks represent a way to strengthen family caregivers, developing resilience and social interactions. Family caregivers sharing similar experiences support one another and provide critical information to each other. Although results are encouraging, future studies incorporating improved study designs are needed to better evaluate the effectiveness of peer support networks. Furthermore, studies where peer support networks develop organically while the child is supported are warranted.Conclusion: Although results obtained are encouraging, our findings support the need for further research studies of peer support networks with better designs and more detailed description of the factors involved in the development.

AB  - Introduction Suicide is one of the main causes of death in adults and adolescents, so research focused on identifying risk factors for suicidal behavior is needed. In recent years, emotion regulation, mainly the presence of difficulties regulating one's own negative emotions, has been associated with negative mental health outcomes. Objective The purpose of this study was to systematically review the available evidence on the association between emotion regulation and suicide (ideation and attempt) in both adults and adolescents. Method A systematic search of scientific articles published in English and Spanish was carried out through the databases PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Results We identified 76 eligible studies, of which 70 reported that people with difficulties in emotion regulation reported higher levels of suicide ideation and more suicide attempts. The results were consistent in adolescents and adults, in clinical and general population samples, and when studies assessed both emotion regulation processes and strategies. However, few studies were longitudinal and most of them were with women. Conclusions We discuss the theoretical implications of the results, suggesting that actual psychological models might benefit from considering individual differences in ER in understanding why people engage in suicide behavior. Clinical implications are also discussed.

AB  - Background Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that 20% of adults with chronic physical diseases experience concomitant depression, increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality. Low intensity psychosocial interventions, such as self-management, are part of recommended treatment; however, no systematic review has evaluated the effects of depression self-management interventions for this population. The primary objective was to examine the effect of self-management interventions on reducing depressive symptomatology in adults with chronic disease(s) and co-occurring depressive symptoms. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of these interventions on improving other psychosocial and physiological outcomes (e.g., anxiety, glycemic control) and to assess potential differential effect based on key participant and intervention characteristics (e.g., chronic disease, provider). Methods Studies comparing depression self-management interventions to a control group were identified through a) systematic searches of databases to June 2018 [MEDLINE (1946 -), EMBASE (1996 -), PsycINFO (1967 -), CINAHL (1984 -)] and b) secondary 'snowball' search strategies. The methodological quality of included studies was critically reviewed. Screening of all titles, abstracts, and full texts for eligibility was assessed independently by two authors. Data were extracted by one author and verified by a second. Results Fifteen studies were retained: 12 for meta-analysis and three for descriptive review. In total, these trials included 2064 participants and most commonly evaluated interventions for people with cancer (n = 7) or diabetes (n = 4). From baseline to < 6-months (T1), the pooled mean effect size was - 0.47 [95% CI -0.73, - 0.21] as compared to control groups for the primary outcome of depression and - 0.53 [95% CI -0.91, - 0.15] at >= 6-months (T2). Results were also significant for anxiety (T1) and glycemic control (T2). Self-management skills of decision-making and taking action were significant moderators of depression at T1. Conclusion Self-management interventions show promise in improving depression and anxiety in those with concomitant chronic physical disease. The findings may contribute to the development of future Self-management interventions and delivering evidence-based care to this population. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to identify sources of heterogeneity and investigate key intervention components.

AB  - Unipolar depressive disorder (UDD) affects more than 264 million people worldwide and was projected well before the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic to be the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years lost in 2030. It is imperative for leading economies to implement preventive strategies targeted towards UDD, given consistent policies are currently lacking. Recently established similarities between the aetiological hypotheses of depression and cardiometabolic diseases are shifting paradigms within this field. It is believed that dietary practices could potentially reduce the incidence of depression; similar to their effects on metabolism. Thus, the aim of this review was to compile current evidence on healthy dietary patterns as suitable contributors towards primary prevention strategies against UDD. Most of the well-known biological mechanisms behind depression have been positively associated with healthful diets and dietary patterns to varying degrees. Interestingly, a common factor of UDD is the production and overall effects of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein. These compounds have been associated with depressive symptoms, disturbances in neuroendocrine function, leaky gut, monoamine activity and brain function, while also being key factors in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MD) in particular, is well supported by first-level evidence regarding its preventive qualities against metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and thus considered a model for healthy eating by various organizations. In one of the few clinical trials investigating these associations, the PREDIMED trial, individuals with diabetes assigned to a MD supplemented with mixed tree nuts experienced a 41% relative risk reduction for developing depression. Lastly, there is a need to include health related quality of life as an indicator of physical and mental well-being, considering its putative associations with depression and suicide risk. Going forward, focusing on clinical trials, using precise nutritional assessments, and identifying nutritional biomarkers which may be related to depression are needed to fully support the implementation of dietary recommendations in the field of psychiatry.

AB  - Currently, psychiatry lacks a field that can be called "theoretical psychiatry ", which uses theoretical concepts and explanatory models: The main stream of research is to collect data of all kinds in the hope that the computational Big Data approach will shed a bright light on the black box of mental disorders. Accordingly, the biology-based Research Domain Criteria of the National Institute of Mental Health have been established. However, as philosophical analyses of concepts and methods have shown, several epistemological gaps stand in the way of a consistent multilevel understanding of mental disorders. Also, the implicit ontological problems in the biological reduction of the psychosocial level and in the integration of so-called hard and soft disciplines are mostly left out. As a consequence, a non-reductive psychological theory of mental disorders is sought that also integrates correlating biological and sociological issues. In this context, one example of promising nonreductive psychiatric research is the option of systems/network psychopathology. The possibilities for integrating different psychological perspectives are highlighted for the field of addiction research and treatment, where pragmatic behaviorist approaches dominate over the theory-based practice of psychoanalysis. In comparing the theoretical constructs of these two approaches, the relevance of the concept of "(social) environment " as the wealth of influential sociocultural factors is discussed at levels superior to the interpersonal micro-level, namely the organizational meso- and societal macro level, which is not sufficiently considered in current biopsychiatry. On this basis of argumentation, the usefulness of grounding and framing psychiatry through the field of ecological sciences, especially human ecology, is demonstrated. Finally, to this end, an outline of an ecological model of mental health and illness is presented.

AB  - There is evidence for the positive impact of mindfulness in children. However, little is known about the techniques through which mindfulness practice results in differential outcomes. Therefore, this study intended to systematically review the available evidence about the efficacy of meditation techniques used by mindfulness-based programs on cognitive, socio-emotional, and academic skills of children from 6 to 12 years of age. The review was registered on the PROSPERO database, and the literature search was conducted according to PICO criteria and PRISMA guidelines. The EBSCO databases were searched, and 29 studies were eligible: nine randomized controlled trials and 20 quasi-experimental studies. All the included randomized controlled trials were rated as having a high risk of bias. Overall, the evidence for mindfulness techniques improving cognitive and socio-emotional skills was reasonably strong. Specifically, for cognitive skills, results showed that all the interventions used "body-centered meditations" and "mindful observations." Regarding socio-emotional skills, although all the studies applied "body-centered meditations" and "mindful observations," "affect-centered meditations" were also frequent. For academic skills, just one quasi-experimental trial found improvements, thus making it difficult to draw conclusions. Further research is crucial to evaluate the unique effects of different meditation techniques on the cognitive, social-emotional, and academic skills of children.Systematic Review Registration: Identifier: RD42019126767.

PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and Web of Science databases were searched. Outcomes, including pain, sleep quality, and adverse events, were investigated. Differences were expressed using mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The statistical analysis was performed using STATA 16.0. Twelve trials with 476 TBI patients were included. The included studies did not indicate a positive effect of CBT on pain. Significant improvements were shown for self-reported sleep quality, reported with the Pittsburgh Self-Reported Sleep Quality Index (MD, -2.30; 95% CI, -3.45 to -1.15; P<0.001) and Insomnia Severity Index (MD, -5.12; 95% CI, -9.69 to -0.55; P=0.028). No major adverse events related to CBT were reported. The underpowered evidence suggested that CBT is effective in the management of sleep quality and pain in TBI adults. Future studies with larger samples are recommended to determine significance. This trial is registered with PROSPERO registration number .

AB  - Burnout among healthcare personnel has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic's unique features. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide a complete assessment of the prevalence of burnout across various healthcare personnel. Until January 2021, systematic searches for English language papers were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. Thirty observational studies were found after conducting systematic searches. The pooled overall prevalence of burnout was 52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40-63%]. Pooled emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and lack of personal accomplishment (PA) were 51% (95% CI 42-61%), 52% (95% CI 39-65%), and 28% (95% CI 25-31%), respectively. This study demonstrated that nearly half of the healthcare workers experienced burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the studies that were included, non-frontline COVID-19 exposed healthcare personnel also experienced burnout. From high to lower middle-income countries, there was a gradient in the prevalence of total burnout, EE, and lack of PA. Further studies on burnout in low and lower-middle-income countries are suggested. A uniform diagnostic tool for the assessment of burnout is warranted.

AB  - Social media has rapidly transformed the ways in which adolescents socialize and interact with the world, which has contributed to ongoing public debate about whether social media is helping or harming adolescents. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified both the challenges and opportunities of adolescents' social-media use, which necessitates revisiting the conversation around teens and social media. In this article, we discuss key aspects of adolescent social-media use and socioemotional well-being and outline how these issues may be amplified in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use this as a springboard to outline key future research directions for the field, with the goal of moving away from reductionist approaches and toward a more nuanced perspective to understand the who, what, and when of social-media use and its impact on adolescent well-being. We conclude with a commentary on how psychological science can inform the translation of research to provide evidence-based recommendations for adolescent social-media use.

AB  - Brain-wide neural circuits enable bi- and quadrupeds to express adaptive locomotor behaviors in a context- and state-dependent manner, e.g., in response to threats or rewards. These behaviors include dynamic transitions between initiation, maintenance and termination of locomotion. Advances within the last decade have revealed an intricate coordination of these individual locomotion phases by complex interaction of multiple brain circuits. This review provides an overview of the neural basis of state-dependent modulation of locomotion initiation, maintenance and termination, with a focus on insights from circuit-centered studies in rodents. The reviewed evidence indicates that a brain-wide network involving excitatory circuit elements connecting cortex, midbrain and medullary areas appears to be the common substrate for the initiation of locomotion across different higher-order states. Specific network elements within motor cortex and the mesencephalic locomotor region drive the initial postural adjustment and the initiation of locomotion. Microcircuits of the basal ganglia, by implementing action-selection computations, trigger goal-directed locomotion. The initiation of locomotion is regulated by neuromodulatory circuits residing in the basal forebrain, the hypothalamus, and medullary regions such as locus coeruleus. The maintenance of locomotion requires the interaction of an even larger neuronal network involving motor, sensory and associative cortical elements, as well as defined circuits within the superior colliculus, the cerebellum, the periaqueductal gray, the mesencephalic locomotor region and the medullary reticular formation. Finally, locomotor arrest as an important component of defensive emotional states, such as acute anxiety, is mediated via a network of survival circuits involving hypothalamus, amygdala, periaqueductal gray and medullary premotor centers. By moving beyond the organizational principle of functional brain regions, this review promotes a circuit-centered perspective of locomotor regulation by higher-order states, and emphasizes the importance of individual network elements such as cell types and projection pathways. The realization that dysfunction within smaller, identifiable circuit elements can affect the larger network function supports more mechanistic and targeted therapeutic intervention in the treatment of motor network disorders.

AB  - Depression is a disabling, highly prevalent, frequently chronic, and difficult-to-treat disorder with an immense cognitive, social, and economic burden. Given that many of the advances in other non-communicable disorders like cancer have been in prevention rather than treatment, the prevention of depression is currently an unmet public health priority. We sought to provide an overview of the meta-analytic literature through conducting a systematic umbrella review of universally delivered preventive interventions for depression. The search was conducted on March 18, 2021 utilising the following databases (all accessed through EBSCOHost); Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL Complete, Global Health, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE Complete and APA PsychArticles. The following search terms related to depression, prevention, and trial study design. Two authors independently screened articles and a third resolved discrepancies. Eligibility criteria sought to identify meta-analyses that investigated the prevention of depression (i.e., reduced incidence) through intervention studies that were universal, in that they were designed to be delivered to entire populations Six meta-analyses on psychological interventions, two school-based meta-analyses, and one eHealth meta analysis were included in this umbrella review. Findings indicated that all identified studies were of good quality and one was of fair quality. One previous meta-review that examined physical activity to prevent depression was included in results, comprising eight meta-analyses. Preventive interventions have primarily and successfully utilized psychological therapeutic components, delivered at the school, community, and workplace settings. Both school-and eHealth-based interventions hold some utility for depression prevention. There is meta-analytic evidence that physical activity is efficacious for depression prevention. However, universal prevention is inconsistently defined. There is a pressing need for well-designed randomized controlled preventative interventions for depression before recommendations can be universally accepted with convincing level of evidence.

AB  - Objective This systematic literature search aimed to investigate the physical health status of first-degree relatives to patients with bipolar disorder. There is abundant evidence for familial aggregation of both bipolar disorders, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. However, a review gathering data on the physical health status in first-degree relatives to patients with bipolar disorder is missing. We hypothesized that first-degree relatives of bipolar probands would express higher rates of physical diseases and somatic morbidity. Method We conducted a systematic literature search in three different databases PubMed, Embase and PsychInfo. The search identified 10 studies comparing 24,277 unaffected first-degree relatives with 318.933 controls persons. Results Seven out of 10 studies showed that first-degree relatives had statistically significantly higher rates of one or more physical diseases or increased morbidity, including cardiovascular diseases, infections, autoimmune thyroiditis, pernicious anaemia, and higher mortality compared with control persons. Conclusion Findings from this systematic literature review did not unambiguously confirm a possible link between bipolar disorder and overall increased risk of physical diseases in first-degree relatives of probands with bipolar disorder. However, these results could suggest that first-degree relatives of probands with bipolar disorder could have a predisposition to poorer physical health than the general population and that this aspect warrants further investigation.

AB  - It has only been recently that fear of crime scholars have shifted their attention to online contexts. The current systematic review provides an overview of available studies on measurement, intensity and determinants of fear of cybercrime. While matters of measurement and conceptualisation has sprung a sizeable and vivid debate in the general fear of crime literature, we aim to scope this debate for the online context by scrutinizing the available knowledge base. At the same time, and by providing an overview of correlates of fear of cybercrime, we aim to provide a fertile ground for theory building specific to the online context. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, yielding a total of 28 relevant studies from a range of (sub)disciplines, using a variety of measures in terms of the particular emotion measured (fear, worry, anxiety) and the type of cybercrime it related to. We find considerable agreement between studies on classic fear of crime indicators such as gender, victimization and risk perception. At the same time, various studies report a relationship between fear of cybercrime and what is termed 'constrained behavior', as outcome measure. Implications of these findings, and future directions for fear of cybercrime research are discussed.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs), such as autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, are characterized by diverse facets of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, differing in etiology, onset and severity. Such symptoms include mental delay, cognitive and language impairments, or restrictions to adaptive and social behavior. Nevertheless, all have in common that critical milestones of brain development are disrupted, leading to functional deficits of the central nervous system and clinical manifestation in child- or adulthood. To approach how the different development-associated neuropathologies can occur and which risk factors or critical processes are involved in provoking higher susceptibility for such diseases, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying proper brain formation is required. NDDs rely on deficits in neuronal identity, proportion or function, whereby a defective development of the cerebral cortex, the seat of higher cognitive functions, is implicated in numerous disorders. Such deficits can be provoked by genetic and environmental factors during corticogenesis. Thereby, epigenetic mechanisms can act as an interface between external stimuli and the genome, since they are known to be responsive to external stimuli also in cortical neurons. In line with that, DNA methylation, histone modifications/variants, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, as well as regulatory non-coding RNAs regulate diverse aspects of neuronal development, and alterations in epigenomic marks have been associated with NDDs of varying phenotypes. Here, we provide an overview of essential steps of mammalian corticogenesis, and discuss the role of epigenetic mechanisms assumed to contribute to pathophysiological aspects of NDDs, when being disrupted.

AB  - Background In most trials and systematic reviews that evaluate exercise-based interventions in reducing depressive symptoms, it is difficult to separate treatment from prevention. Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise-based interventions in reducing depressive symptoms in people without clinical depression. Method We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, WOS, SPORTDiscus, CENTRAL, OpenGrey and other sources up to 25 May 2020. We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared exclusively exercise-based interventions with control groups, enrolling participants without clinical depression, as measured using validated instruments, and whose outcome was reduction of depressive symptoms and/or incidence of new cases of people with depression. Pooled standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated using random-effect models (registration at PROSPERO: CRD42017055726). Results A total of 14 RCTs (18 comparisons) evaluated 1737 adults without clinical depression from eight countries and four continents. The pooled SMD was -0.34 (95% CI -0.51 to -0.17; P < 0.001) and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of this result. We found no statistical evidence of publication bias and heterogeneity was moderate (I-2 = 54%; 95% CI 22-73%). Only two RCTs had an overall low risk of bias and three had long-term follow-up. Multivariate meta-regression found that a larger sample size, country (Asia) and selective prevention (i.e. people exposed to risk factors for depression) were associated with lower effectiveness, although only sample size remained significant when adjustment for multiple tests was considered. According to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool, the quality of evidence was low. Conclusions Exercise-based interventions have a small effect on the reduction of depressive symptoms in people without clinical depression. It could be an alternative to or complement psychological programmes, although further higher-quality trials with larger samples and long-term follow-up are needed.

AB  - Background: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients experience multiple uncomfortable symptoms, which may be alleviated using music-based intervention, a nondrug treatment. This umbrella review aims to combine the data of systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of music-based intervention in improving uncomfortable symptoms in ICU patients. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Airiti Library, CINAHL, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases, and Epistemonikos. The search had no language restrictions, and articles on the improvement of symptoms using music-based intervention in adult ICU patients were included. This review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021240327). Results: This umbrella review retrieved 5 systematic reviews and 41 original studies, including 39 randomized controlled trials, and 2 nonrandomized controlled trials. Diverse music was the most common music type used for music-based intervention, the intervention music was typically decided by the study participants (61%), and most subjects underwent one intervention session (78%). Furthermore, most music intervention sessions lasted for 30 min (44%). The positive results included decreased anxiety, decreased pain, decreased agitation, decreased anesthesia dose and sedative use, decreased chances of delirium, decreased feelings of uncomfort, and improved sleep quality. Conclusions: A systematic review on the effectiveness of music-based intervention in improving uncomfortable symptoms in ICU patients revealed that 20-30 min intervention sessions showed the best improvement in the uncomfortable symptoms in patients. This study provides a basis for using music-based intervention to relieve the uncomfortable symptoms in critically ill ICU patients, and a reference for empirical clinical practice.

AB  - Background: China accounts for 15% of the global suicide death toll, yet suicide research efforts in the country are not well known by international colleagues. Aims: We aimed to outline the development of suicide research in China, appraise research findings, and identify key contributors. Method: English and Chinese research publication databases were systematically searched and relevant papers were reviewed. Chinese and English publications were compared. Results: There are almost 10 times more Chinese publications than English ones. The research focuses of and key contributors to the Chinese and English literature exhibit more differences than commonalities. The field experienced rapid expansion in the new millennium with more and higher quality publications and more funding support. Psychosocial-oriented perspectives guided most of the papers. Poisoning by pesticide as a suicide method and youth as a subpopulation group received the most research attention. Limitations: The scoping review does not provide in-depth syntheses on specific topics and does not include more recent publications. Conclusion: Research on suicide in China has been actively carried out during the 30-year period we reviewed, which might have contributed to suicide prevention in China. Research gaps identified by the review should be addressed to sustain the achievements.

AB  - Cybersecurity (CS) is a contemporary field for research and applied study of a range of aspects from across multiple disciplines. A cybersecurity expert has an in-depth knowledge of technology but is often also recognized for the ability to view technology in a non-standard way. This paper explores how CS specialists are both a combination of professional computing-based skills and genetically encoded traits. Almost every human behavioral trait is a result of many genome variants in action altogether with environmental factors. The review focuses on contextualizing the behavior genetics aspects in the application of cybersecurity. It reconsiders methods that help to identify aspects of human behavior from the genetic information. And stress is an illustrative factor to start the discussion within the community on what methodology should be used in an ethical way to approach those questions. CS positions are considered stressful due to the complexity of the domain and the social impact it can have in cases of failure. An individual risk profile could be created combining known genome variants linked to a trait of particular behavior using a special biostatistical approach such as a polygenic score. These revised advancements bring challenging possibilities in the applications of human behavior genetics and CS.

TI  - Artificial intelligence to aid detection and diagnostic accuracy of mood disorders and predict suicide risk: A systematic review
KW  - MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER
KW  - CLASSIFICATION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mood disorders often are diagnosed by clinical interview, yet many cases are missed or misdiagnosed. Mood disorders increase the risk of suicide, making it imperative to diagnose and treat these disorders quickly. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been investigated for diagnosing mood disorders, but the merits of the literature have not been evaluated. This systematic review aims to understand and explain AI methods and evaluate their use in augmenting clinical diagnosis of mood disorders as well as identifying individuals at increased suicide risk. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of all studies until August 1, 2020 examining the efficacy of different AI techniques for diagnosing mood disorders and identifying individuals at increased suicide risk because of a mood disorder. RESULTS: Our literature search generated 13 studies (10 of mood disorders and 3 describing suicide risk) where AI techniques were used. Machine learning and artificial neural networks were most commonly used; both showed merit in helping to diagnose mood disorders and assess suicide risk. CONCLUSIONS: The data shows that AI methods have merit in improving the diagnosis of mood disorders as well as identifying suicide risk. More research is needed for bipolar disorder because only 2 studies explored this condition, and it is often misdiagnosed. Although only a few AI techniques are discussed in detail in this review, there are many more that can be employed, and should be evaluated in future studies.

AB  - Simple Summary: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that manifests as motor dysfunction and nonmotor symptoms (NMSs). Apart from motor symptoms, NMSs include sleep disorders, neuropsychiatric problems, and cognitive impairment, which negatively influence patients' daily lives and caregivers. Disturbances of the sleep cycle also worsen overall health, causing dysregulation of cortisol and melatonin secretion. Furthermore, bright light therapy (BLT) is a well-known treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders, seasonal affective disorders, and dementia-related sleep disturbances under the regulation of circadian rhythm by melatonin, a chronological pacemaker. BLT is also applied to treat depressive symptoms and bipolar disorder through unknown mechanisms. The present study, at first, conducted a literature review, which found that a few non-controlled studies demonstrated improvements in motor symptoms and NMSs in PD. Secondly, the present study performed a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials which treated the PD patients with BLT. The results revealed that BLT nonsignificantly alleviated symptoms of depression and sleep disorders in patients with PD. However, the inconsistency between BLT protocols, such as varied timing, dosages, and treatment durations, may render BLT's efficacy challenging to demonstrate, and future RCTs must be obtained.Sleep disorders and depression are significant nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) of Parkinson disease (PD). However, few effective, evidence-proven medical treatments are available for alleviating these symptoms. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a well-established treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders and seasonal affective disorder. The present study conducted a literature review for the effect of BLT on PD, especially a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched for studies using the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. The major outcomes were the effects on sleep and depression. The effect on motor symptoms was also analyzed as a secondary outcome. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020204454). Six studies were included in the literature review only, and the other five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Despite the positive effects of BLT on PD patients, which were demonstrated in noncontrolled studies, in the meta-analysis of the RCTs, BLT did not significantly improve the depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.48 to 0.17, p = 0.36) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) (SMD: -0.12, 95% CI: -0.49 to 0.25, p = 0.53) in PD patients. Regarding motor symptoms, no significant beneficial effects were conferred (SMD: -0.11, 95% CI: -0.44 to 0.21, p = 0.49). In conclusion, BLT did not significantly alleviate depression and sleepiness. The inconsistency between BLT protocols, such as the varied timing, dosages, and treatment durations, may render BLT's efficacy difficult to demonstrate. The small effect size obtained from the present meta-analysis indicates that future RCTs are necessary, for which BLT protocols are standardized and more patients are enrolled to determine whether a significant therapeutic benefit was conferred.

AB  - Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with increased health risks across the life course. We aimed to estimate the annual health and financial burden of ACEs for 28 European countries.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Criminal Justice Databases, and Education Resources Information Center for quantitative studies (published Jan 1, 1990, to Sept 8, 2020) that reported prevalence of ACEs and risks of health outcomes associated with ACEs. Pooled relative risks were calculated for associations between ACEs and harmful alcohol use, smoking, illicit drug use, high body-mass index, depression, anxiety, interpersonal violence, cancer, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and respiratory disease. Country-level ACE prevalence was calculated using available data. Country-level population attributable fractions (PAFs) due to ACEs were generated and applied to 2019 estimates of disability-adjusted life-years. Financial costs (US$ in 2019) were estimated using an adapted human capital approach.
   Findings In most countries, interpersonal violence had the largest PAFs due to ACEs (range 14.7-53.5%), followed by harmful alcohol use (15.7-45.0%), illicit drug use (15.2-44.9%), and anxiety (13.9%-44.8%). Harmful alcohol use, smoking, and cancer had the highest ACE-attributable costs in many countries. Total ACE-attributable costs ranged from $0.1 billion (Montenegro) to $129.4 billion (Germany) and were equivalent to between 1.1% (Sweden and Turkey) and 6.0% (Ukraine) of nations' gross domestic products.
   Interpretation Availability of ACE data varies widely between countries and country-level estimates cannot be directly compared. However, findings suggest ACEs are associated with major health and financial costs across European countries. The cost of not investing to prevent ACEs must be recognised, particularly as countries look to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted services and education, and potentially increased risk factors for ACEs.

AB  - Mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs), as the name suggests, are the membranes that physically and biochemically connect mitochondria with endoplasmic reticulum. MAMs not only structurally but also functionally connect these two important organelles within the cell which were previously thought to exist independently. There are multiple points of communication between ER-mitochondria and MAMs play an important role in both ER and mitochondria functions such as Ca2+ homeostasis, proteostasis, mitochondrial bioenergetics, movement, and mitophagy. The number of disease-related proteins and genes being associated with MAMs has been continually on the rise since its discovery. There is an overwhelming overlap between the biochemical functions of MAMs and processes affected in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). Thus, MAMs have received well-deserving and much delayed attention as modulators for ER-mitochondria communication and function. This review briefly discusses the recent progress made in this now fast developing field full of promise for very exciting future therapeutic discoveries.

AB  - Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people present poorer mental and physical health results compared to the heterosexual and cisgender population. There are barriers in the healthcare system that increase these health inequities. Objective: To synthesise the available evidence on how nurses can intervene in reducing health inequities in LGBT people, identifying their specific health needs and describing their experiences and perceptions of the barriers they face in the healthcare system. Methods: Systematic review. Between March and April 2021, a bibliographic search was carried out in the Cuiden, LILACS, PubMed, Dialnet, SciELO, Trip Database, and Web of Science databases and metasearch engines. Inclusion criteria: Articles published in the last 5 years that address the specific health needs of LGBT people, their experiences and perceptions, or interventions in this group in which nurses may engage. Results: A total of 16 articles were selected. Health disparities were detected in the LGBT community, which exhibited higher rates of mental health problems, substance abuse, risky sexual behaviours, self-harm, and suicide. These inequalities were related to minority stress, and each of them differently impacted individual populations within the broader LGBT community depending on their sexual orientations and gender identities. The impact of these factors was, in turn, modified by the intersections of race/ethnicity, geographic region, and socioeconomic factors. LGBT people described discriminatory experiences by health professionals, as well as their distrust and fear in this setting. Nurses can carry out interventions such as inclusive education about sex and sexual and gender diversity and bullying and suicide prevention programmes, and can provide gender-affirming and family-centred care. Conclusions: LGBT people experience health inequities and discrimination in the healthcare system. Nurses can implement diverse interventions to reduce these problems and, moreover, these health professionals are obliged to acquire cultural competence regarding LGBT health.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide a summary of the existing evidence on the prevalence of depression among cancer patients worldwide to assist health policymakers in adopting appropriate measures to prevent and control depression in these patients. EMBASE, Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched for original studies published in English from January 2000 to July 2019. The studies were screened on the basis of quality and relevance criteria. The statistical analyses were conducted in the R software. Out of 182,521 cancer patients examined in 183 studies, 49,280 (similar to 27%) had depression (95% confidence interval [CI] = 24%-30%). The highest prevalence of depression was among patients with colorectal cancer with 32% (95% CI = 20%-47%). Among countries, Pakistan with 43% (95% CI = 26%-64%), and among continents, Africa with 36% (95% CI = 29%-43%) had the highest prevalence of reported depression in cancer patients. Adjusting for sample size, the prevalence of depression among female cancer patients, 31% (95% CI = 26%-36%), was higher than men, 26% (95% CI = 21%-31%). The prevalence of depression among cancer patients is increasing by an average of 0.6% per year. The findings show higher prevalence of depression among cancer patients in underdeveloped and developing countries compared to the developed nations and the global average.

AB  - Baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been proposed as a transdiagnostic biomarker of stress vulnerability across psychopathologies, and a reliable association between PTSD, OCD and lower resting RSA was found. Contemplative practices have been linked to the activation of the vagus as well as to an increased RSA that, according to the polyvagal theory, reflects the activation of the ventral vagal complex (VVC) and may promote PTSD and OCD recovery. PubMed and Scopus databases were selected to conduct a search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, and A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) was used to appraise the methodological quality for this systematic review. Six articles met the inclusion criteria (one cross-sectional study, one study with pre-post measurements, two cohort studies and two RCT studies). Mindfulness-related interventions promoted parasympathetic activity, an increased vagal tone and improvements in PTSD and OCD symptoms. According to the polyvagal theory, mindfulness-related and compassion-related meditations would be conceptualized as neural exercises expanding the capacity of the ventral vagal complex to regulate the present state and to promote resilience. Clinical and methodological issues are discussed.

AB  - Most systematic reviews of the relationships between work-related psychosocial risks, health, and performance have only considered papers in English, thus ignoring, to a considerable extent, studies conducted in Latin America. In addition, most systematic reviews that have indeed included Latin-American studies have focused on only one occupation and one kind of psychosocial risk, which contributes to producing scattered empirical evidence of this relationship. This paper reports the results of a comprehensive and critical systematic review of 85 studies that examined the relationships between psychosocial risks, health, and performance across a wide range of organizational contexts in Latin America over the last ten years. The paper contributes to the organizational psychology literature by critically reviewing and integrating the most recent studies on this topic in Latin America, identifying their main limitations, and proposing future lines of research that update the debate on this relationship and move this field of study forward.

AB  - Background: Machine learning (ML) offers vigorous statistical and probabilistic techniques that can successfully predict certain clinical conditions using large volumes of data. A review of ML and big data research analytics in maternal depression is pertinent and timely, given the rapid technological developments in recent years.
   Objective: This study aims to synthesize the literature on ML and big data analytics for maternal mental health, particularly the prediction of postpartum depression (PPD).
   Methods: We used a scoping review methodology using the Arksey and O'Malley framework to rapidly map research activity in ML for predicting PPD. Two independent researchers searched PsycINFO, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and the ACM Digital Library in September 2020 to identify relevant publications in the past 12 years. Data were extracted from the articles'ML model, data type, and study results.
   Results: A total of 14 studies were identified. All studies reported the use of supervised learning techniques to predict PPD. Support vector machine and random forest were the most commonly used algorithms in addition to Naive Bayes, regression, artificial neural network, decision trees, and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). There was considerable heterogeneity in the best-performing ML algorithm across the selected studies. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values reported for different algorithms were support vector machine (range 0.78-0.86), random forest method (0.88), XGBoost (0.80), and logistic regression (0.93).
   Conclusions: ML algorithms can analyze larger data sets and perform more advanced computations, which can significantly improve the detection of PPD at an early stage. Further clinical research collaborations are required to fine-tune ML algorithms for prediction and treatment. ML might become part of evidence-based practice in addition to clinical knowledge and existing research evidence.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to investigate the association of burnout and vital exhaustion with measures of glycemic control and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to April 2, 2020. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. When possible, results were meta-analyzed using random-effects models and rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Results A total of 5317 titles/abstracts were screened, 140 articles were read full text, of which 29 studies were included. Eighteen studies were cross-sectional, three prospective and eight were case-control studies. Burnout and vital exhaustion were significantly associated with T2D, with a pooled odds ratio of 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4 to 2.4, I-2 = 79%; 9 studies). Glycated hemoglobin A(1c) levels were not significantly higher in people with burnout and vital exhaustion, compared to those without, with a pooled standardized mean difference of 0.35 (95% CI = -0.62 to 1.33, I-2 = 98%; 7 studies). In addition, no differences in glucose levels were observed (standardized mean difference = 0.02, 95% CI = -0.26 to 0.30, I-2 = 90%; 9 studies). Sensitivity analyses showed no decrease in heterogeneity when excluding studies with low quality (I-glucose(2) = 89%) or studies with a study n < 40 population (I-T2D(2) = 77%). The level of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation evidence was moderate to low quality because of 18 studies having a cross-sectional design. Conclusions Burnout and vital exhaustion might be associated with a higher risk of T2D, but not with glycemic control. Methodological shortcomings and high heterogeneity of the studies included complicate the interpretation of our results.

AB  - Objectives The early pathogenesis and precursors of Bipolar Disorder (BD) are poorly understood. There is some cross-sectional and retrospective evidence of affective lability as a predictor of BD, but this is subject to recall biases. The present review synthesises the prospective evidence examining affective lability and the subsequent development of BD at follow-up. Methods The authors performed a systematic search of PubMed, PsycInfo and Embase (1960-June 2020) and conducted hand searches to identify studies assessing affective lability (according to a conceptually-inclusive definition) at baseline assessment in individuals without a BD diagnosis, and a longitudinal follow-up assessment of bipolar (spectrum) disorders. Results are reported according to the PRISMA guidelines, and the synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting guidelines were used to strengthen the narrative synthesis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess risk of bias (ROB). Results 11 articles describing 10 studies were included. Being identified as having affective lability at baseline was associated with an increased rate of bipolar diagnoses at follow-up; this association was statistically significant in six of eight studies assessing BD type I/II at follow-up and in all four studies assessing for bipolar spectrum disorder (BSD) criteria. Most studies received a 'fair' or 'poor' ROB grade. Conclusions Despite a paucity of studies, an overall association between prospectively-identified affective lability and a later diagnosis of BD or BSD is apparent with relative consistency between studies. This association and further longitudinal studies could inform future clinical screening of those who may be at risk of BD, with the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate early intervention.

AB  - Introduction: Physician's burnout has been recognized as an increasing and significant work-related syndrome, described by the combination of emotional exhaustion (EE) and depersonalization (D), together with low personal accomplishment (PA). It has many negative consequences on personal, organizational, and patient care levels. This systematic review aimed to analyze research articles where psychological interventions with elements of mindfulness (PIMs) were used to support physicians in order to reduce burnout and foster empathy and well-being. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in May 2019, within six electronic databases PubMed, EBSCOhost MEDLINE, PsycArticles, Cochrane Library, JSTOR, and Slovenian national library information system. Different combinations of boolean operators were used-mindfulness, empathy, medicine/family medicine/general practice/primary care, burnout, doctors/physicians, intervention, and support group. Additional articles were manually searched from the reference list of the included articles. Studies with other healthcare professionals (not physicians and residents) and/or medical students, and those where PIMs were applied for educational or patient's treatment purposes were excluded. Results: Of 1194 studies identified, 786 screened and 139 assessed for eligibility, there were 18 studies included in this review. Regardless of a specific type of PIMs applied, results, in general, demonstrate a positive impact on empathy, well-being, and reduction in burnout in participating physicians. Compared with other recent systematic reviews, this is unique due to a broader selection of psychological interventions and emphasis on a sustained effect measurement. Conclusions: Given the pandemic of COVID-19, it is of utmost importance that this review includes also interventions based on modern information technologies (mobile apps) and can be used as an awareness-raising material for physicians providing information about feasible and easily accessible interventions for effective burnout prevention and/or reduction. Future research should upgrade self-reported data with objective psychological measures and address the question of which intervention offers more benefits to physicians.

AB  - Background Telepsychology is increasingly being implemented in mental health care. We conducted a scoping review on the best available research evidence regarding availability, efficacy and clinical utility of telepsychology in DBT. The review was performed using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Our aim was to help DBT-therapists make empirically supported decisions about the use of telepsychology during and after the current pandemic and to anticipate the changing digital needs of patients and clinicians. Methods A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycARTICLES and Web of Science. Search terms for telepsychology were included and combined with search terms that relate to DBT. Results Our search and selection procedures resulted in 41 articles containing information on phone consultation, smartphone applications, internet delivered skills training, videoconferencing, virtual reality and computer- or video-assisted interventions in DBT. Conclusions The majority of research about telepsychology in DBT has focused on the treatment mode of between-session contact. However, more trials using sophisticated empirical methodologies are needed. Quantitative data on the efficacy and utility of online and blended alternatives to standard (i.e. face-to-face) individual therapy, skills training and therapist consultation team were scarce. The studies that we found were designed to evaluate feasibility and usability. A permanent shift to videoconferencing or online training is therefore not warranted as long as face-to-face is an option. In all, there is an urgent need to compare standard DBT to online or blended DBT. Smartphone apps and virtual reality (VR) are experienced as an acceptable facilitator in access and implantation of DBT skills. In addition, we have to move forward on telepsychology applications by consulting our patients, younger peers and experts in adjacent fields if we want DBT to remain effective and relevant in the digital age.

AB  - Anxiety is a common complaint following acquired traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the measurement of dysfunctional anxiety behavioral states following experimental TBI in rodents is complex. Some studies report increased anxiety after TBI, whereas others find a decreased anxiety-like state, often described as increased risk-taking behavior or impulsivity. These inconsistencies may reflect a lack of standardization of experimental injury models or of behavioral testing techniques. Here, we review the most commonly employed unconditioned tests of anxiety and discuss them in a context of experimental TBI. Special attention is given to the effects of repeated testing, and consideration of potential sensory and motor confounds in injured rodents. The use of multiple tests and alternative data analysis methods are discussed, as well as the potential for the application of common data elements (CDEs) as a means of providing a format for documentation of experimental details and procedures of each published research report. CDEs may improve the rigor, reproducibility, as well as endpoint for better relating findings with clinical TBI phenotypes and the final goal of translation. While this may not resolve all incongruities in findings across laboratories, it is seen as a way forward for standardized and universal data collection for improvement of data quality and sharing, and advance therapies for neuropsychiatric symptoms that often present for decades following TBI.

AB  - Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are strong risk factors for homelessness and poor health and functioning. We aimed to evaluate the lifetime prevalence of ACEs and their associations with health-related and functioning-related outcomes among homeless adults.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched from database inception to Nov 11, 2020, for original and peer-reviewed studies in English that documented lifetime prevalence of ACEs or associations between ACEs and health-related or functioning-related outcomes. We selected studies if they included a definable group of homeless adults and measured at least four ACE categories. We calculated pooled estimates of lifetime prevalence of one or more ACEs and four or more ACEs with random-effects models. We used the leave-one-out method in sensitivity analyses and studied meta-regressions to explore potential moderators of ACE prevalence. We also did a narrative summary of associations between ACEs and health-related and functioning-related outcomes, as there were too few studies on each outcome for quantitative meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020218741.
   Findings We identified 2129 studies through systematic search, of which 29 studies (16 942 individuals) were included in the systematic review, 20 studies (10 034 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis for one or more ACEs, and 15 studies (5693 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis for four or more ACEs. Studies included samples of adults experiencing homelessness in the USA, Canada, and the UK; participants in the included studies were predominantly male (65.2%) and mean ages ranged between 18.3 and 58.1 years, but many studies did not report race, ethnicity, and sexual and gender minority data. Lifetime prevalence of one or more ACEs among homeless adults was 89.8% (95% CI 83.7-93.7) and the lifetime prevalence of four or more ACEs was 53.9% (45.9-61.7). Considerable heterogeneity was identified in both meta-analyses (I-2>95%). Of the potential moderators analysed, the ACE measurement tool significantly moderated the estimated lifetime prevalence of one or more ACEs and four or more ACEs, and age also significantly moderated the estimated lifetime prevalence of four or more ACEs. In the narrative synthesis, ACEs were consistently positively associated with high suicidality (two studies), suicide attempt (three studies), major depressive disorder (two studies), substance misuse (two studies), and adult victimisation (two studies).
   Interpretation The lifetime prevalence of ACEs is substantially higher among homeless adults than among the general population, and ACE exposure might be associated with prevalence of mental illness, substance misuse, and victimisation. Policy efforts and evidence-based interventions are urgently needed to prevent ACEs and address associated poor outcomes among this population. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disabling brain disorder. Physical exercise has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of PD and, consequently, improve patient quality of life. Exercise mechanisms involved in beneficial effects on PD have been widely investigated. This study aims to systematically review the literature on the use of treadmill exercise in PD animal models. The study was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI databases. In total, 78 studies were included. The dopaminergic system, behavior, neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation, mitochondria, and musculoskeletal systems were some of the outcomes evaluated by the selected studies. Based on the systematic review center for laboratory animal experimentation (SYRCLE) RoB tool, the methodologies revealed a high risk of bias and lack of information about study design, which needs attention for data reproducibility. This review can guide future studies that aim to fill existing gaps regarding the effects of treadmill exercise in PD animal models.

AB  - Over the past decade, psychiatric research has been on an important hunt for biomarkers of psychiatric disease. In psychiatry, the term "biomarker" is a broad umbrella term used to identify any biological variable that can be objectively measured and applied to a diagnosis; this includes genetic and epigenetic assessments, hormone levels, measures of neuro-anatomy and many other scientific modalities. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic being published yearly and other medical specialties having success in discovering biomarkers, clinical psychiatric practice has not had the same success. This paper aims to consolidate the many opinions on the search for psychiatric biomarkers to suggest key methodological and clinical challenges that psychiatric biomarker research faces. Psychiatry as a specialty has many fundamental differences compared to other medical specialties in methods of diagnosing, underlying etiology and disease pathologies that may be limiting the success of biomarker research in itself and puts strict requirements on the research being conducted. The academic and clinical environment in which the research is being conducted also heavily influences the translation of the findings. Finally, once biomarkers are identified, more often than not they are inapplicable to clinical settings, unable to integrate into clinical practice and fail to outperform current diagnostic practices and guidelines. We also make six recommendations for more promising future research in psychiatric biomarkers.

AB  - Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is commonly seen in women after birth and can lead to adverse effects on both the health of mothers and child(ren) development. In Vietnam, there have been a number of studies examining the rate and risk factors of PPD, but none has provided a systematic review.</p>
   Aim: This current literature review aims to summarize and synthesize the current state of knowledge of studies conducted in Vietnam to provide a comprehensive understanding of the PPD phenomena during the last 10 years.</p>
   Data Sources: A literature search was conducted relying on the most common online databases-MEDLINE/PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, which included articles if they (i) examined prevalence or risk factors of PPD; (ii) were conducted among Vietnamese participants using either quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-method, and (iii) were published from 2010 to 2020. After the filtering process, 18 articles were eligible to be reviewed.</p>
   Results: Research studies in Vietnam on PPD are conducted among women at and after 1-month delivery. The rate of PPD reported in Vietnam among mothers at postnatal time points from 1 to 12 months ranged from 8.2 to 48.1%. Risk factors can be clustered into three groups: personal factors, family factors, and environmental factors.</p>
   Recommendation: Further research studies should focus on examining PPD at an earlier stage within the first month after birth. The investigation of risk factors in a comprehensive manner for Vietnamese mothers would also be recommended.</p>

AB  - Background: False suffocation alarm hypothesis has been widely used to explain carbon dioxide hypersensitivity in panic disorder (PD). However, hypersensitivity to carbon dioxide has been observed in other psychiatric disorders. We explored the specificity of carbon dioxide inhalation as a panic provocation test among psychiatric disorders via network meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic literature search on PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycNET was performed to acquire the studies using the carbon dioxide provocation test in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and checklists. Odds ratios (OR) for a panic attack (PA) induced by the carbon dioxide inhalation tests were extracted from each of the original studies and were pooled using the random-effects model. Results: Network meta-analysis on a pool of 2181 participants from 41 studies was used to compare the efficacy of carbon dioxide provocation tests among psychiatric disorders. The network meta-analysis showed that the odds for PA in response to carbon dioxide inhalation are higher in patients with PD, premenstrual dysphoric syndrome (PMDD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD) than healthy controls (HC). The odds for PA were not significantly different among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and healthy controls (HC). Conclusions: The vulnerability to the carbon dioxide provocation test is not limited to PD. The specificity of the test for PD is questionable, as individuals suffering from PMDD and SAD are also significantly more responsive to carbon dioxide inhalation compared to HC, OCD, MDD, and GAD. There may be shared underpinning biological mechanisms between PD, PMDD, and SAD.

AB  - Background Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) host the majority of the world's refugees. Evidence suggests that refugees and asylum seekers have high mental health needs compared to the host country population. However, they face many social, economic and culture barriers to receiving mental health care and benefitting from mental health interventions. This paper examines how these contextual factors affect the implementation of mental health interventions for refugees and asylum seekers in LMICs. Methods We conducted a qualitative systematic review searching 11 databases and 24 relevant government and non-governmental organisation (NGO) websites. We spoke with academic experts and NGO professionals for recommendations, and conducted forwards and backwards citation tracking. Results From 2055 records in abstract and title screening, and then 99 in full-text screening, 18 eligible studies were identified. Qualitative thematic synthesis was conducted on eligible papers. Three main thematic clusters were identified around: (1) support during a time of pressure and insecurity, and the need for intervention flexibility through facilitator and participant autonomy; (2) different cultural conceptions of mental health, and how interventions negotiated these differences; and (3) the importance of facilitator skills, knowledge, characteristics and relationships to intervention implementation. Conclusion Evidence suggests that intervention coordinators and developers should continue to: (1) think broadly about the range of social influences on mental health, addressing structural issues where possible; (2) offer flexibility with intervention style, content and timings; and (3) encourage building research capacity in LMICs while acknowledging pre-existing mental health knowledge and practice.

AB  - Background and objectives: Several studies have addressed the relationship between bipolar disorder and meteorological variables, but no previous review focusing on the influence of a wide range of meteorological variables on bipolar disorder has been published. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review about the influence of weather on the clinical course of bipolar disorder patients.
   Methods: Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, the main electronic medical databases were searched in February 2020, and studies were screened based on the eligibility criteria. 24 studies were selected for qualitative synthesis. Most of them were observational retrospective studies based in medical records.
   Results: The most studied meteorological variables were temperature and sunlight, and the most studied clinical outcomes were hospital admissions. Significant correlations were found between temperature and sunlight and clinical outcomes, although the findings were heterogeneous. Higher temperatures may trigger bipolar disorder relapses that require hospital admission, and higher expositions to sunlight may increase the risk of manic episodes.
   Conclusion: Meteorological variables seem to have an influence in the course of bipolar disorder, especially temperature and sunlight, although further studies are needed to clarify this possible relationship.

AB  - Historically, pesticides have shaped and revolutionized modern agriculture in successions and thus have played a major role in increasing agricultural productivity with a substantial reduction in losses and increased farm incomes. Fresh produce like vegetables is attacked by a large number of insects and pests which necessitates the use of pesticides as control agents and may result in direct toxicity or residue left in treated vegetables after the harvest. The issues of contamination and residues have an unavoidable threat to both the environment and human well-being. Different adverse health effects due to pesticide exposure or consumption through the contaminated food depend upon the type of pesticide and exposure duration as well. The use of pesticides should be restricted by appropriate and good agricultural practices (GAPs), rational use for specific target organisms, and alternative pest control strategies to reduce their health and environmental impact. Regulations governing pesticide use, training, and extension services should be given to the farmers. The biotransformation and bioaccumulation of the most commonly used pesticides should be carefully monitored and documented for the highest level of safety to the ultimate consumers. Further, research should be focused on searching for rapid analytical, detection, and removal techniques for the residues. The focus of this review is to provide updated information about the most commonly used pesticides and their bioaccumulation and biotransformation. Further, advancements in the detection techniques and the effect of processing or decontamination techniques on residue content in vegetable crops have been provided for the readers.

AB  - Background: Psychiatric disorders have been historically classified using symptom information alone. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in research interest not only in identifying the mechanisms underlying defined pathologies but also in redefining their etiology. This is particularly relevant for the field of personalized medicine, which searches for data-driven approaches to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection for individual patients.
   Methods: This review aims to provide a high-level overview of the rapidly growing field of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from the perspective of unsupervised machine learning applications for disease subtyping. Following the PRISMA guidelines for protocol reproducibility, we searched the PubMed database for articles describing functional MRI applications used to obtain, interpret, or validate psychiatric disease subtypes. We also employed the active learning framework ASReview to prioritize publications in a machine learning-guided way.
   Results: From the 20 studies that met the inclusion criteria, five used functional MRI data to interpret symptom-derived disease clusters, four used it to interpret clusters derived from biomarker data other than fMRI itself, and 11 applied clustering techniques involving fMRI directly. Major depression disorder and schizophrenia were the two most frequently studied pathologies (35% and 30% of the retrieved studies, respectively), followed by ADHD (15%), psychosis as a whole (10%), autism disorder (5%), and the consequences of early exposure to violence (5%).
   Conclusions: The increased interest in personalized medicine and data-driven disease subtyping also extends to psychiatric disorders. However, to date, this subfield is at an incipient exploratory stage, and all retrieved studies were mostly proofs of principle where further validation and increased sample sizes are craved for. Whereas results for all explored diseases are inconsistent, we believe this reflects the need for concerted, multisite data collection efforts with a strong focus on measuring the generalizability of results. Finally, whereas functional MRI is the best way of measuring brain function available to date, its low signal-to-noise ratio and elevated monetary cost make it a poor clinical alternative. Even with technology progressing and costs decreasing, this might incentivize the search for more accessible, clinically ready functional proxies in the future.

AB  - Background: Identifying the characteristics of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) associated with different dementia types may be a promising strategy to effectively deal with BPSD. We aimed to synthesize the prevalence rates of BPSD characteristics in community-dwelling dementia patients.Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and PsycARTICLES databases for original clinical studies published until December 2020 that enrolled at least 300 community-dwelling dementia patients. The methodological qualities of prevalence studies were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklist.Results: Thirty studies were included. The prevalence of the BPSD characteristic ranged from 4 (elation and mania) to 32% (apathy) in the pooled samples. The prevalence of delusions, anxiety, apathy, irritability, elation and mania, and aberrant motor behavior in Alzheimer's disease patients was 1.72-2.88 times greater than that in vascular dementia (VD) patients, while the prevalence of disinhibition in VD patients was 1.38 times greater. The prevalence of anxiety, irritability, and agitation and aggression, delusion, hallucinations, apathy, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior tended to increase as the severity of dementia increased, while that of depression, eating disorder, sleep disorders, and elation and mania tended to stable. In community-dwelling patients with dementia, the pooled prevalence of apathy, depression, anxiety, irritability, agitation and aggression, sleep disorders, and eating disorder was higher than 20%, while that of disinhibition and elation and mania was lower than 10%.Conclusion: Overall, the pooled prevalence of apathy, depression, anxiety, irritability, agitation and aggression, sleep disorders, and eating disorder was generally high in patients with dementia. Also, the prevalence of some BPSD characteristics differed according to the type and the severity of dementia. The methodological quality of the included studies is not the best, and high heterogeneity may affect the certainty of the findings. However, the results of this review can deepen our understanding of the prevalence of BPSD.<br>

AB  - Following the introduction and application of pesticides in human life, they have always been along with health concerns both in acute poisoning and chronic toxicities. Neurotoxicity of pesticides in chronic exposures has been known as one of the most important human health problems, as most of these chemicals act through interacting with some elements of nervous system. Pesticide-induced neurotoxicity can be defined in different categories of neurological disorders including neurodegenerative (Alzheimer, Parkinson, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), neurodevelopmental (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, developmental delay, and intellectual disability), neurobehavioral and neuropsychiatric (depression/suicide attempt, anxiety/insomnia, and cognitive impairment) disorders some of which are among the most debilitating human health problems. In this review, neurotoxicity of pesticides in the mentioned categories and sub-categories of neurological diseases have been systematically presented in relation to different route of exposures including general, occupational, environmental, prenatal, postnatal, and paternal.

AB  - Dopaminergic neurotoxicity is characterized by damage and death of dopaminergic neurons. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Therefore, the study of the mechanisms, as well as the search for new targets for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, is an important focus of modern neuroscience. PD is primarily caused by dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons; however, other neurotransmitter systems are also involved. Research reports have indicated that the glutamatergic system is involved in different pathological conditions, including dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Over the last two decades, the important functional interplay between dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems has stimulated interest in the possible role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the development of extrapyramidal disorders. However, the specific mechanisms driving these processes are presently unclear. The participation of the universal neuronal messenger nitric oxide (NO) in the mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotoxicity has attracted increased attention. The current paper aims to review the involvement of mGluRs and the contribution of NO to dopaminergic neurotoxicity. More precisely, we focused on studies conducted on the rotenone-induced PD model. This review is also an outline of our own results obtained using the method of electron paramagnetic resonance, which allows quantitation of NO radicals in brain structures.</p>

The search included studies up to 2017 and meta-analytic structural equation modeling, allowed us to examine the magnitude of the indirect effect across 17 studies (k = 19). The meta-analysis included 6433 predominantly White, English speaking children (M-age = 36 months; 50% female) from Western, industrialized countries. All paths in the model were statistically significant, notably, the indirect effect was significant (b = -.052), showing that maternal responsivity may be a proximal intervening variable between socioeconomic risk and children's language development. Moderator analyses found that the indirect effect was stronger for sensitive parenting than warmth and when parenting was assessed in the family home.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are more prevalent and severe in women than men. Extant research suggests that the menstrual cycle modulates the severity and expression of anxiety symptoms across a range of disorders. The aims of this systematic review were to synthesise the existing literature investigating menstrual phase-related fluctuations in symptoms of anxiety disorders, and related conditions PTSD and OCD, in menstruating women, and to evaluate the methodologies used. PsycINFO and PubMed were searched through to April 2021 for studies that measured and compared symptoms of a diagnosed anxiety disorder, PTSD, or OCD, between at least two menstrual phases. Fourteen studies meeting inclusion criteria were identified. The review revealed evidence for exacerbation of a broad range of symptoms in panic disorder, PTSD, social anxiety disorder, and generalised anxiety disorder, around the weeks prior to and post menses onset, coincident with elevated but declining ovarian hormones, and low hormone levels, respectively. Effects were heterogenous between individuals and different symptom types. Key methodological weaknesses included sub-optimal and inconsistent means of defining and identifying menstrual phases, low sample representativeness, and small sample sizes. Menstrual fluctuations in anxiety symptoms appear to be a feature of anxiety disorders, PTSD, and OCD, but likely only occur in a subset of women. Future research in this field could better manage and account for such heterogeneity by using group-based trajectory modelling in larger sample sizes and using pre-screening to recruit women with known histories of menstrual fluctuation in anxiety symptoms.

AB  - Background: Locally delivered, place-based public health interventions are receiving increasing attention as a way of improving health and reducing inequalities. However, there is limited evidence on their effectiveness. This umbrella review synthesises systematic review evidence of the health and health inequalities impacts of locally delivered place-based interventions across three elements of place and health: the physical, social, and economic environments.
   Methods: Systematic review methodology was used to identify recent published systematic reviews of the effectiveness of place-based interventions on health and health inequalities (PROGRESS+) in high-income countries. Nine databases were searched from 1st January 2008 to 1st March 2020. The quality of the included articles was determined using the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool (R-AMSTAR).
   Results: Thirteen systematic reviews were identified - reporting 51 unique primary studies. Fifty of these studies reported on interventions that changed the physical environment and one reported on changes to the economic environment. Only one primary study reported cost-effectiveness data. No reviews were identified that assessed the impact of social interventions. Given heterogeneity and quality issues, we found tentative evidence that the provision of housing/home modifications, improving the public realm, parks and playgrounds, supermarkets, transport, cycle lanes, walking routes, and outdoor gyms - can all have positive impacts on health outcomes - particularly physical activity. However, as no studies reported an assessment of variation in PROGRESS+ factors, the effect of these interventions on health inequalities remains unclear.
   Conclusions: Place-based interventions can be effective at improving physical health, health behaviours and social determinants of health outcomes. High agentic interventions indicate greater improvements for those living in greater proximity to the intervention, which may suggest that in order for interventions to reduce inequalities, they should be implemented at a scale commensurate with the level of disadvantage. Future research needs to ensure equity data is collected, as this is severely lacking and impeding progress on identifying interventions that are effective in reducing health inequalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND</p>
   Empathy has long been considered a multidimensional construct, encompassing cognitive, affective and behavioral domains. Deficits in empathic competences in early childhood contribute to psychopathology, and have been variably implicated in several clinical conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and conduct disorders.</p>
   AIM</p>
   To identify and describe empirically validated questionnaires assessing empathy in children and adolescents and to provide a summary of related theoretical perspectives on empathy definitional issues.</p>
   METHODS</p>
   A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Three bibliographic databases were searched. A total of 47 studies were selected for final analysis and 16 distinct measures were identified and described.</p>
   RESULTS</p>
   Questionable to excellent levels of internal consistency were observed, while few studies assessed test-retest reliability. Although construct definitions only partially overlapped, affective and cognitive domains of empathy were the commonest internal factors that were often separately evaluated. New facets of the construct (i.e., somatic empathy and sympathy) and specific clinical populations (i.e., ASD) could be specifically addressed through more recent instruments.</p>
   CONCLUSION</p>
   The combination of different assessment methods is recommended in order to foresee further improvements in this field and try to overcome the problem of limited convergence with more objective measures.</p>

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly. While the etiology of PD is likely multifactorial with the involvement of genetic, environmental, aging and other factors, alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) pathology is a pivotal mechanism underlying the development of PD. In recent years, astrocytes have attracted considerable attention in the field. Although astrocytes perform a variety of physiological functions in the brain, they are pivotal mediators of alpha-syn toxicity since they internalize alpha-syn released from damaged neurons, and this triggers an inflammatory response, protein degradation dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Astrocytes are indispensable coordinators in the background of several genetic mutations, including PARK7, GBA1, LRRK2, ATP13A2, PINK1, PRKN and PLA2G6. As the most abundant glial cells in the brain, functional astrocytes can be replenished and even converted to functional neurons. In this review, we discuss astrocyte dysfunction in PD with an emphasis on alpha-syn toxicity and genetic modulation and conclude that astrocyte replenishment is a valuable therapeutic approach in PD.

AB  - Background Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) presents one of the main problems in the field of reproductive medicine, due to the unknown etiology in 50% of cases, as well as limited evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Recent studies indicate that systemic and placental oxidative stress (OS) represents an essential factor in the etiopathogenesis of RPL. This article is a comprehensive narrative synthesis of previously published studies concerning the role of oxidative stress in the etiology of recurrent pregnancy loss. Methods We conducted literature search of published studies in the English language focusing on oxidative stress and its association with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) utilizing the Medline and Cochrane databases from 2000 through January 2021. The keywords used were "recurrent pregnancy loss" "oxidative stress and recurrent pregnancy loss" and "oxidative stress biomarkers and recurrent pregnancy loss". Results The search yielded 1116 publications, of which 92 were included in the final analysis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) at basal levels have various physiological functions whereas deviation from redox window is associated with different pathologies including early pregnancy loss. The currently available studies support the concept that increased oxidative stress (OS) and deficient antioxidant protection is implicated in the etiology of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) but underlying mechanisms through which OS affects pregnancy outcome remains largely indefinable. Conclusions Future research in this field can provide new insights regarding the OS-mediated damage in recurrent pregnancy loss as well as potential applications of antioxidant therapy in this group of patients.
   Plain Language summary Recurrent pregnancy loss is a significant health problem in reproductive medicine due to the idiopathic etiology in 50% of cases and limited evidence-based practice. The role of oxidative stress in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is an understudied and enthralling field of investigation. We reviewed the existing information based on the published literature on this complex topic and found that oxidative/nitrosative stress complemented with inefficient antioxidant capacity presents an essential factor in the etiology of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). However, based on the currently available knowledge underlying mechanisms through which OS-imbalance affects the increased risk of RPL remains unclear. Future research with a larger number of patients, can provide new insights regarding the molecular mechanisms as well as modifiable factors to decrease OS in this clinical entity.

AB  - Background Refugees and asylum seekers often report having experienced numerous complex traumas. It is important to understand the prevalence of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), which can follow complex traumas. Aims This systematic review aims to summarise the available literature reporting the prevalence in refugees and asylum seekers of three operationalised definitions of CPTSD: the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria, the ICD-10 criteria (for enduring personality change after catastrophic experience) and the DSM-IV criteria (for disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified). Method Six electronic databases were searched for studies reporting the prevalence of CPTSD in adult refugee and/or asylum-seeking samples. Owing to heterogeneity between the studies, a narrative synthesis approach was used to summarise studies. Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Checklist for Prevalence Studies. This systematic review has been registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020188422, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=188422). Results Systematic searches identified 15 eligible studies, with 10 examining treatment-seeking samples and five using population samples. CPTSD prevalence in treatment-seeking samples was between 16 and 38%. Prevalence in population samples ranged from 2.2 to 9.3% in four studies, with the fifth reporting a much higher estimate (50.9%). Conclusions This review highlights both the high prevalence of CPTSD in treatment samples and the lack of research aiming to establish prevalence of CPTSD in refugee and asylum-seeking populations. Understanding the prevalence of these disabling disorders has implications for policy and healthcare services for the appropriate promotion, planning and provision of suitable treatment and interventions for this highly traumatised population.

AB  - FMR1 premutation is defined by 55-200 CGG repeats in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. FMR1 premutation carriers are at risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease called fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) in adulthood. In the last years an increasingly board spectrum of clinical manifestations including psychiatric disorders have been described as occurring at a greater frequency among FMR1 premutation carriers. Herein, we reviewed the neuroimaging findings reported in relation with psychiatric symptomatology in adult FMR1 premutation carriers. A structured electronic literature search was conducted on FMR1 premutation and neuroimaging yielding a total of 3,229 articles examined. Of these, 7 articles were analyzed and are included in this review. The results showed that the main radiological findings among adult FMR1 premutation carriers presenting neuropsychiatric disorders were found on the amygdala and hippocampus, being the functional abnormalities more consistent and the volumetric changes more inconsistent among studies. From a molecular perspective, CGG repeat size, FMR1 mRNA and FMRP levels have been investigated in relation with the neuroimaging findings. Based on the published results, FMRP might play a key role in the pathophysiology of the psychiatric symptoms described among FMR1 premutation carriers. However, additional studies including further probes of brain function and a broader scope of psychiatric symptom measurement are required in order to obtain a comprehensive landscape of the neuropsychiatric phenotype associated with the FMR1 premutation.

AB  - Background: Oxidative stress is conjectured to be related to many diseases. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that radiofrequency fields may induce oxidative stress in various cell types and thereby compromise human and animal health. This systematic review (SR) aims to summarize and evaluate the literature related to this hypothesis. Objectives: The main objective of this SR is to evaluate the associations between the exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields and oxidative stress in experimental models (in vivo and in vitro). Methods: The SR framework has been developed following the guidelines established in the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development and the Handbook for Conducting a Literature-Based Health Assessment). We will include controlled in vivo and in vitro laboratory studies that assess the effects of an exposure to RF-EMF on valid markers for oxidative stress compared to no or sham exposure. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO. We will search the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and the EMFPortal. The reference lists of included studies and retrieved review articles will also be manually searched. Study appraisal and synthesis method: Data will be extracted according to a pre-defined set of forms developed in the DistillerSR online software and synthesized in a meta-analysis when studies are judged sufficiently similar to be combined. If a meta-analysis is not possible, we will describe the effects of the exposure in a narrative way. Risk of bias: The risk of bias will be assessed with the NTP/OHAT risk of bias rating tool for human and animal studies. We will use GRADE to assess the certainty of the conclusions (high, moderate, low, or inadequate) regarding the association between radiofrequency electromagnetic fields and oxidative stress. Funding: This work was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO). Registration: The protocol was registered on the PROSPERO webpage on July 8, 2021.

AB  - Introduction: Loneliness is prevalent and associated with negative health outcomes in young people. Our understanding of how it can be best addressed is limited. This systematic review aims to assess the acceptability and effectiveness of interventions to reduce and prevent loneliness and social isolation in young people. Methods: Six bibliographic databases were searched; references of included studies were screened for relevant literature. A pre-defined framework was used for data extraction. Quality appraisal was performed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. Data were synthesised narratively. Results: 9,358 unique references were identified; 28 publications from 16 interventions met the inclusion criteria. The majority of interventions were high intensity, individual or small group interventions, often targeted at specific 'at risk' populations. While 14 interventions were associated with a statistically significant reduction in loneliness or social isolation, the heterogeneous measures of loneliness, small sample sizes, short periods of follow-up and high attrition rates limit evidence on effectiveness. Interventions implemented in more general populations of young people appeared more acceptable than those in specific 'at risk' populations. Conclusion: High intensity interventions are unlikely to be feasible at a population level. Further work is required to develop and evaluate theoretically-informed loneliness interventions for young people that reach wider audiences.

AB  - Objective To conduct a rapid knowledge synthesis of literature on the social determinants of mental health of racialized women exposed to gender-based violence (GBV) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods We adapted the Cochrane Rapid Reviews method and were guided by an equity lens in conducting rapid reviews on public health issues. Four electronic databases (Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline, ProQuest, and EBSCO), electronic news media, Google Scholar, and policy documents were searched for literature between January 2019 and October 2020 with no limitations for location. Fifty-five articles qualified for the review.
   Results Health emergencies heighten gender inequalities in relation to income, employment, job security, and working conditions. Household stress and pandemic-related restrictions (social distancing, closure of services) increase women's vulnerability to violence. Systemic racism and discrimination intensify health disparities.
   Conclusion Racialized women are experiencing a 2020 Syndemic: a convergence of COVID-19, GBV, and racism pandemics, placing their wellbeing at a disproportionate risk. GBV is a public health issue and gender-responsive COVID-19 programming is essential. Anti-racist and equity-promoting policies to GBV service provision and disaggregated data collection are required.

AB  - Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se, they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.

AB  - Beginning in 1999, Department of Defense policy directed the military services to develop Combat and Operational Stress Control (COSC) programs to address prevention, early identification, and management of the negative effects of combat and operational stress. The aim of this study is to provide a narrative review of COSC programs and organize them into a prevention framework to clarify gaps and future directions. A systematic search was conducted to identify studies between 2001 and 2020 in peer-reviewed articles or government-sponsored reports describing an evaluation of COSC programs. The target population of these programs was US service members who had participated in an intervention designed to address combat or operational stress in a deployed, operational, or field setting. These programs then were rated for level of evidence and categorized using a tiered prevention model. This search identified 36 published evaluations of 19 COSC programs and interventions from. Most programs were described as effective in addressing target outcomes, with behavioral health outcomes reported for 13 of the 19 identified programs; the remaining six focused on knowledge base and behavior changes. Delivery of these prevention programs also ranged from peer-based implementation to formal treatment, including programs at all prevention levels. COSC interventions show promise for helping service members manage stress, with more than half of the programs showing evidence from studies using randomized designs. Future iterations of COSC program evaluations should explore the development of a joint curriculum using existing content in a tiered prevention framework.

Methods A systematic review was carried out from 2006 to 2018. A keyword request was obtained using the PubMed/Medline, Web of Science and Banque de Donnees en Sante Publique search engine. Studies written in English measuring burnout with the MBI tool among a population of practicing European physicians were selected. Data were extracted and classified according to burnout's definition provided by the authors. Three definitions using the MBI dimensions were considered: tri-, bi- and unidimensional definition. A meta-analysis was then performed on burnout prevalence rates according to the dimensional definition of burnout. Results From 2378 search results, we selected 56 studies including from up to 41 European countries. Depending upon the study, physicians' burnout prevalence rates ranged from 2.5% to 72.0%. The pooled prevalence rate of burnout was estimated at 7.7% [5.3-10.4%] with the tridimensional definition, 19.7% [13.5-26.3%] with the bidimensional definition and 43.2% [29.0-57.6%] with the unidimensional definition. Conclusion Burnout pooled prevalence among physicians varies from single to fivefold depending on the method employed to assess burnout with the MBI tool. Medical community should determine a standardized method to assess burnout prevalence rates to best evaluate this phenomenon.

AB  - Purpose As the new coronavirus disease propagated around the world, the rapid spread of news caused uncertainty in the population. False news has taken over social media, becoming part of life for many people. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate, through a systematic review, the impact of social media on the dissemination of infodemic knowing and its impacts on health. Methods A systematic search was performed in the MedLine, Virtual Health Library (VHL), and Scielo databases from January 1, 2020, to May 11, 2021. Studies that addressed the impact of fake news on patients and healthcare professionals around the world were included. It was possible to methodologically assess the quality of the selected studies using the Loney and Newcastle-Ottawa Scales. Results Fourteen studies were eligible for inclusion, consisting of six cross-sectional and eight descriptive observational studies. Through questionnaires, five studies included measures of anxiety or psychological distress caused by misinformation; another seven assessed feeling fear, uncertainty, and panic, in addition to attacks on health professionals and people of Asian origin. Conclusion By analyzing the phenomenon of fake news in health, it was possible to observe that infodemic knowledge can cause psychological disorders and panic, fear, depression, and fatigue.

AB  - Background: A growing body of literature has detailed the use of qualitative analyses to measure the therapeutic processes and intrinsic effectiveness of psychotherapies, which yield small databases. Nonetheless, these approaches have several limitations and machine learning algorithms are needed.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the use of machine learning for automated text classification for small data sets in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and social sciences. This review will identify available algorithms and assess if automated classification of textual entities is comparable to the classification done by human evaluators.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases of Medline, Web of Science, PsycNet (PsycINFO), and Google Scholar from their inception dates to 2021. The fields of psychiatry, psychology, and social sciences were selected as they include a vast array of textual entities in the domain of mental health that can be reviewed. Additional records identified through cross-referencing were used to find other studies.
   Results: This literature search identified 5442 articles that were eligible for our study after the removal of duplicates. Following abstract screening, 114 full articles were assessed in their entirety, of which 107 were excluded. The remaining 7 studies were analyzed. Classification algorithms such as naive Bayes, decision tree, and support vector machine classifiers were identified. Support vector machine is the most used algorithm and best performing as per the identified articles. Prediction classification scores for the identified algorithms ranged from 53%-91% for the classification of textual entities in 4-7 categories. In addition, 3 of the 7 studies reported an interjudge agreement statistic; these were consistent with agreement statistics for text classification done by human evaluators.
   Conclusions: A systematic review of available machine learning algorithms for automated text classification for small data sets in several fields (psychiatry, psychology, and social sciences) was conducted. We compared automated classification with classification done by human evaluators. Our results show that it is possible to automatically classify textual entities of a transcript based solely on small databases. Future studies are nevertheless needed to assess whether such algorithms can be implemented in the context of psychotherapies.

We conducted a literature search from inception to January 2020 via electronic databases, using search terms with HRV, ABI, and functional outcomes. Meta-analyses included 16 studies with 906 persons with ABI. Results demonstrated significant associations: Low frequency (LF) (r = -0.28) and SDNN (r = -0.33) with neurological function; LF (r = -0.33), High frequency (HF) (r = -0.22), SDNN (r = -0.22), and RMSSD (r = -0.23) with emotional function; and LF (r = 0.34), HF (r = 0.41 to 0.43), SDNN (r = 0.43 to 0.51), and RMSSD (r = 0.46) with behavioral function. Results indicate that higher HRV is related to better neurological, emotional, and behavioral functions after ABI. In addition, persons with stroke showed lower HF (SMD = -0.50) and SDNN (SMD = -0.75) than healthy controls. The findings support the use of HRV as a biomarker to facilitate precise monitoring of post-ABI functions.

Meta-analyses were performed separately according to pollutant type [particulate matter with diameter <= 10 mu m (PM10) and <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O-3), and carbon monoxide (CO)] and exposure duration [short- (<30 days) and long-term (>= 30 days)]. Test for homogeneity based on Cochran's Q and I-2 statistics were calculated and the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) random effect model was applied. We assessed overall quality of pooled estimates, influence of single studies on the meta-analytic estimates, sources of between-study heterogeneity, and publication bias. We observed an increased risk of depression associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5 (relative risk: 1.074, 95% confidence interval: 1.021-1.129) and NO2 (1.037, 1.011-1.064), and with short-term exposure to PM10 (1.009, 1.006-1.012), PM2.5 (1.009, 1.007-1.011), NO2 (1.022, 1.012-1.033), SO2 (1.024, 1.010-1.037), O-3 (1.011, 0.997-1.026), and CO (1.062, 1.020-1.105). The publication bias affecting half of the investigated associations and the high heterogeneity characterizing most of the meta-analytic estimates partly prevent to draw very firm conclusions. On the other hand, the coherence of all the estimates after excluding single studies in the sensitivity analysis supports the soundness of our results. This especially applies to the association between PM (2.5) and depression, strengthened by the absence of heterogeneity and of relevant publication bias in both long- and short-term exposure studies. Should further investigations be designed, they should involve large sample sizes, well-defined diagnostic criteria for depression, and thorough control of potential confounding factors. Finally, studies dedicated to the comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the association between air pollution and depression remain necessary.

AB  - Aims: To provide an overview of published research on migration and health conducted in Norway and identify gaps in the research field. Methods: Applying a scoping review methodology, we searched Medline for articles on migration health in Norway published between 2008 and 2020, and assessed them according to research topic, methodology, user-involvement and characteristics of the populations studied (country or area of origin, type of migrant/immigrant status). Results: Of the 707 articles retrieved, 303 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (77%) were within the clinical disciplines reproductive health, mental health, infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases, or on socio-cultural aspects and the use of healthcare services. One third of the papers (36%) pulled participants from various geographic backgrounds together or did not specify the geographic background. Among those who did so, participants were mostly from The Middle East, South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Only 14% of the articles specified the type of migrant/immigrant status and those included refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants. A total of 80% of the papers used quantitative methods, of which 15 described an intervention; 15 papers (5%) described different types of user-involvement. Conclusions: Our findings suggest gaps in research related to migrant subgroups, such as those from Eastern-Europe and labour and family reunification migrants. Future studies should further investigate the self-identified health needs of different migrant groups, and might also benefit from a methodological shift towards more intervention studies and participatory approaches.

AB  - Following recovery from COVID-19, an increasing proportion of individuals have reported the persistence and/or new onset of symptoms which collectively have been identified as post-COVID-19 syndrome by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Although depressive symptoms in the acute phase of COVID-19 have been well characterized, the frequency of depression following recovery of the acute phase remains unknown. Herein, we sought to determine the frequency of depressive symptoms and clinically-significant depression more than 12 weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid Medline and Google Scholar for studies published between January 1, 2020 and June 5, 2021 was conducted. Frequency and factors associated with depression in post-COVID-19 syndrome were recorded and qualitatively assessed through narrative synthesis. Methodological quality and risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for prospective cohort studies. Of 316 articles identified through our systematic search, eight studies were included. The frequency of depressive symptoms +12 weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 11 to 28%. The frequency of clinically-significant depression and/or severe depressive symptoms ranged from 3 to 12%. The severity of acute COVID-19 was not associated with the frequency of depressive symptoms. However, the component studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to mode of ascertainment, time of assessment, and location and age of patients. The majority of studies did not include an unexposed control group. Future research should endeavour to produce a standardized classification of postCOVID-19 syndrome, and as well as include unexposed control groups.

AB  - Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people are frequently exposed to stigma, discrimination, and violence, with adverse impacts on wellbeing. The 'Minority Stress Model' and sources of gender affirmation both highlight the impact of social oppression and provide useful means to understand how TGNC people can develop their resilience and what may contribute to different ways of coping. While this stress has been explored in previous reviews, a limited focus on lived experiences constrained discussion of how coping approaches could be put into action in relation to gender affirmation. Therefore, the current review sought to better understand TGNC individuals' opportunities for gender affirmation through their experiences of coping with minority stress. A systematic search yielded nine studies reporting qualitative data related to adaptive coping. Framework synthesis was applied through an a priori framework, based on minority stress and gender affirmation research, which generated eight themes: four themes privileging psychological affirmation comprised 'defining one's own gender identity', 'fostering self-belief', 'using information and knowledge', and 'drawing upon other identities'; and four themes offering social affirmation comprised 'connecting with the TGNC community', 'cultivating allies', 'advocating for change', and 'asserting oneself'. Our findings augment established models and concepts with the delineation of coping responses for TGNC individuals that can support gender affirmation and mitigate minority stress.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a popular modulatory technique for the noninvasive diagnosis and therapy of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Unfortunately, current modulation strategies are only modestly effective. The literature provides strong evidence that the modulatory effects of TMS vary depending on device components and stimulation protocols. These differential effects are important when designing precise modulatory strategies for clinical or research applications. Developments in TMS have been accompanied by advances in combining TMS with neuroimaging techniques, including electroencephalography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. Such studies appear particularly promising as they may not only allow us to probe affected brain areas during TMS but also seem to predict underlying research directions that may enable us to precisely target and remodel impaired cortices or circuits. However, few precise modulation strategies are available, and the long-term safety and efficacy of these strategies need to be confirmed. Here, we review the literature on possible technologies for precise modulation to highlight progress along with limitations with the goal of suggesting future directions for this field.

AB  - Objective To examine the hypothesis that PTSD with delayed expression in some cases occurs without subthreshold PTSD symptoms above background levels bridging the gap between the traumatic exposure(s) and the clinical diagnosis. Methods We performed systematic searches of peer-reviewed papers in English referenced in Pubmed, Embase, or PsycINFO and ascertained 34 prospective studies of PTSD symptom trajectories identified by latent class growth statistical modeling. Studies with delayed and low-stable trajectories provided appropriate data for this study. We computed the difference between the delayed trajectory PTSD symptom sumscore and the low-stable PTSD sumscore at the observed points in time after the traumatic event(s). Results In 29 study populations, the latent class growth analyses displayed delayed trajectories, and in these, we identified 110 data points (% PTSD sumscore difference/months since traumatic exposure). The median PTSD symptom sumscore was 25% higher during the initial 6 months among individuals in the delayed trajectory compared to those in low-stable trajectory. From this level, the difference widened and reached a plateau of 40-50% higher. The variation was large, and the baseline participation rate and loss to follow-up were exceeding 25% in the majority of the studies. Heterogeneity of populations, measures, and analyses precluded formal meta-analysis. Conclusion Delayed PTSD is preceded by PTSD symptoms during the first year in most cases. Still, few individuals may experience an asymptomatic delay. The results underpin the rationale for monitoring PTSD symptoms and may inform forensic assessments in that delayed PTSD without symptoms bridging the traumatic event is rare.

AB  - Objective: Lifestyle medicine is increasingly important in psychiatry for its efficacy as a transdiagnostic treatment, its preventative potential, and its increased tolerability compared with first-line strategies. Although the impact of lifestyle medicine is strong across many psychiatric illnesses, our understanding of the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in treating obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) is minimal. We aimed to conduct a systematic review examining the effect of lifestyle interventions (targeting diet, exercise, sleep, stress management, and tobacco/alcohol use) on OCRD symptoms.
   Methods: We systematically searched four electronic databases for published randomized controlled trials reporting on lifestyle interventions for OCRDs. We qualitatively synthesized results of eligible studies and calculated mean changes in symptom severity from baseline to end point and standardized between-group effect sizes.
   Results: We identified 33 eligible studies. Poor efficacy was noted across a number of rigorous dietary supplement interventions with some promising data in four (of six) studies regarding N-acetylcysteine for trichotillomania, skin picking, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Stress management interventions, generally characterized by high risk of bias, reported mild effectiveness with greater effects noted for mind-body exercises (yoga) for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Greater improvements may be achieved when lifestyle intervention is adjunct to first-line treatments and delivered by facilitators.
   Conclusions: Diet (particularly N-acetylcysteine) and stress management interventions seem promising avenues for OCRDs treatment. We present an action plan to move the lifestyle interventions for OCRDs field forward. Further high-quality lifestyle interventions are required to improve the certainty of findings and to inform clinical treatment guidelines.

AB  - Even though increasing literature describes changes in emotional processing in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), efforts to summarize relevant findings are lacking in the field. A systematic literature review was performed to provide a critical and up-to-date account of emotional abilities in ALS. References were identified by searches of PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus (1980-2021, English literature), with the following key terms: ("Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis" or "Primary Lateral Sclerosis" or "Motor Neuron") and "Emotion*" and ("Processing" or "Attribution" or "Elaboration" or "Perception" or "Recognition"). Studies concerning only caregivers, pseudobulbar affect, and social cognition were excluded. Forty-one articles were included, all concerning ALS, and seven topics were identified: Emotion recognition, Emotional responsiveness, Emotional reactivity, Faces approachability rating, Valence rating, Memory for emotional materials and Alexithymia. The majority of these aspects have only been sparsely addressed. The evidence confirms altered emotional processing in ALS. The most consistent findings regard the recognition of facial expressions for negative emotions, but also alterations in the subjective responsiveness to emotional stimuli (arousal, valence and approachability), in psychophysiological and cerebral reactivity and in emotional memory, together with alexithymia traits, were reported. According to this evidence, emotional abilities should be included in the clinical assessment and therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Wildfires present a serious risk to humans as well as to the environment. Wildfires cause loss of lives, economic losses, expose people to personal as well as collective trauma, and compromise the mental health of survivors. Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent following a traumatic event; however, their prevalence is not well established amongst those confronted by natural disasters such as wildfires. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesise the empirical findings pertaining to wildfires and the prevalence of sleep disturbances in the general community affected by this natural disaster. We searched EBSCO, PsychINFO, Medline, SpringerLink, CINAHL Complete, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library between January 2012 and March 2021. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings from this systematic review suggest that sleep disturbances, assessed one to ten months following the fires, are highly prevalent in wildfire survivors, with insomnia (ranging between 63-72.5%) and nightmares (ranging between 33.3-46.5%), being the most prevalent sleep disturbances reported in this cohort. Results also highlight the significant associations between sleep disturbances and post-traumatic symptoms following the trauma of wildfires. There is a possible link between sleep disturbance prevalence, severity of, and proximity to fires.

AB  - Background: Regularly performed physical activity promote proper development and prevent health risk factors in children and adolescents. Pandemic crisis has been limiting the scope of movement with social distancing for participation of physical activity for health promotion. This study aimed to review studies on promoting physical activity to prevent health risks for children and adolescents since the onset of COVID-19.
   Methods: Three major online databases (PubMed, Medline, and Scopus) were searched for 'physical activity,' 'intervention' for children and adolescents. Seven articles were selected from 1,761 articles through the inclusion and exclusion processes.
   Results: All studies were conducted through online. One study showed that streaming services and online apps majorly promoted MVPA (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity), MSE (muscle-strengthening exercise), or combined (MVPA, MSE) by 2.4, 3.1, and 4.3 folds, respectively. Another study showed that greater duration of physical activity (PA) prevented depressive symptoms during exposure to outbreak. Five intervention studies which used digital platforms to promote PA significantly encouraged PA along with the physiological, psycho social, and academic achievement outcomes.
   Conclusion: Internet-based digital platforms may assist to promote physical activity for improved psychosocial and academic achievement in children and adolescents during the untack period. Structured PA promotion platforms with various health outcomes for children and adolescents should be developed and scientifically evaluated.

AB  - Population-level physical activity (PA) and sedentary time/behaviour estimates represent a significant public health issue exacerbated by restrictions enforced to control COVID-19. This integrative review interrogated available literature to explore the pandemic's impact on correlates of such behaviours in adults (& GE;18 years). Five electronic databases were systematically searched in January 2021. Data extracted from 64 articles were assessed for risk-of-bias using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool, with correlates identified, coded, and themed via thematic analysis. A socioecological model of during-pandemic PA was conceptualized and mapped to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change mechanisms, which illustrates influences over five levels: Individual (biological)-general health; Individual (psychological)-mental health, cognition, motivation, and behaviour; Social-domestic situation, sociodemographic factors, support, and lifestyle choices; Environmental-resources and area of residence; and Policy-COVID-19-related rules. For sedentary time/behaviour, individual level factors, namely general and mental health, may be important correlates. Neither age or sex were clearly correlated with either behaviour. As we transition into a new normal, understanding which behaviour mechanisms could effectively challenge physical inactivity is essential. Targeting capability on a psychological level may facilitate PA and limit sedentary time/behaviour, whereas, on a physical level, maximizing PA opportunities could be crucial.

AB  - Introduction: Suicide is a pressing psychiatric concern worldwide with no established biomarker. While there is some evidence of the clinical utility of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in assessing and predicting suicidality, no systematic review of such evidence has been conducted to date. Therefore, this review aimed to systematically review and gather evidence from existing studies that used fNIRS signals to assess suicidality and its associated changes in the brain, and those that examined how such signals correlated with suicide symptomatology.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were used in a systematic literature search for English-language articles published between 2000 and December 19, 2020 that focused on the utility of fNIRS for (i) assessing suicidality and its associated changes in the brain, and (ii) correlating with suicide symptomatology. Studies were included if they utilised fNIRS to evaluate variations in fNIRS-measured cerebral hemodynamic responses in patients with different mental disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia), as well as in healthy controls, of any age group. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale.
   Results: A total of 7 cross-sectional studies were included in this review, all of which had acceptable quality. Across all studies, fNIRS demonstrated reduced cerebral hemodynamic changes in suicidal individuals when compared to non-suicidal individuals. One study also demonstrated the potential of fNIRS signals in correlating with the severity of suicidality.
   Conclusions: This review provides a comprehensive, updated review of evidence supporting the clinical utility of fNIRS in the assessment and prediction of suicidality. Further studies involving larger sample sizes, standardised methodology, and longitudinal follow-ups are needed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to collect evidence of the relationship between retirement and depression through meta-analysis and further analyze the heterogeneity of results. The quality of the studies was rated based on 10 predefined criteria. We searched for articles published between 1980 and 2020, and a total of 25 longitudinal studies were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis results showed that retirement was associated with more depressive symptoms (d = 0.044, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.008, 0.080). The association of more depressive symptoms with involuntary retirement (d = 0.180, 95% CI: 0.061, 0.299) was stronger than with voluntary retirement (d = 0.086, 95% CI: -0.018, 0.190) and regulatory retirement (d = 0.009, 95% CI: -0.079, 0.097). Retirement was significantly associated with more depressive symptoms in Eastern developed countries (d = 0.126, 95% CI: 0.041, 0.210), and the association was stronger than that in Western developed countries (d = 0.016, 95% CI: -0.023, 0.055). We found that the transition to retirement was associated with higher risk of depression, and this association varied by the type of retirement and country. Further empirical studies are needed to explore the mechanism of retirement and depression and whether such an association is linked with socioeconomic position.

AB  - Background: Pediatric chronic pain is a prevalent condition that requires significant coping to encourage optimal functioning; however, relevant research is vast, heterogeneous, and difficult to interpret. To date, no attempt has been made to map and summarize the measurement and conceptualization of coping responses in the context of pediatric chronic pain.
   Objectives: A scoping review was conducted to map and summarize the participant characteristics, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and measures used to assess coping responses in youth with chronic pain. The extent to which authors used definitions and examples of coping responses (conceptual clarity) as well as consistently used measures (measurement consistency) and their corresponding conceptualizations (conceptual consistency) relative to how they were intended to be used were assessed.
   Methods: Searches were conducted through MEDLINE (PubMed) and PsycINFO. Following title/abstract screening, full-text extractions were performed on 125 English-language publications on coping in youth with chronic pain.
   Results: Of the 125 studies, only 12.8% used a theoretical framework to explain the coping responses assessed, and even fewer (7.2%) used theory to guide measure selection. Conceptual clarity was rated "low/very low" (i.e., no definitions and/or examples) for 47.2% of studies. The majority of studies were conducted in the United States (67%) and a preponderance of White and female participants was sampled. The research primarily used quantitative methods (85%) and cross-sectional designs (67%). Parent- or self-report questionnaires were the most common methods for assessing coping (86%). Of the 95 studies that utilized one of the 14 questionnaires with known psychometric properties, 33.7 and 55.8% had one or more discrepancies for conceptual and measurement consistency, respectively.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the lack of clear descriptions and theoretical frameworks of coping responses for pediatric chronic pain. Inconsistencies in the measurement and conceptualization of coping responses limit research and clinical advancements. As a field, we need to strive toward using well-developed theory to create fewer, more well-established standardized measures with clearly defined coping responses. Opportunities for qualitative and observational research in more diverse patient populations should be considered for theory construction and measure validation.

AB  - Objectives: This systematic review aimed to understand the current state of the art about the effectiveness of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) on individuals with substance use disorders (SUD), taking into account not only SUD variables (e.g., cravings, frequency of use) but also other relevant clinical variables (e.g., anxiety and depressive symptoms, quality of life). Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted to identify studies that investigate MBRP interventions on individuals with SUD. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were synthesized and assessed using systematic review methods. Results: Thirteen studies were included in the present review. The methodological quality of the included studies was moderately strong. Nine studies (69.2%) used the traditional 16 h MBRP program. Six studies (46.1%) chose to use a co-intervention treatment ranging from the treatment as usual (TAU) to cognitive behavioral therapy. All but one study indicated that their interventions produced positive effects on at least one addiction outcome measure. None of the interventions were evaluated across different settings or populations. Conclusions: Despite some heterogeneity regarding the type of MBRP program used, results support the effectiveness of these interventions in the SUD population, especially in reducing cravings, decreasing the frequency of use, and improving depressive symptoms.</p>

AB  - The use of serious games and entertainment games was compared as adjuvant tools for intervention in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A comprehensive search was performed in the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. From 295 studies, 53 studies were selected and included in this review. Overall, studies showed improvement after intervention, regardless of the type of video games, mostly for social skills and behavior. However, these changes should be regarded with caution, as they are limited to the tests applied. Furthermore, neither the entertainment nor the serious approach had a therapeutic impact on emotional resilience, representing the current gap in the field. Thus, even considering the limitations, our study is important because it shows that both categories have strengths.

AB  - Objective To systematically examine the effectiveness and tolerability of psilocybin for treating end-of-life anxiety symptoms. Methods The Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO databases were searched up to November 25, 2020. We enrolled clinical trials investigating psilocybin for treating end-of-life anxiety symptoms. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model. Results Overall, five studies were included, revealing that psilocybin was superior to the placebo in treating state anxiety at 1 day (Hedges' g,-0.70; 95% confidence interval,-1.01 to-0.39) and 2 weeks (-1.03;-1.47 to-0.60) after treatment. Psilocybin was more effec-tive than placebo in treating trait anxiety at 1 day (-0.71;-1.15 to-0.26), 2 weeks (-1.08;-1.80 to-0.36), and 6 months (-0.84;-1.37 to-0.30) after treatment. Psilocybin was associated with transient elevation in systolic (19.00; 13.58-24.41 mm Hg) and diastolic (8.66; 5.18-12.15 mm Hg) blood pressure compared with placebo. The differences between psilocybin and placebo groups with regard to all-cause discontinuation, serious adverse events, and heart rates were nonsignificant. Conclusion Psilocybin-assisted therapy could ameliorate end-of-life anxiety symptoms without serious adverse events. Because of the small sample sizes of the included studies and high heterogeneity on long-term outcomes, future randomized controlled trials with large sample sizes are needed.

AB  - Perinatal Depression (PND) is a severe mental disorder that appears during pregnancy or in the post-partum. Although PND has been associated with behavioral problems in the offspring, its effects on brain development are unclear. With this review we aimed at summarizing the existing literature on the effects of perinatal depressive symptoms on children's brains. A search on PubMed and Embase of structural, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies exploring the effect of PND on offspring's brain was conducted. We selected twenty-six studies, ten structural MRI, five DTI, six fMRI and five with combined techniques. Overall, the studies showed: a) gray matter alterations in amygdala and fronto-temporal lobes; b) microstructural alterations in amygdala, frontal lobe, cingulum, longitudinal fasciculus and fornix; and c) functional alterations between limbic and mesocortical networks. The small sample size and the heterogeneity in populations and methodologies limit this review. In conclusion, PND seems to influence structure and function of offspring, that may contribute to the risk of behavioral disturbances later in life.

AB  - Caregivers and families of autistic people have experienced stress and increase in demands due to the COVID-19 pandemic that may have long-term negative consequences for both their own and their children's mental health. A scoping review was conducted to identify pandemic related demands experienced by caregivers and families of autistic children and youth. The review also consolidated information on coping strategies and parenting-related guidelines that have emerged to help parents meet these demands. Search strategies were approved by a research librarian and were conducted in peer-reviewed and gray literature databases between May 2020 and February 2021. Additional resources were solicited through author networks and social media. All articles were published between December 2019 and February 2021. Article summaries were charted, and a thematic analysis was conducted with confirmation of findings with our knowledge users. Twenty-three published articles and 14 pieces of gray literature were included in the review. The majority of articles characterized and highlighted the increase in demands on caregivers of autistic children and youth during the pandemic globally. Both quantitative and qualitative studies suggest that parents have experienced an increase in stress and mental health-related symptoms during lockdown measures. Findings suggest that families are employing coping strategies, but there no evidence-based supports were identified. The review highlighted the potential long-term impact of prolonged exposure to increasing demands on the mental health and wellbeing of caregivers and families of autistic people, and pointed to a need for the rapid development and evaluation of flexible and timely support programs. Lay Summary Caregivers and families of autistic children and youth have faced increased demands due to pandemic-related lockdown measures. We reviewed the literature to outline sources of stress, links to their influence on caregiver mental health, and if support programs have emerged to help them. Our findings suggest a number of demands have increased caregivers' risk to mental health challenges, and their potential impact on family wellbeing. Ongoing development of evidence-based supports of all families of autistic children and youth are needed.

AB  - The relaxin-3/RXFP3 system is one of several neuropeptidergic systems putatively implicated in regulating the behavioural alterations that characterise clinical depression and anxiety, making it a potential target for clinical translation. Accordingly, this systematic review identified published reports on the role of relaxin-3/RXFP3 signalling in these neuropsychiatric disorders and their behavioural endophenotypes, evaluating evidence from animal and human studies to ascertain any relationship. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar databases up to February 2021, finding 609 relevant records. After stringent screening, 51 of these studies were included in the final synthesis. There was considerable heterogeneity in study designs and some inconsistency across study outcomes. However, experimental evidence is consistent with an ability of relaxin-3/RXFP3 signalling to promote arousal and suppress depressive- and anxiety-like behaviour. Moreover, meta-analyses of six to eight articles investigating food intake revealed that acute RXFP3 activation had strong orexigenic effects in rats. This appraisal also identified the lack of high-quality clinical studies pertinent to the relaxin-3/RXFP3 system, a gap that future research should attempt to bridge.

AB  - Aim: Patients with malignancies, experience high rates of psychological distress. Fear of Corona-infection combined with the interruptions in some treatment programs might affect the psychological health of cancer patients. This review study was conducted to investigate the psychological distress among cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic to offer system-adapted individual solutions.
   Materials and methods: To identify the psychological distress of cancer patients, a comprehensive search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. English language and original articles were included in this study. Articles that addressed any psychological distress among cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic were included.
   Results: At first 1,410 articles, were included in the study. After removing duplicate articles and reviewing the title and abstract, 55 articles were selected for the review. The findings of this study revealed COVID-19 greatly affects psychological health of cancer patients. Fear of COVID-19, fear of disease progression, disruption of oncology services, cancer stage, and immunocompromised status were the most common causes of psychological distress in oncology patients which can influence patients' decisions about treatment.
   Conclusion: The COVID-19 related anxiety is an expected reaction to the current situation. Although psychological distress affects many people, it can confuse cancer patients to the point that they refuse to continue treatment for the fear of infection and worsening of their condition. Since the end of this pandemic is unknown, this action can endanger the health and prognosis of this group of patients, so it seems that using psychological interventions and intensive counseling in the current situation is one of the main priorities for cancer patients.

AB  - Background: To monitor population mental health, the identification of relevant indicators is pivotal. This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of current indicators representing the various fields of public mental health core topics. It was conducted as a first step to build up a Mental Health Surveillance for Germany.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic MEDLINE search via PubMed. This search was supplemented by an extensive examination of the websites of relevant national as well as international institutions in the context of public mental health and an additional internet search via Google. To structure the data, an expert-based focus group identified superordinate topics most relevant to public mental health to which the identified indicators could be assigned to. Finally, the indicator set was screened for duplicates and appropriate content to arrive at a final set.
   Results: Within the various search strategies, we identified 13.811 records. Of these records, a total of 365 records were processed for indicator extraction. The extracted indicators were then assigned to 14 topics most relevant to public mental health as identified by the expert-based focus group. After the exclusion of duplicates and those indicators not meeting criteria of specificity and target group, the final set consisted of 192 indicators.
   Conclusion: The presented indicator set provides guidance in the field of current concepts in public mental health monitoring. As a comprehensive compilation, it may serve as basis for future surveillance efforts, which can be adjusted and condensed depending on the particular monitoring focus. Our work provides insights into established indicators included in former surveillance work as well as recent, not yet included indicators reflecting current developments in the field. Since our compilation mainly concludes indicators related to mental health in adults, it should be complemented with indicators specific to children and adolescents. Furthermore, our review revealed that indicators on mental health promotion and prevention are underrepresented in current literature of public mental health and should hence be focused on within future research and surveillance.

AB  - Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic caused countries across the globe to impose restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, with people instructed to stay at home and reduce contact with others. This reduction in social contact has the potential to negatively impact mental health and well-being. The restrictions are particularly concerning for people with existing chronic illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, who may be especially affected by concerns about the pandemic and associated reduction of social contact. The aim of this review was to synthesise published literature on the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the social and psychological well-being of people with Parkinson's disease. Study design: The design of this study is a scoping review. Methods: We searched five electronic databases for English language articles containing primary data on this topic. Results: Thirty-one relevant studies were found and included in the review. Six main themes were identified: impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health; COVID-19 concerns; access to health care; impact on daily and social activities; impact on physical activity and impact on caregivers. Levels of perceived risk of COVID-19 differed across studies, but most participants had adopted preventive measures such as staying at home and reducing social contacts. Participants in many studies reported a discontinuation of regular healthcare appointments and physiotherapy, as well as concerns about being able to obtain medication. Loss of daily activities and social support was noted by many participants. There was mixed evidence on the impact of the pandemic on physical exercise, with some studies finding no change in physical activity and others reporting a reduction; generally, participants with reduced physical activity had poorer mental health and greater worsening of symptoms. Caregivers of people with Parkinson's disease were more likely to be negatively affected by the pandemic if they cared for people with complex needs such as additional mental health problems. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on the physical and mental health of people with Parkinson's disease, perhaps due to disruption of healthcare services, loss of usual activities and supports and reduction in physical activity. We make recommendations for policy, practice and future research. (c) 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders are both common and especially challenging during pregnancy. Considering possible risks of intrauterine drug exposure of the child, the role of psychopharmacological treatment is ambiguous and various negative obstetric outcomes were inconsistently associated with medication. Consequently, a critical examination of peri- and postnatal phenomena associated with intrauterine exposure to antidepressants based on serotonin reuptake inhibition (SRI) and subsumed under the term "poor neonatal adaptation syndrome" (PNAS) is urgently called for. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted, revealing a total number of 33 relevant studies and 69 individual outcomes among 3025 screened studies. Seventeen outcomes allowed meta-analytic evaluation (random effects model). Measures for heterogeneity (I-2) and contour-enhanced funnel plots were generated. Results Single studies showed increased risks for deficits in neurological functioning and autonomous adaptation in SRI exposed infants. Meta-analytical evaluation showed increased symptom occurrence or severity in exposed neonates for low APGAR scores, birth weight, size for gestational age, preterm delivery, neuromuscular and autonomous regulation, and higher rates of admission to specialized care. Mostly, increased risk after SRI exposure was supported by comparison to unexposed infants born to mothers diagnosed with depression. Conclusion Whereas statistically significant evidence for various effects of intrauterine exposure to SRI was found, the clinical relevance remains unresolved because of inherently low data quality in this research domain and insufficiently defined samples and outcomes. More systematic research under ethical considerations is required to improve multiprofessional counseling in the many women dealing with MDD during pregnancy and the peripartum.

AB  - Acute and chronic psychological distress are prevalent during adolescence and can have negative impacts on adolescents in all life domains. The aim of this systematic review was to appraise the use of virtual reality (VR) interventions to manage symptoms of psychological distress symptoms among adolescents. MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases were searched up to June 2020. Available citations were de-duplicated and screened by two authors using title and abstract information. A total of 301 articles were retained for full-text evaluation next to eligibility criteria. Empirical studies of all designs and comparator groups were included if these appraised the impact of an immersive VR intervention on any standardized measure indicative of psychological distress in an adolescent sample. Data were extracted into a standardized coding sheet. Results were tabulated and discussed with a narrative synthesis due to the heterogeneity between studies. A total of seven studies met inclusion criteria. There were four randomized controlled trials and three uncontrolled pilot studies on new VR interventions. Distress-related issues included: state-anxiety, venepuncture, risk taking, public speaking anxiety, social anxiety disorder, sexual victimization, and chemotherapy administration. All studies reported significant changes on outcome measures after VR treatment. Six studies reported small-to-large reductions in symptoms. The average attrition rate was 3.6 percent during the active VR treatment phase. Treatment acceptability was high in the studies that assessed user engagement factors. The VR technology can provide a safe, rapidly efficacious, and acceptable treatment modality for managing psychological distress in several key adolescent populations.

AB  - Literature reviews on how social media use affects adolescent mental health have accumulated at an unprecedented rate of late. Yet, a higher-level integration of the evidence is still lacking. We fill this gap with an up-to-date umbrella review, a review of reviews published between 2019 and mid-2021. Our search yielded 25 reviews: seven meta-analyses, nine systematic, and nine narrative reviews. Results showed that most reviews interpreted the associations between social media use and mental health as 'weak' or 'inconsistent,' whereas a few qualified the same associations as 'substantial' and 'deleterious.' We summarize the gaps identified in the reviews, provide an explanation for their diverging interpretations, and suggest several avenues for future research.

AB  - Background: Psychiatric disorders have been identified as an important risk factor for suicide. However, different psychological autopsy studies have revealed different prevalences at different times and places. Objective: We aimed to see the distribution of psychological autopsy studies and the prevalence of mental disorders among suicides and identify major risk factors in Southeast Asian countries. Method: We scrutinized psychological autopsy studies published in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia (SEA) region countries. We also searched the available bibliographies to identify the studies in the region so that all the possible articles could be included. Results: Out of the 11 countries, 14 psychological autopsy studies were identified in five SEA countries (Bangladesh [1], India [9], Indonesia [1], Nepal [1], and Sri Lanka [2]). Seven studies (50%) used a case-control study design, and eight (57.1%) were carried out in urban settings. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in case-control studies was from 37% to 88%. Stressful life event was identified as a major risk factor in all the case-control studies. Conclusion: Psychological autopsy studies have not been conducted in 6 out of 11 countries of the SEA region. The presence of pre-existing psychiatric morbidity and stressful life events were the two most common risk factors noted across settings, even though there is wide heterogeneity in samples, study design, instruments, and study settings.

AB  - Objective To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the association between residential or occupational short- and long-term exposure to odour pollution from industrial sources and the health status of the exposed population. Methods The searches were conducted in Medline, EMBASE and Scopus in April 2021. Exposure to an environmental odour from industrial sources in population resident near the source or in workers was considered. We considered outcomes for which there was a biological plausibility, such as wheezing and asthma, cough, headache, nausea and vomiting (primary outcomes). We also included stress-related symptoms and novel outcomes (e.g. mood states). Risk of bias was evaluated using the OHAT tool. For primary outcomes, when at least 3 studies provided effect estimates by comparing exposed subjects versus not exposed, we pooled the study-specific estimates of odour-related effect using random effects models. Heterogeneity was evaluated with Higgins I-2. Results Thirty studies were eligible for this review, mainly cross-sectional (n = 23). Only one study involved school-age children and two studies involved workers. Only five studies reported odour effects on objective laboratory or clinical outcomes. Animal Feeding Operations and waste were the most common industrial sources. The overall odds ratios in exposed versus not exposed population were 1.15 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.29) for headache (7 studies), 1.09 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.30) for nausea/vomiting (7 studies), and 1.27 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.44) for cough/phlegm (5 studies). Heterogeneity was a moderate concern. Overall, the body of evidence was affected by a definitely high risk of bias in exposure and outcome assessment since most studies used self-reported information. Conclusions Findings underline the public health importance of odour pollution for population living nearby industrial odour sources. The limited evidence for most outcomes supports the need for high quality epidemiological studies on the association between odour pollution and its effects on human health.

AB  - Background: People with chronic pain (CP) sometimes report impaired cognitive function, including a deficit of attention, memory, executive planning, and information processing. However, the association between CP and cognitive decline was still not clear. Our study aimed to assess the association of CP as a risk factor with cognitive decline among adults.Methods: We included data from clinical studies. Publications were identified using a systematic search strategy from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to October 10, 2020. We used the mean cognitive outcome data and the standard deviations from each group. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were performed for each cognitive decline outcome. I-2-values were assessed to quantify the heterogeneities.Results: We included 37 studies with a total of 52,373 patients with CP and 80,434 healthy control participants. Because these studies used different evaluative methods, we analyzed these studies. The results showed CP was associated with cognitive decline when the short-form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36) mental component summary (SMD = -1.50, 95% CI = -2.19 to -0.81), the Montreal cognitive assessment (SMD = -1.11, 95% CI = -1.60 to -0.61), performance validity testing (SMD = 3.05, 95% CI = 1.74 to 4.37), or operation span (SMD = -1.83, 95% CI = -2.98 to -0.68) were used. However, we got opposite results when the studies using International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems classification (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 0.97 to 2.56), the Mini-Mental State Examination (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI = -0.94 to 0.10; OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.42), and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status memory component (SMD = -0.06, 95% CI = -0.37 to 0.25).Conclusion: There may be an association between CP and the incidence of cognitive decline when some cognitive, evaluative methods were used, such as short-form 36 health survey questionnaire, Montreal cognitive assessment, performance validity testing, and operation span.

AB  - We assessed the association between anxiety and hypertension in adults via a systematic review/meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Ovid, and PsycINFO through 27 March 2020 with no language or publication type restrictions and systematically contacted study authors for unpublished information/data. We meta-analysed 59 studies including a total of 4,012,775 participants. Study quality was rated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and random-effects analyses were performed. A significant anxiety-hypertension association was found in crosssectional (OR = 1.37, 95 % CI = 1.21-1.54) and prospective studies (OR = 1.40, 95 % CI = 1.23-1.59). In sensitivity analyses, results were influenced by method of hypertension diagnosis, but not by study quality, method of anxiety diagnosis, study population, and effect size type. In subgroup analyses, study location, in particular country economic status, but not participant age, influenced the results. Longitudinal data and theoretical literature indicate that anxiety may precede hypertension. These findings have important clinical implications for the early detection and treatment of both anxiety and hypertension. Suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Background Old age bipolar disorder has been an orphan of psychiatric research for a long time despite the fact that bipolar disorder (BD)-I and II together may affect 0.5-1.0% of the elderly. It is also unclear whether aetiology, course of illness and treatment should differ in patients with a first manifestation in older age and patients suffering from a recurrence of a BD known for decades. This narrative review will summarize the current state of knowledge about the epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment of BD in the elderly. Methods We conducted a Medline literature search from 1970 to 2021 using MeSH terms "Bipolar Disorder" x "Aged" or "Geriatric" or "Elderly". Search results were complemented by additional literature retrieved from examining cross references and by hand search in text books. Summary of findings Varying cut-off ages have been applied to differentiate old age from adult age BD. Within old age BD, there is a reasonable agreement of distinct entities, early and late-onset BD. They differ to some extent in clinical symptoms, course of illness, and some co-morbidities. Point prevalence of BD in older adults appears slightly lower than in working-age adults, with polarity of episodes shifting towards depression. Psychopharmacological treatment needs to take into account the special aspects of somatic gerontology and the age-related change of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. The evidence for commonly used treatments such as lithium, mood-stabilizing antiepileptics, antipsychotics, and antidepressants remains sparse. Preliminary results support a role of ECT as well as psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions in old age BD. Conclusions There is an obvious need of further research for all treatment modalities of BD in old age. The focus should be pharmacological and psychosocial approaches, as well as their combination, and the role of physical treatment modalities such as ECT.

AB  - Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) and administrative healthcare data (AHD) are frequently used in geriatric mental health research to answer various health research questions. However, there is an increasing amount and complexity of data available that may lend itself to alternative analytic approaches using machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) methods. We performed a systematic review of the current application of ML or AI approaches to the analysis of EHR and AHD in geriatric mental health.Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to identify potential studies. We included all articles that used ML or AI methods on topics related to geriatric mental health utilizing EHR or AHD data. We assessed study quality either by Prediction model Risk OF Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) or Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist.Results: We initially identified 391 articles through an electronic database and reference search, and 21 articles met inclusion criteria. Among the selected studies, EHR was the most used data type, and the datasets were mainly structured. A variety of ML and AI methods were used, with prediction or classification being the main application of ML or AI with the random forest as the most common ML technique. Dementia was the most common mental health condition observed. The relative advantages of ML or AI techniques compared to biostatistical methods were generally not assessed. Only in three studies, low risk of bias (ROB) was observed according to all the PROBAST domains but in none according to QUADAS-2 domains. The quality of study reporting could be further improved.Conclusion: There are currently relatively few studies using ML and AI in geriatric mental health research using EHR and AHD methods, although this field is expanding. Aside from dementia, there are few studies of other geriatric mental health conditions. The lack of consistent information in the selected studies precludes precise comparisons between them. Improving the quality of reporting of ML and AI work in the future would help improve research in the field. Other courses of improvement include using common data models to collect/organize data, and common datasets for ML model validation.

AB  - Neural circuits in the mammalian central nervous system are modified in response to neural activity during development. In this Review, Faust and colleagues provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying developmental synaptic pruning and how alterations in this process can occur in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia.
   Almost 60 years have passed since the initial discovery by Hubel and Wiesel that changes in neuronal activity can elicit developmental rewiring of the central nervous system (CNS). Over this period, we have gained a more comprehensive picture of how both spontaneous neural activity and sensory experience-induced changes in neuronal activity guide CNS circuit development. Here we review activity-dependent synaptic pruning in the mammalian CNS, which we define as the removal of a subset of synapses, while others are maintained, in response to changes in neural activity in the developing nervous system. We discuss the mounting evidence that immune and cell-death molecules are important mechanistic links by which changes in neural activity guide the pruning of specific synapses, emphasizing the role of glial cells in this process. Finally, we discuss how these developmental pruning programmes may go awry in neurodevelopmental disorders of the human CNS, focusing on autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Together, our aim is to give an overview of how the field of activity-dependent pruning research has evolved, led to exciting new questions and guided the identification of new, therapeutically relevant mechanisms that result in aberrant circuit development in neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - The role of diet in depression is becoming increasingly acknowledged. This umbrella review aimed to summarize comprehensively the current evidence reporting the effects of dietary factors on the prevention and treatment of depression. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to June 2021 to identify relevant meta-analyses of prospective studies. Twenty-eight meta-analyses, with 40 summary estimates on dietary patterns (n = 8), food and beverages (n = 19), and nutrients (n = 13) were eligible. The methodological quality of most meta-analyses was low (50.0%) or very low (25.0%). Quality of evidence was moderate for inverse associations for depression incidence with healthy diet [risk ratio (RR): 0.74, 95% confidential interval (CI), 0.48-0.99, I-2 = 89.8%], fish (RR: 0.88, 95% CI, 0.79-0.97, I-2 = 0.0%), coffee (RR: 0.89, 95% CI, 0.84-0.94, I-2 = 32.9%), dietary zinc (RR: 0.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.82, I-2 = 13.9%), light to moderate alcohol (<40 g/day, RR: 0.77, 95% CI, 0.74-0.83, I-2 = 20.5%), as well as for positive association with sugar-sweetened beverages (RR: 1.05, 95% CI, 1.01-1.09, I-2 = 0.0%). For depression treatment, moderate-quality evidence was identified for the effects of probiotic [standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.31, 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.07, I-2 = 48.2%], omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (SMD: -0.28, 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.09, I-2 = 75.0%) and acetyl-l-carnitine (SMD: -1.10, 95% CI, -1.65 to -0.56, I-2 = 86.0%) supplementations. Overall, the associations between dietary factors and depression had been extensively evaluated, but none of them were rated as high quality of evidence, suggesting further studies are likely to change the summary estimates. Thus, more well-designed research investigating more detailed dietary factors in association with depression is warranted.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Hypothyroidism is considered a cause of or a strong risk factor for depression, but recent studies provide conflicting evidence regarding the existence and the extent of the association. It is also unclear whether the link is largely due to subsyndromal depression or holds true for clinical depression.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression in the general population.
   DATA SOURCES PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases were searched from inception until May 2020 for studies on the association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression.
   STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently selected epidemiologic and population-based studies that provided laboratory or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems diagnoses of hypothyroidism and diagnoses of depression according to operationalized criteria (eg, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) or cutoffs in established rating scales.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated studies based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Summary odds ratios (OR) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prespecified coprimary outcomeswere the association of clinical depression with either hypothyroidism or autoimmunity.
   RESULTS Of 4350 articles screened, 25 studies were selected formeta-analysis, including 348 014 participants. Hypothyroidism and clinical depression were associated (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.08-1.57]), while the OR for autoimmunity was inconclusive (1.24 [95% CI, 0.89-1.74]). Subgroup analyses revealed a stronger association with overt than with subclinical hypothyroidism, with ORs of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.13-2.77) and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.01-1.28), respectively. Sensitivity analyses resulted in more conservative estimates. In a post hoc analysis, the association was confirmed in female individuals (OR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.18-1.85]) but not in male individuals (OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.40-1.25]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the effect size for the association between hypothyroidism and clinical depression was considerably lower than previously assumed, and the modest association was possibly restricted to overt hypothyroidism and female individuals. Autoimmunity alone may not be the driving factor in this comorbidity.

AB  - Obesity is linked with health and psychosocial outcomes among many populations. However, it is unclear the extent to which obesity is linked with these outcomes among autistic adults. We searched seven research databases for articles examining the association between obesity and autistic adults' health and psychosocial outcomes. Three studies found that obesity was associated with health outcomes, including: in-hospital mortality, risk of type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and number of co-occurring medical conditions. One study found no significant association between autism diagnosis, mental health conditions, and body mass index. Obesity increases the risk of in-hospital mortality and some chronic conditions among autistic adults, highlighting the need for clinicians trained to promote weight management among autistic adults.

AB  - Background: Psychotherapy is the recommended treatment for borderline personality disorder. While systematic reviews have demonstrated the effectiveness of psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder, effect sizes remain small and influenced by bias. Furthermore, the proportion of people who do not respond to treatment is seldom reported or analysed. Objective: To obtain an informed estimate of the proportion of people who do not respond to psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder. Methods: Systematic searches of five databases, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library, occurred in November 2020. Inclusion criteria: participants diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, treated with psychotherapy and data reporting either (a) the proportion of the sample that experienced 'reliable change' or (b) the percentage of sample that no longer met criteria for borderline personality disorder at conclusion of therapy. Exclusion criteria: studies published prior to 1980 or not in English. Of the 19,517 studies identified, 28 met inclusion criteria. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included in the review comprising a total of 2436 participants. Average treatment duration was 11 months using well-known evidence-based approaches. Approximately half did not respond to treatment; M = 48.80% (SD = 22.77). Limitations: Data regarding within sample variability and non-response are seldom reported. Methods of reporting data on dosage and comorbidities were highly divergent which precluded the ability to conduct predictive analyses. Other limitations include lack of sensitivity analysis, and studies published in English only. Conclusion: Results of this review suggest that a large proportion of people are not responding to psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder and that factors relating to non-response are both elusive and inconsistently reported. Novel, tailored or enhanced interventions are needed to improve outcomes for individuals not responding to current established treatments.

AB  - Objective: This rapid review aimed to understand the rates of suicidal ideation and behaviours in men who are separated from intimate relationships, the co-occurrence of risk factors, and the effectiveness of suicide prevention interventions for them in order to inform future suicide prevention efforts.
   Method: The review method followed a streamlined systematic review process which facilitates an expedited review of the evidence related to the review questions. We searched three academic databases (Cochrane, Medline and PsycINFO) for peer-reviewed articles published between 2010 and 2019 in English using keywords related to men who are separated from an intimate relationship; suicidal thoughts, attempts and deaths; suicide rates; and suicide prevention interventions.
   Results: Four systematic reviews and 22 papers featuring primary studies were included in the review relating to suicide rates and risk. No papers were identified relating to the effectiveness of suicide prevention interventions for this group. The evidence base was rated as good. The findings suggest that men who are separated from an intimate relationship are at higher risk of suicide.
   Discussion: The review identified an increased risk of suicide among men who are separated, but no evidence about the effectiveness of suicide prevention interventions for them. More work is needed to unpack the interplay between personal and sociodemographic factors and the risk of suicide for separated men in order to inform suicide prevention efforts with these men.

AB  - One of the essential non-pharmacological treatments for patients with chronic diseases are psychosocial supports and counselling services such as spiritual psychotherapy. Although several preliminary studies represent the effects of counselling and spiritual psychotherapy on anxiety in patients with chronic diseases, there are various contradictions among the findings. The present meta-analysis aimed to determine the effects of counselling and spiritual care programs on anxiety in patients with chronic diseases. For data collection, various databases were searched regarding no time limitation until May 2021, including SID, MagIran, Embase, ProQuest, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science (WoS) using Google Scholar search engine. Inclusion criteria were original research articles, interventional studies, and exclusion criteria were irrelevant assessments, systematic review and meta-analysis studies, case reports, letters to the editor, and duplicate papers. I-2 test was used to calculate heterogeneity of studies, and the Egger's test was applied to examine the publication bias. According to the inclusion criteria, 26 articles were selected among 612 initial papers with a sample size of 1040 individuals. The mean anxiety scores before and after the interventions were 33.02 +/- 3.77 and 25.27 +/- 3.66, respectively. The significant (P < 0.05) mean difference before and after the interventions was 1.74 +/- 0.23. Counselling and psychotherapy can reduce anxiety in patients with chronic diseases.

AB  - Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a significant public health concern, with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) being a common cause, and a particular relationship exists with the severity of depression. A literature search on OSA, depression, and EDS was performed in PubMed. The chosen evidence was limited to human studies. Available evidence was systematically reviewed to ascertain the association of EDS with depression and OSA according to the general population and some specific population subgroups. In addition, effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was analyzed as a standard therapy for improving EDS and depression in patients with OSA. In the general population, patients with OSA, and some other subpopulations, the review contributed to: (1) delineating the prevalence of EDS; (2) substantiating the relationship of EDS and depression; (3) presenting the relationship between EDS and OSA; and (4) revealing that the duration of CPAP is crucial for its therapeutic effects in improving EDS and depressive symptoms in patients with OSA.

AB  - The Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) was introduced as a promising pupillary workload measure for field investigations since, unlike pupil dilation, it is not affected by illumination. Recent studies have investigated the ICA for task-evoked cognitive workload with contradictory findings. However, few studies investigated the influence of illumination on the ICA. Therefore, to examine inconsistencies regarding the reliability for workload measurement and the effects of light, a meta-analysis was conducted based on a structured literature review. The meta-analysis considered k = 14 studies with a total sample size of N = 751 participants. Results showed significant effects for workload (r = 0.61) and light (r = 0.45) on the ICA. Since moderating effects were found for several between-study differences, it seems likely that different cognitive processes and settings affect the indicator and should be considered in empirical investigations. According to the findings, the ICA is a reliable indicator for task-evoked workload. However, light influences were found which indicates that evidence-based conclusions regarding the ICA's practical applicability require further research.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly employed in health care fields such as oncology, radiology, and dermatology. However, the use of AI in mental health care and neurobiological research has been modest. Given the high morbidity and mortality in people with psychiatric disorders, coupled with a worsening shortage of mental health care providers, there is an urgent need for AI to help identify high-risk individuals and provide interventions to prevent and treat mental illnesses. While published research on AI in neuropsychiatry is rather limited, there is a growing number of successful examples of AI's use with electronic health records, brain imaging, sensor-based monitoring systems, and social media platforms to predict, classify, or subgroup mental illnesses as well as problems such as suicidality. This article is the product of a study group held at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology conference in 2019. It provides an overview of AI approaches in mental health care, seeking to help with clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, as well as clinical and technological challenges, focusing on multiple illustrative publications. Although AI could help redefine mental illnesses more objectively, identify them at a prodromal stage, personalize treatments, and empower patients in their own care, it must address issues of bias, privacy, transparency, and other ethical concerns. These aspirations reflect human wisdom, which is more strongly associated than intelligence with individual and societal well-being. Thus, the future AI or artificial wisdom could provide technology that enables more compassionate and ethically sound care to diverse groups of people.

AB  - This manuscript is based on a keynote address presented at the 2020 Marce Society's Conference celebrating the Society's 40th anniversary. The address described a 50-year perspective on prevention research, current evidence that perinatal depression can be prevented, and how digital tools could be used to disseminate perinatal depression prevention interventions throughout the world. We utilized the Mothers and Babies Course as a case study to illustrate these goals. The article reviews the gradual progress of depression prevention research, from the time when the state of the science was such that it was believed that the onset of major depressive episodes could not be prevented until the present day. In addition, the article recounts the three consensus reports on prevention of mental disorders published by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, culminating in the 2019 report, which calls on the field to implement known interventions for the prevention of depression and other mental disorders, and to scale up their administration to reduce the prevalence of these disorders in the general population. The paper presents the 2019 recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force, which instructs the health system to provide routine referrals to perinatal depression prevention interventions (e.g., the Mothers and Babies Course) to perinatal persons at risk for depression. We now have the knowledge to prevent approximately half of episodes of perinatal depression. It is time to implement this knowledge and begin to do research on how to prevent the remaining half.

Publications about NP associated with depression or anxiety increased exponentially from 2000 to 2020. However, studies that applied the bibliometric method in analyzing global scientific research about NP associated with depression or anxiety are rare. This work used the bibliometric method to analyze the publications on NP associated with depression or anxiety between 2000 and 2020.</p>
   Method: Publications from 2000 and 2020 were identified from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS) database. We employed CiteSpace V to conduct the bibliometric study.</p>
   Results: A total of 915 articles or reviews were obtained from the WoS database. The number of publications has increased over the last two decades. The USA was the most productive among countries or regions in the field. According to the burst key words, neuroinflammation, hippocampus, safety, and modulation were the hot global research issues in the domain.</p>
   Conclusion: Publications about NP associated with depression or anxiety have remarkably increased from 2000 to 2020. These historical opinions about NP associated with depression or anxiety could be an important practical basis for further research into potential development trends.</p>

AB  - Aims In the search for effective therapeutic strategies for depression, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) emerged as a non-invasive, promising treatment. This is because the antidepressant effect of rTMS might be related to neuronal plasticity mechanisms possibly reverting connectivity alterations often observed in depression. Therefore, in this review, we aimed at providing an overview of the findings reported by studies investigating functional and structural connectivity changes after rTMS in depression. Methods A bibliographic search was conducted on PubMed, including studies that used unilateral, excitatory (> 10 Hz) rTMS treatment targeted on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in unipolar depressed patients. Results The majority of the results showed significant TMS-induced changes in functional connectivity (FC) between areas important for emotion regulation, including the DLPFC and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and among regions that are part of the major resting-state networks, such as the Default Mode Network, the Salience Networks and the Central Executive Network. Finally, in diffusion tensor imaging studies, it has been reported that rTMS appeared to increase fractional anisotropy in the frontal lobe. Limitations The small sample size, the heterogeneity of the rTMS stimulation parameters, the concomitant use of psychotropic drugs might have limited the generalisability of the results. Conclusions Overall, rTMS treatment induces structural and FC changes in brain regions and networks implicated in the pathogenesis of unipolar depression. However, whether these changes underlie the antidepressant effect of rTMS still needs to be clarified.

AB  - Background: Shared decision-making (SDM) in mental healthcare has received increased attention as a process to reinforce person-centered care. With the rapid development of digital health technology, researchers investigate how digital interventions may be utilized to support SDM. Despite the promise of digital interventions to support SDM, the effect of these in mental healthcare has not been evaluated before. Thus, this paper aims to assess the effect of SDM interventions complimented by digital technology in mental healthcare.
   Objective: The objective of this review was to systematically examine the effectiveness of digital SDM interventions on patient outcomes as investigated in randomized trials.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on digital SDM interventions for people with a mental health condition. We searched for relevant studies in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search strategy included terms relating to SDM, digital systems, mental health conditions, and study type. The primary outcome was patient activation or indices of the same (e.g., empowerment and self-efficacy), adherence to treatment, hospital admissions, severity of symptoms, and level of functioning. Secondary outcomes were satisfaction, decisional conflict, working alliance, usage, and adherence of medicine; and adverse events were defined as harms or side effects.
   Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria with outcome data from 2,400 participants. Digital SDM interventions had a moderate positive effect as compared with a control condition on patient activation [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.56, CI: 0.10, 1.01, p = 0.02], a small effect on general symptoms (SMD = -0.17, CI: -0.31, -0.03, p = 0.02), and working alliance (SMD = 0.21, CI: 0.02, 0.41, p = 0.03) and for improving decisional conflict (SMD = -0.37, CI: -0.70, -0.05, p = 0.02). No effect was found on self-efficacy, other types of mental health symptoms, adverse events, or patient satisfaction. A total of 39 outcomes were narratively synthesized with results either favoring the intervention group or showing no significant differences between groups. Studies were generally assessed to have unclear or high risk of bias, and outcomes had a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) rating of low- or very low-quality evidence.
   Conclusions: Digital interventions to support SDM may be a promising tool in mental healthcare; but with the limited quality of research, we have little confidence in the estimates of effect. More quality research is needed to further assess the effectiveness of digital means to support SDM but also to determine which digital intervention features are most effective to support SDM.

AB  - Problem Identification Many BRCA1/2 carriers experience an increase in distress after diagnosis; however, there is a need to review the longer term psychological implications of genetic confirmation and the factors associated with persistent distress. Literature Search This article systematically reviewed the literature in line with PRISMA guidelines on distress a minimum of six months after BRCA1/2 confirmation focusing on prevalence rates and factors associated with distress. Data Evaluation and Synthesis Fifteen studies were identified for inclusion and a narrative synthesis was conducted. Distress was associated with a range of demographic, clinical and psychological factors. A consistent finding was that although most carriers experience a reduction in distress 6-12 months after BRCA1/2 confirmation, those who experience persistent distress are more likely to have had higher distress levels at time of genetic testing. Risk reducing surgery may also play a role in reducing distress. Conclusion The review highlights the importance of psychological assessment and the use of specific distress measures. Given the considerable challenges in synthesizing the data there is a need for further prospective studies of high methodological quality.

AB  - Background Despite major efforts to address psychological distress and quality of life (QOL) in people with cancer, only none to small intervention effect has been observed. There is reason to question whether psychosocial needs of patients have already been met under the usual oncology care.
   Purpose The purpose of this systematic review was to examine changes in depression, anxiety and QOL during the existential plight in advanced cancer.
   Methods A literature search was performed in the PubMed and APA PsycINFO databases from year 1976 up to May 31, 2021. Longitudinal observational or experimental research targeting depression, anxiety or QOL in advanced cancer (stage III or IV), with baseline time since cancer diagnosis within 100 days, follow-up within 16 weeks post-baseline were eligible. Quality rating was based on the GRADE guidelines.
   Results Overall QOL did not reveal clinically relevant changes for the majority of studies as evaluated by effect size and raw score changes (median effect size 0.01, interquartile range -0.10-0.15). Nonetheless, modest to moderate improvement was found for depression (median effect size 0.28, interquartile range 0.03-0.38) and anxiety (median effect size 0.57, interquartile range 0.32-0.79).
   Conclusion Transient distress symptoms and temporarily reduced functioning in the oncology setting may be considered normal, whereas impaired overall QOL needs to be addressed. Developing innovative interventions that enhance QOL for patients newly diagnosed with advanced cancer without interfering with patients' natural adaptation process is imperative.

A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE from database inception to 7 January 2020. Random effect model was performed to summarize the scores of each domain and the forest plot was used to compare the scores of OA patients with healthy controls. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the source of heterogeneity. Statistical analyses were executed using Review Manager (version 5.1). In total, six studies were included in this study, including 7094 patients with OA and 12 100 healthy controls, which were all reliable to summarize the scores of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Meta-analyses found that pooled mean HRQoL score for the SF-36 each domain (physical function, physical role function, body pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role function, mental health) was lower in patients with OA than in healthy controls, especially the score in the dimension of physical role function. OA have a substantial impact HRQoL. HRQoL is a significant component of measuring overall health, which contributes to formulate successful self-disease management plan, patient-centered care, and develop effective interventions target confidence.

AB  - The efficient detection of neurological abnormalities (disorders) is very important in clinical diagnosis for modern medical applications. As stated by the World Health Organization's (WHO), brain diseases like Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke to headache, infected almost one billion people globally. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the current reference standard for diagnosis of most of the neurological diseases as it is inexpensive, bearable, and non-invasive compared to other tests (e.g. computed tomography, positron emission tomography, mini-mental state examination, and magnetic resonance imaging). Many studies are performed using EEG signals to detect the neurodegenerative abnormalities in the preliminary stage. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive survey on the recent studies which are made using EEG signals to detect the neurological diseases: Dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer, Schizophrenia, and Parkinson. This paper focuses on the following key research questions: (1) what are the key components of EEG signal processing, (2) what algorithms have been used in this processing, (3) which signal processing techniques have received more attention? The paper provides a clear description of the mentioned neuro-diseases along with the relevant studies. Moreover, this study presents all the recent efforts of the methods that are obtained various step of signal data processing including feature extraction and classification phases. Finally, an elaborated comparison of the existing efforts with their drawbacks and performance are reported. This will guide the medical field researchers and technology experts to discover more accurate solutions for neuro-diseases and come up with a neurological abnormality detection framework.

AB  - Catchment urbanization is widely recognised as a primary driver of stream degradation by increasing stormwater runoff, which causes major changes to key ecosystem processes. Reinstating the "natural" hydrogeomorphic conditions is central in designing successful, self-sustaining restoration actions; however, addressing urban stream degradation by reestablishing the hydrogeomorphic conditions remains a challenge, and comparatively limited measurable progress has been observed, particularly in achieving ecological objectives. This review articulates that stream restoration goals might be better achieved when management measures take a broader approach that considers anticipated hydraulic condition effects that liaise relationships between flow and ecology. The study argues that fluvial systems are characterised by complex and dynamic ecosystem processes primarily governed by the hydraulic conditions (e.g., velocity, depth, shear stress); thus, as the practice of addressing urban stream restoration becomes increasingly common, it is critical to explore and understand the anticipated response of the hydraulic conditions. It describes how hydraulic regime consideration provides further opportunity for a holistic approach to urban stream management given their capacity to account for multiple ecological and geomorphic objectives. This review suggests that developing suitable flow-biota-ecosystem processes nexus is critical to addressing urban stream degradation, and hydraulic consideration in restoration actions provides an important step towards that. It discusses opportunities to evolve management actions to achieve restoration goals by highlighting how the management of the two key levers (addressing altered flow regime and morphology) to improve the hydraulic conditions can help to address the urban stream disturbance.

AB  - Background: Ensuring young people experience good sexual health is a key public health concern, yet some vulnerable groups of young people remain at higher risk of poor sexual health. These individuals require additional support to achieve good sexual health but the best way to provide this remains needs to be better understood. Methods: We searched for randomised controlled trials of behavioural and psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting sexual health in high-risk young populations. Outcomes of interest were indicators of sexual health (e.g., condom use, attitudes to contraception, knowledge of risk). Participants were under 25 years old and in one of the following high-risk groups: alcohol and other drug use; ethnic minority; homeless; justice-involved; LGBTQI+; mental ill-health; or out-of-home care. Results: Twenty-eight papers from 26 trials met our inclusion criteria, with all but one conducted in North America. Condom use was the most frequently reported outcome measure along with knowledge and attitudes towards sexual health but considerable differences in measures used made comparisons across studies difficult. Change in knowledge and attitudes did not consistently result in long-term change in behaviours. Conclusions: There remains a dearth of research undertaken outside of North America across all high-risk groups of young people. Future interventions should address sexual health more broadly than just the absence of negative biological outcomes, with LGBTQI+, homeless and mental ill-health populations targeted for such work. An international consensus on outcome measures would support the research field going forward, making future meta-analyses possible.

AB  - Background: Mentalization processes seem to be of high relevance for social learning and seem important in all psychotherapies. The exact role of mentalization processes in psychotherapy is still unknown. The aim of the present systematic review is to investigate whether mentalization is related to the therapeutic outcome and, if so, whether it has a moderating, mediative, or predictive function. Method: A systematic review with an electronic database search was conducted. A total of 2567 records were identified, and 10 studies were included in the final synthesis. Results: Psychotherapy research is still in an initial phase of examining and understanding the impact of mentalization on psychotherapy outcome. The small number of studies and the executed study designs and statistical analyses indicate the possible role that mentalization has in psychotherapy. Conclusion: Generally, strongly elaborated study designs are needed to identify the role of mentalization in psychotherapy. Mentalization seems to be differently represented in differential treatment approaches. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the patient's mentalizing capacity seems to be relevant to the psychotherapy process. Psychotherapies should be adapted to this.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) represents an effective intervention for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). One priority of this research field is the clarification of ECT response mechanisms and the identification of biomarkers predicting its outcomes. We propose an overview of the molecular studies on ECT, concerning its course and outcome prediction, including also animal studies on electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), an experimental analogue of ECT. Most of these investigations underlie biological systems related to major depressive disorder (MDD), such as the neurotrophic and inflammatory/immune ones, indicating effects of ECT on these processes. Studies about neurotrophins, like the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), have shown evidence concerning ECT neurotrophic effects. The inflammatory/immune system has also been studied, suggesting an acute stress reaction following an ECT session. However, at the end of the treatment, ECT produces a reduction in inflammatory-associated biomarkers such as cortisol, TNF-alpha and interleukin 6. Other biological systems, including the monoaminergic and the endocrine, have been sparsely investigated. Despite some promising results, limitations exist. Most of the studies are concentrated on one or few markers and many studies are relatively old, with small sample sizes and methodological biases. Expression studies on gene transcripts and microRNAs are rare and genetic studies are sparse. To date, no conclusive evidence regarding ECT molecular markers has been reached; however, the future may be just around the corner.

AB  - Patients under dialysis are known to be more vulnerable to frailty, a dynamic geriatric syndrome defined as a state of vulnerability to stressors, due to numerous metabolic changes. With rise of life expectancy globally, it is important to understand the complexity of the pathophysiology of frailty and identify possible markers that can help with the prognosis and diagnosis of frailty. The aim of this systematic review is to give an overview of the knowledge regarding clinical and biochemical markers associated with pre-frailty and frailty in dialysis and pre-dialysis patients. In November 2020, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched. Studies regarding biomarkers associated with (pre-)frailty in (pre-)dialysis patients were included. This systematic review identified clinical and biochemical markers in pre-frail and frail patients under dialysis or pre-dialysis published in the literature. This study shows that more investigation is necessary to identify markers that can differentiate these processes to be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in routine care and management of geriatric needs. Interventions that can improve health outcomes in pre-frail and frail older adults under dialysis or pre-dialysis are essential to improve not only the individual's quality of life but also to reduce the burden to the health systems.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic-induced changes have threatened the psychological wellbeing of travelling. This review aims to appraise a range of perceived psychological variables used to realize how the pandemic has influenced tourist behavior.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify the mechanisms behind tourists' behavioral change during the pandemic. The papers were extracted from four databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and EMBASE, published since 2020 to 2021. The results are summarized narratively due to the heterogeneity of the studies.
   Results: A total of 369 citations were identified through an electronic search of databases, of which nine publications met the inclusion criteria. The extracted information determines the significant factors contributing to the psychological changes of travelling behavior during the pandemic.
   Conclusion: The tourists' perception of COVID-19 has influenced the intentions and motivation in the tourism sector and has changed travel behavior. The mental health outcome of travelling has been replaced by globally recognized fear and anxiety. Yet, there are several motivators to travel during the pandemic. At the same time, the socio-demographic characteristics contribute to all the identified changes.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature regarding adolescent suicide risk and explore the associations between treatment compliance (expressed as a concept including measured adherence to treatment and/or mental health service utilization) and risk and protective factors for suicidal behavior (SB), as well as the association between treatment compliance and reattempts.
   Methods: PubMed, LILACS, and Google Scholar were searched using the following terms: (adolescent*) AND (suicide*) AND (risk factor OR protective factors) AND (treatment compliance OR treatment attrition OR treatment adherence OR treatment drop out OR treatment retention OR mental health utilization). We retrieved studies that focused on the relation of treatment compliance to risk and protective factors for SB and that had only adolescent samples.
   Results: Of 4,841 articles, 30 original articles were selected for review. Most studies indicated high mental health service (MHS) utilization and poor treatment adherence by SB patients. Social minority status and conduct disorder were associated with less treatment adherence, while female sex, parental perceived need for treatment, and major depression were associated with greater treatment adherence. Inpatient and intensive emergency care after SA and family interventions improved MHS utilization and treatment compliance. However, we found no substantial protective effect of treatment compliance against reattempts.
   Conclusion: Effective treatment planning for compliance requires considering psychopathology, treatment planning, and social, familial, and individual factors.

AB  - We aimed to review occupational burnout predictors, considering their type, effect size and role (protective versus harmful), and the overall evidence of their importance. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched from January 1990 to August 2018 for longitudinal studies examining any predictor of occupational burnout among workers. We arranged predictors in four families and 13 subfamilies of homogenous constructs. The plots of z-scores per predictor type enabled graphical discrimination of the effects. The vote-counting and binomial test enabled discrimination of the effect direction. The size of the effect was estimated using Cohen's formula. The risk of bias and the overall evidence were assessed using the MEVORECH and GRADE methods, respectively. Eighty-five studies examining 261 predictors were included. We found a moderate quality of evidence for the harmful effects of the job demands subfamily (six predictors), and negative job attitudes, with effect sizes from small to medium. We also found a moderate quality of evidence for the protective effect of adaptive coping (small effect sizes) and leisure (small to medium effect sizes). Preventive interventions for occupational burnout might benefit from intervening on the established predictors regarding reducing job demands and negative job attitudes and promoting adaptive coping and leisure.

AB  - Background: Sleep occupies one-third of human life and is essential for health and for emotional, physical, and cognitive well-being. Poor or insufficient sleep is associated with a wide range of dysfunctions that involve different body systems, such as the endocrine, metabolic, and immune systems, thus compromising the higher cortical functions, cognitive performance, mood, and post-physical activity recovery. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the effectiveness of physical therapy exercises on sleep disorders in patients with neurological disorders. Our systematic review identified 10 articles that investigated the effects of physical therapy on sleep disorders in patients with neurological disorders, 6 of which were included in the meta-analysis. Results suggest that physical therapy exercises are a safe and useful strategy for managing sleep disorders in neurorehabilitation.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is a significant driver of change in marine ecosystems globally. To improve mechanistic understanding of the impact of climate-related stressors, experimental work on marine organisms has intensified in recent decades. A previous synthesis paper published nearly a decade ago established that Marine Climate Change Experiments (MCCEs) published from 2000-2009 were primarily laboratory-based and focused on single stressors and individual focal temperate species. Using consistent methodology, we compared the 2000-2009 analysis to experiments published in the following decade (i.e. 2010-2019) to assess recent trends in MCCEs and to determine to what extent knowledge gaps and research priorities have been addressed. The search returned 854 papers, vs. 110 from the 2000s, indicating considerable intensification of research effort and output. We found again that single species studies were most common, particularly with benthic invertebrates as model organisms, and that laboratory-based research comprised over 90% of all studies. However, multiple stressor experiments increased substantially, where tests for interaction effects between ocean acidification (i.e., increased pCO(2)) and warming were particularly common. Furthermore, a wider range of model species were studied and more community-level experiments were conducted in the 2010s compared with the 2000s. In addition, studies on behavioral responses, transgenerational effects, genetic adaptation and extreme climatic events increased markedly. These recent advances in MCCEs have undoubtedly improved understanding of how climate change will affect marine organisms and the communities and ecosystems they underpin. Going forward, biases in the type and distribution of model organisms should be addressed to enhance general understanding of responses to environmental change. Similarly, experiments should manipulate a greater number and range of climate and non-climate factors and increase the number of target organisms to increase realism. Finally, where possible, further research should be combined and contextualized with field-based experiments and observations to better reflect the complexity of marine ecosystems and yield more representative responses to ocean climate change.

AB  - Several studies have conceptualized neuropsychological dysfunction as part of the core pathology and defining behaviors seen in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa (AN). The aim of the current review was to synthesize the differences in neuropsychological test performance between individuals with AN and healthy controls, quantify and explain their heterogeneity. The search and screening procedures resulted in fifty studies that comprised 186 neuropsychological test results. Utilizing random-effects meta-analyses, the results revealed evidence for significant, moderate underperformance in people with AN in overall neuropsychological functioning ((g) over bar = -0.43, 95 % CI [-0.50, -0.36]). Weighted mean effect sizes ranged from (g) over bar = -0.53 for visuospatial abilities to (g) over bar = -0.10 for planning. Study and participant characteristics, including body mass index (BMI) and age, had significant moderator effects, especially on executive function, memory, and visuospatial abilities. The findings from the current study provide an extensive and comprehensive overview of the possible impairments in neuropsychological functioning in adult patients diagnosed with AN.

AB  - Background: Children, adolescents, and young adults with chronic conditions experience difficulties coping with disease-related stressors, comorbid mental health problems, and decreased quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global mental health crisis, and telemental health has necessarily displaced in-person care. However, it remains unknown whether such remote interventions are feasible or efficacious. We aimed to fill this research-practice gap.
   Objective: In this systematic review, we present a synthesis of studies examining the feasibility and efficacy of telemental health interventions for youth aged >= 25 years with chronic illnesses.
   Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from 2008 to 2020. We included experimental, quasiexperimental, and observational studies of telemental health interventions designed for children, adolescents, and young adults aged >= 25 years with chronic illnesses, in which feasibility or efficacy outcomes were measured. Only English-language publications in peer-reviewed journals were included. We excluded studies of interventions for caregivers or health care providers, mental health problems not in the context of a chronic illness, disease and medication management, and prevention programs for healthy individuals.
   Results: We screened 2154 unique study records and 109 relevant full-text articles. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, and they represented seven unique telemental health interventions. Five of the studies included feasibility outcomes and seven included efficacy outcomes. All but two studies were pilot studies with relatively small sample sizes. Most interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy. The subset of studies examining intervention feasibility concluded that telemental health interventions were appropriate, acceptable, and satisfactory to patients and their parents. Technology did not create barriers in access to care. For the subset of efficacy studies, evidence in support of the efficacy of telemental health was mixed. Significant heterogeneity in treatment type, medical diagnoses, and outcomes precluded a meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: The state of the science for telemental health interventions designed for youth with chronic illnesses is in a nascent stage. Early evidence supports the feasibility of telehealth-based delivery of traditional in-person interventions. Few studies have assessed efficacy, and current findings are mixed. Future research should continue to evaluate whether telemental health may serve as a sustainable alternative to in-person care after the COVID pandemic.

AB  - Background: Atypical parkinsonian syndromes are rare, fatal neurodegenerative diseases associated with abnormal protein accumulation in the brain. Examples of these syndromes include progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, and corticobasal degeneration. A common clinical feature in parkinsonism is a limited improvement with levodopa. So far, there are no disease-modifying treatments to address these conditions, and therapy is only limited to the alleviation of symptoms. Diagnosis is devastating for patients, as prognosis is extremely poor, and the disease tends to progress rapidly. Currently, potential causes and neuropathological mechanisms involved in these diseases are being widely investigated.
   Objectives: The goal of this review is to summarize recent advances and gather emerging disease-modifying therapies that could slow the progression of atypical parkinsonian syndromes.
   Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched regarding novel perspectives for atypical parkinsonism treatment. The following medical subject headings were used: "atypical parkinsonian syndromes-therapy, " "treatment of atypical parkinsonian syndromes, " "atypical parkinsonian syndromes-clinical trial, " "therapy of tauopathy, " "alpha-synucleinopathy treatment, " "PSP therapy/treatment, " "CBD therapy/treatment, " "MSA therapy/treatment, " and "atypical parkinsonian syndromes-disease modifying. " All search results were manually reviewed prior to inclusion in this review.
   Results: Neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, microglia activation, proteasomal impairment, and oxidative stress play a role in the neurodegenerative process. Ongoing studies and clinical trials target these components in order to suppress toxic protein accumulation. Various approaches such as stem cell therapy, anti-aggregation/anti-phosphorylation agent administration, or usage of active and passive immunization appear to have promising results.
   Conclusion: Presently, disease-modifying strategies for atypical parkinsonian syndromes are being actively explored, with encouraging preliminary results. This leads to an assumption that developing accurate, safe, and progression-halting treatment is not far off. Nevertheless, the further investigation remains necessary.

AB  - Introduction: Given associated risks, sexting among children and adolescents has yielded significant interest in recent years. Several previous reviews have examined data on the prevalence, determinants, and correlates of sexting behaviour, however, in an ever-changing digital media context, a comprehensive overview of findings regarding its outcomes is warranted. This novel review aimed to systematically identify and conduct a narrative synthesis of empirical evidence regarding the outcomes of sexting involvement for children and adolescents. Methods: Four databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature on sexting, and 54 articles were identified for inclusion in the review. The quality of included studies was appraised using Dixon-Woods et al. (2006) five question prompts. Results: Four 'outcomes' categories were derived, namely, psychological (victimisation; sexual abuse/victimisation; mental health and quality of life; and emotional outcomes), behavioural (sexual activity, risk behaviours, and perpetration of abuse and harassment), relational (personal connections with others & reputational outcomes), and systems-level (distribution/public exposure of sexting content). Conclusions: Findings indicate that the outcomes of sexting for children and adolescents (aged <= 19 years) are wide-ranging, some positive and desirable, others negative and unwanted. Furthermore, identified outcomes were located along a continuum spanning benefits for adolescents' well-being and relationships, stigma and associated difficulties, and serious harm or trauma. Limitations (e.g., methodological constraints of studies) and implications (e.g., informing harm prevention/intervention initiatives; further large-scale and replication studies) are discussed within.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of anxiety in general hospital inpatients by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of all relevant published studies. Method: We searched Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Ovid PsycINFO from inception to December 2020. We included studies of the prevalence of anxiety symptoms of clinically significant severity (using cut-off scores on rating scales) and of the prevalence of anxiety disorders (using diagnostic interviews) in general hospital inpatients. Two independent reviewers assessed articles and extracted data. The review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42020189722. Results: We included 32 studies. Pooled prevalence estimates in random-effects meta-analyses were: anxiety symptoms 28% (95% CI 19% to 38%, 95% prediction interval 5% to 72%), any anxiety disorder 8% (95% CI 5% to 12%, 95% prediction interval 2% to 33%), panic disorder 3% (95% CI 2% to 4%, 95% prediction interval 1% to 8%), generalized anxiety disorder 5% (95% CI 3% to 8%, 95% prediction interval 1% to 23%). There was high heterogeneity in prevalence, little of which was explained in exploratory analyses of a limited number of potential determinants. Conclusion: Anxiety symptoms of clinically significant severity affect more than one in four inpatients and anxiety disorders affect nearly one in ten.

Methods: Searches were carried out in the PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Cinahl, Google Scholar and Open Gray databases. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO under number CRD42020168231. Cross-sectional studies showing the prevalence of common mental disorders in women over 18 years were included. Studies with men, children and pregnant women of another age group and with other mental disorders and other types of studies were excluded. The Joanna Briggs Institute checklist was used to assess the risk of bias. Results: Nineteen studies were included in this review. The prevalence of CMD ranged from 9.6% to 69.3%. The main associated factors were unemployment, indebtedness, low income, being a housewife, smoking, low education, poor self-rated health, being single, divorced or widowed. The risk of bias in the studies was classified as low and moderate. Conclusion: This review revealed a variable prevalence rate of CMD in adult women. Public policies are needed to create strategies to prevent the mental illness of these women.

AB  - Background: Childhood trauma is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders, including obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD). However, our understanding of the different types of childhood trauma and its impact on the different types and severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) is still in its infancy. Aims: We conducted a systematic review to synthesise the current knowledge on the possible relationships between childhood trauma and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical populations. Methods: We systematically searched four electronic databases for studies reporting on childhood trauma and OCS severity. Subsequently, we qualitatively synthesised results of eligible studies and effect sizes were also calculated. Results: Twenty-four studies were included in this systematic review. Most studies used OCD samples (k = 16), with a few studies using a sample comprising of a range of psychiatric disorders (k = 6) and some studies using a general community sample (k = 2). Overall, there was support for a significant relationship between childhood trauma and OCS severity (8 out of 16 of the studies using OCD clinical samples, both studies using general population samples, and 5 out of 6 studies used mixed psychiatric samples). Conclusions: We found evidence of a significant relationship between exposure to childhood trauma and OCS severity across clinical and non-clinical populations. Our results also suggest that a range rather than a single type of childhood trauma was associated with OCD.

AB  - There is an increasing understanding that obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) occurs within an interpersonal context in which family members can become involved in assisting relatives with their OCD; a process known as family accommodation (FA). This review conducted a systematic evaluation of the literature investigating predictors of family accommodation of OCD in child and adult samples. A systematic literature search identified 14 relevant papers which were then assessed against a quality grid. Although these studies identified several predictors of family accommodation, with the exception of OCD symptom severity, it is difficult to draw any reliable conclusions regarding which variables are pertinent to predicting accommodation due to several methodological issues within the field at present. This review suggests the field currently suffers from a lack of clarity and consensus in defining and measuring FA; inadequate power and small samples sizes which accompany 'exploratory' research; and limited attempts to replicate, strengthen and extend previous findings. This, therefore, suggests that the evidence regarding reliable predictors of FA in OCD does not appear to be robust at present and should be viewed with some caution. It is recommended that future research should seek to develop a clear understanding of the processes involved in family accommodation of OCD by implementing robust research designs to confirm and extend the evidence available for the predictors already identified within the field.

AB  - Background Healthcare decision makers require accurate long-term economic models to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of new mental health interventions. Aims To assess the suitability of current patient-level economic models to estimate long-term economic outcomes in severe mental illness. Method We undertook pre-specified systematic searches in MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to identify reviews and stand-alone publications of economic models of interventions for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (PROSPERO: CRD42020158243). We screened paper titles and abstracts to identify unique patient-level economic models. We conducted a structured extraction of identified models, recording the presence of key predefined model features. Model quality and validation were appraised using the 2014 ISPOR and 2016 AdViSHE model checklists. Results We identified 15 unique patient-level models for psychosis and major depressive disorder from 1481 non-duplicate records. Models addressed schizophrenia (n = 6), bipolar disorder (n = 2) and major depressive disorder (n = 7). The predominant model type was discrete event simulation (n = 9). Model complexity and incorporation of patient heterogeneity varied considerably, and only five models extrapolated costs and outcomes over a lifetime horizon. Key model parameters were often based on low-quality evidence, and checklist quality assessment revealed weak model verification procedures. Conclusions Existing patient-level economic models of interventions for severe mental illness have considerable limitations. New modelling efforts must be supplemented by the generation of good-quality, contemporary evidence suitable for model building. Combined effort across the research community is required to build and validate economic extrapolation models suitable for accurately assessing the long-term value of new interventions from short-term clinical trial data.

AB  - Background: ESports has evolved into a hyper-competitive genre of video gaming. Emerging evidence has linked its intense engagement with mental health problems, with implications on youth development. We aim to summarise the impact of eSports and online video gaming on lifestyle outcomes. Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in journals published in the English language since 2011. We searched PubMed, Web of Science (WoS) and Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) using search strings related to eSports or video-gaming and lifestyle behaviours. Results: We identified 3694 studies, 36 of which met the inclusion criteria. The studies reported associations between online video gaming (including eSports participation and consumption) and poor lifestyle outcomes: physical activity-related (decreased levels of physical activity, increased body mass index (BMI) and sedentary behaviour)nutrition-related (poorer diet, sweetened beverage consumption) and sleep-related outcomes (decreased quality/duration, increased sleepiness/sleep deprivation). One study investigated physical lifestylerelated outcomes (eye strain, wrist pain, neck pain) Results indicate a widening breadth of research investigating associations between lifestyle outcomes and online video gaming. Conclusion: Lifestyle outcomes associated with engagement in eSports and video gaming are important to consider. This emphasizes the need for longitudinal studies which examine characteristics of gaming that may increase young people's risk of practicing unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. The accessibility of eSports to a wide digital audience highlights the need for this sector to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours among consumers and gamers.

AB  - With the rapid development of electronic information in the past 30 years, technical achievements based on electromagnetism have been widely used in various fields pertaining to human production and life. Consequently, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) has become a substantial new pollution source in modern civilization. The biological effects of EMR have attracted considerable attention worldwide. The possible interaction of EMR with human organs, especially the brain, is currently where the most attention is focused. Many studies have shown that the nervous system is an important target organ system sensitive to EMR. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on the neurobiological effects of EMR, including the metabolism and transport of neurotransmitters. As messengers of synaptic transmission, neurotransmitters play critical roles in cognitive and emotional behavior. Here, the effects of EMR on the metabolism and receptors of neurotransmitters in the brain are summarized.

AB  - In the past 20 years, a new concept has slowly emerged and expanded to various domains of marine biology research: the holobiont. A holobiont describes the consortium formed by a eukaryotic host and its associated microorganisms including bacteria, archaea, protists, microalgae, fungi, and viruses. From coral reefs to the deep-sea, symbiotic relationships and host-microbiome interactions are omnipresent and central to the health of marine ecosystems. Studying marine organisms under the light of the holobiont is a new paradigm that impacts many aspects of marine sciences. This approach is an innovative way of understanding the complex functioning of marine organisms, their evolution, their ecological roles within their ecosystems, and their adaptation to face environmental changes. This review offers a broad insight into key concepts of holobiont studies and into the current knowledge of marine model holobionts. Firstly, the history of the holobiont concept and the expansion of its use from evolutionary sciences to other fields of marine biology will be discussed. Then, the ecology and physiology of marine holobionts will be investigated through the examples of corals and sponges. We will discuss the impacts of environmental change on organisms at the holobiont level and how microbiomes contribute to the resilience and/or vulnerability of their host in the face of environmental stressors. Finally, we will conclude with the development of new technologies, holistic approaches, and future prospects for conservation biology surrounding marine holobionts.

AB  - Background: Many diverse inflammatory pathophysiologic mechanisms have been linked to mental disorders, and through the past decade an increasing interest in the gut microbiota and its relation to mental health has been arising. We aimed to systematically review studies of alterations in gut microbiota of patients suffering from psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or depression compared to healthy controls. Methods: We systematically searched the databases CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and LILACS. Primary outcome was to compare the gut microbiota of patients suffering from psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or depression with healthy controls. Results: We identified 17 studies, covering 744 patients and 620 healthy controls. The most consistent microbiota changes were a tendency towards higher abundance of Actinobacteria and lower abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level, lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae at family level and lower abundance of Faecalibacterium at genus level for the mental disorders overall. However, we found that all studies had risk of bias and that the in-cluded studies displayed great variability in methods of storage, analysis of the fecal samples, reporting of results and statistics used. Conclusion: Due to the many limitations of the included studies the findings should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies (especially of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder) are needed, but it is also of great im-portance to gather information of and control for factors that influence the result of a microbiota analysis includ-ing body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, diet habits, antibiotics, sample handling, wet laboratory methods and statistics.

AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are being increasingly used as interventions for eating disorders including binge eating. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess two decades of research on the efficacy of MBIs in reducing binge eating severity. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library for trials assessing the use of MBIs to treat binge eating severity in both clinical and non-clinical samples. The systematic review and meta-analysis was preregistered at PROSPERO (CRD42020182395). Results: Twenty studies involving 21 samples (11 RCT and 10 uncontrolled samples) met inclusion criteria. Random effects meta-analyses on the 11 RCT samples (n = 618: MBIs n = 335, controls n = 283) showed that MBIs significantly reduced binge eating severity (g = -0.39, 95% CI -0.68, -0.11) at end of trial, but was not maintained at follow-up (g = -0.06, 95% CI, -0.31, 0.20, k = 5). No evidence of publication bias was detected. On the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2, trials were rarely rated at high risk of bias and drop-out rates did not differ between MBIs and control groups. MBIs also significantly reduced depression, and improved both emotion regulation and mindfulness ability. Conclusion: MBIs reduce binge eating severity at the end of trials. Benefits were not maintained at follow-up; however, only five studies were assessed. Future well-powered trials should focus on assessing diversity better, including more men and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.

AB  - Purpose A systematic review was undertaken to determine whether research supports: (i) an association between income inequality and adult mental health when measured at the subnational level, and if so, (ii) in a way that supports the Income Inequality Hypothesis (i.e. between higher inequality and poorer mental health) or the Mixed Neighbourhood Hypothesis (higher inequality and better mental health). Methods Systematic searches of PsycINFO, Medline and Web of Science databases were undertaken from database inception to September 2020. Included studies appeared in English-language, peer-reviewed journals and incorporated measure/s of objective income inequality and adult mental illness. Papers were excluded if they focused on highly specialised population samples. Study quality was assessed using a custom-developed tool and data synthesised using the vote-count method. Results Forty-two studies met criteria for inclusion representing nearly eight million participants and more than 110,000 geographical units. Of these, 54.76% supported the Income Inequality Hypothesis and 11.9% supported the Mixed Neighbourhood Hypothesis. This held for highest quality studies and after controlling for absolute deprivation. The results were consistent across mental health conditions, size of geographical units, and held for low/middle and high income countries. Conclusions A number of limitations in the literature were identified, including a lack of appropriate (multi-level) analyses and modelling of relevant confounders (deprivation) in many studies. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that area-level income inequality is associated with poorer mental health, and provides support for the introduction of social, economic and public health policies that ameliorate the deleterious effects of income inequality.

AB  - Objectives Serum or plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) are widely used clinical markers of inflammation in other branches of medicine, whereas its clinical use in psychiatry has been limited to research studies. We aimed to assess the possibility of using CRP/hsCRP in psychiatric practice. This is a review and evaluation of various lines of evidence supporting the concept of CRP as a biomarker for psychiatric disorders in certain conditions. Methods We searched the literature for studies which assessed CRP/hsCRP levels in various psychiatric disorders. Results The accumulating evidence from large studies and meta-analyses allows us to understand the role of CRP in major psychiatric disorders and increase our understanding of specific symptoms and subtypes of disorders. CRP may be considered a 'psychiatric biomarker' which can alert clinicians about neuroinflammation, adverse effects of medications, cardiometabolic status, co-morbidities, and may also predict clinical outcomes and guide optimal treatment.selection. Conclusion Although the underlying pathophysiological role of CRP and hsCRP is still elusive and the association between CRP and psychiatric disorders is inconsistent, CRP holds promise to become a psychiatric biomarker.

AB  - Hallucinogen-persisting perception disorder (HPPD) features as a diagnostic category in the DSM-5, ICD-11, and other major classifications, but our knowledge of the phenomenology of the perceptual symptoms involved and the changes in consciousness during the characteristic "flashbacks" is limited. We systematically evaluated original case reports and case series on HPPD to define its phenomenology, associated (psycho)pathology, and course. Our search of PubMed and Embase yielded 66 relevant publications that described 97 people who, together, experienced 64 unique symptoms of HPPD. Of these, 76% concerned symptoms characteristic of Alice in Wonderland syndrome, over 50% non-visual symptoms, and 38% perceptual symptoms not clearly linked to prior intoxication states. This is in contrast with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for HPPD. Even though less than half of the patients showed a protracted disease course of over a year, a third achieved remission. However, in patients with co-occurring depression (with or without anxiety) HPPD symptoms persisted longer and treatment outcomes were more often negative. Thus, unlike the acute stages of psychedelic drug intoxication, which may be accompanied by altered states of consciousness, HPPD is rather characterized by changes in the content of consciousness and an attentional shift from exogenous to endogenous phenomena. Since HPPD is a more encompassing nosological entity than suggested in the DSM-5, we recommend expanding its diagnostic criteria. In addition, we make recommendations for clinical practice and future research.

AB  - Aim: Robust evidence suggests that depression, and risk for depression, are associated with the generation of stressful life events. This tendency to generate stress may be genetically determined. This systematic review aimed to identify specific molecular genetic markers associated with the generation of interpersonal stressful life events, at least in part dependent on individuals' behavior. Method: We followed the PRISMA guidelines in searching six electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Psy-cINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, and EMBASE) from inception to January 2021, and we reviewed the reference lists of eligible articles for additional records. We restricted eligibility to empirical studies involving at least one genetic marker and including proximal life events. We evaluated the risk of bias using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for observational studies. The outcome permitted a distinction between life events dependent on the individual's agency versus independent events. Results: Seven studies, including 3585 participants, met eligibility criteria. Three were longitudinal, and four were cross-sectional; six included adolescents and young adults, and one focused on middle adulthood. Four examined the serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR), two examined the rs53576 single nucleotide polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), and one examined a multilocus genetic profile score including four hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis genes. There were no significant direct corre-lations between genotype and life events in any study. Instead, their relation was significantly moderated by symptoms, exposure to early adversity, or attachment. Consistent with the stress generation hypothesis, this moderation relation was significant in predicting exposure to dependent life events but was not significant in predicting independent life event exposure. Conclusions: There is evidence that genetic variation in the serotonin, HPA axis, and oxytocin systems moderates the effects of psychosocial vulnerability markers on the generation of proximal, dependent life events. Future research should examine additional genetic markers in systems known to confer risk for stress generation. PROSPERO: CRD42019136886.

AB  - The practice-based evidence suggests that it is possible to use eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), but its specific efficacy is unknown. A systematic search was carried out for randomized controlled trials comparing EMDR with a control condition group in MDD patients. Two meta-analyses were conducted, with symptom reduction as primary outcome and remission as exploratory outcome. Eight studies with 320 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The first meta-analysis showed that EMDR outperformed "No Intervention" in decreasing depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.81, 95% CI = -1.22 to -0.39, p < 0.001, low certainty), but statistically significant differences were not observed in improving remission (risk ratio = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.87-1.66, p = 0.25, very low certainty). The second showed the superiority of EMDR over CBT in reducing depressive symptoms (mean difference [MD] = -7.33, 95% CI = -8.26 to -6.39, p < 0.001, low certainty), and improving remission (risk ratio = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.24-3.06, p = 0.004, very low certainty). Besides, anxiety symptoms and level of functioning could not be included as secondary outcome due to the lack of data. The present meta-analysis suggests that EMDR is more effective in treating MDD than "No Intervention" and CBT, particularly in individuals who have traumatic experience. However, this result should be considered with caution due to small sample size and low quality of trails.

AB  - Background: As one of the most widely researched consequence of traumatic events, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among people exposed to the trauma resulting from infectious disease outbreak varies greatly across studies. This review aimed at examining the pooled prevalence of PTSS among people exposed to the trauma resulting from infectious disease outbreak, summarizing the possible causes of the inconsistencies in the current estimates.
   Methods: Systematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, PsycArticles, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) until 14 October 2020. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (registration number: CRD42020182366).
   Results: About 106 studies were included. The results showed that the pooled prevalence of PTSS among the general population exposed to the trauma resulting from infectious disease outbreak was 24.20% (95% CI: 18.54-30.53%), the pooled prevalence of PTSS among healthcare workers was 24.35% (95% CI: 18.38-1.51%), the pooled prevalence of PTSS among patients with infectious disease was 28.83% (95% CI: 18.53-44.86%), and the pooled prevalence of PTSS among suspected cases of infectious disease was 25.04% (95% CI: 18.05-34.73%). Mortality rate was a significant contributor to heterogeneity.
   Conclusions: Evidence suggests that PTSS were very common among people exposed to the trauma resulting from infectious disease outbreak. Health policymakers should consider both short-term and long-term preventive strategy of PTSS.

AB  - Forensic psychiatrists are often sought by the court of law to provide professional opinion on specific legal matters that have a major impact on the evaluee and possibly society at large. The quality of that opinion and recommendations rely on the quality of the analysis from the assessment results conducted by the psychiatrist. However, the definition and scope of a forensic psychiatric analysis is not clear. While existing literature on forensic psychiatric analysis generally includes organizing information, identifying relevant details, and formulating a set of forensic psychiatric opinions as components, there is no explicit and unified definition of these terms and process. This lack of clarity and guidelines may hinder forensic psychiatry from achieving its goal of providing objective information to the court or other relevant parties. Forensic psychiatric analysis exhibits numerous parallels to clinical reasoning in other fields of medicine. Therefore, this review aims to elaborate forensic psychiatric analysis through the lens of clinical reasoning, which has been developed by incorporating advances in cognitive sciences. We describe forensic psychiatric analysis through three prominent clinical reasoning theories: hypothetico-deductive model, illness script theory, and dual process theory. We expand those theories to elucidate how forensic psychiatrists use clinical reasoning not only to diagnose mental disorders, but also to determine mental capacities as requested by law. Cognitive biases are also described as potential threat to the accuracy of the assessment and analysis. Additionally, situated cognition theory helps elucidate how contextual factors influence risk of errors. Understanding the processes involved in forensic psychiatric analysis and their pitfalls can assist forensic psychiatrists to be aware of and try to mitigate their bias. Debiasing strategies that have been implemented in other fields of medicine to mitigate errors in clinical reasoning can be adapted for forensic psychiatry. This may also shape the training program of general psychiatrists and forensic psychiatrists alike.

AB  - Women with primary dysmenorrhea are vulnerable to develop a depressive disorder, which is a common form of psycho-disturbance. However, clinical findings are inconsistent across studies, and the evidence has not been previously synthesized. This study aims to investigate whether primary dysmenorrhea is associated with a higher risk of depression via a cumulative analysis. Four electronic databases were systematically searched for the eligible studies. The combined effect was assessed by analyzing the relative risk (RR) and standard mean differences (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). This cumulative analysis was registered on the PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020169601). Of 972 publications, a total of 10 studies involving 4,691 participants were included. Pooled results from six included studies showed that primary dysmenorrhea was associated with a significant depressive disorder (RR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.44 to 2.0, P < 0.001; heterogeneity: I-2 = 0%, P = 0.544). In addition, synthesis results from two studies provided the BDI scores suggested that dysmenorrhea had significantly higher scores when compared to non-dysmenorrhea (SMD = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.31-0.62, P < 0.001; heterogeneity: I-2 = 0%, P = 0.518). However, in the two studies providing the PROMIS T-Score, the pooled result showed that there was no significant difference between women with dysmenorrhea and those without dysmenorrhea (P = 0.466). The overall quality of the evidence in our study was judged to MODERATE. The present study has confirmed the positive relationship between primary dysmenorrhea and depression. Social supports and medical help from pain management physicians or psychologists are important interventions for women with dysmenorrhea-suffering depressive disorder.

AB  - Background: Insight into illness is often used in clinical and legal contexts, for example, as evidence of decision-making capacity. However, it is unclear whether this disadvantages certain groups protected under equality legislation. To our knowledge, this question has yet to be addressed systematically. Therefore, the present study reviews empirical studies that look at the relationship between insight and sociodemographic variables. Methods: A systematic search of six bibliographic databases (CENTRAL, CINAHL, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) was conducted, which yielded 6,192 results. Study characteristics and outcomes (associations between insight and socio-demographic variables) were then extracted from 207 eligible studies. This included protected characteristics under the Equality Act (2010): age, sex, ethnicity, marital status and religion. Weighted confidence estimates were calculated and relevant moderators included in a random effects meta-analysis. A study protocol was registered prospectively on PROSPERO, ID: CRD42019120117. Results: Insight was not strongly associated with any sociodemographic variable. Better insight was weakly but significantly associated with white ethnicity, being employed, younger age and more years of education. The age associations were mostly explained by relevant moderating variables. For people with schizophrenia, the associations between sociodemographic variables and insight were comparable to associations with decision making capacity. Conclusions: Our results suggest that insight is not strongly associated with any sociodemographic variables. Further research is needed to clarify potential associations, particularly with non-white ethnicity and proxies for social support.

AB  - Background Low medication adherence is a significant challenge in all medical fields and particularly in mental health treatment, where a lack of insight into one's own disease can repress the ability to adhere. In recent years, the increase in migration combined with a high prevalence of mental illnesses among migrants and the possible consequences of nonadherence, point towards the need for a focus on adherence with psychotropic drugs among migrants. Aim To review current literature, exploring the potential impact of being a migrant from a non-Western country living in a Western country on the level of adherence to psychotropic medication and subsequently to discuss these findings. Methods A systematic review of studies investigating adherence among non-western migrants was conducted. The literature search was conducted using PubMed and Embase databases in October 2020. Results Seven observational studies were included, all ranging from moderate to high-quality. Six out of seven studies found an association between being a non-Western migrant in a Western country and low adherence to psychotropic drugs. Conclusion Studies indicate an association between being a non-Western migrant in a Western country and low adherence to psychotropic drugs. None of the included studies investigated possible causes of the low adherence in migrants. Communication difficulties are, however, considered possible barriers to healthcare access and a contributing factor to nonadherence. There is a need for studies assessing the possible impact of interventions aiming at increasing adherence such as intercultural mediators and training of healthcare providers in cultural competencies.

AB  - Indigenous people, particularly minorities in Southeast Asia (SEA), often face hardships due to colonization, displacement, and deforestation. However, studies on their subjective suffering experiences are sparse. Therefore, the present study aimed to conduct a systemic review of literature concerning SEA indigenous people's cognition and emotion in suffering events. A rigorous literature search following PRISMA guidelines was conducted on the following databases-Scopus, EbscoHost, Ovid (PsychArticles and PsycInfo), Proquest. Embase, Ovid Medline, and Google Scholar using keyword categories for "SEA," "cognition" or "emotion," and "suffering events." The initial search resulted in 6,383 articles, but only 11 empirical studies (containing qualitative or quantitative original data) were included after careful screening. Next, a thematic synthesis method was used to summarize the findings. Two themes of causal attribution of suffering were identified-supernatural reasons and negative impact of interactions with outsiders. Four themes of emotional expression of suffering were identified-physical actions and gestures, communal practices, somatic symptoms, and behavior adaptations. Our findings correspond with the ecological rationality theory, where indigenous people still function as strong-ties societies that capitalize on external-oriented mental strategies and cognitive styles. The identification of unique forms of cognition and modes of emotional expression holds implications toward building an equitable humanistic psychology.

AB  - This scoping review systematically mapped evidence of the mediating and moderating effects of family characteristics on health inequalities in school-aged children and adolescents (6-18 years) in countries with developed economies in Europe and North America. We conducted a systematic scoping review following the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews recommendations. We searched the PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus databases. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. Evidence was synthesized narratively. Of the 12,403 records initially identified, 50 articles were included in the synthesis. The included studies were conducted in the United States (n = 27), Europe (n = 18), Canada (n = 3), or in multiple countries combined (n = 2). We found that mental health was the most frequently assessed health outcome. The included studies reported that different family characteristics mediated or moderated health inequalities. Parental mental health, parenting practices, and parent-child-relationships were most frequently examined, and were found to be important mediating or moderating factors. In addition, family conflict and distress were relevant family characteristics. Future research should integrate additional health outcomes besides mental health, and attempt to integrate the complexity of families. The family characteristics identified in this review represent potential starting points for reducing health inequalities in childhood and adolescence.

AB  - The technostress model has introduced different factors to consider when assessing how information and communication technologies impact individuals in different work settings. This systematic review gathers evidence regarding associations between occupational exposure to technostress and health or work outcomes. In addition, we highlight typical methodological constraints of the technostress model. We conducted electronic literature searches in June 2020 (PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, PsycArticles) and independently screened 321 articles. We report on 21 articles meeting eligibility criteria (working population, technostress exposure, health or work outcome, quantitative design). The most frequently examined techno-stressors, i.e., factors of technostress, were techno-overload and techno-invasion. Techno-stressors were consistently associated with adverse health and work outcomes, apart from a positive impact on work engagement. However, studies may be subject to considerable conceptual overlap between exposure and outcome measures. Future technostress research would benefit from reducing heterogeneity in technostress measures, assessing their external validity and focussing on specific techno-stressors.

AB  - During operational activities, military personnel face extremely demanding circumstances, which when combined lead to severe fatigue, influencing both their well-being and performance. Physical exertion is the main condition leading to fatigue, and its continuous tracking would help prevent its effects. This review aimed to investigate the up-to-date progress on non-invasive physiological monitoring to evaluate situations of physical exertion as a pre-condition to fatigue in military populations, and determine the potential associations between physiological responses and fatigue, which can later result in decision-making indicators to prevent health-related consequences. Adhering to the PRISMA Statement, four databases (Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science and PubMed) were used for a literature search based on combinations of keywords. The eligibility criteria focused on studies monitoring physiological variables through non-invasive objective measurements, with these measurements being developed in military field, combat, or training conditions. The review process led to the inclusion of 20 studies. The findings established the importance of multivariable assessments in a real-life context to accurately characterise the effects of military practices. A tendency for examining heart rate variables, thermal responses, and actigraphy measurements was also identified. The objectives and experimental protocols were diverse, but the effectiveness of non-invasive measurements in identifying the most fatigue-inducing periods was demonstrated. Nevertheless, no assessment system for standardised application was presented. Future work may include the development of assessment methods to translate physiological recordings into actionable information in real-time and mitigate the effects of fatigue on soldiers' performance accurately.

AB  - Internalized stigma (IS), in addition to the illness itself, is one of the major challenges that people with mental health problems have to face. The aim of this scoping review and meta-analysis is to update knowledge about this issue and to investigate the influence of different sociodemographic, psychosocial, and clinical variables on IS. English and Spanish articles were searched between 2010 and 2019, in different databases, with no restriction on culture or geographical area. Only studies that used the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI) as a measure of IS were included. A total of 61 studies remained for the review and 52 for the meta-analysis (N = 11,072). Self-esteem, quality of life, hopeful feelings and stigmatizing experiences, as well as clinical variables (depressive symptoms and subjective recovery), were strongly associated with IS. The association of insight with IS was not confirmed. Empowerment showed a weaker relationship than in a previous meta-analysis. Gender and age, education, occupational situation, and marital status were weakly associated with IS, and sometimes inconsistently. Subjective recovery, depressive symptomatology, or experienced and perceived social stigma have begun to be studied in recent years. The update on the subject reveals the impact of clinical and psychosocial variables, also underlining the relevance of recently incorporated variables such as depressive symptomatology, subjective recovery, and perceived discrimination. The results highlight the need to carry out longitudinal studies with more representative samples and in new geographical areas with variables rarely or not yet studied in relation to IS.

AB  - Affective prosody, or the changes in rate, rhythm, pitch, and loudness that convey emotion, has long been implicated as a function of the right hemisphere (RH), yet there is a dearth of literature identifying the specific neural regions associated with its processing. The current systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence on affective prosody localization in the RH. One hundred and ninety articles from 1970 to February 2020 investigating affective prosody comprehension and production in patients with focal brain damage were identified via database searches. Eleven articles met inclusion criteria, passed quality reviews, and were analyzed for affective prosody localization. Acute, subacute, and chronic lesions demonstrated similar profile characteristics. Localized right antero-superior (i.e., dorsal stream) regions contributed to affective prosody production impairments, whereas damage to more postero-lateral (i.e., ventral stream) regions resulted in affective prosody comprehension deficits. This review provides support that distinct RH regions are vital for affective prosody comprehension and production, aligning with literature reporting RH activation for affective prosody processing in healthy adults as well. The impact of study design on resulting interpretations is discussed.

AB  - This paper aimed to characterize actions directed to children's mental health (CMH) in Primary Health Care (PHC), based on an integrative review of Brazilian literature (2006-2017). The searches were carried out from LILACS, SciELO and VHL Network databases. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 articles were identified for analysis, which were presented in three thematic axes: 1) Characterization of the demands on CMH for PHC; 2) Actions and interventions on CMH carried out in PHC; and 3) Difficulties and propositions for the implementation of actions on CMH in PHC. The literature points, as the main actions, the identification of CMH problems and their referral to care by specialties. Some studies described specific actions of professionals such as physicians, pediatricians, and psychologists. Interventions of a local character or in partnerships with universities were also identified. The analysis of this material indicated that PHC has been considered as an important field of action in CMH, but that nevertheless requires greater investments, especially in professional training and work organization.

AB  - The primary aim was to evaluate the burnout prevalence among healthcare workers (HCWs) in intensive care units (ICUs) and emergency departments (EDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim was to identify factors associated with burnout in this population. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines by searching PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, and Scopus from 1 January to 24 November 2020. Studies with information about burnout prevalence/level during the pandemic regarding ICU/ED HCWs were eligible. A total of 927 records were identified. The selection resulted in 11 studies. Most studies were conducted in April/May 2020. Samples ranged from 15 to 12,596 participants. The prevalence of overall burnout ranged from 49.3% to 58%. Nurses seemed to be at higher risk. Both socio-demographic and work-related features were associated with burnout. Many pandemic-related variables were associated with burnout, e.g., shortage in resources, worry regarding COVID-19, and stigma. This review highlighted a substantial burnout prevalence among ICU/ED HCWs. However, this population has presented a high burnout prevalence for a long time, and there is not sufficient evidence to understand if such prevalence is currently increased. It also outlined modifiable factors and the need to improve emergency preparedness both from an individual and structural level.

AB  - Background. Interpersonal distance (IPD) plays a critical role in a human being's social life, especially during interpersonal interaction, and IPD is non-verbal social information and not only provides silent cues but also provides a secure space for personal relationships. IPD has been a research field of neural studies from the recent decade, researches had provided behavior and neural correlates of IPD. Objectives. This review aims to summarize the experimental paradigms of IPD-neural research, to reveal the neural activity processes associated with it, and to explore the correlation between IPD-neural activity and IPD-behavior. Methods. We conducted a standardized systematic review procedure, including the formal search method be adopted to seek out any type of studies related to IPD and brain, then devised them into categories to make a systematic review. Results. 17 articles met the inclusion criteria of the review, 5 event-related potential (ERP) studies measured the amplitude and latencies of ERPs, and 12 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies provided the neural activation during IPD tasks. In addition, the passive IPD experimental paradigm is the main experimental paradigm for exploring neural activity in IPD cognition, with the parietal lobe, motor areas, prefrontal lobe, and amygdala being the main brain areas involved. Functional connections between the identified brain regions were found and have a moderate correlation with IPD behavior. Conclusions. This review provides the neural activity of the IPD interaction process. However, the insufficient ecological validity of IPD tasks and ignore the initiative of people in IPD interaction. Therefore, there is a large research space on this topic. The work of the current systematic review contributed to linking the external performance and inner neural activities of IPD.

AB  - Obesity is a risk factor that exponentially increases morbidity and mortality in the world. Today, new health strategies are being implemented based on the use of social media but the use and effectiveness for these interventions needs to be assessed. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the impact of social-media-delivered weight loss interventions among teenagers and young adults. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and OVID to identify articles that focused on this topic. Fourteen studies were included in the final review. The commitment of the participants was found to be fundamental factor when assessing the impact of social-media-delivered weight loss interventions, but also the social context in which the interventions were carried out. Our study highlights the potential of social media platforms to address weight loss interventions among younger groups. The works evaluated showed the usefulness of social media for the adequate monitoring and control in these groups. Finally, the current variety of study designs in this field highlights the need for greater homogeneity in their methodology and applications, which is a fundamental step before these tools could be considered a suitable tool for overweight management in clinical practice.

AB  - The high global prevalence of depression, together with the recent acceleration of remote care owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, has prompted increased interest in the efficacy of digital interventions for the treatment of depression. We provide a summary of the latest evidence base for digital interventions in the treatment of depression based on the largest study sample to date. A systematic literature search identified 83 studies (N = 15,530) that randomly allocated participants to a digital intervention for depression versus an active or inactive control condition. Overall heterogeneity was very high (I-2 = 84%). Using a random-effects multilevel metaregression model, we found a significant medium overall effect size of digital interventions compared with all control conditions (g = .52). Subgroup analyses revealed significant differences between interventions and different control conditions (WLC: g = .70; attention: g = .36; TAU: g = .31), significantly higher effect sizes in interventions that involved human therapeutic guidance (g = .63) compared with self-help interventions (g = .34), and significantly lower effect sizes for effectiveness trials (g = .30) compared with efficacy trials (g = .59). We found no significant difference in outcomes between smartphone-based apps and computer- and Internet-based interventions and no significant difference between human-guided digital interventions and face-to-face psychotherapy for depression, although the number of studies in both comparisons was low. Findings from the current meta-analysis provide evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of digital interventions for the treatment of depression for a variety of populations. However, reported effect sizes may be exaggerated because of publication bias, and compliance with digital interventions outside of highly controlled settings remains a significant challenge.
   Public Significance Statement This meta-analysis demonstrates the efficacy of digital interventions in the treatment of depression for a variety of populations. Additionally, it highlights that digital interventions may have a valuable role to play in routine care, most notably when accompanied by human guidance. However, compliance with digital interventions remains a major challenge, with little more than 50% of participants completing the full intervention on average.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) treatment is associated with many physical and psychological symptoms. Psychological distress or physical dysfunction are one of the most common side effects of oncological treatment. Functional dysfunction and pain-related evasion of movement may increase disability in BC. Virtual reality (VR) can offer BC women a safe environment within which to carry out various rehabilitation interventions to patient support during medical procedures. The aim of this systematic review was to conduct an overview of the clinical studies that used VR therapy in BC. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines method: the initial search identified a total of 144 records, and 11 articles met the review criteria and were selected for the analysis. The results showed that VR seems to be a promising tool supporting oncological treatment in BC patients. VR can have a positive effect on mental and physical functions, such as relieving anxiety during oncotherapy, diminution pain syndrome, and increasing the range of motion and performance in daily activities.

Methods We searched in MEDLINE (via Ovid) for placebo-controlled clinical trials published in the last 20 years that assessed drug repurposing approaches for the treatment of DM or mood disorders. Results We found seven studies that aimed to verify the effects of antidepressants in patients diagnosed with DM, and eight studies that tested the effect of antidiabetic drugs in patients diagnosed with MDD or BD. Most studies published in the last two decades did not report a positive effect of antidepressants on glycemic control in patients with DM. On the other hand, antidiabetic drugs seem to have a positive effect on the treatment of MDD and BD. Conclusions While effect of antidepressants on glycemic control in patients with DM is still controversial, the use of antidiabetic drugs may be a promising strategy for patients with MDD or BD. Prospective studies are still needed.

AB  - Purpose Public mental health training can effectively support well-being at a population level. The application of this type of training is increasingly prevalent, however, training evaluation is currently limited and inconsistent. This paper aims to summarise the characteristics of public mental health training available in England, presents key quality criteria for this training and identifies gaps in training provision. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a pragmatic mixed-methods approach including database and Google Searches, focus groups and survey methods. The data analysis included a structured data extraction template for the training availability scoping and thematic analysis of the survey and focus groups. Findings This paper identifies a total of 74 training courses targeting workplace employees, young people and the general population. Most courses were delivered face-to-face (54), followed by e-learning (16) and blended modalities (4). This paper derives four core quality principles, focussing on the training approach, key features of training, trainer attributes and evaluation. There were no significant gaps in training provision, although areas for future development included consistency in public mental health terminology, systems and populations requiring additional training and the logistics of training delivery, etc. Originality/value The results contribute to the evidence base of interventions that are currently available, supporting the efforts to evaluate the impact of training provision in this area. This paper provides a novel approach to assessing training quality and discuss areas for development and innovation in this field.

AB  - Embodiment research is at a turning point. There is an increasing amount of data and studies investigating embodiment phenomena and their role in mental processing and functions from across a wide range of disciplines and theoretical schools within the life sciences. However, the integration of behavioral data with data from different biological levels is challenging for the involved research fields such as movement psychology, social and developmental neuroscience, computational psychosomatics, social and behavioral epigenetics, human-centered robotics, and many more. This highlights the need for an interdisciplinary framework of embodiment research. In addition, there is a growing need for a cross-disciplinary consensus on level-specific criteria of embodiment. We propose that a developmental perspective on embodiment is able to provide a framework for overcoming such pressing issues, providing analytical tools to link timescales and levels of embodiment specific to the function under study, uncovering the underlying developmental processes, clarifying level-specific embodiment criteria, and providing a matrix and platform to bridge disciplinary boundaries among the involved research fields.

AB  - Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a safe, effective, and appealing treatment for Parkinson's Disease (PD), particularly for improving motor symptoms (e. g., tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity). However, concerns have been raised about whether DBS causes psychological changes, including changes to personality: characteristic and relatively stable patterns of affect, behavior, cognition, and desire. In this article, after first presenting some background information about PD and DBS, we examined evidence obtained from various empirical research methods (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods for evaluating patient valued characteristics) pertaining to whether DBS causes personality change. General limitations across research methods include a lack of randomized clinical trials and small sample sizes. We organized our review of findings according to different layers of personality variables: dispositional traits (including personality pathology), characteristic adaptations, and narrative identity. Though most work has been done on dispositional traits, there is not much evidence that dispositional traits change following DBS. Little work has been done on characteristic adaptations, but there is somewhat consistent evidence for positive perceived progress toward goals across a number of domains: routine activities, work, social/relational, and leisure. Nascent work on narrative identity holds promise for revealing issues around self-image that may be common following DBS. We listed a number of strategies for advancing research, highlighting opportunities related to personality conceptualization, personality assessment, and interdisciplinary scholarship. Finally, we offer practical applications of our findings for the informed consent process and for ongoing treatment.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Preexisting noncommunicable diseases (eg, diabetes) increase the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death. Mood disorders are associated with impaired immune function and social determinants that increase the risk of COVID-19. Determining whether preexisting mood disorders represent a risk of COVID-19 would inform public health priorities.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether preexisting mood disorders are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, severe complications, and death.
   DATA SOURCES Systematic searches were conducted for studies reporting data on COVID-19 outcomes in populations with and without mood disorders on PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Embase, Web of Science, Google/Google Scholar, LitCovid, and select reference lists. The search timeline was from database inception to February 1, 2021.
   STUDY SELECTION Primary research articles that reported quantitative COVID-19 outcome data in persons with mood disorders vs persons without mood disorders of any age, sex, and nationality were selected. Of 1950 articles identified through this search strategy, 21 studies were included in the analysis.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess methodological quality and risk of bias of component studies. Reported adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were pooled with unadjusted ORs calculated from summary data to generate 4 random-effects summary ORs, each corresponding to a primary outcome.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The 4 a priori primary outcomes were COVID-19 susceptibility, COVID-19 hospitalization, COVID-19 severe events, and COVID-19 death. The hypothesis was formulated before study search. Outcome measures between individuals with and without mood disorders were compared.
   RESULTS This review included 21 studies that involved more than 91 million individuals. Significantly higher odds of COVID-19 hospitalization (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53; P =.001; n = 26 554 397) and death (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.34-1.69; P <.001; n = 25 808 660) were found in persons with preexisting mood disorders compared with those without mood disorders. There was no association between mood disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.73-2.19; n = 65 514 469) or severe events (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-1.03; n = 83 240). Visual inspection of the composite funnel plot for asymmetry indicated the presence of publication bias; however, the Egger regression intercept test result was not statistically significant.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association between preexisting mood disorders and COVID-19 outcomes suggest that individuals with preexisting mood disorders are at higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death and should be categorized as an at-risk group on the basis of a preexisting condition.

AB  - Requests for pathological demand avoidance diagnoses have increased over recent years but pathological demand avoidance remains a controversial issue. We undertook a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies of pathological demand avoidance, using standardised appraisal and synthesis methods, to assess how pathological demand avoidance is identified and to explore the relationships between pathological demand avoidance, autism and other developmental/psychiatric disorders. A search of PsycINFO/PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase identified 13 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Narrative synthesis was chosen due to methodological heterogeneity of the identified studies. Autistic children/adolescents constituted the majority of participants in most studies. Most studies provided clearly defined inclusion criteria together with adequate descriptions of participants and study settings. Almost all studies relied on the parental report of pathological demand avoidance symptoms/diagnosis. Identification of pathological demand avoidance in all studies seemed to be, directly or indirectly, based on the criteria developed by Newson et al. While eight studies used objective criteria for the identification of pathological demand avoidance, the measures used have methodological limitations. Though associations with anxiety have been reported, few studies took account of possible relationships between pathological demand avoidance and other conditions, such as anxiety. Methodological limitations restrict current conclusions regarding the uniformity or stability of the constellation of behaviours associated with pathological demand avoidance or the characteristics of individuals displaying them. Clinical implications of current research are discussed. Lay Abstract Requests for diagnoses of pathological demand avoidance have increased over recent years, but pathological demand avoidance remains a controversial issue. The concept of pathological demand avoidance has been criticised for undermining the self-advocacy of autistic people and neglecting the potential role of anxiety as a possible underlying or contributing cause. The current study was undertaken to summarise and review the methodological quality and findings from current research into pathological demand avoidance in children and adolescents. Further aims were to describe how pathological demand avoidance has been identified and to explore the relationships with autism and other developmental and psychiatric disorders. After a comprehensive search, 13 relevant studies using a wide range of methods were identified and systematic quality assessments were undertaken. All the studies had based the identification of pathological demand avoidance, directly or indirectly, on descriptions from the original study by Newson and colleagues. However, the methods used to develop these criteria were not clearly described. Most studies relied exclusively on parental report for data, and there was a general failure to take account of alternative explanations for the behaviours under study. No studies explored the views of individuals with pathological demand avoidance themselves. Problems concerning definition and measurement in the reviewed studies currently limit any conclusions regarding the uniformity or stability of the behaviours described, or the characteristics of individuals displaying them.
   Relationships between pathological demand avoidance and other emotional and behavioural difficulties should be explored in future research, as should the perspectives of individuals with pathological demand avoidance themselves.

AB  - Background: Obstetric fistula (OF) is a birth complication that largely affects women in developing countries. These women suffer constant incontinence, shame, social segregation, and health problems. Reconstructive surgery can usually repair OF, enabling the women to reintegrate back into their communities. However, pro repair does not necessarily equate with emotional recovery. Our objective was to explore women's experiences of social support after first time OF repair. Methods: An evidence synthesis was performed based on a systematic search of literature done between January and March 2020 in PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest, and EMBASE databases using keywords including "obstetric fistula", "vesicovaginal fistula", "vesicovaginal", "fistula", and "social support". Inclusion criteria were primary peer reviewed articles addressing one or more study objectives, in English, on OF support, regardless of location. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility of the studies and extracted the data. Disagreement between the reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer. The scoping review was based on a framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (2015). Results: The search resulted in 246 articles, of which 14 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. The synthesis of the studies was theoretically guided by Berkman's Model which emphasizes a link between social resources, social support, and disease. We found that support was either internal or external. Internal support constituted self efficacy resulting in strengthened internal locus of control. Externally, women were supported by friends and family with material and financial resources. In some cases, the women were supported with educational opportunities and/or business start-up capital. Our review identified the need to support women with information about OF. Most post-OF repair women who were successfully re-integrated into their communities choose to support other women suffering from OF. Conclusions: Social networks make a significant contribution to emotional and psychological recovery of women after a successful OF surgical repair. Lack of social networks were also found to be detrimental to emotional and psychological recovery of women. Most women were abandoned and not supported by their husbands. Restorative surgery is not sufficient making supportive and well organised social networks an integral component of full recovery post-OF repair.

AB  - Introduction Identifying the predictors of parenting stress in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder is crucial to provide the best health-care services. Main text The scoping review was conducted. Search engines (EBSCO, Springer, PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar, and Science Direct) were used to collate published studies between the years 2009 and 2020. Keywords used were parenting stress, parental stress, predictors of parenting stress, Autism disorder, Autism, and scoping review. Primary screening of the titles and abstracts of 1039 articles was conducted. The secondary screening of 348 articles resulted in 27 articles included in this review. The reviewed articles revealed core symptoms of the disorder, namely, behavior problems, and socio-communication impairments strongly linked with the high level of parenting stress. Conclusion This scoping review is the initial step toward encouraging future efforts to provide supportive interventions for parents of children with autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - Objective To investigate the relationships between diabetes-specific family conflict and health outcomes of young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA statement (registration number: CRD42020164988). PubMed, Embase, PsycNET, reference lists of included studies, and other relevant reviews were searched (1990-2020). Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-texts. Studies were included if they sampled young people with T1D (mean age between 14 and 25years) and examined the relationship between diabetes-specific family conflict and the following outcomes: glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), treatment adherence, blood glucose monitoring, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and/or well-being. Results A total of 20 studies met the predetermined inclusion criteria. Greater diabetes-specific family conflict was significantly related to higher HbA1c values in 17 studies. Seven studies reported a significant association between greater diabetes family conflict and suboptimal treatment adherence and/or less frequent blood glucose monitoring. However, significant relationships between conflict and HbA1c and/or treatment adherence were not found in four studies. Seven studies in total reported that greater diabetes family conflict was significantly related to poorer quality of life or well-being and greater depressive and/or anxiety symptoms in young people. Conclusions Diabetes-specific family conflict is associated with some adverse health outcomes for young people with T1D. However, more longitudinal studies of young people aged older than 16years are needed. Screening for and addressing diabetes-specific family conflict is recommended, given the growing number of studies linking family conflict to various adverse health outcomes in young people with T1D.

AB  - The eyewitness and fundamental memory research fields have investigated the effects of acute stress at encoding on memory performance for decades yet results often demonstrate contrasting conclusions. In this review, we first summarise findings on the effects of acute encoding stress on memory performance and discuss how these research fields often come to these diverging findings regarding the effects of encoding stress on memory performance. Next, we critically evaluate methodological choices that underpin these discrepancies, emphasising the strengths and limitations of different stress-memory experiments. Specifically, we elaborate on choice of stressors and stimuli, stress manipulation checks, stressor timing, and the interval between encoding and retrieval and discuss how methodological shortcomings in both the eyewitness and fundamental memory fields have limited our understanding of how encoding stress may affect eyewitness memory performance. Finally, we propose several recommendations for researchers interested in this topic, such as confirming stress inductions with physiological measures, implementing sufficient retrieval intervals to isolate the memory phase of interest and using ecologically valid memory paradigms. We conclude that the best progress can be made if researchers are responsive to the methodologies and findings reported in other research fields and encourage collaborations between the different disciplines.

AB  - Historically, many investigations into neurodegenerative diseases have focused on alterations in specific neuronal populations such as, for example, the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) and loss of cholinergic transmission in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it has become increasingly clear that mammalian brain activities, from executive and motor functioning to memory and emotional responses, are strictly regulated by the integrity of multiple interdependent neuronal circuits. Among subcortical structures, the dopaminergic nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways as well as cholinergic innervation from basal forebrain and brainstem, play pivotal roles in orchestrating cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms in PD and AD. Understanding the functional interactions of these circuits and the consequent neurological changes that occur during degeneration provides new opportunities to understand the fundamental inter-workings of the human brain as well as develop new potential treatments for patients with dysfunctional neuronal circuits. Here, excerpted from a session of the European Behavioral Pharmacology Society meeting (Braga, Portugal, August 2019), we provide an update on our recent work in behavioral and cellular neuroscience that primarily focuses on interactions between cholinergic and dopaminergic systems in PD models, as well as stress in AD. These brief discussions include descriptions of (1) striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) and PD, (2) dopaminergic and cholinergic modulation of impulse control, and (3) the use of an implantable cell-based system for drug delivery directly the into brain and (4) the mechanisms through which day life stress, a risk factor for AD, damage protein and RNA homeostasis leading to AD neuronal malfunction.

AB  - Depression is one of the common mental illnesses. Because it is an important complication of diabetes, its association with changes in insulin levels and insulin resistance, the causative factors of diabetes, has attracted widespread attention. However, the association between insulin and depression has not been systematically studied through bibliometric and visual analysis. This study is based on 3131 publications of Web of Science to identify the current research status and research trends in this field. The results show that since 2010, the number of publications has been growing rapidly. Cooperative network analysis shows that the United States, the University of Toronto and Roger S Mcintyre are the most influential countries, research institutes and scholars, respectively. Insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome are hot topics in this field. Analysis of keywords and references reveals that "sex hormones, " is new research area that constantly emerging. As far as we know, this study is the first one to visualize the association between depression and insulin and predict potential future research trends through bibliometric and visual analysis.

AB  - Objective: The term disaster resilience has not been well defined. The purpose of this article is to scrutinize the concept of disaster resilience in rescue workers. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of the PsychInfo, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus databases using the key terms. The framework from Walker and Avant was used to analyze the concept of disaster resilience. Results: A total of 26 papers was included in this analysis. The attributes of disaster resilience have been identified from the literature as including personality, perceived control, self-efficacy, coping strategies, and social support. The antecedents of disaster resilience are disastrous events and preparedness for disaster. The consequences of disaster resilience are psychological well-being, posttraumatic growth, and enhanced work engagement. Conclusion: This concept analysis presents a definition of the concept of disaster resilience that could contribute to the development of a standardized screening or assessment tool and tailored training programs to strengthen disaster resilience among those who are willing to be deployed to engage in disaster rescue work and those who have been involved in such work.

AB  - Introduction: Appraisal of prodromal symptoms of unipolar depression may complement the traditional cross-sectional approach and provide a longitudinal perspective, according to a staging model of the illness. Objective: To provide an updated systematic review of clinical studies concerned with prodromal symptoms of unipolar depression, according to PRISMA guidelines. Methods: Keyword searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Longitudinal studies on prodromal symptoms and signs in adult patients primarily diagnosed with unipolar depression were selected. Findings were examined separately according to study design (i.e., retrospective or prospective). Results: Twenty-five studies met the criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. Findings indicate that a distinct prodromal symptomatology - commonly characterized by anxiety, tension, irritability, and somatic complaints - exists before the onset of unipolar depression. The duration of the prodromal phase was highly variable across studies, ranging from less than a month to several years. Prodromal symptoms profile and duration were consistent within individuals across depressive episodes. There was a close relationship between prodromal and residual symptoms of the same depressive episode. Conclusions: The present systematic review addresses an important, and yet relatively neglected, clinical issue that deserves further investigation and may be of immediate practical value. The findings provide challenging insights into the pathogenesis and course of unipolar depression, which may result in more timely and effective treatment of recurrences. The definition of a prodromal phase in depression would benefit from the joint use of symptom identification, biomarkers, and neuroimaging.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by emotional, behavioral and cognitive disturbances, and the treatment of schizophrenia is often complicated by noncompliance and pharmacoresistance. The search for the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia has resulted in the proposal of several hypotheses to explain the impacts of environmental, genetic, neurodevelopmental, immune and inflammatory factors on disease onset and progression. This review discusses the newest insights into the pathophysiology of and risk factors for schizophrenia and notes novel approaches in antipsychotic treatment and potential diagnostic and theranostic biomarkers. The current hypotheses focusing on neuromediators (dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin), neuroinflammation, the cannabinoid hypothesis, the gut-brain axis model, and oxidative stress are summarized. Key genetic features, including small nucleotide polymorphisms, copy number variations, microdeletions, mutations and epigenetic changes, are highlighted. Current pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia relies mostly on dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonists/partial agonists, but new findings in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia have allowed the expansion of novel approaches in pharmacotherapy and the establishment of more reliable biomarkers. Substances with promising results in preclinical and clinical studies include lumateperone, pimavanserin, xanomeline, roluperidone, agonists of trace amine-associated receptor 1, inhibitors of glycine transporters, AMPA allosteric modulators, mGLUR(2-3) agonists, D-amino acid oxidase inhibitors and cannabidiol. The use of anti-inflammatory agents as an add-on therapy is mentioned.

AB  - Objective: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a significant concern for family caregivers of cancer survivors and is associated with many adverse outcomes, including increased emotional distress and poorer quality of life. Although several theoretical models have been proposed to account for FCR in cancer survivors, their applicability to caregivers is unknown. The aim of this review was to identify clinical, demographic and psychological factors that are associated with, and predict, FCR in caregivers of cancer survivors.
   Method: AMED, CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus were systematically searched for relevant studies reporting quantitative data on factors associated with FCR or similar constructs (e.g., worry or anxiety about cancer recurrence) in family caregivers of adult cancer survivors. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality using a standardized checklist adapted from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
   Results: Sixteen studies, half of which were cross-sectional, were included and summarized narratively. Non-modifiable factors, including age (n = 6) and treatment modality (n = 4), were found to be associated with increased FCR. Significant positive associations were also reported between illness perceptions and FCR (n = 3). However, there was heterogeneity across included studies with regards to factors examined and most were conducted in the USA. There were also several methodological limitations to the included studies.
   Conclusions: Research examining FCR in caregivers of cancer survivors has predominantly focused on demographic and clinical factors. Given the paucity of research exploring the psychological mechanisms underpinning FCR, future research should investigate theoretical underpinnings of FCR in caregivers of cancer survivors to support the development of psychological interventions for this population.

AB  - Student mental health is of growing concern for the university education sector. Supporting opportunities to increase mental health literacy of students is one strategy in which universities and colleges are actively investing to support students build their capacity to be well. This study is a systematic review of mental health literacy training (MHLT) programs, other than Mental Health First Aid training, to examine their impact on the mental health literacy of university students. The review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) (Online Resource 1) and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR2) guidelines. Search terms related to mental health literacy concepts, mental health literacy training and university students were used in four major databases (i.e. EBSCOhost, Ovid, ProQuest and Web of Science), retrieving a total of 1219 articles, with 44 studies selected for full-text review, and a final number of 24 studies included for review based on pre-determined eligibility criteria. Results were reported against three main themes: types of MHLT offered; common practices, processes and implementation elements; and effectiveness of intervention. Results indicate a high level of variability in approaches to mental health literacy interventions and measures of assessment and reporting. Additionally, reported benefits to mental health literacy failed to report on comparable units of improvement or the sustainability of benefits. Although it is in the best interest of universities to prioritise early intervention programs to address mental health and improve wellbeing, more robust data is required to establish the effectiveness of MHLT programs in achieving this aim.

AB  - Objective: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects a growing number of young people. While factors associated with poor disease experience in pediatric IBD have garnered much attention in the literature, less attention has focused on the factors associated with the resilient outcomes seen in the majority of young people with IBD. This review seeks to contribute to the literature by synthesizing research on the psychosocial factors that promote resilience in pediatric IBD and by offering future directions for the field. Methods: Systematic searches of the MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo, and CINAHL databases were performed for quantitative English-language studies with keywords for IBD, resilience or factors of resilience, and pediatric populations, with no date restrictions. Reference lists of all included articles were searched. Quality assessments were performed using an NIH tool. Results: Of 3315 articles identified, 17 were included. Studies were heterogeneous, with 19 psychosocial factors identified and analyzed for associations with over two dozen indicators of resilience. A narrative synthesis of included studies was performed. Study details were organized into three domains-individual, social, and family. Preliminary data indicate that resilience in pediatric IBD may be associated with positive body image, increased mindfulness, and improved social functioning, among other potential factors. Conclusions: Resilience in pediatric IBD is largely unstudied. Only one study pursued an understanding of resilience as an aim, and no studies incorporated validated measures of resilience. Future prospective, theorydriven research is needed to elucidate the network of factors and mechanisms that can foster resilience in children and adolescents with IBD.

AB  - Exposure to trauma at a younger age has been associated with an increased likelihood of developing PTSD. School-based interventions have been utilized to address traumatic stress and PTSD symptoms in children. However, to date, no meta-analyses have been performed to evaluate the strength of intervention impacts on PTS symptoms in school-aged children, ages 5-11. Thus, the current review sought to address these gaps. Nine international databases were searched during the study's timeframe. Inclusion criteria were: (1) randomized controlled trials of an intervention or prevention program, (2) implementation in a school-based setting, (3) children aged 5-11, and (4) an outcome variable for PTS or PTSD. Although 26 studies met the above criteria, 21 studies met all inclusion criteria, including the data necessary to run the analysis, and were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. Random effects models were used; the standard mean difference was reported at -.30, which was determined as statistically significant (t = - 2.70, p = .01; 95% CI: [- 0.52, -0.07]). The results indicate that school-based interventions can effectively reduce posttraumatic stress in young children. These results indicate that school-based programs to address trauma in children may be an effective strategy to reduce PTS-related symptoms. Some limitations include a small number of studies included in the meta-analysis. Additionally, few studies reported enough detail to determine racial and ethnic demographic and specific age outcomes. As a result, it was not possible to isolate the specific effects on the intended age group and conduct moderator effects for racial and ethnic demographic data.

AB  - BackgroundResponses from the H1N1 swine flu pandemic and the recent COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic provide an opportunity for insight into the role of health authorities' ways of communicating health risk information to the public. We aimed to synthesise the existing evidence regarding different modes of communication used by health authorities in health risk communication with the public during a pandemic.MethodsWe conducted a rapid scoping review. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for publications in English from January 2009 through October 2020, covering both the full H1N1 pandemic and the response phase during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search resulted in 1440 records, of which 48 studies met our eligibility criteria.ResultsThe present review identified studies across a broad interdisciplinary field of health risk communication. The majority focused on the H1N1 pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. A content analysis of the studies identified three categories for modes of communication: i) communication channels, ii) source credibility and iii) how the message is communicated. The identified studies on social media focused mainly on content and engagement, while studies on the effect of the use of social media and self-protective behaviour were lacking. Studies on the modes of communication that take the diversity of receivers in the field into account are lacking. A limited number of studies of health authorities' use of graphic and audio-visual means were identified, yet these did not consider/evaluate creative communication choices.ConclusionExperimental studies that investigate the effect of health authorities' videos and messages on social media platforms and self-protective behaviour are needed. More studies are needed across the fields of health risk communication and media studies, including visual communication, web design, video and digital marketing, at a time when online digital communication is central to reaching the public.

AB  - Background Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a significant problem in clinical practice and reason for the lack of functional recovery among depressed patients. Sleep disturbances and poor alertness are common residual symptoms. Main body of the abstract Many patients with refractory depression experience residual symptoms, such as insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and poor alertness. This is a literature review and we searched the electronic databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane database, Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar of all studies published between 2000 and 2020. The literature on the relationship between sleep quality and alertness in a patient with depression is very sparse. One possible reason could be the difficulty in defining alertness as a mental function. Alertness itself has been described as a state of responsivity to both interoceptive and external stimuli. Subjective and objective measures of alertness, daytime somnolence, and quality of sleep are presented. Adjunctive treatment with stimulant medications (methylphenidate, amphetamine, modafinil) to the standard antidepressant medications might be warranted in patients in patients with daytime sleepiness, decreased alertness, fatigue, and poor work performance. Short conclusion Patients with treatment-resistant depression usually suffer from poor quality of sleep and decreased alertness. Stimulant medications may help with alertness, daily functioning, and work performance.

AB  - Background: Loneliness is known to be associated with both poorer physical and mental health, being associated with increased mortality. Responses throughout the world to the current COVID-19 pandemic all incorporate varying degrees of social distancing and isolation. There is an imperative to provide a timely review and synthesis of the impact of COVID-19 on loneliness in the general population. Methods: PubMed was searched using the key terms 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'SARS-COV2' and 'loneliness'. Fifty-four articles were identified and screened against the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria stipulated that the study needed to incorporate a measure of loneliness with participants being drawn from the general adult population. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Results: The key data extracted from the 24 reviewed studies are presented and summarised with a focus on key demographics of participants, the research designs utilised, the measures of loneliness employed and the other variables assessed in the studies. Overall, the findings indicate that loneliness has been a significant issue during the current COVID-19 pandemic and loneliness is positively associated with mental health symptoms. However, there were inconsistencies in the results evident across studies. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of research investigating loneliness during the current COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population. Despite the inconsistencies evident in some of the results across the studies, it is clearly apparent that loneliness is having an impact on the mental health and wellbeing of the general adult population. Furthermore, it is apparent that the current COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on loneliness in the general adult population and that loneliness is significantly positively associated with mental illness symptomatology. Thus, there is an imperative to address loneliness through public policy and interventions. The limitations of this review are noted and directions given for future research.

Main Outcome Measures Main outcomes were body weight shame, and compassion. Secondary outcomes assessed were mental health, eating attitudes and behaviours, physical exercise and Body Mass Index and weight. Results 25 studies (23 papers) met inclusion criteria and results indicated promise for compassion-based interventions for body weight shame, compassion, and health related behaviour. Mixed results were found for BMI and weight. The studies varied considerably in terms of populations targeted, the duration of interventions, and intervention delivery.Conclusion: Overall, compassion-based interventions were found to reduce body weight shame and improve levels of compassion. However, the impact of compassion-based interventions on BMI and weight is less promising. Recommendations for future research are provided.

AB  - Aim Children living in families impacted by parental mental illness are at increased risk of adverse mental and physical health outcomes compared with children living in families unaffected by mental illness. Considered to be a hard-to reach group, it is likely that there are unique barriers for these young people in seeking help for their difficulties. This systematized review synthesizes what is currently known about help-seeking barriers, facilitators and interventions for young people affected by parental mental illness. Methods Three databases were searched, yielding 2556 results and three studies were identified through other sources. Studies were screened on title and abstract review and were excluded if they were published before 2005 or if they did not include the perspectives of young people. At a second stage, full-text articles were screened based on the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies were included for data extraction and quality appraisal. Results Qualitative and quantitative data synthesis revealed three significant barriers (i) stigma, (ii) family communication and (iii) lack of belonging and shared experience, three key facilitators (i) individual characteristics, (ii) group identification and (iii) anonymity and three primary components of therapeutic interventions (i) psychoeducation, (ii) connection with peers and (iii) accessibility. Conclusions It was found that stigma towards mental illness is highly salient amongst young people impacted by parental mental illness and has unique effects on their patterns of help-seeking. Help-seeking research amongst this group is still emerging, with a need for greater clarity in operationalisation of help-seeking constructs and more robust methodological designs.

AB  - Objectives: Effective prevention and intervention of Internet gaming disorder require the identification of risk and protective factors. This study aims to exhaustively review the risk and protective factors of Internet gaming disorder among Chinese people. Method: We searched for articles published from database inception to February 2020 in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science and two Chinese databases, CNKI and Wanfang Data. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they addressed Internet gaming disorder, sampled people in China, presented correlational factors of Internet gaming disorder and reported the effect sizes for correlations. Reviewers independently selected the studies, assessed their validity and extracted the data. Pooled Pearson's correlations were calculated using the random effects model. Result: In the meta-analysis, 153 studies covering 115,975 subjects were included. We identified 56 risk factors and 28 protective factors. Most risk factors strongly correlated with Internet gaming disorder fell into the category of maladaptive cognitions and motivations. Other factors that showed high effect sizes fell into various categories, including psychopathological characteristics, personality traits, cognition emotion regulation style and gaming-related factors. The only protective factor strongly correlated with Internet gaming disorder was self-control. We found that the factors related to the 'environments' show modest effect sizes compared to those related to the individual. The pooled effect sizes for most factors were not influenced by outliers and publication bias. Conclusion: Factors strongly correlated with Internet gaming disorder, especially maladaptive cognitions and motivations, are more likely to be proximal correlates of Internet gaming disorder and may be considered the focus of interventions. We encourage further empirical and experimental studies to examine the causal pathway and the treatment efficacy.

AB  - Objectives Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) are detectable fragments of mtDNA released from the cell as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction or apoptosis. The brain is one of the most energy demanding organs in the human body, and many neuropsychiatric and non-psychiatric neurological diseases have mitochondrial dysfunction associated with disease pathophysiology. Thus, we aimed to assess ccf-mtDNA as a potential biomarker for brain diseases. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of studies that examined peripheral and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ccf-mtDNA relevant to neuropsychiatric conditions, which we define as disorders of affect, behaviour and mood, and non-psychiatric neurological diseases, which consist of neurological diseases not related to psychiatry including neurodegenerative diseases. Results The results of the sensitivity analysis investigating the levels of peripheral ccf-mtDNA in neuropsychiatric studies showed no significant difference between cases and controls (Z = 1.57; p = 0.12), whereas the results of the sensitivity analysis investigating the levels of CSF ccf-mtDNA in non-psychiatric neurological diseases showed a decreasing trend in cases compared with controls (Z = 2.32; p = 0.02). Interestingly, the results indicate an overall mitochondrial stress associated mainly with non-psychiatric neurological diseases. Conclusions Our study supports the involvement of mitochondrial stress, here defined as ccf-mtDNA, in brain diseases and encourage further investigation of ccf-mtDNA among patients with brain diseases.

This association, if consistently present, may be a promising biological marker that could assist clinicians in decision making regarding risk and treatment. We conducted a systematic review to assess whether there is a reliable association between lipid profile (total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) and aggression, self-harm or suicide in people with schizophrenia, and whether effects are similar in males and females. Method: Relevant databases were searched to identify primary research studies (up to November 2020) that (1) involved adults (some samples also included 16- to 18-year olds) with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychosis; and (2) included a standardised assessment of verbal aggression, physical aggression against objects, physical aggression against self (including suicide) or others. The search yielded 23 studies eligible for inclusion following a quality appraisal. Results: Suicidality was the most commonly assessed subtype of aggression (20 studies). For suicidality, about half the studies, including the study with the largest sample size, found a link with total cholesterol. An association between low total cholesterol and violence towards others was found in six of nine studies that investigated this. The evidence for a link with violence was the strongest for total cholesterol, followed by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the weakest for triglycerides. Only a few studies investigated sex differences and yielded mixed evidence. Studies focussed on self-harm as well as involving females in forensic settings were lacking. Conclusion: There is encouraging evidence of an association between low total cholesterol and aggression towards others as well as suicidality in schizophrenia. Future studies should systematically explore this association in people with schizophrenia who have a significant history of violence, suicidality and self-harm, both inpatients and community, and also investigate underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and perfectionism mean a huge concern related to mental health and psychopathology. Recently, there has been a growing interest in research on the exploration of the association of perfectionism and NSSI, but till today there is no systematic review has been prepared in this topic. Aims: Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review of published studies that investigated the association between NSSI and perfectionism. Methods: The systematic search was made on PubMed, OVID Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search terms were ("nonsuicidal self-injury" OR "nonsuicidal self-injury" OR NSSI OR "self-injury" OR "self-injurious behavior" OR SIB OR "self-harm" OR "deliberate self-harm" OR DSH) AND (perfectionism). The inclusion criteria were as follows: written in English; reported empirical data; used validated self-report measures; investigated the association of nonsuicidal self-injury and perfectionism. There were no restrictions on participants regarding age, gender, race or ethnicity. Exclusion criteria: not written in English; was a review/meta-analysis; measured suicide behavior; measured self-injury irrespective of motivation or suicidal intent; was not about the association between nonsuicidal self-injury and perfectionism. Results: After the screening process, 15 studies were included in our systematic review. The majority of studies (12) were published in the last 10 years. Nine (60%) recruited participants from community samples, four (26.7%) from clinical populations, and two (13.3%) both from community and clinical participants. Fourteen (93.3%) of the studies were cross-sectional studies, and one study contained a longitudinal investigation. The majority of studies included only or mainly female participants (62.3-87.2%) and two studies contained a balanced male-female ratio population. Fourteen (93.3%) studies from the 15 studies found a significant positive association between NSSI and perfectionism. Limitations: The heterogeneity of used instruments makes it difficult to compare the results of involved studies. Only two studies investigated populations with balanced gender ratios. Only two studies examined both clinical and community populations. Clinical investigations enrolled mainly eating-disordered (ED) patients. Conclusions: The results of the current systematic review highlight the role of perfectionism in NSSI engagement. This systematic review may help the development of effective prevention initiatives and treatment strategies.

AB  - Objective: This meta-analysis and systematic review examined the effects of exercise interventions on alcohol consumption and binge drinking in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD).
   Data sources: PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SPORTDiscus, and ERIC databases.
   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials published in English between 1970 and 2021. All studies compared exercise (Ex) and treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU in adults with an alcohol-related diagnosis. All forms of exercise interventions were included (e.g., aerobic exercise, yoga, resistance exercise, etc.).
   Data Extraction: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols standard and the Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies guidelines were followed. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool as described by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and Interventions.
   Results: The literature searches retrieved a combined 2527 studies, with 1,034 studies screened after removal of duplicates and 973 (94%) rejected after reviewing titles and abstracts. Full-text review was performed on 61 studies, with seven studies meeting inclusion criteria for qualitative and meta-analysis. Across seven studies (n = 492 participants), a significant effect (Z-value = -3.37; g = -0.30; 95% CI [-0.50--0.09]; p = 0.001) was found for Ex+TAU on drinking volume. There was no effect of Ex+TAU on binge drinking. The effect of Ex+TAU on physical fitness (VO(2)max, ml.kg(-1).min(-1)) was significant (Z-score = 3.70; g = 0.64; 95% CI [0.19-1.08]; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Exercise interventions may decrease alcohol consumption and improve fitness and can be an effective adjunctive treatment for individuals with alcohol-related diagnoses including AUD.

AB  - Background: Overlap in symptom domains particularly in the field of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) have stimulated further research activities since our last review from 2014.
   Main body: Disentangling features of impulsivity in ADHD and BPD revealed that impulsivity is a feature of both disorders with patients suffering from both ADHD and BPD having highest impulsivity ratings. BPD individuals have more problems using context cues for inhibiting responses and their impulsivity is stress-dependent, whereas ADHD patients have more motor impulsivity and therefore difficulties interrupting ongoing responses. For emotion regulation difficulties the ranking order ranges from ADHD to BPD to the comorbid condition, again with the patients suffering from both, ADHD and BPD, having the most pronounced emotion regulation problems. Environmental influences namely adverse childhood events were shown to be linked to both ADHD and BPD. Traumatic experiences seem independently linked to impulsivity features. Thus, some authors point to the risk of misdiagnosis during childhood and the necessity to screen for traumatic experiences in both patient groups. Genetic research confirmed genetic overlap of BPD with bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenic disorders, as well as genetic overlap of BD and ADHD. A population-based study confirmed the high co-occurrence and familial co-aggregation of ADHD and BPD. Interesting questions in the field of gene-environment-interactions are currently dealt with by genetic and epigenetic research.
   Few studies have investigated treatment strategies for the comorbid condition, though the issue is highly important for the management of patients suffering from both disorders and presenting with the highest symptom scores.
   Conclusion: Research on the different impulsivity features might point to a necessity of disorder-specific treatment strategies in the field of impulse control. Future research is needed to base treatment decisions for the comorbid condition on an evidence basis.

AB  - Background: Psychosocial stress is a significant public health problem inducing consequences for quality of life. Results about the use of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as a biomarker of acute stress are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to demonstrate that DHEA levels could be a biomarker of stress. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect databases were searched on March 19, 2021 using the keywords "acute stress" AND "DHEA" OR "Dehydroepiandrosterone." Articles needed to describe our primary outcome, i.e., induction of acute stress and at least two measures of DHEA. Results: We included 14 studies, with a total of 631 participants, in our meta-analysis. The DHEA levels increased overtime after acute stress [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.56, 95%CI = 1.13-1.99]. Stratification by time showed a main peak at the end of stress (SMD = 2.43, 95%CI = 1.59-3.27), followed by a progressive decrease (coefficient = -0.11, 95%CI = -0.19 to -0.17, p = 0.020). There was no significant change 1 h after the end of acute stress. Metaregressions showed an impact of mental stress (SMD = 2.04, 95%CI = 1.43-2.65), sex (SMD = 0.02, 95%CI = 0.00-0.04), age (SMD = -0.12, 95%CI = -0.2 to -0.05), and obesity (SMD = 0.31, 95%CI = -0.00 to 0.63). There was no difference whatever the type of fluid (blood or saliva) and the measurement technique used. Conclusions: DHEA is a biomarker of acute stress, with a short-term increase (1 h). DHEA increases following acute mental stress, whatever the type and duration of mental stress. Women, young people, and obese individuals had a higher response. Blood and saliva measures were comparable.

AB  - Introduction: Neuroprogression has been proposed as the pathological rewiring of the brain that takes place in parallel with clinical and neurocognitive deterioration in the course of psychiatric disorders. This study aims to review the biological underpinnings and clinical outcomes related to neuroprogression in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Methods: We performed a systematic review by searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1960, and January 6, 2020. Inclusion criteria were met when articles assessed brain changes, neurocognition, functioning, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotrophins in patients with PTSD. Narrative review articles, case reports, and preclinical studies were excluded.
   Results: A total of 965 abstracts were identified and 15 articles were included in our systematic review. It seems that for a subset of patients whose symptoms worsen or are maintained at a high intensity there is a progressive change in the frontal lobe, especially the prefrontal cortex, and worsening of both neurocognition (verbal memory and facial recognition) and functioning (physical, psychological, social and environmental).
   Conclusion: Although current findings associate progressive reduction in frontal lobe size with neurocognitive impairment, further research is needed to characterize PTSD as a neuroprogressive disorder.

AB  - Background: Substance use disorders (SUDs) contribute significantly to global rates of morbidity and mortality. Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) have been suggested as an adjunct to face-to-face health services. However, the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of IMIs for SUDs is scant. Methods: A comprehensive literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Economic Evaluations Database, NHS Health Technology Assessment Database, Office of Health Economics Evaluations Database and EconLit was conducted. We included economic evaluations alongside randomized controlled trials of IMIs for SUDs compared with a control group. Results: Of 1687 abstracts identified, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Targeted conditions were alcohol use disorder (four studies) and tobacco smoking (five studies) whereas two studies included any SUD. Cost-effectiveness results demonstrated that IMIs had a firm probability of being more cost-effective than TAU (e.g. less costs per additional abstinent person). Compared with (online) psychoeducation, evidence towards an additional benefit of IMIs was less clear. Regarding cost-utility (e.g. costs per quality-adjusted life year gained), except for one study, results suggested that TAU and online psycho-education would probably be more preferable than IMIs. Quality of study reporting was at least adequate. Conclusions: The likelihood of IMIs being more cost-effective than TAU looks promising but more economic evaluations are needed in order to determine the economic merit of IMIs. With an increasing pressure on health care budgets, strategies to disseminate effective interventions at affordable costs are required. This review suggests that IMIs might carry that promise and have potential as a cost-effective strategy to scale-up existing evidence-based treatments for SUDs.

AB  - Background: There is a growing interest in the promotion of mental health, and concepts as resilience are re-emerging and taking relevance. In addition, Information and Communication Technologies can provide potential benefits in the field of mental health, and the treatment of mental disorders in particular. This study aims to synthesize the evidence of internet-based resilience interventions, analyzing the theoretical adequacy, methodological quality and efficacy. Methods: A systematic search was performed. The eligibility criteria stated for this article were: randomized controlled trials targeted at adults or adolescents and including any psychological intervention focussing on resilience in its rationale or design. Studies with direct (e.g. resilience scales) and proximal resilience measures (e.g. scales on well-being) were included. Risk of bias was assessed for each trial using Cochrane's Collaboration Tool. Two reviewers worked independently in order to identify potential articles. A total of 11 articles were selected. A random-effects pooling model using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method based on direct and proximal resilience measures at post-test was used. Results: The overall effects of online resilience training compared to control groups at post-test were not significant; the effect size concerning the improvement of resilience was g=0.12 (95% CI: -0.14 to 0.38). In addition, a potential association between the type of outcome and the effect size could be revealed. Conclusions: The results of the present meta-analysis showed that the overall effect of online resilience trainings was not significant. Nonetheless, a tendency for a higher benefit for resilience was found in the studies with a clear assessment theory, indicating some promising effects.

AB  - Athletic identity (AI), the degree of personal connection to sport, is well-described in adult research; however, this social trait has been less studied in younger age groups. This systematic review describes epidemiological characteristics of AI in youth athletes. PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo were searched to identify AI studies involving quantitative athlete identity outcomes and cohorts 22 years and younger. The search strategy was developed for each database using the Boolean method. PRISMA guidelines and the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) were utilized. Ten out of ninety-one studies met inclusion criteria. AI scores differed by race/ethnicity. Two studies found increased AI during adolescence compared to later in ones' training. Mental health-focused studies revealed higher AI levels protect against burnout, but in injured athletes, increased depression risk. Transitioning to a higher level of play during adolescence can correlate with stronger senses of AI. Further research should explore the concept of athletic identity saliency as one moves through an athletic career or training program and how thoughts of perceived success, professional progression, recruitment prospect or injury affect levels of athletic identity.

AB  - Resilience interventions have been gaining importance among researchers due to their potential to provide well-being and reduce the prevalence of mental disorders that are becoming an increasing concern, especially in Western countries, because of the costs associated. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify the intervention studies carried out in the last decade in adult population samples, evaluate their methodological quality and highlight the trends of these types of interventions. This review was performed using systematic literature searches in the following electronic databases: B-on, PubMed, PsycNet and Science Direct. The application of eligibility criteria resulted in the inclusion of 38 articles, of which 33 were randomized controlled trials and the other five were nonrandomized controlled studies. Although most studies showed statistical significance for their results, these were constrained by the great heterogeneity of the studies, the lack of power of the samples and their fair methodological quality. Therefore, it is important to consolidate the theoretical basis and standardize certain methodologies so that the effects of the interventions can be compared through a meta-analysis.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has revolutionised data analysis over the past decade. Like innumerous other industries heavily reliant on accurate information, banking supervision stands to benefit greatly from this technological advance. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive walk-through of how the most common ML techniques have been applied to risk assessment in banking, focusing on a supervisory perspective. We searched Google Scholar, Springer Link, and ScienceDirect databases for articles including the search terms "machine learning" and ("bank" or "banking" or "supervision"). No language, date, or Journal filter was applied. Papers were then screened and selected according to their relevance. The final article base consisted of 41 papers and 2 book chapters, 53% of which were published in the top quartile journals in their field. Results are presented in a timeline according to the publication date and categorised by time slots. Credit risk assessment and stress testing are highlighted topics as well as other risk perspectives, with some references to ML application surveys. The most relevant ML techniques encompass k-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), tree-based models, ensembles, boosting techniques, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Recent trends include developing early warning systems (EWS) for bankruptcy and refining stress testing. One limitation of this study is the paucity of contributions using supervisory data, which justifies the need for additional investigation in this field. However, there is increasing evidence that ML techniques can enhance data analysis and decision making in the banking industry.

AB  - Objective: The authors sought to identify scalable evidence-based suicide prevention strategies.
   Methods: A search of PubMed and Google Scholar identified 20,234 articles published between September 2005 and December 2019, of which 97 were randomized controlled trials with suicidal behavior or ideation as primary outcomes or epidemiological studies of limiting access to lethal means, using educational approaches, and the impact of antidepressant treatment.
   Results: Training primary care physicians in depression recognition and treatment prevents suicide. Educating youths on depression and suicidal behavior, as well as active out-reach to psychiatric patients after discharge or a suicidal crisis, prevents suicidal behavior. Meta-analyses find that antidepressants prevent suicide attempts, but individual randomized controlled trials appear to be underpowered. Ketamine reduces suicidal ideation in hours but is untested for suicidal behavior prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy prevent suicidal behavior. Active screening for suicidal ideation or behavior is not proven to be better than just screening for depression. Education of gatekeepers about youth suicidal behavior lacks effectiveness. No randomized trials have been reported for gatekeeper training for prevention of adult suicidal behavior. Algorithm-driven electronic health record screening, Internet-based screening, and smartphone passive monitoring to identify high-risk patients are understudied. Means restriction, including of firearms, prevents suicide but is sporadically employed in the United States, even though firearms are used in half of all U.S. suicides.
   Conclusions: Training general practitioners warrants wider implementation and testing in other nonpsychiatrist physician settings. Active follow-up of patients after discharge or a suicide-related crisis should be routine, and restricting firearm access by at-risk individuals warrants wider use. Combination approaches in health care systems show promise in reducing suicide in several countries, but evaluating the benefit attributable to each component is essential. Further suicide rate reduction requires evaluating newer approaches, such as electronic health record-derived algorithms, Internet-based screening methods, ketamine's potential benefit for preventing attempts, and passive monitoring of acute suicide risk change.

AB  - Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent and debilitating inflammatory skin disease of the hair follicle that usually presents as painful, deep-seated inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body. HS patients suffer from uncomfortable signs and symptoms, such as pain, pruritus, malodour and suppuration, which may impair patients' quality of life (QoL). Although HS patients frequently experience these signs and symptoms, they are only occasionally assessed by clinicians and, unexpectedly, the scientific evidence available is limited and heterogeneous. The aim of this study is to summarize the evidence regarding the impact of HS signs and symptoms on QoL to serve as a basis for future research and help clinicians to consider them in the daily care of HS patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA Guidelines. The following search algorithm was used: (hidradenitis or "acne inversa") and (pain or itch or odour or malodour or suppuration or oozing or drainage) and ("quality of life"). The literature search identified 836 references, 17 of them met the eligible criteria and were included for analysis, representing 4929 HS patients. Mean age of the participants was 36.28 years and there was a predominance of female sex among study participants. The BMI of the population was in the range of over-weight and about two out five patients were active smokers. Studies included patients with mild to moderate HS, with a mean disease duration of 13.69 years. The HS signs and symptoms assessed were pain, pruritus, malodour and suppuration. Overall, the higher intensity of a sign or symptom correlated with poorer general QoL or specific QoL dimensions including sexual distress, anxiety, depression and sleep. The most frequently employed tool to assess QoL was the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). DLQI was used in 52.9% of the studies (9/17) with a mean value of 10.70 (2.16 SD). The scores employed to assess signs and symptoms severity were subjective and varied between studies, being the numerical rating scale (NRS) for each of the most used symptoms. The mean NRS value for pain was 3.99 and the mean NRS for pruritus was 4.99. In conclusion, we have summarized, categorized and analyzed the scientific evidence regarding signs and symptoms in HS patients and their impairment in QoL. Their assessment should be thorough and included during routine evaluation of HS patients to motivate therapeutic modifications and increase patients' health.

AB  - Many individuals who were affected by the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident continue to face a challenging recovery. We reviewed the long-term mental health consequences of three major nuclear power plant accidents: the Three Mile Island (TMI, 1979), Chernobyl (1986), and Fukushima (2011) nuclear disasters. We examined the relevant prospective cohort studies and before-and-after studies that covered more than two timepoints, searching four databases (PubMed, Ichushi, PsyArticles, and PTSDPub). We identified a total of 35 studies: TMI, n = 11; Chernobyl, n = 6; and Fukushima, n = 18. The smaller numbers of early-phase studies (within 6 months) of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters may also indicate the chaotic situation at those timepoints, as large-scale interviews were conducted in the early phase after the TMI disaster. Although the patterns of effects on mental health outcomes were diverse, more than half of the participants in the studies we evaluated were categorized into low or under-threshold symptom groups in all three disasters. Across the three disasters, the radiation exposure level estimated by the proximity and stigma were the common risk factors for mental health outcomes. Our findings will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the worst nuclear accidents in history on the affected individuals' mental health, and our results illustrate the longitudinal consequences of such disasters.

AB  - In Africa, a systematic appraisal of the associated pattern of psychiatric disorders (PDs) among health-care workers (HCWs) is lacking. We, therefore, aimed to ascertain the pattern of PDs and their associated risk factors among HCWs in Africa during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. We identified 12 studies for inclusion after searching four databases: Web of Science, PubMed, AJOL, and EBSCOhost for articles written in English from January 2020 to April 2021. Anxiety disorder with rates from 9.5% to 73.3% and depression, 12.5% to 71.9%, were the most reported PDs. Availability of protective gear and information regarding preventive measures reduced the risk of developing any PDs, while psychoactive substance use, history of chronic medical illness, low level of resilience, and low social support increased these risks. A considerable proportion of HCWs manifest various psychological problems such as their counterparts in other parts of the world. Multiple factors were also implicated as risk, albeit associations were not consistently established across the studies. There is a need to increase research capacity tailored to the HCW population's needs in the continent.

AB  - There is great heterogeneity in both the clinical presentation and rate of disease progression among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This can pose prognostic difficulties in a clinical setting, and a greater understanding of the risk factors that contribute to modify disease course is of clear importance for optimizing patient care and clinical trial design. Genetic variants in SNCA are an established risk factor for PD and are candidates to modify disease presentation and progression. This systematic review aimed to summarize all available primary research reporting the association of SNCA polymorphisms with features of PD. We systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science, from inception to 1 June 2020, for studies evaluating the association of common SNCA variants with age at onset (AAO) or any clinical feature attributed to PD in patients with idiopathic PD. Fifty-eight studies were included in the review that investigated the association between SNCA polymorphisms and a broad range of outcomes, including motor and cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, mental health, hyposmia, or AAO. The most reproducible findings were with the REP1 polymorphism or rs356219 and an earlier AAO, but no clear associations were identified with an SNCA polymorphism and any individual clinical outcome. The results of this comprehensive summary suggest that, while there is evidence that genetic variance in the SNCA region may have a small impact on clinical outcomes in PD, the mechanisms underlying the association of SNCA polymorphisms with PD risk may not be a major factor driving clinical heterogeneity in PD.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers, who stand in the frontline of this crisis. Insomnia is often related to exposure to stressful situations, such as the current health crisis, as well as other mental disorders, physical conditions and work-related problems. The objectives of this systematic review were: 1) to examine the impact of the current health pandemic produced by COVID-19 on insomnia and sleep quality of health professionals, and 2) to identify risk factors associated with insomnia. After a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, 18 relevant studies were identified. The prevalence of insomnia estimated by random effects meta-analysis was 38% (95%CI=37 to 39%), being slightly higher in women (29%, 95%CI=27% to 30%) than in men (24%, 95%CI=21 to 27%). The main risk factor associated with insomnia was working in a high-risk environment, followed by female sex and having a lower educational level. The high figures of self-reported insomnia and poor sleep quality observed indicate the need to develop interventions aimed at mitigating and caring for the mental health of healthcare workers fighting against this pandemic.

AB  - Background: The findings of many neuroimaging studies in patients with first-episode major depressive disorder (MDD), and even those of previous meta-analysis, are divergent. To quantitatively integrate these studies, we performed a meta-analysis of gray matter volumes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search for relevant studies and traced the references up to May 1, 2021 to select the VBM studies between first-episode MDD and healthy controls (HC). A quantitative meta-analysis of VBM studies on first-episode MDD was performed using the Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) method, which allows a familywise error rate (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons of the results. Meta-regression was used to explore the effects of demographics and clinical characteristics. Results: Nineteen studies, with 22 datasets comprising 619 first-episode MDD and 707 HC, were included. The pooled and subgroup meta-analysis showed robust gray matter reductions in the left insula, the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus extending into the bilateral hippocampus, the right gyrus rectus extending into the right striatum, the right superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral part), the left superior frontal gyrus (medial part) and the left superior parietal gyrus. Meta-regression analyses showed that higher HDRS scores were significantly more likely to present reduced gray matter volumes in the right amygdala, and the mean age of MDD patients in each study was negatively correlated with reduced gray matter in the left insula. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis revealed that structural abnormalities in the fronto-striatal-limbic and fronto-parietal networks are essential characteristics in first-episode MDD patients, which may become a potential target for clinical intervention.

AB  - The present study aimed to provide a precise, meta-analytic estimate of the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) amongst those with a current primary eating disorder (ED) diagnosis, and to isolate its predictors. An online search of PubMed and PsycINFO was conducted with a Boolean search phrase incorporating keywords related to OCD, EDs, comorbidity, prevalence, and epidemiology, complemented by references coded from related review articles and contact with experts in the field. Articles were included if they (a) reported an observational study examining current ED diagnoses, (b) used a semi-structured or structured diagnostic interview for OCD and ED diagnosis, (c) applied DSM or ICD criteria, (d) included adolescent or adult samples (age > 12), (e) included patient or community samples, and (f) reported lifetime or current OCD comorbidity. From the 846 articles identified, 35 lifetime and 42 current estimates were calculated. OCD prevalence was extracted from each study for each ED diagnostic category, along with eleven additional potential moderators. Analyses revealed an aggregate lifetime OCD prevalence of 13.9% CI95% [10.4 to 18.1] and current OCD prevalence of 8.7% CI95% [5.8 to 11.8] across EDs. Moderator analyses revealed the prevalence of and risk for OCD in EDs to be greatest in anorexia nervosa binge-eating purging type (ANBP). Further, OCD is most prevalent amongst patient samples than samples recruited from the community.

Methods: The review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. Four main databases were searched, and studies were screened based on specific inclusion criteria. The data were extracted and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Fourteen studies, with various research designs met the study inclusion criteria. The themes identified were that "justice is human rights and a balance in power". Consequences of experiencing systemic injustice were highlighted in the theme of "mistrust in the legal system and a preference for informal forms of justice". Systemic injustice has negative impacts on wellbeing which formed the themes of "injustice and wellbeing", "sense of agency/control" and "anger at injustice". Conclusions: Experiences of systemic injustice have a negative impact on the wellbeing of refugees and asylum seekers. Implications for refugee and asylum seeker wellbeing are discussed along with suggestions for working with this population. What is already known about this topic: (1) Justice is fundamentally important to humans. (2) Experiencing an injustice has many negative consequences for wellbeing. (3) People with refugee and asylum seeker backgrounds face many risk factors for negative wellbeing and mental health. What this topic adds: (1) Refugees and asylum seekers understand justice in terms of human rights and as a balance of power. (2) Refugees and asylum seekers face many barriers and to accessing justice through legal pathways and as such express a mistrust of the legal system. (3) A loss of control and agency over one's life was associated with negative wellbeing outcomes.

AB  - Introduction This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to (i) examine the associations between experiential avoidance (EA), non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide experiences, and (ii) identify sample- and methodological-related variables affecting the strength of these associations. Method Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched until April 2020. Random-effect meta-analyses were applied. The I-2 statistic and the Egger's test assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. Meta-regression analyses were used to evaluate the impact of moderator variables on the strength of these associations. Results Data from 19 independent studies based on n = 9900 participants were pooled. The analyses demonstrated a weak but significant association between EA and NSSI. None of the examined moderator variables influenced the strength of this relationship. There was an indication of publication bias, suggesting that this association may have been inflated. The associations between EA, and suicide ideation and behaviors were moderate to strong. Discussion The current study concluded that (i) the EA model for NSSI should be revised by incorporating new evidence implicating feelings of relief in NSSI, and (ii) future studies should examine interactive factors between EA and key psychological components in the pathways to suicide experiences because these findings have direct clinical implications.

AB  - Objective: Patients will experience a plethora of issues when faced with a recurrence of their cancer. It is unclear if cancer type is a significant factor in how recurrence is experienced by an individual. The aim of the current review is to explore the evidence base and summarise the experiences of patients specifically with a recurrence of breast or prostate cancer (the most common for women and men, respectively) and then provide a comparison of these experiences. These experiences include the physical, psychological and psychosocial issues that arise at this time. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of studies published between January 1994 and April 2019. Due to the mix of research designs used previously in the literature, this review was conducted in an integrative manner; allowing for inclusion of diverse research designs. Results were synthesised narratively, with data categorised according to physical, psychological, and psychosocial indices of quality of life. The review protocol was registered in the international database of prospective systematic reviews in health and social care- (CRD42019137381). Results: Fifteen breast cancer and six prostate cancer articles were identified, each reporting one relevant study. Patients reported several negative issues at the time of a breast or prostate cancer recurrence. Similarities were found between cancer types, with physical problems such as fatigue, psychological issues including anxiety and depressive symptoms, and psychosocial concerns such as issues with healthcare professionals common in both cancers. Certain findings were inconsistent across studies, with some experiences differing between studies rather than due to cancer type. Conclusions: Differences in the experience of recurrent cancer appear to be more heavily influenced by individual factors, rather than cancer type. Findings are confounded by gender; and should be considered preliminary. Effects of recurrence should be studied in samples where cancer type and gender are not confounded. Concerns are raised about available study quality and differing outcome measures in this interpretation. Care and support of the individual at the time of a cancer recurrence is a key focus. Future research suggestions with implications for clinical practise are included. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019137381.

AB  - Of Duman's many influential findings, the finding that long-term treatment with antidepressant drugs produces an increase in neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the adult hippocampus may be one of the most enduring and far-reaching. This novel discovery and his decades of continued research in the field led to a new hypothesis about the mechanism of action of antidepressants, providing a critical step in our understanding of the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression and synaptic plasticity. It is now accepted that antidepressant treatments can oppose and even reverse the effects of stress on the brain and on newly born hippocampal cells, possibly via neurotrophic factors, which Duman had continued to explore. Furthermore, ablation studies have shown preclinically that hippocampal neuro -genesis may be necessary for some of the clinical effects of antidepressant drugs. Duman's laboratory continued to interrogate neurotrophins and synaptic plasticity, demonstrating that newer clinically approved antidepressant compounds also affect neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarize Duman's original findings and discuss the current state of the field of neurogenesis with respect to animal models and human studies and the implications of those findings on the field of drug discovery.

AB  - Sediment is an important compartment in aquatic environments and acts as a sink for environmental pollutants. Sediment toxicity tests have been suggested as critical components in environmental risk assessment. Since the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been indicated as an emerging model system in ecotoxicological tests, a scientometric and systematic review was performed to evaluate the use of zebrafish as an experimental model system in sediment toxicity assessment. A total of 97 papers were systematically analyzed and summarized. The historical and geographical distributions were evaluated and the data concerning the experimental design, type of sediment toxicity tests and approach (predictive or retrospective), pollutants and stressors, zebrafish developmental stages and biomarkers responses were summarized and discussed. The use of zebrafish to assess the sediment toxicity started in 1996, using mainly a retrospective approach. After this, research showed an increasing trend, especially after 2014-2015. Zebrafish exposed to pollutant-bound sediments showed bioaccumulation and several toxic effects, such as molecular, biochemical, morphological, physiological and behavioral changes. Zebrafish is a suitable model system to assess the toxicity of freshwater, estuarine and marine sediments, and sediment spiked in the laboratory. The pollutant-bound sediment toxicity in zebrafish seems to be overall dependent on physical and chemical properties of pollutants, experimental design, environmental factor, developmental stages and presence of organic natural matter. Overall, results showed that the zebrafish embryos and larvae are suitable model systems to assess the sediment-associated pollutant toxicity. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We compare the relative efficacy of virtual reality therapy exposure (VRET) versus in vivo therapy exposure among individuals suffering from phobias. A systematic search was completed up to 03 April 2020, using the following databases: ACM Digital Library, ResearchGate, IEEE, Science Direct, MIT PressJournals, Center for Direct Scientific Communication (CCSD) and Mary Ann Liebert Publishers. Five authors searched the databases using the following terms: Virtual Reality, Phobia, Mental health, Computing, Therapy, HMD, CAVE, Virtual ambient, in virtuo, Avoidance, Exposure, VRET, in vivo, Anxiety, Agoraphobia, Social Phobia, Stimuli, Cognitive-behaviour. All studies that evaluate the effect of in virtuo exposure towards phobia rehabilitation were selected. By reviewing the article, each author then applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 30 articles were selected. Data extracted included the number of samples, amount of sessions, study variables that may affect the final outcome, therapy technology. The data provided was synthesized using a meta-analysis based on the results. The results demonstrated a positive outcome of Virtual Reality Exposure Treatment in the treatment of most phobias. In contrast, some of these treatments did not work for a few specific phobias in which the standard procedures were more effective. The findings suggest that for some specific phobias treatment, Virtual Reality Exposure Treatment does not reach the in vivo exposure level of immersion and presence. Further research is needed to perform studies with higher-dimension samples, since many papers report a low sample size and that is probably why many of them have inconclusive results.

AB  - Currently, freshwater resources occupy a top place among other natural resources on the planet. The Egyptian water resource system is complex and uncertain; therefore, the major challenge is to close the rapidly increasing gap between the limited water resources and escalating demand for freshwater. The Toshka Depression is in a hyper arid area in the Western Egyptian Desert. This depression is considered the first line of defense to accommodate any sudden floods. Its water is lost mainly through evaporation without being utilized optimally. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) were integrated to assess the surface hydrological changes of Toshka Lakes. The massive floods of the Nile River resulted in the gradual formation of four new inland lakes in the Toshka Depression (first lake of 12.5 km(3), second of 0.4 km(3), third of 5.2 km(3), and fourth of 22.1 km(3)). Those lakes were diminishing with low Nile discharges and appeared again with the Lake Nasser high flood. Therefore, measures must be taken to obtain the most benefits from the lakes as freshwater and avoid the negative effects as they eventually turn into saline basins owing to evaporation.

AB  - A student's sense of school belonging is critical to school success, yet internationally, a large proportion of secondary students do not feel that they belong to their school. However, little is understood about how schools can address this issue, nor what evidence-based interventions are available to increase belonging among secondary school students. The aim of this study is to identify and critically review the evidence on school-based interventions that increase a sense of school belonging in adolescents. Seven electronic databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1999 to February 2021 using 'school belonging' and 'intervention' amongst the key search terms. A total of 22 controlled trials were identified with 14 studies reporting effective school-based interventions for enhancing a sense of adolescent school belonging. Successful interventions targeted students' strengths and promoted positive interactions between students and between school staff and students. Overall, this review found a paucity of interventions that intentionally aimed to develop adolescent school belonging. Inconsistencies in terminology use and definitions describing school belonging were identified even when similar measurement tools were utilised. Findings of this review have important practice implications and provide information to support schools to select evidence-based interventions to improve students' sense of school belonging.

AB  - Transgender and gender non-conforming people (TGNC), individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, experience unique stressors, discrimination, and barriers to health and wellbeing. TGNC People of Colour (POC) navigate the nexus of racism, cisgenderism (and often homophobia) in their daily lives, resulting in uniquely intersecting forms of discrimination, and pronounced disparities in their health and well-being. In order to examine the current state of knowledge about the health and wellbeing of TGNC POC, we conducted a systematic search and review of peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1 January 2010 and 1 May 2020 that focused on this population. A systematic search identified (3,575) papers, with 76 of those meeting full inclusion criteria. In our review, we were able to identify physical health and psychological wellbeing (which included resilience), as core clusters of research focused on TGNC POC. We identified specific factors that hindered physical and psychological health (what we call "push" factors) as well as those that promoted it (what we call "pull" factors). Leveraging these findings, we offer ways forward for best practice in clinical work and carrying out research with this population.

AB  - Children and adolescents with heterogeneous psychiatric disorders, of whom over 50% have a second psychiatric comorbidity, have low rates of physical activity and experience unique challenges to engaging in community-based exercise programming, school-based physical education programming, and targeted physical activity interventions. This contributes to elevated rates of gross and fine motor delays, lower mood and self-regulation, and increased risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Perform a systematic scoping review of the literature to assess known barriers to and facilitators of engaging in physical activity programming among children and adolescents with heterogeneous and/or comorbid psychiatric disorders, in order to improve engagement among this population in real world intervention settings. Systematic Boolean diagnostic and physical activity search terms were entered into PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science for English-language studies published between 2005 and 2020, examining barriers and facilitators for common psychiatric diagnoses and general psychiatric population's engagement in physical activity, physical education, sports, or exercise interventions. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts and full articles to determine inclusion. A total of 5,198 articles were returned; 39 relating to children and adolescents were qualified for full-text review. After review, 24 studies were included addressing barriers and facilitators across multiple diagnoses; 7 studies were quantitative, 10 were qualitative, and 7 were mixed methods. Major barriers included low motivation, low self-efficacy, depleted parental reserve capacity, social isolation, lack of staff training, and safety concerns. Major facilitators included peer support/engagement, exergames, supportive parental behaviors, and inclusive/adaptive programming. Numerous barriers and facilitators to physical activity have been identified which should inform community, school, clinical, and research intervention program design. Further research is needed to develop effective strategies that address the challenges to inclusion that children and adolescents with heterogeneous and/or comorbid psychiatric disorders face.

AB  - Background Peer support is being integrated within mental health services to further the development of a recovery approach. However, the most effective models and formats of intervention delivery are unknown. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of peer support for improving outcomes for people with lived experience of mental health conditions, when delivered as group interventions. Methods Studies reporting randomised controlled trials of group peer support interventions for people experiencing mental health conditions were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL, from inception until July 12th 2019 and undertaking supplementary searches. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias and meta-analyses were conducted if three or more trials provided usable data. Results Eight trials met eligibility criteria, providing data from 2131 participants. Six trials had either high or unclear risk of bias. Interventions were categorised as mutual support groups, or peer support groups, sub-categorised as anti-stigma or self-management interventions. Meta-analyses were only possible for peer support groups and five outcomes. We found evidence that group peer support may make small improvements to overall recovery but not hope or empowerment individually, or to clinical symptoms. Evidence for effectiveness for outcomes which could not be meta-analysed was mixed. Conclusions Findings from the few eligible trials suggest group peer support interventions may be specifically effective for supporting personal recovery and have a limited impact on other outcomes, though there were some risks of bias to study findings. Interventions were heterogeneous and most social outcomes were absent in the literature, highlighting further limitations to the current evidence-base. There is insufficient evidence available from trials of group peer support torecommend the routine implementation of these interventions across mainstream mental health services at present. More high-quality trials of peer-developed, group peer support interventions are needed in order tomake firm conclusions about intervention effectiveness.

AB  - Objective Converging evidence from structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies points to amygdala alteration as crucial in the development of paediatric bipolar disorder (pBP). The high number of recent studies prompted us to comprehensively evaluate findings. We aimed to systematically review structural and functional MRI studies investigating the amygdala in patients with pBP and in youth at high-risk (HR) for developing pBP. Methods We searched PubMed from any time to 25 September 2020 using: 'amygdala AND (MRI OR magnetic resonance imaging) AND bipolar AND (pediatr* OR child OR children OR childhood OR adolescent OR adolescents OR adolescence OR young OR familial OR at-risk OR sibling* OR offspring OR high risk)'. In this review, we adhered to the PRISMA statement. Results Amygdala hyperactivity to emotional stimuli is the most commonly reported finding in youth with pBP and HR compared to healthy peers (HC), whereas findings from structural MRI studies are inconsistent. Conclusions Hyperactivation of the amygdala might be an endophenotype of pBP.

AB  - The medical use of lithium has grown since its initial introduction in the 1800s as a treatment for gout. Today, the divalent cation remains as the pharmacological gold standard in treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) with strong mood stabilizing effects. Lithium has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acute affective episodes, in the reduction of affective episode recurrence, and in significantly decreasing the risk of suicide in patients. BD has been consistently associated with clinical signs of accelerated aging, including increased rates of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, malignancies, and diabetes mellitus. This clinical scenario parallels accelerated aging mechanisms observed on a molecular basis, with studies reporting shortened telomeres, increased oxidative stress, and accelerated epigenetic aging in patients with BD compared to controls. Lithium has proved useful as a potential agent in slowing down this accelerated aging process in BD, potentially reversing effects induced by the disorder. This mini-review summarizes findings of anti-aging mechanisms associated with lithium use and provides a discussion of the clinical implications and perspectives of this evolving field. Despite many promising results, more studies are warranted in order to elucidate the exact mechanism by which lithium may act as an anti-aging agent and the extent to which these mechanisms are relevant to its mood stabilizing properties in BD.

AB  - Depression is a common mental disorder and one of the leading causes of disability around the world. Monoaminergic antidepressants often take weeks to months to work and are not effective for all patients. This has led to a search for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of depression as well as to the development of novel antidepressants. One such novel antidepressant is ketamine, which has demonstrated both clinically promising results and contributed to new explanatory models of depression, including the potential role of neuroplasticity in depression. Early clinical trials are now showing promising results of serotonergic psychedelics for depression; however, their mechanism of action remains poorly understood. This paper seeks to review the effect of depression, classic antidepressants, ketamine, and serotonergic psychedelics on markers of neuroplasticity at a cellular, molecular, electrophysiological, functional, structural, and psychological level to explore the potential role that neuroplasticity plays in the treatment response of serotonergic psychedelics.

AB  - Mental health symptoms secondary to trauma exposure and substance use disorders (SUDS) co-occur frequently in both clinical and community samples. The possibility of a shared aetiology remains an important question in translational neuroscience. Advancements in genetics, basic science, and neuroimaging have led to an improved understanding of the neural basis of these disorders, their frequent comorbidity and high rates of relapse remain a clinical challenge. This project aimed to conduct a review of the field's current understanding regarding the neural circuitry underlying posttraumatic stress disorder and SUD. A comprehensive review was conducted of available published literature regarding the shared neurobiology of these disorders, and is summarized in detail, including evidence from both animal and clinical studies. Upon summarizing the relevant literature, this review puts forth a hypothesis related to their shared neurobiology within the context of fear processing and reward cues. It provides an overview of brain reward circuitry and its relation to the neurobiology, symptomology, and phenomenology of trauma and substance use. This review provides clinical insights and implications of the proposed theory, including the potential development of novel pharmacological and therapeutic treatments to address this shared neurobiology. Limitations and extensions of this theory are discussed to provide future directions and insights for this shared phenomena.

AB  - Steroid hormones are extremely important natural hormones in all vertebrates. They control a wide range of physiological processes, including osmoregulation, sexual maturity, reproduction and stress responses. In addi-tion, many synthetic steroid hormones are in widespread and general use, both as human and veterinary phar-maceuticals. Recent advances in environmental analytical chemistry have enabled concentrations of steroid hormones in rivers to be determined. Many different steroid hormones, both natural and synthetic, including transformation products, have been identified and quantified, demonstrating that they are widespread aquatic contaminants. Laboratory ecotoxicology experiments, mainly conducted with fish, but also amphibians, have shown that some steroid hormones, both natural and synthetic, can adversely affect reproduction when present in the water at extremely low concentrations: even sub-ng/L. Recent research has demonstrated that mixtures of different steroid hormones can inhibit reproduction even when each individual hormone is present at a concen-tration below which it would not invoke a measurable effect on its own. Limited field studies have supported the conclusions of the laboratory studies that steroid hormones may be environmental pollutants of significant con -cern. Further research is required to identify the main sources of steroid hormones entering the aquatic environ -ment, better describe the complex mixtures of steroid hormones now known to be ubiquitously present, and determine the impacts of environmentally-realistic mixtures of steroid hormones on aquatic vertebrates, espe-cially fish. Only once that research is completed can a robust aquatic risk assessment of steroid hormones be concluded. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background Cognitive difficulties are common in people with severe mental disorders (SMDs) and various measures of cognition are of proven validity. However, there is a lack of systematic evidence regarding the psychometric properties of these measures in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Objective To systematically review the psychometric properties of cognitive measures validated in people with SMDs in LMICs. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature by searching from four electronic databases. Two authors independently screened studies for their eligibility. Measurement properties of measures in all included studies were extracted. All eligible measures were assessed against criteria set for clinical and research recommendations. Results are summarized narratively and measures were grouped by measurement type and population. Results We identified 23 unique measures from 28 studies. None of these was from low-income settings. Seventeen of the measures were performance-based. The majority (n = 16/23) of the measures were validated in people with schizophrenia. The most commonly reported measurement properties were: known group, convergent, and divergent validity (n = 25/28). For most psychometric property, studies of methodological qualities were found to be doubtful. Among measures evaluated in people with schizophrenia, Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, Cognitive Assessment Interview, MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, and CogState Schizophrenia Battery were with the highest scores for clinical and research recommendation. Conclusions Studies included in our review provide only limited quality evidence and future studies should consider adapting and validating measures using stronger designs and methods. Nonetheless, validated assessments of cognition could help in the management and allocating therapy in people with SMDs in LMICs.

AB  - In this study, a literature survey was conducted of research into the development and use of wearable devices and sensors in patients with depression. We collected 18 studies that had investigated wearable devices for assessment, monitoring, or prediction of depression. In this report, we examine the sensors of the various types of wearable devices (e.g., actigraphy units, wristbands, fitness trackers, and smartwatches) and parameters measured through sensors in people with depression. In addition, we discuss future trends, referring to research in other areas employing wearable devices, and suggest the challenges of using wearable devices in the field of depression. Real-time objective monitoring of symptoms and novel approaches for diagnosis and treatment using wearable devices will lead to changes in management of patients with depression. During the process, it is necessary to overcome several issues, including limited types of collected data, reliability, user adherence, and privacy concerns.

AB  - Background: Individuals living with coeliac disease generally experience a remission of symptoms after adopting the gluten-free diet but often report substantial treatment burden and ongoing quality of life issues. Psychosocial factors have been suggested to play a significant role in post-diagnosis quality of life but have yet to be systematically reviewed. Aim: To review the evidence for psychosocial factors associated with quality of life in adult coeliac disease cohorts. Methods: Studies were identified via systematic searches of eight databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, PsycINFO, Ovid Nursing, CINAHL, Informit Health Collection, Cochrane Library) in May 2019. Results: Fourteen studies were included involving 3372 participants (80.2% female, mean age = 46.4 years). Symptoms of depression and anxiety were the most examined psychosocial factors across all studies. Quality of life was differentially associated with psychological distress, illness perceptions, coping, and attitudes/behaviours regarding food and the gluten-free diet. Conclusion: Several psychosocial factors are associated with quality of life in adults living with coeliac disease. Current evidence suggests these factors are interrelated and may influence quality of life directly, via reduced psychological well-being, and indirectly, via reduced adherence to the gluten-free diet. Future research is needed to examine these processes concurrently, with the aim of elucidating the psychosocial mechanisms underlying post-diagnosis well-being and identifying potential targets for psychosocial intervention.

AB  - Background: Psychotropic concomitant medication use for the treatment of youth with emotional and behavioral disorders has grown significantly in the U.S. over the past 25 years. The use of pharmacy claims to analyze these trends requires the following: age of the selected population, overlapping days of use, and precision of the outcome itself. This review will also address the gaps in reporting of pediatric psychotropic polypharmacy. Methods: An electronic literature search was undertaken for the period 2000 through 2020 using keywords such as "pediatric," "concomitant," "polypharmacy," "multiple medications," and "concurrent psychotropic"; Relevant references in textbooks were also used. Only English language and U.S. studies were included, resulting in 35 inter-class studies. Results: Studies were organized into seven groups according to data sources and clinical topics: (1) population surveys; (2a) multi-state publicly insured populations; (2b) single/two state studies; (3) privately insured populations; (4) diagnosed populations; (5) foster care populations; (6) special settings. Across 20 years it is apparent that pediatric psychotropic polypharmacy affects substantially more children and adolescents today than had been the case. As many as 300,000 youth now receive 3 or more classes concomitantly. The duration of concomitant use is relatively long, e.g., 69-89% of annual medicated days. Finally, more adverse event reports were associated with 3-class compared with 2-class drug regimens. Discussion: Factors that contribute to the growth of pediatric psychotropic polypharmacy include: (1) predominance of the biological model in psychiatric practice; (2) invalid assumptions on efficacy of combinations, (3) limited professional awareness of metabolic and neurological adverse drug events, and (4) infrequent use of appropriate deprescribing. Conclusion: A review of publications documenting U.S. pediatric psychotropic polypharmacy written over the last 20 years supports the need to standardize the methodologies used. The design of population-based studies should maximize information on the number of youth receiving regimens of 3-, 4-, and 5 or more concomitant classes and the duration of such use. Next, far more post-marketing research is needed to address the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of complex drug regimens prescribed for youngsters.

AB  - The scientific literature on workplace interventions that target individual-level determinants of mental health for primary or secondary prevention is mixed, with many studies failing to show statistically significant, sizeable effects. A methodological characteristic that may explain these mixed findings is fidelity, a multidimensional construct that captures the extent to which an intervention is implemented as intended, in a standardized manner. In this narrative review, we examined the extent to which workplace mental health intervention studies try to enhance or measure the twelve different dimensions of fidelity that have been identified. We conducted comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. Following review, 370 articles were selected for inclusion, of which only 21% explicitly mentioned fidelity. About two-thirds of the articles considered less than half of all relevant fidelity dimensions. Most studies tried to enhance rather than measure fidelity. Only a handful of included studies (n=7, 2%) measured half or more of all relevant fidelity dimensions. Some fidelity dimensions (e.g. theoretical) were considered less often than others (e.g. receipt and enactment). Our review shows that fidelity is insufficiently considered in current workplace mental health literature. We discuss implications for internal and external validity, scalability, and directions for future research.

AB  - Background: Due to lack of preparedness of health systems, fast spread of the new virus, high mortality rates, and lack of a definite treatment, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led to high levels of fear and anxiety in different populations. In addition, isolation, mental disorders, and limitations in social interactions as a result of lockdown and travel ban increased the fear of the new coronavirus. Methods: International databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google scholar, were searched without any time limitation, and all observational studies published in English reporting the mean of fear of COVID-19 based on the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) were included in the analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. Random effects model, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Heterogeneity across studies was examined using Cochran's Q test and I-2 statistic. All the statistical analyses were conducted using R software v4.0.3. Results: A total of 44 articles with a sample size of 52,462 were reviewed. A pooled mean of 18.57 was found for fear of COVID-19. The mean of fear of COVID-19 was higher in women than in men (20.67 vs. 18.21). The highest and lowest means of fear of COVID-19 had been found in Asia (18.36) and Australia (17.43) based on continent, and in hospital staff (19.51) and college students (17.95) based on target population, respectively. In addition, the highest and lowest means of fear of COVID-19 were related to items #1 and #3 of the scale, respectively. According to the results of meta-regression analysis, there was no significant association between the mean of fear of COVID-19 and sample size and participants' age. In addition, publication error was not significant (P = 0.721). Conclusion: The mean of fear of COVID-19 was high around the world; therefore, it seems necessary to pay more attention to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.

AB  - Within the general literature on infections and suicidal behavior, studies on Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) occupy a central position. This is related to the parasite's neurotropism, high prevalence of chronic infection, as well as specific and non-specific behavioral alterations in rodents that lead to increased risk taking, which are recapitulated in humans by T. gondii's associations with suicidal behavior, as well as trait impulsivity and aggression, mental illness and traffic accidents. This paper is a detailed review of the associations between T. gondii serology and suicidal behavior, a field of study that started 15 years ago with our publication of associations between T. gondii IgG serology and suicidal behavior in persons with mood disorders. This "legacy" article presents, chronologically, our primary studies in individuals with mood disorders and schizophrenia in Germany, recent attempters in Sweden, and in a large cohort of mothers in Denmark. Then, it reviews findings from all three meta-analyses published to date, confirming our reported associations and overall consistent in effect size [ranging between 39 and 57% elevation of odds of suicide attempt in T. gondii immunoglobulin (IgG) positives]. Finally, the article introduces certain links between T. gondii and biomarkers previously associated with suicidal behavior (kynurenines, phenylalanine/tyrosine), intermediate phenotypes of suicidal behavior (impulsivity, aggression) and state-dependent suicide risk factors (hopelessness/dysphoria, sleep impairment). In sum, an abundance of evidence supports a positive link between suicide attempts (but not suicidal ideation) and T. gondii IgG (but not IgM) seropositivity and serointensity. Trait impulsivity and aggression, endophenotypes of suicidal behavior have also been positively associated with T. gondii seropositivity in both the psychiatrically healthy as well as in patients with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Yet, causality has not been demonstrated. Thus, randomized interventional studies are necessary to advance causal inferences and, if causality is confirmed, to provide hope that an etiological treatment for a distinct subgroup of individuals at an increased risk for suicide could emerge.

AB  - People with psychosis can experience social functioning impairments. Virtual reality (VR) has been used to assess and treat these difficulties. This systematic review (Prospero CRD42015026288) provides an evaluation of these VR applications. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched until May 2020. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess studies. Database searching identified 3810 titles. Fifty-eight studies (published 2005-2020; N = 2,853), comprising twenty-six head-mounted display studies (20 assessment, 6 treatment) and thirty-two immersive 2D screen studies (23 assessment, 9 treatment), were included. There were forty-eight observational studies and ten randomised controlled trials, with 1570 participants (of which, 185 were at ultra-high risk of psychosis) in VR test groups. Nearly half the studies were published since 2016. Assessments targeted cognitive and behavioural indicators of social functioning, e.g. paranoia, eye gaze, or interpersonal distance. Treatments promoted cognitive-behavioural social skills or job interview training. Studies indicate feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of VR for social functioning impairments in psychosis. Limitations of studies include the narrow scope of social functioning, small sample sizes, and limited randomised controlled trials and standardised interventions. Findings suggest VR has potential to be integrated with existing psychological approaches.

AB  - Background
   Observational studies suggest that hormonal contraceptive use may increase depressive symptoms in women, but it is unclear whether the effect is causal.
   Aims
   To quantitatively examine the evidence from randomised clinical trials for the link between hormonal contraceptive use and depressive symptoms.
   Method
   We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials comparing women randomised to any form of a hormonal contraceptive with women randomised to any other form of a (non-)hormonal contraceptive or placebo. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, EMCare and EMBASE, from inception to 1 May 2020. Certainty of the evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. A random-effect Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted, with change in depressive symptoms between baseline and three cycles as outcome.
   Results
   This review identified 3492 records, of which 14 trials were eligible and 12 could be included in the network meta-analysis. These trials included 5833 participants (mean age per study range: 16.8-32.4 years) and compared 10 different interventions. Compared with placebo, hormonal contraceptive use did not cause worsening of depressive symptoms (standardised mean difference: median, -0.04; range, -0.17 [95% credible interval -0.46 to 0.13] to 0.13 [95% credible interval -0.28 to 0.56]).
   Conclusions
   This study suggests that hormonal contraceptive use does not lead to an increase in depressive symptoms in adult women. Future studies should include first-time users, to confirm the results in young women.

AB  - Background: Prevalence estimates of major depressive disorder (MDD) among adults in China have varied widely between studies. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the overall prevalence of MDD in the Chinese population was estimated from published epidemiological studies and potential moderators that account for variability in estimates were assessed. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI), and WanFang databases to identify relevant studies. Data analyses were conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2.0. Results: Forty studies comprising 1,024,087 subjects were included. The pooled point, 12-month, and lifetime prevalence rates of MDD in China were 1.1% (95% CI: 0.9-1.4%), 1.6% (95% CI: 1.0-2.5%), and 1.8% (95% CI: 1.5-2.2%), respectively. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed gender, marital status, survey year, being published in English language, use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnostic systems and age as significant moderators of MDD prevalence. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of MDD in the Chinese population appears to be lower than that of most countries, but the rates have been increasing over time and are elevated in particular demographic subgroups. Due to the negative consequences of MDD, effective preventive measures, early identification, and timely treatments are still important and should be offered to those in need.

AB  - The association between physical activity (PA) and mental health in typically developing children has been amply documented, but little is known about the corresponding association in children with special educational needs (SEN). This systematic review aimed to synthesize the evidence for the association between PA and mental health in children with SEN. A systematic literature search of five databases (PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL) was conducted, and the publication year was between October 2010 and February 2021. Two researchers performed abstract and full text screening and extracted the data independently. Inclusion and exclusion criteria followed the PICOS framework, and the quality of eligible studies was assessed using the McMaster critical review form. Eighteen studies that met the inclusion criteria and had quality ratings >= 60% were included in this review. PA was positively associated with overall psychological well-being and its subtypes (including enjoyment, self-worth, self-competence, mental wellness, and quality of life), and negatively associated with anxiety and fatigue. Body composition, age, and sex were moderators of the association. The findings of this review indicated that PA was consistently associated with mental health in children with SEN. These associations were the most powerful when PA was conducted in unstructured types such as free play and recess activities. Structured types including physical education classes were more strongly related to mental health than overall PA (combined structured and unstructured types). Future PA interventions are needed to promote mental health in children with SEN.

AB  - Sports participations have the potential for both positive and negative health outcomes. We hence aimed (i) to assess systematically reviewed associations between organized sports participation in children and adolescents and their health, and (ii) to assess qualitative syntheses of experiences among children and adolescents concerning organized sports participation and health. A search was undertaken in April 2020 across the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo (Ovid), Scopus, SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost), and specialized databases for reviews. The recommended Joanna Briggs Institute approach to critical appraisal, study selection, data extraction, and data synthesis was used. Systematic reviews were included that covered children and/or adolescents aged <= 18 years, and adult participants with retrospective exposure to-or experiences of-organized sports participation before the age of 19 and examining health outcomes and experiences (Prospero protocol CRD 42020206677). Five reviews based mainly on cross-sectional data, two mainly on longitudinal data, and one on experimental studies were included. A causal relationship of moderate-to-high level of evidence between organized sports participation and moderate crude weight reduction accentuated by diet control and team sports was identified. Evidence of causal relationships between sports participation and reduced anxiety, and depression and increased physical activity was at a moderate level. Evidence of causal relationships between sports participation and health was of low-to-moderate level concerning obesity status (inconclusive), bone health (positive), and psychological and social health (positive and negative). Causal relationships between organized child and adolescent sports participation and health remain uncertain. Experimental and well-conducted longitudinal primary studies are highly warranted.

AB  - Depression is a prevalent disorder and leading cause of disability in Latin America, where the mental health treatment gap is still above 50%. We sought to synthesise and assess the quality of the evidence on the feasibility of mHealth-based interventions for depression in Latin America. We conducted a literature search of studies published in 2007 and after using four electronic databases. We included peer-reviewed articles, in English, Spanish or Portuguese, that evaluated interventions for depressive symptoms. Two authors independently extracted data using forms developed a priori. We assessed appropriateness of reporting utilising the CONSORT checklist for feasibility trials. Eight manuscripts were included for full data extraction. Appropriate reporting varied greatly. Most (n = 6, 75%) of studies were conducted in primary care settings and sought to deliver psychoeducation or behaviour change interventions for depressive symptoms. We found great heterogeneity in the assessment of feasibility. Two studies used comparator conditions. mHealth research for depression in Latin America is scarce. Included studies showed some feasibility despite methodological inconsistencies. Given the dire need for evidence-based mental health interventions in this region, governments and stakeholders must continue promoting and funding research tailored to cultural and population characteristics with subsequent pragmatic clinical trials.

AB  - Purpose To systematically review studies on HRQOL, measured by the WHOQOL-Bref instrument, of refugees in general and clinical populations who are settled in the community of the hosting country, and outline the differences in scores among the two population groups and across the four domains of WHOQOL-Bref (physical, psychological, social relationships and environment domain) as well as factors impacting those outcomes. Methods Several databases were systematically searched by using a broad search strategy. Additionally, a hand search for grey literature was performed. Studies had to comply with the following inclusion criteria: (a) population of refugees; (b) living in the community of the country of destination; (c) assessing HRQOL through the WHOQOL-Bref instrument. Results 15 studies were identified and divided into two subgroups: (a) general population of refugees (b) clinical population of refugees, who were specifically selected for their mental status or because they had experienced relevant past traumas. Although we can outline common patterns among the two groups, in terms of domains scoring the highest and the lowest, heterogeneous values of HRQOL are observed across the studies included. Conclusions Individuals who were included in the clinical refugee group have a lower quality of life in respect to the general population of refugees. However, among the two groups different patterns can be outlined considering each domain of HRQOL: higher scores for the Physical and lower for the Environment domain when considering the general population of refugees and higher scores for the Environment and lower for the Psychological domain when referring to the clinical one. These lower scores are probably due to having a higher rate of mental distress and being more exposed to somatization, stigmatization and barriers to access the healthcare system of the hosting country.

AB  - Background: Review-based research is needed which can establish the psychosocial outcomes and mechanisms of "storytelling and sharing" interventions for people with stroke. This information will act to inform the value and development of such interventions. Methods: An integrative review was conducted in three stages: (a) a systematic search strategy was undertaken to focus on articles between 2009 until January 2020 to locate articles the considered storytelling and sharing interventions for people diagnosed with stroke; (b) critical appraisal was undertaken to assess study quality; and (c) synthesis within three stages including data reduction, data display and conclusion. Results: Fourteen articles (including 727 participants) were identified that met the eligibility criteria. Five themes were identified that represented the outcome and mechanisms that appeared to be associated with a stroke intervention. These included introducing the concept of hope and learning to be positive, the enhanced ability to cope, the impact of loneliness and social interaction, impact on emotions, depression and related emotions such as fear. Conclusions: Storytelling interventions appear to impact loneliness, introduce positivity and hope and enable coping through knowledge exchange. The main mechanisms which appeared to influence these outcomes were social comparisons and social control.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Supervision in mental health services (MHSs) has a long tradition. Aim of this review was to analyze papers focused on group clinical supervision in adult psychiatric services.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review of the literature was performed, according to the PRISMA guidelines. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO. Papers were electronically identified through a database search updated up to October 31, 2020, on PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus and Web of Science. English-written papers were eligible if reporting any data measuring directly or indirectly the outcome of supervision on mental health professionals.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-five articles were included: three randomized controlled trials, one cohort study, one cross-sectional and twenty qualitative studies. Although supervision is widely employed among MHSs, the number of studies documenting its diffusion and efficacy is limited. Furthermore, poor operational definitions of supervision limit comparisons among studies. Participants generally reported an improved sense of professional competence and expressed a clear preference for a supervisor coming from outside the work environment. This choice may impact on budget, therefore future studies should address also cost effectiveness of group supervision.
   CONCLUSIONS: Improved sense of competence, widely reported by participants, should encourage further studies to better investigate supervision cost; therefore, future studies should also address effectiveness in clinical contexts. In particular, professionals taking part to supervision found that a supervisor coming from outside their organizations was more effective, but this may bring additional costs.

AB  - People with disabilities may be disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We synthesize the literature on broader health and social impacts on people with disabilities arising from lockdown-related measures. Methods: Scoping review with thematic analysis. Up to mid-September 2020, seven scientific databases and three pre-print servers were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers addressing lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Snowballing searches and experts' consultation also occurred. Two independent reviewers took eligibility decisions and performed data extractions. Results: Out of 1026 unique references, 85 addressed lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Ten primary and two central themes were identified: (1) Disrupted access to healthcare (other than for COVID-19); (2) Reduced physical activity leading to health and functional decline; (3) From physical distance and inactivity to social isolation and loneliness; (4) Disruption of personal assistance and community support networks; (5) Children with disabilities disproportionally affected by school closures; (6) Psychological consequences of disrupted routines, activities, and support; (7) Family and informal caregiver burden and stress; (8) Risks of maltreatment, violence, and self-harm; (9) Reduced employment and/or income exacerbating disparities; and (10) Digital divide in access to health, education, and support services. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and structural, pre-pandemic disparities were the central themes. Conclusions: Lockdown-related measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic can disproportionally affect people with disabilities with broader impact on their health and social grounds. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and pre-pandemic disparities created structural disadvantages, exacerbated during the pandemic. Both structural disparities and their pandemic ramifications require the development and implementation of disability-inclusive public health and policy measures.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains one of the most effective treatments for major depressive disorder, but uncertainties persist regarding the cognitive tests to include in ECT follow-up. The current study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the most frequent cognitive side effects after ECT. We also discuss the most common cognitive tests in ECT follow-up. We searched studies published from 2000 to 2017 in English and French language in Pubmed, EBM Reviews, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Standardized cognitive tests were separated into 11 cognitive domains. Comparisons between cognitive measures included pre-ECT baseline with post-ECT measures at 3 times: PO1, immediately post-ECT (within 24 hours after last ECT); PO2, short term (1-28 days); and PO3, long term (more than 1 month). A total of 91 studies were included, with an aggregated sample of 3762 individuals. We found no significant changes in global cognition with Mini-Mental State Examination at PO1. Hedges g revealed small to medium effect sizes at PO2, with individuals presenting a decrease in autobiographical memory, verbal fluency, and verbal memory. Verbal fluency problems showed an inverse correlation with age, with younger adults showing greater deficits. At PO3, there is an improvement on almost all cognitive domains, including verbal fluency and verbal memory. There is a lack of standardization in the choice of cognitive tests and optimal cognitive timing. The Mini-Mental State Examination is the most common screening test used in ECT, but its clinical utility is extremely limited to track post-ECT cognitive changes. Cognitive assessment for ECT purposes should include autobiographical memory, verbal fluency, and verbal memory.

KW  - Telepsychiatry
AB  - Purpose of Review We review recent findings on the use of telepsychiatry while investigating medical students' perceptions and willingness to use it for their mental health needs. We explore the impact of COVID-19 on medical school curriculums. We also investigate current education in medical schools surrounding telemedicine. Recent Findings Medical students experience symptoms of anxiety at a greater rate than the general population. Major barriers to help-seeking behaviors are the refusal to seek treatment due to fear of incurring negative views from supervising faculty, time constraints, and the cost of counseling services. Those who do use telemental health resources have positive views and believe that it is an effective tool. Medical students are willing to use telepsychiatry for their personal mental health needs and recognize its value as a treatment modality that will be useful for their future patients. The telemedicine field is evolving but many medical school curriculums do not include education on telemedicine.

AB  - The genesis of the concept of intersectionality was a call to dismantle interlocking systems of oppression - racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class-based - in order to realise liberation of Black women and other women of colour. Intersectionality holds the radical potential to amplify collective efficacy, community solidarity, and liberation. The extension of intersectionality into stigma research has resulted in an increased focus on intersectional stigma in quantitative research. This raises questions regarding how the radical and liberatory potential of intersectionality is applied in stigma research. Specifically, empowerment-based perspectives may be overlooked in quantitative intersectional stigma research. We conducted a scoping review to document if and how empowerment-based perspectives were included in intersectional stigma quantitative studies. We identified and included 32 studies in this review that examined varied stigmas, most commonly related to race, gender, HIV and sexual orientation. In total 13/32 (40.6%) of these studies reported on empowerment-based factors; most of these examined social support and/or resilience. Taken together, findings suggest that the quantitative intersectional stigma research field would benefit from expansion of concepts studied to include activism and solidarity, as well as methodological approaches to identify the protective roles of empowerment-based factors to inform health and social justice-related programmes and policy.

The quality of the selected studies was assessed with a critical assessment checklist for cross-sectional analytical and case-control studies, prepared by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data related to the publication were collected (author and year; city/country); methodological design; sample/population (gender; average age), outcome, measuring instrument and factors associated with suicidal behavior. A total of 14 studies were included in the systematic review, and factors associated with farmers' behavior in mental health (depression), seasonal impacts (drought), and work exposures (herbicides and insecticides) were identified. However, heterogeneity was found in terms of the method, measurement of suicidal behavior, and associated factors, which indicates the need for further studies.

AB  - The psycho-didactic approach in education is becoming more and more popular. Its supporters emphasize the great values that are associated with the implementation of this approach to various fields of science and school subjects. The greatest value of the psycho-didactic approach is supporting the personal growth of the learner by respecting the developmental factors involved in each subject's learning processes. Psycho-didactics could also be used in the design of core curricula and their implementation in the field of religious, ethical, and moral education. By supporting personal development through moral and religious education, it is possible to simultaneously influence the agencyof each learner. Personal agency in self-development, as well as in religious and moral development, is one of the greatest challenges for modern education and one of the most significant issues of positive mental health advancement in the field of education. Within psycho-didactics, it becomes possible to foster every student in an individual way, therefore all methods and techniques used in the psycho-didactic approach are focused on the student's needs.

AB  - The improvement of perinatal mental health formed part of WHO's Millennium Development Goals. Research suggests that the implementation of perinatal mental health care is variable. To ensure successful implementation, barriers and facilitators to implementing perinatal mental health services need to be identified. Therefore, we aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators to implementing assessment, care, referral, and treatment for perinatal mental health into health and social care services. In this systematic review, we searched CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO with no language restrictions for primary research articles published between database inception and Dec 11, 2019. Forward and backward searches of included studies were completed by March 31, 2020. Studies were eligible if they made statements about factors that either facilitated or impeded the implementation of perinatal mental health assessment, care, referral, or treatment. Partial (10%) dual screening was done. Data were extracted with EPPI-Reviewer 4 and analysed by use of a thematic synthesis. The protocol is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42019142854. Database searching identified 21 535 citations, of which 46 studies were included. Implementation occurred in a wide range of settings and was affected by individual (eg, an inability to attend treatment), health-care professional (eg, training), interpersonal (eg, trusting relationships), organisational (eg, clear referral pathways), political (eg, funding), and societal factors (eg, stigma and culture). A complex range of barriers and facilitators affect the implementation of perinatal mental health policy and practice. Perinatal mental health services should be flexible and women-centred, and delivered by well trained health-care professionals working within a structure that facilitates continuity of carer. Strategies that can be used to improve implementation include, but are not limited to, co-production of services, implementation team meetings, funding, and coalition building. Future research should focus on implementation barriers and facilitators dependent on illness severity, the healthcare setting, and inpatient care.

AB  - Objective To estimate the prevalence of burnout among primary health-care professionals in low- and middle-income countries and to Methods We systematically searched nine databases up to February 2022 to identify studies investigating burnout in primary healthcare professionals in low- and middle-income countries. There were no language limitations and we included observational studies. Two independent reviewers completed screening, study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate overall burnout prevalence as assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment. We narratively report factors associated with burnout. Findings The search returned 1568 articles. After selection, 60 studies from 20 countries were included in the narrative review and 31 were included in the meta-analysis. Three studies collected data during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic but provided limited evidence on the impact of the disease on burnout. The overall single-point prevalence of burnout ranged from 2.5% to 87.9% (43 studies). In the meta-analysis (31 studies), the pooled prevalence of a high level of emotional exhaustion was 28.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 21.5???33.5), a high level of depersonalization was 16.4% (95% CI: 10.1???22.9) and a high level of reduced personal accomplishment was Conclusion The substantial prevalence of burnout among primary health-care professionals in low- and middle-income countries has implications for patient safety, care quality and workforce planning. Further cross-sectional studies are needed to help identify evidencebased solutions, particularly in Africa and South-East Asia.

AB  - Objective: The present meta-analysis aimed to explore the cognitive and neural mechanism of social anxiety disorder (SAD) from a whole-brain view, and compare the differences in brain activations under different task paradigms. Methods: We searched Web of Science Core Collection and other databases with the keywords related to social anxiety, social phobia, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for comparing persons with SAD to healthy controls and used the activation likelihood estimation method. Thirty-seven papers met the inclusion criteria, including 15 with emotional faces as stimuli, 8 presenting specific situations as stimuli, and 14 using other types of tasks as stimuli. Among these papers, 654 participants were in the SAD group and 594 participants were in the control group with 335 activation increase points and 115 activation decrease points. Results: Whole-brain analysis showed that compared with healthy controls, persons with SAD showed significantly lower activation of the left anterior cingulate gyrus (MNI coordinate: x = -6, y = 22, z = 38; p 0.001). Sub-group analysis based on task indicated that when performing tasks with emotional faces as stimuli, persons with SAD showed significantly lower activation of the left cerebellar slope and fusiform gyrus (MNI coordinate: x = -26, y = -68, z = -12; p 0.001), and significantly higher activation of the right supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus, than healthy controls (MNI coordinate: x = 58, y = -52, z = 30; p 0.001). Conclusion: Individuals with social anxiety disorder show abnormal activation in the cingulate gyrus, which is responsible for the process of attention control, and task type can influence the activation pattern.

AB  - Mathematics is one of the core STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subject disciplines. Engaging students in learning mathematics helps retain students in STEM fields and thus contributes to the sustainable development of society. To increase student engagement, some mathematics instructors have redesigned their courses using the flipped classroom approach. In this review, we examined the results of comparative studies published between 2011 and 2020 to summarize the effects of this instructional approach (vs. traditional lecturing) on students' behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement with mathematics courses. Thirty-three articles in K-12 and higher education contexts were included for analysis. The results suggest that the use of the flipped classroom approach may increase some aspects of behavioral engagement (e.g., interaction and attention/participation), emotional engagement (e.g., course satisfaction), and cognitive engagement (e.g., understanding of mathematics). However, we discovered that several aspects (e.g., students' attendance, mathematics anxiety, and self-regulation) of student engagement have not been thoroughly explored and are worthy of further study. The results of this review have important implications for future flipped classroom practice (e.g., engaging students in solving real-world problems), and for research on student engagement (e.g., using more objective measures, such as classroom observation) in mathematics education.

This systematic review aims to identify instruments available for use as outcome measures in this field and assess the evidence for the most common instruments, specific to the forensic context, which cover multiple outcome domains. Methods Studies were identified by searching seven online databases. Additional searches were then performed for 10 selected instruments to identify additional information on their psychometric properties. Instrument manuals and gray literature was reviewed for information about instrument development and content validity. The quality of evidence for psychometric properties was summarized for each instrument based on the COnsensus-based Standards for health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) approach. Results A total of 435 different instruments or variants were identified. Psychometric information on the 10 selected instruments was extracted from 103 studies. All 10 instruments had a clinician reported component with only two having patient reported scales. Half of the instruments were primarily focused on risk. No instrument demonstrated adequate psychometric properties in all eight COSMIN categories assessed. Only one instrument, the Camberwell Assessment of Need: Forensic Version, had adequate evidence for its development and content validity. The most evidence was for construct validity, while none was identified for construct stability between groups. Conclusions Despite the large number of instruments potentially available, evidence for their use as outcome measures in forensic mental health services is limited. Future research and instrument development should involve patients and carers to ensure adequate content validity.

AB  - Visual attention and visual working memory (VWM) are two major cognitive functions in humans, and they have much in common. A growing body of research has investigated the effect of emotional information on visual attention and VWM. Interestingly, contradictory findings have supported both a negative bias and a positive bias toward emotional faces (e.g., angry faces or happy faces) in the attention and VWM fields. We found that the classical paradigms-that is, the visual search paradigm in attention and the change detection paradigm in VWM-are considerably similar. The settings of these paradigms could therefore be responsible for the contradictory results. In this paper, we compare previous controversial results from behavioral and neuroscience studies using these two paradigms. We suggest three possible contributing factors that have significant impacts on the contradictory conclusions regarding different emotional bias effects; these factors are stimulus choice, experimental setting, and cognitive process. We also propose new research directions and guidelines for future studies.

AB  - Although some studies have reported the potential efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the treatment of acute mania, there is no consensus on the matter. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of ECT combination with medication (ECT-combo) vs. medication alone (Med-alone) in the treatment of acute mania. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ECT-combo versus Med-alone in acute mania were searched in Chinese databases and English databases from their inceptions up to February 2020. Twelve RCTs (including 863 patients, n=863) met our criteria and were included into meta-analysis. The pooled results found that ECT-combo outperformed Med-alone in reducing manic symptoms from baseline to endpoint with a standardized mean difference of -3.50 (95% CI: -4.57, -2.44, p<0.00001). The significant difference occurred after 3-5 treatments or after a 1-week treatment. ECT-combo had significantly increased memory impairment compared to Med-alone. Apart from increased memory impairment in ECT-combo group (SMD=8.33; 95% CI: 2.73 to 25.45, p= 0.0002), no other statistically significant differences in side effects or drop-out rates were found between groups. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that ECT-combo was significantly superior to Med-alone in efficacy and well-tolerated as Med-alone in the acute treatment of mania. However, larger studies with randomized, double-blind design, and standardized treatment regimens are still warranted due to the high heterogeneity of studies included in the present meta-analysis.

AB  - Background: Many women with perimenopausal depression (PMD) have sought alternative therapies such as acupuncture because of concerns about risks associated with antidepressant and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This systematic review aimed to clarify if acupuncture is effective for PMD compared with waitlist control or placebo/sham acupuncture, and if acupuncture alone or combined with standard care (antidepressant and/or HRT) is more effective in ameliorating PMD in comparison with standard care alone.
   Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PMD treatment via acupuncture vs. waitlist control or placebo/sham acupuncture, and RCTs of PMD treatment via acupuncture alone or combined with Western pharmacotherapy vs. Western pharmacotherapy were searched for from seven databases from inception to December 2020. Cochrane criteria were followed.
   Results: Twenty-five studies involving 2,213 women were analyzed. Meta-analyses indicated that acupuncture significantly reduced the global scores of Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.54, 95% CI (-0.91, -0.16), p < 0.01], compared with standard care. The therapeutic effect of acupuncture maintained at 2-, 4-, and 12-week follow-ups. Acupuncture combined with standard care was more effective than standard care alone in decreasing HAMD scores [SMD = -0.82, 95% CI (-1.07, -0.58), p < 0.01]. Too few RCTs were available to assess the clinical efficacy differences between acupuncture and placebo/sham acupuncture or HRT alone. Acupuncture also showed better effects in decreasing Kupperman index (KI) scores, whether compared with antidepressant alone [MD = -4.55, 95% CI (-8.46, -0.65), p = 0.02] or antidepressant combined with HRT [MD = -0.89, 95% CI (-1.34, -0.43), p < 0.01].
   Conclusions: In comparison with standard care, acupuncture alone or combined with standard care was associated with significant improvements in PMD and reductions of other menopausal symptoms. This finding suggests that acupuncture may be a useful addition to treatment for PMD.

AB  - Objectives Polypharmacy is common in maintenance treatment of bipolar illness, but proof of greater efficacy compared to monotherapy is assumed rather than well known. We systematically reviewed the evidence from the literature to provide recommendations for clinical management and future research.
   Method A systematic review was conducted on the use of polypharmacy in bipolar prophylaxis. Relevant papers published in English through 31 December 2019 were identified searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library.
   Results Twelve studies matched inclusion criteria, including 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The best drug combination in prevention is represented by lithium + valproic acid which showed a significant effect on time to mood relapses (HR = 0.57) compared to valproic acid monotherapy, especially for manic episodes (HR = 0.51). The effect was significant in terms of time to new drug treatment (HR = 0.51) and time to hospitalization (HR = 0.57). A significant reduction in the frequency of mood relapses was also reported for lithium + valproic acid vs. lithium monotherapy (RR=0.12); however, the trial had a small sample size. Lamotrigine + valproic acid reported significant efficacy in prevention of depressive episodes compared to lamotrigine alone.
   Conclusions The literature to support a generally greater efficacy with polypharmacy in bipolar illness is scant and heterogeneous. Within that limited evidence base, the best drug combination in bipolar prevention is represented by lithium + valproic acid for manic, but not depressive episodes. Clinical practice should focus more on adequate monotherapy before considering polypharmacy.

AB  - Disability is a long-term physically or mentally, limiting condition that significantly impacts various life domains. It is associated with a trajectory of emotional adaptation that encompasses diverse internal and external processes. Though rare, psychoanalytic views on adaptation to and acceptance of disability have been proposed, with potential value for rehabilitation. Freud's relatively brief contributions to this field inspired later theorists to elaborate on his concepts and adjust them to address the phenomenology of disability. The majority of these theorists focused on ego and self formulations, while taking external reality into account. Psychopathology in disability was also addressed, as well as acceptance as a primary goal of adaptation. Authors have emphasized the uncertainty of acceptance, highlighting the importance of attunement to individual patient needs and suggesting that psychoanalytic formulation can help psychotherapists to better understand and treat individuals with disability. The meanings and implications of the various conceptualizations are integrated and illustrated through a case example.

AB  - Objective: Menopause is a normal physiological process experienced by women, but it is often accompanied by physical and emotional symptoms that may negatively affect quality of life. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on quality of life and menopausal symptoms by examining randomized controlled trials. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across six electronic databases to collect relevant articles published up to June 30, 2020. The articles' quality was assessed using the modified Jadad scale. We performed a metaanalysis with Review Manager 5.3, calculating 95% confidence intervals and standardized mean differences, and conducted sensitivity analyses. Results: The meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials included 475 participants. The results indicated that the mindfulness-based intervention groups showed significant improvements in total quality of life and vasomotor and physical quality of life, compared to control groups (standardized mean differences range: from -0.48 to -0.68, all ps < 0.05). After the sensitivity analyses, evidence of heterogeneity remained. Insufficient data prevented conducting a meta-analysis with the sexual subscale of MENQOL or on vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Conclusion: For menopausal women, mindfulness-based interventions may improve quality of life (except for psychological and sexual subscales). However, there is insufficient evidence to analyze whether such interventions can reduce vasomotor-related menopausal symptoms. Although heterogeneity should be carefully assessed, mindfulness-based interventions may be a novel approach for improving women's overall quality of life during menopause. However, further research is needed to verify these effects.

AB  - Background:
   Research on patients with chronic psychotic disorders in rural areas is scarce. Those patients may not receive adequate mental health care. Mental health disparities among rural and urban areas have been recognized.
   Aims:
   This review aims to present the most recent research on psychotic disorders in rural areas.
   Method:
   We conducted a search in the PubMed and Scopus databases. The search involved articles published over the last decade (2011-2020). All types of research design were included, if studies had used a controlled group of urban patients and reported on the differences among rural/urban residents with psychotic disorders. The focus of the review was on outcome and treatment.
   Results:
   A total of 12 studies were included in this review. Most have been conducted in China or India. Reports from Western countries are rare. Outcome studies showed that employment rates are significantly higher in rural patients, as well as rates of marriage in women. It is not clear what is the impact of those outcomes on patients' lives. The finding of lower cost of psychotic disorders in some rural areas, should be viewed with scepticism. Studies on treatment aspects suggested that rural patients were less likely to receive antipsychotics, antipsychotic combination or clozapine. Those results were attributed to limited access to specialized treatment. When rural patients receive specialized community care they seem to have better outcomes than urban patients.
   Conclusion:
   There is an ongoing, but still scarce research on patients with chronic psychotic disorders in rural areas. Researchers pointed out the impact of socioeconomic inequalities on outcome and treatment, and stressed the importance of minimizing mental health disparities. These findings may have potential implications for future research; for the introduction of accessible, locally based mental health services in rural areas; and for political initiatives that would address poverty and social inequalities.

AB  - Deficits in social processing (SP) have been proposed to underpin interpersonal dysfunction in both Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Substance Use Disorders (SUD). This study aimed to explore potential transdiagnostic cognitive and behavioral phenotypes of these disorders utilizing the NIMH Research Domain Criteria 'Systems for Social Processes'. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the published research was conducted on 134 studies identified through our database searches. Four meta-analyses were conducted, which revealed significant overlapping deficits in the ability to identify facial emotions and infer the mental states of others in both BPD and SUD. Further, people with BPD displayed a higher ostracism effect following perceived social exclusion. Systematically reviewed studies also revealed significant dysfunction amongst individuals with BPD and SUD across both self and other SP constructs, which were broadly similar in magnitude. Taken together, these results support the proposition that SP dysfunction may be considered a core transdiagnostic phenotype of BPD and SUD.

AB  - This study attempted to synthesize the evidence on the prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms among myocardial infarction (MI) patients to offer a reliable and accurate estimate on the number of MI patients suffering from moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Comprehensive electronic searches (PubMed, Embase and Web of Science) were performed from their inception to February 2021. Between-study heterogeneity was analyzed using the Cochran's Q test and I-2 statistic, and if it was high across the eligible studies, meta-regression and subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the source of heterogeneity. Publication bias and the robustness of the pooled results were also examined. A total of 18 eligible studies covering 8,532 MI patients were included, of which 3,443 were identified with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Between-study heterogeneity was high (I-2 =98.8%) with the reported prevalence ranging from 9.6% to 69.17%, and the pooled prevalence was 38.08% (95% confidence interval: 28.82-47.81%) by a random-effects model. Meta-regression analyses indicated that publication year (beta=-0.014) was significant moderators contributing 16.11% to the heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses indicated that studies using the anxiety subscale of Brief Symptom Inventory to assess anxiety were homogenous (I-2=0.0). Furthermore, the pooled prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms varied significantly by geographic region, instrument used to assess anxiety, methodological quality, sex, education level, a history of previous MI and hypercholesterolemia. Additionally, the results of Egger's linear test (t = -0.630) and Begg's rank test (z = -0.190) indicated no evidence of publication bias, and the sensitivity of the pooled results was low. Nearly two fifth of MI patients suffered from moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, which emphasizes the importance of early identification of anxiety symptoms after MI, as well as the need of implementing psychological interventions for those with elevated anxiety symptoms.

KW  - CARE
AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health-care systems and potentially on pregnancy outcomes, but no systematic synthesis of evidence of this effect has been undertaken. We aimed to assess the collective evidence on the effects on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of the pandemic.
   Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effects of the pandemic on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, from Jan 1, 2020, to Jan 8, 2021, for case-control studies, cohort studies, and brief reports comparing maternal and perinatal mortality, maternal morbidity, pregnancy complications, and intrapartum and neonatal outcomes before and during the pandemic. We also planned to record any additional maternal and offspring outcomes identified. Studies of solely SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant individuals, as well as case reports, studies without comparison groups, narrative or systematic literature reviews, preprints, and studies reporting on overlapping populations were excluded. Quantitative meta-analysis was done for an outcome when more than one study presented relevant data. Random-effects estimate of the pooled odds ratio (OR) of each outcome were generated with use of the Mantel-Haenszel method. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020211753).
   Findings The search identified 3592 citations, of which 40 studies were included. We identified significant increases in stillbirth (pooled OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.07-1.54]; I-2=63%; 12 studies, 168 295 pregnancies during and 198 993 before the pandemic) and maternal death (1.37 [1.22-1.53; I-2 = 0%, two studies [both from low-income and middle-income countries], 1 237 018 and 2 224 859 pregnancies) during versus before the pandemic. Preterm births before 37 weeks' gestation were not significantly changed overall (0.94 [0.87-1.02]; I (2)=75%; 15 studies, 170 640 and 656 423 pregnancies) but were decreased in high-income countries (0.91 [0.84-0.99]; I-2=63%; 12 studies, 159 987 and 635 118 pregnancies), where spontaneous preterm birth was also decreased (0.81 [0.67-0.97]; two studies, 4204 and 6818 pregnancies). Mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were higher, indicating poorer mental health, during versus before the pandemic (pooled mean difference 0.42 [95% CI 002-0.8.1; three studies, 2330 and 6517 pregnancies). Surgically managed ectopic pregnancies were increased during the pandemic (OR 5.81 [2.16-15.6]; I-2=26%; three studies, 37 and 272 pregnancies). No overall significant effects were identified for other outcomes included in the quantitative analysis: maternal gestational diabetes; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; preterm birth before 34 weeks', 32 weeks', or 28 weeks' gestation; iatrogenic preterm birth; labour induction; modes of delivery (spontaneous vaginal delivery, caesarean section, or instrumental delivery); postpartum haemorrhage; neonatal death; low birthweight (<2500 g); neonatal intensive care unit admission; or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 min.
   Interpretation Global maternal and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in maternal deaths, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression. Some outcomes show considerable disparity between high-resource and low-resource settings. There is an urgent need to prioritise safe, accessible, and equitable maternity care within the strategic response to this pandemic and in future health crises. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Problem identification Dissociation is a common presentation of trauma, distinguishable from classic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. While pre-cancer and cancer-related traumatic experiences are prevalent among cancer-affected individuals, the specific impact of traumatic dissociation is unclear. Literature search This scoping review includes a search of English articles published between 1980 and 2019 referencing dissociation in the context of cancer-affected adults. Data evaluation/synthesis Articles assessed how dissociation was addressed in relation to pre-cancer and cancer-related trauma exposure and treatment. Out of 1,265 articles, 71 met inclusion criteria, and 15 underwent a full review. Two studies addressed dissociation related to pre-cancer trauma, nine in regard to cancer-related trauma only, and four in relation to both trauma types. No studies included experimental designs or described interventions. Conclusions Despite high rates of trauma exposure among cancer-affected adults, limited studies specifically address the impact of dissociation. Further inquiry on this topic is needed, especially on treatment implications.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD), an age-related progressive neurodegenerative condition, is associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which results in motor deficits characterized by the following: akinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability, as well as nonmotor symptoms such as emotional changes, particularly depression, cognitive impairment, gastrointestinal, and autonomic dysfunction. The most common treatment for PD is focused on dopamine (DA) replacement (e.g., levodopa = L-Dopa), which unfortunately losses its efficacy over months or years and can induce severe dyskinesia. Hence, more efficacious interventions without such adverse effects are urgently needed. In this review, following a general description of PD, potential novel therapeutic interventions for this devastating disease are examined. Specifically, the focus is on nicotine and nicotinic cholinergic system, as well as butyrate, a short chain fatty acid (SCFA), and fatty acid receptors.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of a single session of mindful exercise on anxiety and examine whether effects varied according to participant characteristics, mindful exercise exposure, or research design features. Methods: Consistent with PRISMA guidelines for conduct and reporting, we identified randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) that: (1) sampled healthy or unhealthy participants, (2) used a single session of yoga, Tai chi, or Qigong practice, and (3) assessed self-reported anxiety outcomes. Databases searched included Google Scholar, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, from which 18 yoga, 5 Tai chi, and 4 Qigong articles were published before August 31, 2020. Studies involved 2341 participants (1904 in yoga studies, 232 in Tai chi studies, 205 in Qigong studies) were selected. Hedges d effect sizes were calculated. Random effect models and multilevel meta-analysis were used to estimate the pooled effects. I2 tests were applied to assess the heterogeneity. In yoga studies, moderating effects were tested by multilevel meta-regression analysis of putative moderators representing participant characteristics, features of mindful exercise exposure, and aspects of research design. Because of the limited number of Tai chi and Qigong studies, sensitivity analyses were conducted by omitting potential outlying effects and evaluating the overall pooled effect. Study quality was judged using the PEDro scale. Results: A single session of yoga reduced anxiety by a heterogeneous (I-2 = 82.7%) standardized mean effect size 0.32 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.48, t = 4.108, p = 0.0002). In the multilevel univariate regression model, reductions were larger in participants who had previous yoga experience, or practiced Hatha yoga, or engaged in higher intensity yoga. Larger effects were also found when yoga was compared to no treatment or minimal treatment control than when yoga was compared to non-yoga exercise and when anxiety was measured 0-10 min immediately after yoga. In the multilevel multiple regression model, the effects remained larger for yoga history and yoga versus no treatment or minimal treatment control compared to yoga versus non-yoga exercise. Meta regression analysis did not suggest other significant (p > 0.05) moderating effects on anxiety outcomes. The low heterogeneous (I-2 = 10%) mean effect of a single session of Tai chi on anxiety was-0.06 (95% Cl,-0.38 to 0.24, t =-0.37, p = 0.68). The homogeneous (I-2 = 0%) mean effect of a single session of Qigong on anxiety was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.18, t = 4.06, p = 0.02). Conclusion: A single session of yoga may have small-to-moderate efficacy for the management of anxiety, but the limited number of studies for Tai chi and Qigong studies makes it premature to conclude their practical effectiveness. In addition, the overall quality of the included studies was relatively low. Cautions should be taken when applying a single session of mindful exercise to reduce anxiety in practice. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to mitigate methodological bias typically found in the retrieved studies.

AB  - Background and Purpose Cognitive decline is an important contributor to disability in patients with chronic heart failure, affecting 25%-50% of patients. The aim of this review is to stress the importance of understanding pathophysiological mechanisms of heart failure involved in cognitive decline.
   Methods An extensive PubMed search was conducted for the literature on the basic mechanisms of cerebral blood flow regulation, the effect of cardiac dysfunction on cerebral blood flow, and possible mechanisms underlying the association between cardiac dysfunction and cognitive decline.
   Results Published literature supports the thesis that cardiac dysfunction leads to cerebral blood flow impairment and predisposes to cognitive decline. One of the postulated mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in chronic heart failure is chronic regional hypoperfusion of critical brain areas. Cognitive function may be further compromised by microvascular damage due to cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, it is implied that cerebral blood flow assessment could enable early recognition of patients at risk and help guide appropriate therapeutic strategies.
   Conclusion Interdisciplinary knowledge in the fields of neurology and cardiology is essential to clarify heart and brain interconnections in chronic heart failure. Understanding and identifying the basic neuropathophysiological changes in chronic heart failure could help with developing methods for early recognition of patients at risk, followed by institution of therapeutic actions to prevent or decrease cognitive decline.

AB  - Background: Benzodiazepines have been widely used in clinical practice for over four decades and continue to be one of the most consumed and highly prescribed class of drugs available in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The literature indicates that Benzodiazepine users at a significantly increased risk of Motor Vehicle accidents compared to non-users but the impact on injuries at workplace is not well-defined. We aimed to investigate whether use of benzodiazepine is associated with increased risk of occupational injuries (OI).
   Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) among case controls, cross-sectional studies, either questionnaire or laboratory exams based.
   Results: A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria, involving 324,168 OI from seven different countries, with an estimated occurrence of benzodiazepine positivity of 2.71% (95% CI 1.45-4.98). A total of 14 estimates were retrieved. Of them, 10 were based on laboratory analyses, three on institutional databases, while one study was based on questionnaires. Regarding the occupational groups, three estimates focused on commercial drivers (0.73%, 95% CI 0.12-4.30), that exhibited a reduced risk ratio for benzodiazepine positivity compared to other occupational groups (RR 0.109, 95% CI 0.063-0.187). Eventually, no increased risk for benzodiazepine positivity was identified, either from case control studies (OR 1.520, 95% CI 0.801-2.885, I-2 76%), or cross sectional studies, when only laboratory based estimates were taken in account (OR 0.590, 95% CI 0.253-1.377, I-2 63%).
   Conclusions: Even though benzodiazepines have the potential to increase injury rates among casual and chronic users, available evidence are insufficient to sustain this hypothesis, particularly when focusing on laboratory-based studies (i.e., studies the characterized the benzodiazepine immediately before the event).

AB  - The anesthetic drug ketamine has been successfully repurposed as an antidepressant in human subjects. This represents a breakthrough for clinical psychopharmacology, because unlike monoaminergic antidepressants, ketamine has rapid onset, including in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) that is resistant to conventional pharmacotherapy. This rapid therapeutic onset suggests a unique mechanism of action, which continues to be investigated in reverse translational studies in rodents. A large fraction of rodent and human studies of ketamine have focused on the effects of only a single administration of ketamine, which presents a problem because MDD is typically a persistent illness that may require ongoing treatment with this drug to prevent relapse. Here we review behavioral studies in rodents that used repeated dosing of ketamine in the forced swim test (FST), with an eye toward eventual mechanistic studies. A subset of these studies carried out additional experiments with only a single injection of ketamine for comparison, and several studies used chronic psychosocial stress, where stress is a known causative factor in some cases of MDD. We find that repeated ketamine can in some cases paradoxically produce increases in immobility in the FST, especially at high doses such as 50 or 100 mg/kg. Several studies however provide evidence that repeated dosing is more effective than a single dose at decreasing immobility, including behavioral effects that last longer. Collectively, this growing literature suggests that repeated dosing of ketamine has prominent depression-related effects in rodents, and further investigation may help optimize the use of this drug in humans experiencing MDD.

AB  - Background Mental health problems in Malaysia are on a rise. This study aimed at performing a systematic review of mental health literacy (MHL) in Malaysia.
   Methods Medline, Embase, ERIC/Proquest, ScienceDirect, Pubmed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Emcare and reference lists of included studies were searched in February 2020. Studies that evaluated at least one of the main components of MHL, including (1) knowledge related to mental health issues, and (2) stigma, were included irrespective of study design. As secondary findings, the review also synthesized results related to facilitators and barriers to seeking mental health services. Depending on the research design, the quality of each study was assessed through checklists.
   Results Forty six studies published between 1995 to 2019 were included. Most studies used cross-sectional designs to investigate MHL. Findings indicate that most Malaysians have stigmatizing attitudes towards mental health problems. Participants in the included studies endorsed multifactorial explanations of mental health issues with a dominance of supernatural and religious aetiologies. Likewise, the commonest barrier was considering sources other than professional sources of mental-health services. Presence of adequate knowledge and considering providers as competent facilitated help-seeking. Additionally, there was considerable heterogeneity in studies and a lack of standardized measures assessing MHL.
   Conclusions There is an increase in studies on MHL in Malaysia. A few of these studies, based on experimental design, have shown positive effects. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers should develop standardized measures and interventional studies based on all the components of MHL.

AB  - Aims:
   The prevalence of perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms have been speculated to increase during an infectious disease outbreak but remains unknown in the context of the COVID-19 situation. Therefore, this review aimed to examine the prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms among pregnant women and postpartum mothers during the COVID-19 period.
   Methods:
   Six electronic databases were systematically searched for articles from November 2019 to December 2020. Twenty-six observational studies and brief reports were included in the meta-analysis.
   Results:
   Overall, the prevalence of anxiety was greater than depression in both antenatal and postnatal periods, and the prevalence of depression was higher in the antenatal period than the postnatal period. The pooled prevalence for antenatal anxiety symptoms, antenatal depressive symptoms and postnatal depressive symptoms were 40% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.27-0.52), 27% (95% CI: 0.20-0.33) and 17% (95% CI: 0.10-0.24), respectively. Europe (56%, 95% CI: 0.28-0.85) had significantly higher prevalence of antenatal anxiety than Asia (16%, 95% CI: 0.09-0.23).
   Conclusions:
   The heightened prevalence of perinatal psychological disorders served as an impetus for healthcare professionals and policy makers to ramp up their support and mitigation strategies for pregnant women and mothers in times of health crisis.

   Methods: In March 2020, we searched 5 databases for literature exploring the psychological consequences of the crisis. Main findings were extracted.
   Results: 132 citations were screened and 11 included in the review. Results suggest a negative psychological effect caused by the water crisis, including anxiety and health worries, exacerbated by lowered trust in public health officials, uncertainty about the long-term impacts of the crisis, financial hardships, stigma, and difficulties seeking help. There was evidence that concerns about tap water continued even after the state of emergency was lifted.
   Conclusions: With a possible compound effect to residents of Flint with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the results highlight the need for more resources for psychological health interventions in Flint as well as a need for local governments and health authorities to regain the trust of those affected by the Flint Water Crisis.

AB  - Background Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is a method for identifying the configurations of conditions that lead to specific outcomes. Given its potential for providing evidence of causality in complex systems, QCA is increasingly used in evaluative research to examine the uptake or impacts of public health interventions. We map this emerging field, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of QCA approaches identified in published studies, and identify implications for future research and reporting. Methods PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched for peer-reviewed studies published in English up to December 2019 that had used QCA methods to identify the conditions associated with the uptake and/or effectiveness of interventions for public health. Data relating to the interventions studied (settings/level of intervention/populations), methods (type of QCA, case level, source of data, other methods used) and reported strengths and weaknesses of QCA were extracted and synthesised narratively. Results The search identified 1384 papers, of which 27 (describing 26 studies) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions evaluated ranged across: nutrition/obesity (n = 8); physical activity (n = 4); health inequalities (n = 3); mental health (n = 2); community engagement (n = 3); chronic condition management (n = 3); vaccine adoption or implementation (n = 2); programme implementation (n = 3); breastfeeding (n = 2), and general population health (n = 1). The majority of studies (n = 24) were of interventions solely or predominantly in high income countries. Key strengths reported were that QCA provides a method for addressing causal complexity; and that it provides a systematic approach for understanding the mechanisms at work in implementation across contexts. Weaknesses reported related to data availability limitations, especially on ineffective interventions. The majority of papers demonstrated good knowledge of cases, and justification of case selection, but other criteria of methodological quality were less comprehensively met. Conclusion QCA is a promising approach for addressing the role of context in complex interventions, and for identifying causal configurations of conditions that predict implementation and/or outcomes when there is sufficiently detailed understanding of a series of comparable cases. As the use of QCA in evaluative health research increases, there may be a need to develop advice for public health researchers and journals on minimum criteria for quality and reporting.

AB  - Background: Suicide is a recognized public health issue, with approximately 800,000 people dying by suicide each year. Among the different technologies used in suicide research, closed-circuit television (CCTV) and video have been used for a wide array of applications, including assessing crisis behaviors at metro stations, and using computer vision to identify a suicide attempt in progress. However, there has been no review of suicide research and interventions using CCTV and video.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to review the literature to understand how CCTV and video data have been used in understanding and preventing suicide. Furthermore, to more fully capture progress in the field, we report on an ongoing study to respond to an identified gap in the narrative review, by using a computer vision-based system to identify behaviors prior to a suicide attempt.
   Methods: We conducted a search using the keywords "suicide," "cctv," and "video" on PubMed, Inspec, and Web of Science. We included any studies which used CCTV or video footage to understand or prevent suicide. If a study fell into our area of interest, we included it regardless of the quality as our goal was to understand the scope of how CCTV and video had been used rather than quantify any specific effect size, but we noted the shortcomings in their design and analyses when discussing the studies.
   Results: The review found that CCTV and video have primarily been used in 3 ways: (1) to identify risk factors for suicide (eg, inferring depression from facial expressions), (2) understanding suicide after an attempt (eg, forensic applications), and (3) as part of an intervention (eg, using computer vision and automated systems to identify if a suicide attempt is in progress). Furthermore, work in progress demonstrates how we can identify behaviors prior to an attempt at a hotspot, an important gap identified by papers in the literature.
   Conclusions: Thus far, CCTV and video have been used in a wide array of applications, most notably in designing automated detection systems, with the field heading toward an automated detection system for early intervention. Despite many challenges, we show promising progress in developing an automated detection system for preattempt behaviors, which may allow for early intervention.

AB  - Objective: To appraise the methodological quality of studies on the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities for children presenting with gender dysphoria, including diagnosis and management. Study design: A systematic review of 15 articles on psychiatric comorbidities for children diagnosed with gender dysphoria between the ages of two - 12 years. Data sources: A systematic literature search of Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science for English-only studies published from 1980 to 2019, supplemented by other sources. Of 736 studies, 721 were removed following title, abstract or full-text review. Results: Ten studies were retrospectively-oriented clinical case series or observational studies. There were few randomised, controlled trials. Over 80% of the data came from gender clinics in the United States and the Netherlands. Funding or conflicts of interest were often not declared. Mood and anxiety disorders were the most common psychiatric conditions studied. There was little research on complex comorbidities. One quarter of studies made a diagnosis by a comprehensive psychological assessment. A wide range of psychological tests was used for screening or diagnostic purposes. Over half of the studies diagnosed gender dysphoria using evidence-based criteria. A quarter of the studies mentioned treating serious psychopathology prior to addressing gender dysphoria. What is already known about this topic:
   Children with gender dysphoria are likely to experience profound psychological and physical difficulties. Gender clinics around the world have different ways of assessing and treating children with gender dysphoria. Children often rely on caregivers and health professionals to make treatment decisions on their behalf. What this topic adds:
   Children with gender dysphoria often experience a range of psychiatric comorbidities, with a high prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders, trauma, eating disorders and autism spectrum conditions, suicidality and self-harm. It is vitally important to consider psychiatric comorbidities when prioritising and sequencing treatments for children with gender dysphoria. The development of international treatment guidelines would provide greater consistency across diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management.

AB  - The ability to recognize and express emotions from facial expressions are essential for successful social interactions. Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) and Facial Emotion Expressions (FEEs), both of which seem to be impaired in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and contribute to socio-communicative difficulties, participate in the diagnostic criteria for ASD. Only a few studies have focused on FEEs processing and the rare behavioral studies of FEEs in ASD have yielded mixed results. Here, we review studies comparing the production of FEEs between participants with ASD and non-ASD control subjects, with a particular focus on the use of automatic facial expression analysis software. A systematic literature search in accordance with the PRISMA statement identified 20 reports published up to August 2020 concerning the use of new technologies to evaluate both spontaneous and voluntary FEEs in participants with ASD. Overall, the results highlight the importance of considering socio-demographic factors and psychiatric co-morbidities which may explain the previous inconsistent findings, particularly regarding quantitative data on spontaneous facial expressions. There is also reported evidence for an inadequacy of FEEs in individuals with ASD in relation to expected emotion, with a lower quality and coordination of facial muscular movements. Spatial and kinematic approaches to characterizing the synchrony, symmetry and complexity of facial muscle movements thus offer clues to identifying and exploring promising new diagnostic targets. These findings have allowed hypothesizing that there may be mismatches between mental representations and the production of FEEs themselves in ASD. Such considerations are in line with the Facial Feedback Hypothesis deficit in ASD as part of the Broken Mirror Theory, with the results suggesting impairments of neural sensory-motor systems involved in processing emotional information and ensuring embodied representations of emotions, which are the basis of human empathy. In conclusion, new technologies are promising tools for evaluating the production of FEEs in individuals with ASD, and controlled studies involving larger samples of patients and where possible confounding factors are considered, should be conducted in order to better understand and counter the difficulties in global emotional processing in ASD.

AB  - Background: Digital data sources have become ubiquitous in modern culture in the era of digital technology but often tend to be under-researched because of restricted access to data sources due to fragmentation, privacy issues, or industry ownership, and the methodological complexity of demonstrating their measurable impact on human health. Even though new big data sources have shown unprecedented potential for disease diagnosis and outbreak detection, we need to investigate results in the existing literature to gain a comprehensive understanding of their impact on and benefits to human health.
   Objective: A systematic review of systematic reviews on identifying digital data sources and their impact area on people's health, including challenges, opportunities, and good practices.
   Methods: A multidatabase search was performed. Peer-reviewed papers published between January 2010 and November 2020 relevant to digital data sources on health were extracted, assessed, and reviewed.
   Results: The 64 reviews are covered by three domains, that is, universal health coverage (UHC), public health emergencies, and healthier populations, defined in WHO's General Programme of Work, 2019-2023, and the European Programme of Work, 2020-2025. In all three categories, social media platforms are the most popular digital data source, accounting for 47% (N = 8), 84% (N = 11), and 76% (N = 26) of studies, respectively. The second most utilized data source are electronic health records (EHRs) (N = 13), followed by websites (N = 7) and mass media (N = 5). In all three categories, the most studied impact of digital data sources is on prevention, management, and intervention of diseases (N = 40), and as a tool, there are also many studies (N = 10) on early warning systems for infectious diseases. However, they could also pose health hazards (N = 13), for instance, by exacerbating mental health issues and promoting smoking and drinking behavior among young people.
   Conclusions: The digital data sources presented are essential for collecting and mining information about human health. The key impact of social media, electronic health records, and websites is in the area of infectious diseases and early warning systems, and in the area of personal health, that is, on mental health and smoking and drinking prevention. However, further research is required to address privacy, trust, transparency, and interoperability to leverage the potential of data held in multiple datastores and systems. This study also identified the apparent gap in systematic reviews investigating the novel big data streams, Internet of Things (IoT) data streams, and sensor, mobile, and GPS data researched using artificial intelligence, complex network, and other computer science methods, as in this domain systematic reviews are not common.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery offers a unique opportunity to record local field potentials (LFPs), the electrophysiological population activity of neurons surrounding the depth electrode in the target area. With direct access to the subcortical activity, LFP research has provided valuable insight into disease mechanisms and cognitive processes and inspired the advent of adaptive DBS for Parkinson's disease (PD). A frequency-based framework is usually employed to interpret the implications of LFP signatures in LFP studies on PD. This approach standardizes the methodology, simplifies the interpretation of LFP patterns, and makes the results comparable across studies. Importantly, previous works have found that activity patterns do not represent disease-specific activity but rather symptom-specific or task-specific neuronal signatures that relate to the current motor, cognitive or emotional state of the patient and the underlying disease. In the present review, we aim to highlight distinguishing features of frequency-specific activities, mainly within the motor domain, recorded from DBS electrodes in patients with PD. Associations of the commonly reported frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high-frequency oscillations) to motor signs are discussed with respect to band-related phenomena such as individual tremor and high/low beta frequency activity, as well as dynamic transients of beta bursts. We provide an overview on how electrophysiology research in DBS patients has revealed and will continuously reveal new information about pathophysiology, symptoms, and behavior, e.g., when combining deep LFP and surface electrocorticography recordings.

AB  - Background: Cell cycle is critical for a wide range of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in dividing cells. Neurons are postmitotic cells which have withdrawn from the cell division cycle. Recent data show us that inappropriate activation of cell cycle regulators including cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and endogenous cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) may take part in the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms for cell cycle reentry in neurodegenerative disease remain unclear.Methods: Electronic databases such as Pubmed, Science Direct, Directory of Open Access Journals, PLOS were searched for relevant articles.Conclusion: The present work reviews basic aspects of cell cycle mechanism, as well as the evidence showing the expression of cell cycle proteins in neurodegenerative disease. We provide a brief summary of these findings and hope to highlight the interaction between the cell cycle reentry and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we outline the possible signaling pathways. However more understanding of the mechanism of cell cycle is of great importance. Because these represents an alternative target for therapeutic interventions, leading to novel treatments of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The groundwater of the quaternary aquifer of Lushnja is the primary source of the public drinking water supply for the population and it is often use even for irrigation in the Lushnja district. Groundwater plays an important role in the supply of drinking water, functioning of ecosystems and the well-being of people. The study area is situated on the Peri-Adriatic Depression and is underlain by gravel deposits of Quaternary age. The Lushnja aquifer is characterized by alluvial deposits of Holocene lithologically represented by alevrites, sand, and gravel. It spreads almost all over the plain part of the Lushnja district from the Shkumbin River to the north, up to the Seman River to the south, and in the Fier-Shegan sector is connected to Berat's plain. The climate of the Lushnja area is characterized by Mediterranean subtropical sub area climate marked by short warm winters and long hot dry summer seasons. A total of 31 samples were collected in spring 2011. There were measured the concentration of major cations {(Na(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+) and K(+)}, major anions {CI(-), SO4 (2-) and HCO3 (-)b electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids. The results of the hydrochemical analysis reveal that the order of cations dominance was Mg2+ >C2+ >(Na++K) for the cations and (HCO3- + CO32-) > CI- for the anions. Further analysis shows that the main type of water of the groundwaters present in the Lushnja is (Mg2++Ca2+)-HCO3.

AB  - Given the negative impact of adverse events on the wellbeing of healthcare providers, easy access to psychological support is crucial. We aimed to describe the types of support resources available in healthcare organizations, their benefits for second victims, peer supporters' experiences, and implementation challenges. We also explored how these resources incorporate aspects of Safety I and Safety II. We searched six databases up to 19 December 2019 and additional literature, including weekly search alerts until 21 January 2021. Two reviewers independently performed all methodological steps (search, selection, quality assessment, data extraction, formal narrative synthesis). The 16 included studies described 12 second victim support resources, implemented between 2006 and 2017. Preliminary data indicated beneficial effects not only for the affected staff but also for the peer responders who considered their role to be challenging but gratifying. Challenges during program implementation included persistent blame culture, limited awareness of program availability, and lack of financial resources. Common goals of the support programs (e.g., fostering coping strategies, promoting individual resilience) are consistent with Safety II and may promote system resilience. Investing in second victim support structures should be a top priority for healthcare institutions adopting a systemic approach to safety and striving for just culture.

AB  - Despite the lack of a universally accepted definition, the concept of self-care has been long recognized in the health care literature (e.g., nursing, behavioral medicine), and research findings have established a foundation to support the importance of self-care in optimizing health and well-being in patients. In recent decades, more attention has been paid to self-care in health service professionals (Wise, Hersh, & Gibson, 2012), and emerging evidence has supported the benefits of self-care in facilitating psychology graduate trainees' professional gains and well-being (Colman et al., 2016). To facilitate more empirical research in this area, the current systematic review was conducted to summarize the current availability of self-care measures among health care professionals and trainees (e.g., psychologists, social workers, and nurses) and assess their psychometric properties and clinical utilities. An electronic search was performed for self-care measures in 3 databases (i.e., PsycINFO, CINAHL, and PudMed). Eight articles published from 2013 to 2019 met the inclusion criteria, and 10 measures assessing self-care among mental health care professionals were identified. The key features of these measures are summarized. Although all the scales have some psychometric support, only a few had adequate support that was demonstrated through high-quality empirical studies. Recommendations are provided for future use of the self-care measures, especially for psychologists, psychology trainees, and social or child welfare workers. Research gaps and future directions of self-care measurement studies to promote self-care practice among mental/health care professionals and trainees are also discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to carry out a systematic review of controlled clinical trials in order to identify both specific populations and social issues which may benefit from the effective use of psychodrama psychotherapy. A search was conducted in the WoS, SCOPUS, PsychINFO, Medline, Academic Search Ultimate, ProQuest, and PubPsych databases, complemented by a manual search on relevant websites and in the reference lists of the selected studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of group-based psychodrama psychotherapy were included. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool was adopted to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The search identified 14 RCTs and one quasi-RCT evaluating the effects of group-based psychodrama psychotherapy. The total number of participants in the studies was 642 people. Seven studies were conducted in Turkey, two in the USA, two in Finland, one in Canada, one in Brazil, one in Italy, and one in Iran. The heterogeneity of the issues analyzed indicates that psychodrama improves the symptoms associated with a wide range of problems. Despite psychodrama's long history, most clinical trials in this field have been published this century, which suggests not only that this psychotherapeutic practice remains relevant today but also that it continues to attract substantial interest among the scientific community. Nevertheless, further research efforts are required to understand its potential benefits for psychosocial well-being.

AB  - The aim of the present systematic review was to assess and provide an up-to-date analysis of the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children and adolescents. Thus, an electronic search of the literature, in two well-known databases (PubMed and Web of Science), was performed until February 2021 (without date restriction). PRISMA guideline methodology was employed and data regarding the HRQoL were extracted from eligible studies. Articles were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (a) children and/or adolescent population (4 to 19 years old); (b) HRQoL as a main assessment; (c) German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English language; and (d) pre-pandemic and during pandemic HRQoL data. Following the initial search, 241 possible related articles were identified. A total of 79 articles were identified as duplicates. Moreover, 129 articles were removed after reading the title and abstract. Of the remaining 33 articles, 27 were removed since they were not focused on children or adolescents (n = 19), articles did not report pre- and post- pandemic HRQoL values (n = 6), articles were not focused on HRQoL (n = 6), and one article was an editorial. Finally, six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and, therefore, were included in the systematic review. A total of 3177 children and/or adolescents during COVID-19 were included in this systematic review. Three articles showed that COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the HRQoL of children and adolescents, and another did not report comparison between pre- and during COVID-19 pandemic, although a reduction in the HRQoL can be observed. Nevertheless, two articles did not find significant changes and another one did not report p-values. Regarding sex differences, only two studies analyzed this topic, observing no differences between girls and boys in the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HRQoL. Taking into account these results, this systematic review might confirm that COVID-19 has a negative impact on the HRQoL of children and/or adolescents.

AB  - Inhibitory control deficit and impulsivity and compulsivity behaviours are present in different psychopathological disorders such as addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorders and schizophrenia, among others. Social relationships in humans and animals are governed by social organization rules, which modulate inhibitory control and coping strategies against stress. Social stress is associated with compulsive alcohol and drug use, pointing towards a determining factor in an increased vulnerability to inhibitory control deficit. The goal of the present review is to assess the implication of social stress and dominance on the vulnerability to develop impulsive and/or compulsive spectrum disorders, with the aid of the information provided by animal models. A systematic search strategy was carried out on the PubMed and Web of Science databases, and the most relevant information was structured in the text and tables. A total of 34 studies were recruited in the qualitative synthesis. The results show the role of social stress and dominance in increased drug and alcohol use, aggressive and impulsive behaviour. Moreover, the revised studies support the role of Dopaminergic (DA) activity and the alterations in the dopaminergic D1/D2 receptors as key factors in the development of inhibitory control deficit by social stress.

AB  - Study Objective. Suicide is a serious health problem that is shaped by a variety of social and mental health factors. A growing body of research connects the arts to positive health outcomes; however, no previous systematic reviews have examined the use of the arts in suicide prevention and survivorship. This review examined how the arts have been used to address suicide prevention and survivorship in nonclinical settings in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Design and Setting. Ten bibliographic databases, five research repositories, and reference sections of articles were searched to identify published studies. Articles presenting outcomes of interventions conducted between 2014 and 2019 and written in English, were included. Primary Results. Nine studies met inclusion criteria, including qualitative, quantitative randomized controlled trials, quantitative nonrandomized, quantitative descriptive, and mixed-methods studies. The programs studied used film and television (n = 3), mixed-arts (n = 3), theatre (n = 2), and quilting (n = 1). All nine interventions used the arts to elicit emotional involvement, while seven also used the arts to encourage engagement with themes of health. Study outcomes included increased self-efficacy, awareness of mental health issues, and likelihood for taking action to prevent suicide, as well as decreases in suicidal risk and self-harming behaviors. Conclusions. Factors that influence suicide risk and survivorship may be effectively addressed through arts-based interventions. While the current evidence is promising with regard to the potential for arts programs to positively affect suicide prevention and survivorship, this evidence needs to be supplemented to inform recommendations for evidence-based arts interventions.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that youth with behavioral disorders (BD) present an increased risk for developing severe and persistent antisocial behaviors in adulthood. Retrospective research notes that not all children and adolescents follow a negative trajectory and explains this heterogeneity in particular by the severity of CU traits. Our study examines how these traits affect the functioning of children and adolescents with BD. Method: A systematic literature review conducted through various databases and using different keywords made it possible to analyze 52 studies published from 2015 to 2020 that measured the bidirectional effects of CU traits on the functioning of young. Results: Out of the 52 studies, 47 analyzed links between CU traits and neurobiological or mental health, 20 examined family and school contexts, eight focused on social adjustment, 10 on social interactions and 19 measured links with cognitive functioning, especially executive functions. Conclusion: Consistent with previous recommendations in the field, our findings emphasize the importance of assessing the presence of UC traits in early childhood to prevent the emergence of comorbid disorders and to target multimodal (early) interventions to influence the life trajectories of youth with high CU traits.

   Methods We searched seven databases for relevant peer-reviewed articles published between 1 January 2010 and 25 April 2019. Our inclusion criteria required that the study included age-disaggregated data on adolescents, and focused and assessed mental health outcomes associated with pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. We extracted data on the specific health event, the mental health outcome and the method of measuring this, and comparisons with other age groups.
   Findings After initially screening 10 818 articles by title and abstract, we included 96 articles in our review. We observed that a wide-ranging prevalence of mental ill-health has been reported for adolescents. However, most studies of mental health during pregnancy did not identify an increased risk of depression or other mental disorders among adolescents compared with other age groups. In contrast, the majority of studies conducted during the postpartum period identified an increased risk of depression in adolescents compared with other age groups. Three studies reported on mental health outcomes following abortion, with varying results. We found no studies of the effect of sexually transmitted infections on mental health among adolescents.
   Conclusion We recommend that sexual and reproductive health services should be accessible to adolescents to address their needs and help to prevent any adverse mental health outcomes.

AB  - The treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) comprises physical activity (PA), diet, and medication. PA provides important benefits for people with diabetes. However, the majority of patients with DM2 do not attain the recommended levels of PA. Despite the evidence of the benefits to health of engaging in PA, the recommendations have not been fully translated into clinical improvements. Using a scoping review, this study aimed to identify the factors that influence levels of physical activity in adults with DM2. Eighteen studies published from 2009-2020 were identified by a search of relevant systematic databases between March 2019 and December 2020. The scoping review was carried out in accordance with the model defined by Arksey and O'Malley. The synthesis revelated sociodemographic characteristics, and six components-personal, motivation, social, mental, clinical, and self-efficacy-were identified as factors. Those that were most frequently identified were motivation and social support. In conclusion, these results should be considered to implement strategies to encourage people with DM2 to engage in physical exercise and thus improve the management of their condition.

   center dot Evaluate the evidence regarding the effectiveness of long-term treatment of bipolar disorder with valproate Background
   Prophylactic treatment is critical for bipolar disorder (BD) patients. Valproate is commonly used for this purpose but lacks regulatory approval and carries appreciable risks. Methods
   Systematic literature searching through June 2020 sought prospective trials lasting >= 12 months with adults diagnosed with BD to support comparisons of risk of new illness episodes with valproate versus placebo or other agents. Results
   Included were 13 reports involving 9240 subjects treated for an average of 29.1 months (range, 12-124) in 21 trials: 9 were blinded, randomized trials (RCTs) of valproate versus placebo (n = 3), lithium (5), or olanzapine (1); 2 were unblinded RCTs versus lithium (1) or quetiapine (1); and 10 were open-label trials versus lithium (5), quetiapine (2), carbamazepine (1), lamotrigine (1), or olanzapine (1). Random-effects meta-analysis found valproate superior to placebo in 3 trials (odds ratio [OR] = 0.42 [95% confidence level (CI), 0.30-0.60]; p < .0001). In 11 trials, protective effects with valproate and lithium were similar (OR = 1.20 [CI, 0.81-1.79]; p = .36), as well in 5 comparisons versus antipsychotics quetiapine and olanzapine (OR = 0.96 [CI, 0.66-1.40]; p = .84), and 2 versus other mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and lamotrigine) (OR = 1.30 [CI, 0.75-2.26]; p = .34). Valproate was nonsignificantly more effective versus new mania than depression (chi(2) = 3.03; p = .08). Conclusions
   Valproate was more effective than placebo in preventing new BD episodes of mania or depression, and not significantly different from lithium, second-generation antipsychotics, or other anticonvulsants. Overall benefits were nonsignificantly greater versus mania than bipolar depression.

AB  - Purpose of review Children living in socioeconomically disadvantaged households have excess risks of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric problems. The purpose of this review is to synthesize evidence for mechanisms that may contribute to these excess risks. Recent findings The majority of the 60 studies included in our review focused on children's neurocognitive development and behavioural problems. About half conducted mediation analyses of factors in the family and neighbourhood environments, including access to resources (e.g. cognitive inputs within the home environment) and exposure to stressors (e.g. negative parenting practices), as well as neurobiological embedding of childhood disadvantage. In addition, many studies conducted moderation analyses of factors that were hypothesized to interact with (i.e. exacerbate or mitigate) the harmful effects of childhood disadvantage. Many of the factors that contribute to the excess risk of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric problems among children in disadvantaged households are potentially modifiable (e.g. cognitively stimulating materials, parental language input, cultural resources, parental stress and psychopathology, negative parenting, neighbourhood violence). If their causality is ultimately established, they could be targets for the prevention and reduction of disparities. The continued search for mechanisms should not detract from work to reduce and hopefully eliminate children's exposure to disadvantage.

AB  - Objectives Burnout is a state of exhaustion resulting from prolonged and excessive workplace stress. We sought to examine biological underpinnings of burnout, focussing on mechanisms and physical consequences. Methods We searched the literature on burnout and evaluated studies examining biological parameters in patient populations (i.e. 'clinical' burnout) as well as in individuals from the general population judged as having some degree of burnout evaluated using a dimensional approach. Results Findings suggest that burnout is associated with sustained activation of the autonomic nervous system and dysfunction of the sympathetic adrenal medullary axis, with alterations in cortisol levels. Limited studies have also shown altered immune function and changes in other endocrine systems. Consequences of burnout include increased allostatic load, structural and functional brain changes, excito-toxicity, systemic inflammation, immunosuppression, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and premature death. Limitations of studies include variability in study populations, low specificity of burnout measures, and mostly cross-sectional studies precluding examination of changes across the course of burnout. Conclusions Further examination of biological mechanisms of burnout would benefit from more homogeneous clinical samples, challenge tests and prospective studies. This would assist in differentiation from conditions such as depression and aid with development of specific treatment targets for burnout.

AB  - Background: Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are first-line treatments for mental disorders. Despite recent improvements, only approximately 50% of the patients reach sustained remission, indicating a need for novel developments. The main concept put forward in this systematic review and hypothesis article is the targeted co-administration of defined neurobiological interventions and specific psychotherapeutic techniques. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search for randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of augmented psychotherapy to psychotherapy alone. Results: Thirty-five trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The majority (29 trials) used augmentation strategies such as D-cycloserine, yohimbine, or sleep to enhance the effects of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. Fewer studies investigated noninvasive brain stimulation with the aim of improving cognitive control, psychedelic compounds with the aim of enhancing existentially oriented psychotherapy, and oxytocin to improve social communication during psychotherapy. Results demonstrate small augmentation effects for the enhancement of exposure therapy - however, some of the studies found negative results. Other methods are less thoroughly researched, and results are mixed. Conclusions: This approach provides an open matrix for further research and has the potential to systematically guide future studies.

The aim of this systematic review was to explore the scope, quality and inclusivity of international clinical guidelines on mental health and/or substance abuse in relation to diagnosis and treatment of co-existing disorders and considerations for wider social and contextual factors in treatment recommendations. Method A protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020187094) driven systematic review was conducted. A systematic search was undertaken using six databases including MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PsychInfo from 2010 till June 2020; and webpages of guideline bodies and professional societies. Guideline quality was assessed based on 'Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II' (AGREE II) tool. Data was extracted using a pre-piloted structured data extraction form and synthesized narratively. Reporting was based on PRISMA guideline. Result A total of 12,644 records were identified. Of these, 21 guidelines were included in this review. Three of the included guidelines were related to coexisting disorders, 11 related to SMI, and 7 guidelines were related to SUD. Seven (out of 18) single disorder guidelines did not adequately recommend the importance of diagnosis or treatment of concurrent disorders despite their high co-prevalence. The majority of the guidelines (n = 15) lacked recommendations for medicines optimisation in accordance with concurrent disorders (SMI or SUD) such as in the context of drug interactions. Social cause and consequence of dual diagnosis such as homelessness and safeguarding and associated referral pathways were sparsely mentioned. Conclusion Despite very high co-prevalence, clinical guidelines for SUD or SMI tend to have limited considerations for coexisting disorders in diagnosis, treatment and management. There is a need to improve the scope, quality and inclusivity of guidelines to offer person-centred and integrated care.

AB  - Previous studies have reported discrepant outcomes for mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) to improve sleep quality or reduce the benzodiazepines (BZDs) use in cancer patients; therefore, a meta-analysis was required to examine the relationships. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials et al. were searched by independent reviewers from date of inception to January 2020 to examine the associations between MBI and sleep disturbance or BZDs use among cancer patients. Randomized controlled studies that reported the effect of MBI on sleep disturbance or BZDs use in cancer patients aged over 18 years were included. Standardized mean differences with 95% CIs were calculated to estimate effect size. If P 0.1, I2 50%, the random effects model was used. Fourteen studies of 1659 participant were identified in the meta-analysis. Overall, sleep disturbance was significantly relieved in MBI group (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.55, P < 0.001), and the effect could sustain to follow up duration (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.69, P < 0.001). Only three studies reported that MBI could decrease the BZDs use in hospitalized cancer patients. Our findings indicate that MBI were effective in alleviating sleep disturbance in a short time, and may be associated with therapeutic benefits for BZDs use. Further randomized controlled studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of MBI for BZDs use in cancer patients.

AB  - BackgroundPerinatal common mental disorders are associated with significant adverse outcomes for women and their families, particularly in low- and middle-income settings. Early detection through screening with locally-validated tools can improve outcomes.MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Global Health, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar for articles on the validation of screening tools for common mental disorders in perinatal women in India, with no language or date restrictions. Quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. We used bivariate and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic models to calculate pooled summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Heterogeneity was assessed by visualising the distance of individual studies from the summary curve.ResultsSeven studies involving 1003 women were analysed. All studies assessed the validity of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in identifying perinatal depression. No validation studies of any other screening tools were identified. Using a common threshold of >= 13 the EPDS had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 88.9% (95%CI 77.4-94.9) and 93.4 (95%CI 81.5-97.8), respectively. Using optimal thresholds (range >= 9 to >= 13) the EPDS had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 94.4% (95%CI 81.7-98.4) and 90.8 (95%CI 83.7-95.0), respectively.ConclusionThe EPDS is psychometrically valid in diverse Indian settings and its use in routine maternity care could improve detection of perinatal depression. Further research is required to validate screening tools for other perinatal common mental disorders in India.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HAB) are recurrent phenomena in northern Europe along the coasts of the Baltic Sea, Kattegat-Skagerrak, eastern North Sea, Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. These HABs have caused occasional massive losses for the aquaculture industry and have chronically affected socioeconomic interests in several ways. This status review gives an overview of historical HAB events and summarises reports to the Harmful Algae Event Database from 1986 to the end of year 2019 and observations made in long term monitoring programmes of potentially harmful phytoplankton and of phycotoxins in bivalve shellfish. Major HAB taxa causing fish mortalities in the region include blooms of the prymnesiophyte Chrysochromulina leadbeateri in northern Norway in 1991 and 2019, resulting in huge economic losses for fish farmers. A bloom of the prymesiophyte Prymnesium polylepis (syn. Chrysochromulina polylepis) in the Kattegat-Skagerrak in 1988 was ecosystem disruptive. Blooms of the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis spp. have caused accumulations of foam on beaches in the southwestern North Sea and Wadden Sea coasts and shellfish mortality has been linked to their occurrence. Mortality of shellfish linked to HAB events has been observed in estuarine waters associated with influx of water from the southern North Sea. The first bloom of the dictyochophyte genus Pseudochattonella was observed in 1998, and since then such blooms have been observed in high cell densities in spring causing fish mortalities some years. Dinoflagellates, primarily Dinophysis spp., intermittently yield concentrations of Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DST) in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, above regulatory limits along the coasts of Norway, Denmark and the Swedish west coast. On average, DST levels in shellfish have decreased along the Swedish and Norwegian Skagerrak coasts since approximately 2006, coinciding with a decrease in the cell abundance of D. acuta. Among dinoflagellates, Alexandrium species are the major source of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST) in the region. PST concentrations above regulatory levels were rare in the Skagerrak-Kattegat during the three decadal review period, but frequent and often abundant findings of Alexandrium resting cysts in surface sediments indicate a high potential risk for blooms. PST levels often above regulatory limits along the west coast of Norway are associated with A. catenella (ribotype Group 1) as the main toxin producer. Other Alexandrium species, such as A. ostenfeldii and A. minutum, are capable of producing PST among some populations but are usually not associated with PSP events in the region. The cell abundance of A. pseudogonyaulax, a producer of the ichthyotoxin goniodomin (GD), has increased in the Skagerrak-Kattegat since 2010, and may constitute an emerging threat. The dinoflagellate Azadinium spp. have been unequivocally linked to the presence of azaspiracid toxins (AZT) responsible for Azaspiracid Shellfish Poisoning (AZP) in northern Europe. These toxins were detected in bivalve shellfish at concentrations above regulatory limits for the first time in Norway in blue mussels in 2005 and in Sweden in blue mussels and oysters (Ostrea edulis and Crassostrea gigas) in 2018. Certain members of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia produce the neurotoxin domoic acid and analogs known as Amnesic Shellfish Toxins (AST). Blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia were common in the North Sea and the Skagerrak-Kattegat, but levels of AST in bivalve shellfish were rarely above regulatory limits during the review period.
   Summer cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea are a concern mainly for tourism by causing massive fouling of bathing water and beaches. Some of the cyano-bacteria produce toxins, e.g. Nodularia spumigena, producer of nodularin, which may be a human health problem and cause occasional dog mortalities. Coastal and shelf sea regions in northern Europe provide a key supply of seafood, socioeconomic well-being and ecosystem services. Increasing anthropogenic influence and climate change create environmental stressors causing shifts in the biogeography and intensity of HABs. Continued monitoring of HAB and phycotoxins and the operation of historical databases such as HAEDAT provide not only an ongoing status report but also provide a way to interpret causes and mechanisms of HABs.

AB  - Background: Depression is a major cause for disability worldwide, and digital health interventions are expected to be an augmentative and effective treatment. According to the fast-growing field of information and communication technologies and its dissemination, there is a need for mapping the technological landscape and its benefits for users.
   Objective: The purpose of this scoping review was to give an overview of the digital health interventions used for depression. The main goal of this review was to provide a comprehensive review of the system landscape and its technological state and functions, as well as its evidence and benefits for users.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of the field of digital health interventions for the treatment of depression. PubMed, PSYNDEX, and the Cochrane Library were searched by two independent researchers in October 2020 to identify relevant publications of the last 10 years, which were examined using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. To conduct the review, we used Rayyan, a freely available web tool.
   Results: In total, 65 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. After categorizing the studies into the areas of prevention, early detection, therapy, and relapse prevention, we found dominant numbers of studies in the area of therapy (n=52). There was only one study for prevention, 5 studies for early detection, and 7 studies for relapse prevention. The most dominant therapy approaches were cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and problem-solving therapy. Most of the studies revealed significant effects of digital health interventions when cognitive behavioral therapy was applied. Cognitive behavioral therapy as the most dominant form was often provided through web-based systems. Combined interventions consisting of web-based and smartphone-based approaches are increasingly found.
   Conclusions: Digital health interventions for treating depression are quite comprehensive. There are different interventions focusing on different fields of care. While most interventions can be beneficial to achieve a better depression treatment, it can be difficult to determine which approaches are suitable. Cognitive behavioral therapy through digital health interventions has shown good effects in the treatment of depression, but treatment for depression still stays very individualistic.

AB  - The associations between the distinct types of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders and experiential avoidance have received mixed evidence. We, thus, undertook this meta-analysis to i) re-examine the association between obsessive-compulsive disorder and experiential avoidance, ii) extend this association to hoarding disorder, trichotillomania, and body dysmorphic disorder, and iii) identify potential variables affecting these associations. Five databases, including Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL, were searched until March 15th, 2021. Meta-analyses based on random-effect models were performed. Heterogeneity and publication bias tests were applied using the I2 statistic and the Egger's test. Meta-regression analyses were performed to identify potential moderators affecting the strength of these associations. Thirty-six unique studies based on n = 11,859 participants were identified. The association between obsessive-compulsive disorder and experiential avoidance was moderate (SMD = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.57-0.92), whereas the associations between individual obsessive-compulsive symptoms, including obsessions, responsibility for harm, ordering, checking, washing and neutralizing, and experiential avoidance ranged from low to strong (SMD ranged between 0.41 and 1.06, 95% CI = 0.25 to 1.40). The associations between hoarding disorder (SMD = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.46-1.40), trichotillomania (SMD = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.48-0.63), body dysmorphic disorder (SMD = 1.55, 95% CI = 0.72-2.37) and experiential avoidance were moderate to strong. Meta-regression analyses demonstrated that studies using the AAQ/AAQ-II scales for measuring experiential avoidance, and/or self-report scales for assessing OCRDs contributed smaller effect sizes. These findings suggest that reducing experiential avoidance may be a viable way of complementing exposure strategies in alleviating obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms.

AB  - Introduction: Although the aetiology and pathophysiology of depression are multifactorial, to date most studies have examined either biological or environmental mechanisms without looking at the integration of both; with most studies conducted in high-income countries (HICs). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of worldwide studies investigating the relationship between biological and environmental stress risk factors for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescence.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE (via Ovid), PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science (Core Collection), Lilacs, African Journals Online and Global Health for prospective and cross-sectional studies that examined the association between biological markers and environmental stress risk factors in MDD during adolescence.
   Findings: Of 11,089 articles identified, 21 were included, with only two from middle-income countries. Increased inflammation, telomere length and brain abnormalities, including blunted reward-related activity, white matter disruptions, and altered volume of limbic brain regions, were associated with increased risk for MDD mainly in the context of early life adversity. There is little evidence suggesting that the neurobiological changes investigated were associated with MDD in the context of recent life stress.
   Interpretation: The developmental trajectory of depression appears to start with early life adversities and occurs in the context of immune and brain abnormalities. Understanding these biopsychosocial processes will help to improve our ability to detect individuals at risk of developing depression in adolescence. However, generalizability is limited by few studies examining both biological and environmental stress risk factors and a lack of studies on adolescents and young adults in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs).

AB  - Despite the accepted link between childhood abuse and positive psychotic symptoms, findings between other adversities, such as neglect, and the remaining dimensions in people with psychosis have been inconsistent, with evidence not yet reviewed quantitatively. The aim of this study was to systematically examine quantitatively the association between broadly defined childhood adversity (CA), abuse (sexual/physical/emotional), and neglect (physical/emotional) subtypes, with positive, negative, depressive, manic, and disorganized dimensions in those with psychosis. A search was conducted across EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Cochrane Libraries using search terms related to psychosis population, CA, and psychopathological dimensions. After reviewing for relevance, data were extracted, synthesized, and meta-analyzed. Forty-seven papers were identified, including 7379 cases across 40 studies examining positive, 37 negative, 20 depressive, 9 disorganized, and 13 manic dimensions. After adjustment for publication bias, general adversity was positively associated with all dimensions (ranging from r = 0.08 to r = 0.24). Most forms of abuse were associated with depressive (ranging from r = 0.16 to r = 0.32), positive (ranging from r = 0.14 to r = 0.16), manic (r = 0.13), and negative dimensions (ranging from r = 0.05 to r = 0.09), while neglect was only associated with negative (r = 0.13) and depressive dimensions (ranging from r = 0.16 to r = 0.20). W hen heterogeneity was found, it tended to be explained by one specific study. The depressive dimension was influenced by percentage of women (ranging from r = 0.83 to r = 1.36) and poor-quality scores (ranging from r = -0.21 and r = -0.059). Quality was judged as fair overall. Broadly defined adversity and forms of abuse increase transdimensional severity. Being exposed to neglect during childhood seems to be exclusively related to negative and depressive dimensions suggesting specific effects.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Studies have shown that MS disrupts several social cognitive abilities [including empathy and theory of mind (ToM)]. Overall ToM deficits in MS are well documented, but how the specific ToM subcomponents and empathic capacity are affected remains unclear. For this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to July 2020. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedges g with a random-effects model. Thirty-three studies were included. Relative to healthy controls (HCs), patients with MS were moderately impaired in overall empathy (g = -0.67), overall ToM (g = -74), cognitive ToM (g = -0.72), and the overlapping domains of cognitive empathy/affective ToM (g = -0.79); no group differences were identified for affective empathy (g = -0.19). Compared with HCs, patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS were impaired in overall empathy, overall ToM, cognitive ToM, and cognitive empathy/affective ToM, without significant RRMS-progressive MS differences in impairment degree. We conducted the first meta-analytic review investigating the empathy and ToM functioning patterns in patients with MS and examined the overlapping and distinct subcomponents of these constructs. The findings suggest differential impairment of the core aspects of social cognitive processing in patients with MS, which may importantly inform the development of structured social cognitive MS interventions.

AB  - Breastfeeding is an effective way to protect and promote the health of the infant and mother. Cultural, social, economic, medical, or psychological factors might interfere with successful breastfeeding. Therefore, maternal eating disorders (EDs) may have detrimental effects on the decision of breastfeeding initiation and on its continuation. There is limited knowledge about the breastfeeding practices of mothers with EDs. We performed a systematic review to generate more evidence in this area. A search was conducted in PubMed and PsycINFO, and several journals were hand searched for relevant publications. Of N = 3904 hits, 13 full texts were included in the qualitative analysis. The findings on total duration of BF between mothers with and without EDs were mixed, but women with EDs showed more negative experiences and emotional problems during BF. There was not enough evidence to conclude on breastfeeding initiation, or on the duration of exclusive breastfeeding. Maternal EDs might have a negative impact on BF practices with possible negative effects on the maternal-child feeding environment. Further studies with comparable data and information on the women's partners' attitudes about breastfeeding are needed.

AB  - Objectives: A systematic narrative literature review was undertaken to assess the acceptability of childhood screening interventions to identify factors to consider when planning or modifying childhood screening programs to maximize participation and uptake.
   Study design: This is a systematic narrative literature review.
   Methods: Electronic databases were searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO via Ovid, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) to identify primary research studies that assessed screening acceptability. Studies were categorized using an existing theoretical framework of acceptability consisting of seven constructs: affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy. A protocol was developed and registered with PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42018099763)
   Results: The search identified 4529 studies, and 46 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies involved neonatal screening. Programs identified included newborn blood spot screening (n = 22), neonatal hearing screening (n = 13), Duchenne muscular dystrophy screening (n = 4), cystic fibrosis screening (n = 3), screening for congenital heart defects (n = 2), and others (n = 2). Most studies assessed more than one construct of acceptability. The most common constructs identified were affective attitude (how a parent feels about the program) and intervention coherence (parental understanding of the program, and/or the potential consequences of a confirmed diagnosis).
   Conclusions: The main acceptability component identified related to parental knowledge and understanding of the screening process, the testing procedure(s), and consent. The emotional impact of childhood screening mostly explored maternal anxiety. Further studies are needed to examine the acceptability of childhood screening across the wider family unit. When planning new (or refining existing) childhood screening programs, it is important to assess acceptability before implementation. This should include assessment of important issues such as information needs, timing of information, and when and where the screening should occur. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

We seek to use this information to provide recommendations and strategies to mitigate such risks. Design/Methodology/Approach: A narrative review of the peer-reviewed literature on wellbeing of military personnel and other responders was conducted. Data was grouped and categorized according to overarching domains. Findings: Factors associated with wellbeing were categorized into 5 domains: (1) demographics; (2) mental health concerns; (3) social networks; (4) work environment; and (5) postdeployment life. The strategies identified to promote wellbeing included mental health assessments, preparedness trainings, debriefs in the field, postdeployment debriefs, resources in the field, and further postdeployment decompression strategies. Originality/Value: This study provides a unique understanding of the risk factors associated with poor health and wellbeing outcomes in public health emergency response work by extending the body of knowledge that focuses on other types of emergency and military response.

AB  - Given growing concerns of im/migrant women's access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, we aimed to (1) describe inequities and determinants of their engagement with SRH services in Canada; and (2) understand their lived experiences of barriers and facilitators to healthcare. Using a comprehensive review methodology, we searched the quantitative and qualitative peer-reviewed literature of im/migrant women's access to SRH care in Canada from 2008 to 2018. Of 782 studies, 38 met inclusion criteria. Ontario (n = 18), British Columbia (n = 6), and Alberta (n = 6) were primary settings represented. Studies focused primarily on maternity care (n = 20) and sexual health screenings (n = 12). Determinants included health system navigation and service information; experiences with health personnel; culturally safe and language-specific care; social isolation and support; immigration-specific factors; discrimination and racialization; and gender and power relations. There is a need for research that compares experiences across diverse groups of racialized im/migrants and a broader range of SRH services to inform responsive, equity-focused programs and policies.

AB  - Background: early onset is frequent in Bipolar Disorders (BDs), and it is characterised by the occurrence of mixed states (or mixed features). In this systematic review, we aimed to confirm and extend these observations by providing the prevalence rates of mixed states/features and data on associated clinical, pharmacological and psychopathological features. Methods: following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched from inception to 9 February 2021 for all studies investigating mixed states/mixed features in paediatric BD. Data were independently extracted by multiple observers. The prevalence rates of mixed states/features for each study were calculated. Results: eleven studies were included in our review, involving a total patient population of 1365 individuals. Overall, of the patients with paediatric age BD, 55.2% had mixed states/features (95% CI 40.1-70.3). Children with mixed states/features presented with high rates of comorbidities, in particular, with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Evidences regarding the psychopathology and treatment response of mixed states/features are currently insufficient. Conclusions: our findings suggested that mixed states/features are extremely frequent in children and adolescents with BD and are characterised by high levels of comorbidity. Future investigations should focus on the relationship between mixed states/features and psychopathological dimensions as well as on the response to pharmacological treatment.

AB  - Even though there is a recognized association, the causation between chronic migraine (CM) and frontostriatal circuit (FSC) disorders that were commonly presented as anxiety disorders, depression, tic disorders, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders in routine headache outpatient is yet to be fully disclosed. Medication-overuse headache (MOH) and CM recognizedly affect complex neural systems, including the FSC. Referenced circuits constitute a part of a circle that consists of the cortex, striatum, and thalamus regions and they transmit the data from the cerebral cortex to the subcortex. The above-mentioned circles end up once again in the determined region of the cerebral cortex. Five different FSCs have been described above which circulate among the specific parts of the cortex, namely supplementary motor area, frontal eye fields, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex with various subconnections and serve to various functions. Based on the scientific data with an emphasis on the clinical perspective, this paper aims to show the potential causative relationship between common FSC disorders and CM with or without MOH. The results also highlighted the importance of psychiatric comorbidities, as being far from a coincidence, and promoted the application of preventive medicine and interventions including lifestyle changes, cognitive-behavioral treatment, and neuromodulation.

KW  - METAANALYSES
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had different effects on different occupations. The present study was designed to systematically review the available evidence to investigate the pandemic on occupational effects. The academic databases of Scopus, PubMed Central, ProQuest, Science Direct, and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched systematically between December 2019 and February 2021. COVID-19-related fear, concern, worry, anxiety, and stress in combination with job-related MeSH terms were used to search the databases. The methodological quality of included papers was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale checklist. To synthesize data, a qualitative synthesis of findings was performed due to the small number of included studies (n = 4) and the heterogeneity of the assessed outcomes. Four studies were included in the final analysis. All four studies were cross-sectional, collected the data online, and comprised 1654 participants from four different countries. Fear of COVID-19 was associated with increased future career anxiety, perceived job insecurity, organizational and professional turnover intentions, and decreased job satisfaction. COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome was associated with scores on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale. As so few studies have been conducted, there are no conclusive findings. More studies using valid and reliable measures to assess fear/anxiety related to COVID-19 and its' association with job attributes are needed. It is also recommended that these associations are examined in variety of different jobs.

AB  - There has been much discussion recently about the importance of implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to protect the public from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Different governments across the world have adopted NPIs (e.g., social distancing, quarantine, isolation, lockdowns, curfews, travel restrictions, closures of schools and colleges). Two fundamental strategies, namely a strict containment strategy-also called suppression strategy-and a mitigation strategy have been adopted in different countries, mainly to reduce the reproduction number (R-0) to below one and hence to reduce case numbers to low levels or eliminate human-to-human transmission, as well as to use NPIs to interrupt transmission completely and to reduce the health impact of epidemics, respectively. However, the adoption of these NPI strategies is varied and the factors impacting NPI are inconsistent and unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to review the factors associated with the implementation of NPIs (social distancing, social isolation and quarantine) for reducing COVID-19. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched for published and unpublished studies, undertaking a systematic search of: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, COVID-19 Research, WHO database on COVID-19, and Google Scholar. Thirty-three studies were included in the study. Seven descriptive themes emerged on enablers and barriers to NPIs: the positive impact of NPIs, effective public health interventions, positive change in people's behaviour and concerns about COVID-19, the role of mass media, physical and psychological impacts, and ethnicity/age associated with COVID-19. This study has highlighted that the effectiveness of NPIs in isolation is likely to be limited, therefore, a combination of multiple measures e.g., SD, isolation and quarantine, and workplace distancing appeared more effective in reducing COVID-19. Studies suggest that targeted approaches alongside social distancing might be the way forward, and more acceptable. Further research to promote country- and context-specific adoption of NPIs to deliver public health measures is needed. Studies comparing the effectiveness of interventions and strategies will help provide more evidence for future pandemics.

AB  - Trace elements with various roles in metabolic processes as a cofactor or catalysts in enzymatic functions are required in milligrams. In this review, the activity of two trace elements, Fe and Zn, on brain activity is explained. Iron is a significant element for improving learning and memory, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, anxiety, and hypoxia. Low ferritin levels in premature infants result in poor motor skills and altered gene expression. Hemoglobin production is reduced due to lack of iron in cells, which increases pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and causes depression in postpartum women. Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a substantial role in various biochemical processes such as growth and development, brain activity, immunity, lipid metabolism, and controls external and internal behaviors. Deprivation of zinc leads to depression and anxiety as the alteration in the expression of the BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) gene occurs. Low zinc levels and high glucocorticoid levels can be a reason for aggression, impulsiveness, conduct and control problems. Reduction in zinc uptake by the inhibition of ZnT3 (zinc transporter-3) leads to impaired learning and memory.

AB  - Introduction Although cash transfer programmes are not explicitly designed to improve mental health, by reducing poverty and improving the life chances of children and young people, they may also improve their mental health. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the evidence on the effectiveness of cash transfers to improve the mental health of children and young people in low-income and middle-income countries. Methods We searched Pubmed, EBSCOhost, Scientific Electronic Library Online, ISI Web of Science and Social Sciences Citation Index and grey literature (from January 2000 to July 2020) for studies which quantitatively assessed the impact of cash transfers on mental health in young people (aged 0-24 years), using a design that incorporated a control group. We extracted Cohen's d effects size and used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis on studies that measured depressive symptoms, I-2 statistic and assessment of study quality. Results We identified 12 116 articles for screening, of which 12 were included in the systematic review (covering 13 interventions) and seven in the meta-analysis assessing impact on depressive symptoms specifically. There was high heterogeneity (I-2=95.2) and a high risk of bias (0.38, 95% CIs: -5.08 to 5.85; p=0.86) across studies. Eleven interventions (85%) showed a significant positive impact of cash transfers on at least one mental health outcome in children and young people. However, no study found a positive effect on all mental health outcomes examined, and the meta-analysis showed no impact of cash transfers on depressive symptoms (0.02, 95% CIs: -0.19 to 0.23; p=0.85). Conclusion Cash transfers may have positive effects on some mental health outcomes for young people, with no negative effects identified. However, there is high heterogeneity across studies, with some interventions showing no effects. Our review highlights how the effect of cash transfers may vary by social and economic context, culture, design, conditionality and mental health outcome.

AB  - Objective: Converging evidence suggests abnormalities in monetary reward processing may underlie the shared pathophysiology between major depressive disorder and obesity. As such, there is a need to parse deficits in specific subcomponents of monetary reward functioning (i.e., valuation, learning and anticipation). Methods: PsycINFO, Google Scholar and PubMed databases were searched for English-language articles published between database inception to June 6th, 2020. Studies were identified using the following medical search heading (MeSH) terms and search strings: (reward (valuation OR motivation OR anticipation OR learning OR functioning OR decision-making OR reinforcement)) AND ((obesity OR overweight OR obese). Results: Findings were reviewed from 11 studies evaluating the association between obesity and monetary reward processing. Four studies found significant differences in reward learning in individuals with obesity compared to normal-weight participants. Five studies found body mass index (BMI) to be predictive of willingness to expend effort (i.e., valuation) for a monetary reward. Three studies found changes in neural activations in the ventral striatum during anticipatory phases preceding receipt of a monetary reward in participants with obesity. Conclusions: Participants with obesity demonstrated significantly poorer performance in task-based measures of reward learning, valuation, and anticipation, resulting in lower monetary reward outcomes across all studies compared to healthy controls. Notably, participants with obesity and comorbid depression performed worse than participants with no comorbid depression. Limitations: There persists heterogeneity between studies with regards to inclusion of mood disorder populations and exclusion of psychiatric comorbidities in groups with obesity.

AB  - Reservoirs account for about 10% of the freshwater stored in lakes worldwide. These reservoirs are home to 'reservoir ecosystems', that is, the aquatic and non-aquatic interactive ecosystems associated with artificial lakes where water is stored, typically behind a dam, for human purposes. While reservoir ecosystems provide various ecosystem services for sustainable development, their significance in research and policy has not been well understood and not well defined in the 2030 United Nation's (UN) Agenda for Sustainable Development. To advance understanding of reservoir ecosystems and their impact on policy, here we provide an overview of research on reservoir ecosystems and link it to UN SDGs and their Targets. Based on 5280 articles published in the last three decades, we applied network visualization to construct a framework for research addressing reservoir ecosystems. The framework covers four major themes: (1) ecosystem structure and function, (2) environmental pollution and stress effects, (3) climate impacts and ecological feedbacks, and (4) ecosystem services and management We have found that sustainable reservoir ecosystems synergistically support 121 Targets of UN SDGs (71% of all). Reservoir ecosystems have both negative and positive implications for 15 targets (9%) and negative trade-offs for only 3 targets (2%). Thirty SDG Targets (18%) are unrelated to sustainable reservoir ecosystems. The synergies and trade-offs exist in three fields, securing basic material needs (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 14 and 15), pursuing common human well-being (SDGs 1, 3. 4, 5, 8 and 10), and coordinating sustainable governance policies (SDGs 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17). Exploring these linkages allows better integration of reservoir ecosystems into the UN SDGs framework and guides sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems for sustainable development.

AB  - Attention Bias Modification (ABM) is a novel computerized therapy for anxiety disorders and is thought to augment the effect of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) as it may target different mechanisms. Recently, a growing number of studies have examined the combined effects of ABM and CBT on clinically anxious patients, with mixed results. This review examined the combined efficacy of ABM and CBT. A literature search was conducted in four main databases: PsycINFO, Embase, Pubmed and the Cochrane library, resulting in 11 randomized studies. The combination of ABM and CBT had small but significant effects on clinician-rated anxiety symptoms and attention bias towards threat compared to the control group, while ESs for anxiety (all measures), self-reported or parent-reported anxiety measures and depression symptoms were non-significant. Studies in which ABM was conducted as an integral part of each CBT session yielded greater reduction in anxiety symptoms than those conducting ABM and CBT at separate time points. Older participants and patients with social anxiety disorder tended to benefit less from the combination of ABM and CBT based on bias scores. This study may provide preliminary evidence that ABM and CBT have the potential to complement each other, especially when they are conducted integrally.

AB  - Background: The pregnancy and psychological status of infertile couples has always been a concern, but there is no clear evidence for the efficacy of psychotherapy for infertile couples. This study aimed to summarize the current evidence of the effects of psychotherapy on psychological and pregnancy outcomes for infertile couples.
   Method: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMbase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science (ISI) for articles published from 1946 to June 26, 2020. The pregnancy outcomes, psychological outcomes, and acceptability were involved in the study.
   Results: Overall, 29 studies with a combined total of 3,522 adult participants were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with a placebo, psychotherapy was associated with the pregnancy rate [risk ratio (RR) = 1.43, 95% CI [1.07, 1.93]], total psychological scales associated with infertility [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.33 95% CI [-0.63, -0.02]], subsymptoms of psychological scores using the 28-item version of GHQ (including social function [MD = -3.10, 95% CI [-4.30, -1.90]] and depression [MD = -3.90, 95% CI [-5.36, -2.44]], and depression [MD = 3.60, 95% CI [2.25, 4.95]] using the 14-item version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, but it had no statistically significant association with the other outcomes. In the stratified analyses, the pregnancy rate using assisted reproduction, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and the integrative body-mind-spirit (BMS); total psychological scales associated with infertility using other treatments and more than a month; and anxiety using BMS had significant statistical significance. The funnel plots of all outcomes were approximately symmetrical, and no significant publication bias was found.
   Conclusions: The study showed that psychotherapy can lead to improvements in the pregnancy rate for infertile patients, especially for patients receiving assisted fertility. In addition, it may help improve total psychological scales associated with infertility and depression. CBT and BMS play an important role in improving rate of pregnancy, and BMS is associated with reducing anxiety. Although psychological interventions had limited effects on the pregnancy outcomes of infertility, our study still recommended that psychotherapies, in particular CBT and BMS, were applied to the therapeutic regimen for infertility, especially for patients receiving assisted fertility.

AB  - The concept of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER) refers to a variety of processes in which emotion regulation occurs as part of live social interactions and includes, among others, also those interpersonal interactions in which individuals turn to others to be helped or to help the others in managing emotions. Although IER may be a concept of interest in group therapy, specific theoretical insights in this field appear to be missed. In this article, we firstly provide a review of IER definitions, of classifications of IER strategies, and of IER clinical conceptualizations. Afterwards, we discuss the relevance of considering IER for group therapy, both in terms of non-specific group therapeutic factors and of group therapy techniques promoting adaptive emotion regulation, underlining the potentially relevant role of IER behaviors as intrinsically involved in group experience.

AB  - Metal base nanoparticles are widely produced all over the world and used in many fields and products such as medicine, electronics, cosmetics, paints, ceramics, toys, kitchen utensils and toothpastes. They are able to enter the body through digestive, respiratory, and alimentary systems. These nanoparticles can also cross the blood brain barrier, enter the brain and aggregate in the hippocampus. After entering the hippocampus, they induce oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and gene expression alteration in hippocampal cells, which finally lead to neuronal apoptosis. Metal base nanoparticles can also affect hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity that both of them play crucial role in memory and learning. On the one hand, hippocampal cells are severely vulnerable due to their high metabolic activity, and on the other hand, metal base nanoparticles have high potential to damage hippocampus through variety of mechanisms and affect its functions. This review discusses, in detail, nanoparticles' detrimental effects on the hippocampus in cellular, molecular and functional levels to reveal that according to the present information, which types of nanoparticles have more potential to induce hippocampal toxicity and psychiatric disorders and which types should be more evaluated in the future studies.

AB  - Background: Individuals with severe mental illness experience increased morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. Adverse effects of antipsychotics, including weight gain, may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of clinical, biochemical and genetic factors associated with MetS among patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using second-generation antipsychotics (SGA).
   Methods: A literature search was performed in Pubmed and Embase to identify all cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and clinical trials investigating associations with MetS in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using SGAs. We extracted and enumerated clinical, biochemical and genetic factors reported to be associated with MetS. We defined factors associated with MetS as factors being reported as associated with MetS in two or more studies.
   Results: 58 studies were included in this review (n = 12,123). In total, 62 factors were found to be associated with increased risk of MetS. Thirty one out of 58 studies investigated factors that were reported as associated with MetS in two or more studies. With regard to clinical factors, we found gender, higher age, concomitant use of mood stabilizers, higher baseline and current BMI, earlier SGA exposure, higher dose, longer duration of treatment, psychosis and tobacco smoking to be significantly associated with MetS. Furthermore, the biochemical factors hypo-adiponectinemia, elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and higher white blood cell (WBC) count were identified as factors associated with MetS. Among pharmacogenetic factors, the rs1414334 C-allele of the HTR2C-gene was associated with MetS in patients using SGA.
   Conclusion: In this systematic review investigating clinical, biochemical and genetic factors associated with MetS in patients using SGAs we found that higher age, higher baseline BMI, higher current BMI and male as well as female gender were positively associated with MetS across all antipsychotics. This study may set the stage for the application of clinical, biochemical and genetic factors to predict the risk of developing MetS in patients using SGAs. Future research is needed to determine which patients using SGAs are at risk to develop MetS in clinical practice.

AB  - Aims
   Chinese university students are at high risk for depressive symptoms and the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have exacerbated the mental health of university students. However, existing studies on depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a wide range of prevalence estimates, making mental health planning for this population difficult. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of surveys that assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods
   Major Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP) and English (PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo) databases and preprint platforms were searched to identify cross-sectional studies containing data on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the pandemic. Two authors independently retrieved the literature, evaluated the eligibility of potential studies, assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of included studies, and extracted data. RoB was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data.
   Results
   In total, 1177 records were retrieved, and 84 studies involving 1 292 811 Chinese university students during the pandemic were included. None of the included studies were rated as completely low RoB. Statistically significant heterogeneity in the prevalence estimates of included studies was detected (I-2 = 99.9%, p < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms was 26.0% (95%CI: 23.3-28.9%), which was significantly higher in female than in male students (30.8% v. 28.6%, p < 0.001), in postgraduates than in undergraduates (29.3% v. 22.9%, p < 0.001), in students living inside than in those living outside the COVID-19 epicentre (27.5% v. 22.3%, P < 0.001), in students from universities at the epicentre than in those from universities outside the epicentre (26.2% v. 23.1%, p < 0.001), in students who had close contact with COVID-19 than in those who did not (46.0% v. 25.0%, p < 0.001), and in students who had acquaintances or relatives infected with COVID-19 (39.7% v. 24.0%, p < 0.001) than in those who did not. Five sources of heterogeneity were identified from the subgroup analysis: survey period, % of males among the survey sample, scale of depressive symptoms, cutoff score of the scale and level of RoB.
   Conclusions
   Over one-fourth of Chinese university students experienced depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health services for this population should include periodic evaluation of depressive symptoms, expanded social support and psychiatric assessment and treatment when necessary. It is also necessary to design depression prevention programmes that target higher-risk cohorts of university students.

AB  - There are currently no validated treatment biomarkers in psychiatry. Resting State Functional Connectivity (RSFC) is a popular method for investigating the neural correlates of mood disorders, but the breadth of the field makes it difficult to assess progress toward treatment response biomarkers. In this review, we followed general PRISMA guidelines to evaluate the evidence base for mood disorder treatment biomarkers across diagnoses, brain network models, and treatment modalities. We hypothesized that no treatment biomarker would be validated across these domains or with independent datasets. Results are organized, interpreted, and discussed in the context of four popular analytic techniques: (1) reference region (seed-based) analysis, (2) independent component analysis, (3) graph theory analysis, and (4) other methods. Cortico-limbic connectivity is implicated across studies, but there is no single biomarker that spans analyses or that has been replicated in multiple independent datasets. We discuss RSFC limitations and future directions in biomarker development.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are abundant in marine environments, drawing global attention from scientists and rendering it significant to review the research progress and predict future trends of this field. To achieve that, we collected 1898 publications on marine MPs from Web of Science and performed a bibliometric analysis by CiteSpace and VOSviewer. Additionally, we utilized an unrestricted retrieval of literature from ScienceDirect to supplement our major findings. Trends in publication numbers show the growth in study from the initial stage ( 2012 and before), when microplastic (MP) occurrence, abundance, and distribution were primarily investigated. Throughout the ascent stage (between 2013-2016), when diverse sampling and analytical methods were applied to capture and identify MPs from the ocean, baseline data have been gleaned on physiochemical properties of MPs. The research focus then shifted to the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicological effects of MPs on marine biota, further highlighting their potential deleterious impacts on human health via dietary exposure, and this period was defined as the exploration stage (2017 and onwards). Nevertheless, key challenges including the lack of standard procedures for MP sampling, technical limitations in MP detecting and identification, and controversy about the underlying effects on the marine ecosystems and humans have also been arisen in the last decade. The present study elucidates how we gradually recognize MP pollution in marine environments and what challenges we face, suggesting future avenues for MP research.

AB  - Background Brain disorders are gradually becoming the leading cause of death worldwide. However, the lack of knowledge of brain disease's underlying mechanisms and ineffective neuropharmacological therapy have led to further exploration of optimal treatments and brain monitoring techniques. Objective This study aims to review the current state of brain disorders, which utilize transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and daily usable noninvasive neuroimaging techniques. Furthermore, the second goal of this study is to highlight available gaps and provide a comprehensive guideline for further investigation. Method A systematic search was conducted of the PubMed and Web of Science databases from January 2000 to October 2020 using relevant keywords. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy were selected as noninvasive neuroimaging modalities. Nine brain disorders were investigated in this study, including Alzheimer's disease, depression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, stroke, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury. Results Sixty-seven studies (1,385 participants) were included for quantitative analysis. Most of the articles (82.6%) employed transcranial direct current stimulation as an intervention method with modulation parameters of 1 mA intensity (47.2%) for 16-20 min (69.0%) duration of stimulation in a single session (36.8%). The frontal cortex (46.4%) and the cerebral cortex (47.8%) were used as a neuroimaging modality, with the power spectrum (45.7%) commonly extracted as a quantitative EEG feature. Conclusion An appropriate stimulation protocol applying tES as a therapy could be an effective treatment for cognitive and neurological brain disorders. However, the optimal tES criteria have not been defined; they vary across persons and disease types. Therefore, future work needs to investigate a closed-loop tES with monitoring by neuroimaging techniques to achieve personalized therapy for brain disorders.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are fragments, fibers, granules, flakes and spheres with a diameter or length of less than 5 mm. These may eventually end up in the aquatic environment by the progressive breakdown of larger plastics or via domestic and industrial sewage spillage. In order to better understand the current knowledge in this field, we carried out and extensive literature research to retrieve articles mainly focusing on the occurrence and distribution of MPs in aquatic matrix as well as their impacts on aquatic organisms and human derived cells. Once in the environment, MPs may be transported via wind and water movement, affecting their spatial distribution. Furthermore, density may also affect the buoyancy and vertical distribution of these pollutants. Consequently, MPs are ubiquitously distributed in fresh-and marine-water systems, posing a real threat to aquatic organisms. Furthermore, trophic transfer and biomagnification processes represent a viable route for the input of MPs to humans. This paper focuses on (1) Outline the occurrence of MPs in worldwide aquatic ecosystems; (2) Investigate the factors affecting the abundance and distribution of MPs in aquatic ecosystems; (3) Provide an in-depth discussion about the harmful effects that MPs poses to aquatic organisms; (4) Summarizes the possible mechanisms by which MPs may induce toxic effects on humans.

AB  - Cd accumulation in paddy soils and its subsequent transfer to the food chain are widespread environ-mental issues, which has been extensively investigated in China. However, most studies focused on regional scales and these results may not be applicable to present the Cd contamination status in soil-rice ecosystems at a national scale. Therefore, based on collected data from China's rice cultivation dominated regions, this study provides the Cd pollution level of paddy soils and rice grains in China. Results in-dicates that the Yangtze River basin, especially Hunan, required more attention due to the elevated Cd concentrations in soil-rice ecosystems. Moreover, this review summarizes the significant natural and anthropogenic sources, transport and accumulation mechanism as well as the influencing factors of Cd in soil-rice ecosystems. The wide occurrence of Cd contamination in paddy soils derived primarily from mining activities, intensive application of phosphates fertilizers and e-waste. Physicochemical charac-teristics of soil, soil microorganisms, temperature as well as the physiological features of rice plants all contribute to Cd accumulation in rice grains, which can be controlled to mitigate Cd accumulation in rice grains. This review will provide a scientific reference for Cd pollution control and management with respect to paddy field ecosystems in China and other countries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background In Ethiopia, in spite of the high burden of suicide related-adverse effect, substantial variability in the reported prevalence of individual studies about suicidal ideation and attempted suicide; there is no national level epidemiological evidence. Thus, the present study aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of suicide ideation and suicidal attempt in the general population. Methods We followed the PRISMA Guidelines to report the results of the finding. Databases including: PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), African Journal Online (AJOL) and African Indexed Medicus (AIM) were searched. Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochrane chi-square (chi(2)) and quantified by I-2 statistics test. Sensitivity test and subgroup analysis performed. Publication bias was tested by funnel plots and Egger's test. Effect size was calculated by random effects model. Results A total of 12 studies for suicidal ideation and 10 studies for attempted suicide were included in the study. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide were ranged from 1 to 55% and 0.6% to 14% respectively. The 12-month pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt were 9% (5-16%), I-2 = 99.64%, p < 0.001 and 4% (1-8%), I-2 = 98.11%, p < 0.001] respectively. The lifetime pooled prevalence of attempted suicide was found to be 4% (3-6%). We found evidence of significant heterogeneity for suicidal ideation [I-2 = 99.64%, p < 0.001] and attempted suicide [I-2 = 98.11%, p < 0.001]. The subgroup analysis could not identified source of heterogeneity. The sensitivity analysis showed that none of the point estimates was outside of the overall 95%CI for suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. No evidence of publication bias from the visual inspection of the funnel plot for suicidal ideation and [Egger's test (P = 0.174)] and attempted suicide [Egger's test (P = 0.318)]. Conclusion High prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide were observed in the general population of Ethiopia. These suggest the need of strengthening the awareness of suicidal behaviours and evaluate the effectiveness of the national health strategy in addressing the issues of suicidal behaviours.

AB  - This comprehensive review summarizes and interprets the neurobiological correlates of nocebo hyperalgesia in healthy humans. Nocebo hyperalgesia refers to increased pain sensitivity resulting from negative experiences and is thought to be an important variable influencing the experience of pain in healthy and patient populations. The young nocebo field has employed various methods to unravel the complex neurobiology of this phenomenon and has yielded diverse results. To comprehend and utilize current knowledge, an up-to-date, complete review of this literature is necessary. PubMed and PsychInfo databases were searched to identify studies examining nocebo hyperalgesia while utilizing neurobiological measures. The final selection included 22 articles. Electrophysiological findings pointed toward the involvement of cognitive-affective processes, e.g., modulation of alpha and gamma oscillatory activity and P2 component. Findings were not consistent on whether anxiety-related biochemicals such as cortisol plays a role in nocebo hyperalgesia but showed an involvement of the cyclooxygenase-prostaglandin pathway, endogenous opioids, and dopamine. Structural and functional neuroimaging findings demonstrated that nocebo hyperalgesia amplified pain signals in the spinal cord and brain regions involved in sensory and cognitive-affective processing including the prefrontal cortex, insula, amygdala, and hippocampus. These findings are an important step toward identifying the neurobiological mechanisms through which nocebo effects may exacerbate pain. Results from the studies reviewed are discussed in relation to cognitive-affective and physiological processes involved in nocebo and pain. One major limitation arising from this review is the inconsistency in methods and results in the nocebo field. Yet, while current findings are diverse and lack replication, methodological differences are able to inform our understanding of the results. We provide insights into the complexities and involvement of neurobiological processes in nocebo hyperalgesia and call for more consistency and replication studies. By summarizing and interpreting the challenging and complex neurobiological nocebo studies this review contributes, not only to our understanding of the mechanisms through which nocebo effects exacerbate pain, but also to our understanding of current shortcomings in this field of neurobiological research.

AB  - The promotion of mental health and well-being for the working population is crucial. Several studies have examined the effects of group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based interventions on promoting employees' mental health, but whether their work performance-related factors also improved has not been studied thoroughly. This systematic review was conducted to summarize and synthesize the effectiveness and characteristics of group CBT-based interventions on improving mental health and enhancing work performance-related factors from previous studies. A systematic search of studies published until November 2019 was performed using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and MEDLINE. Only ten studies investigated the impact of group CBT-based interventions on both mental health and work performance-related factors in a non-clinical working population using a randomized controlled trial study design. Studies on group CBT-based interventions such as psychosocial skills training and communication skills training were included. Eight studies showed that group CBT-based interventions improved aspects of mental health; ten studies demonstrated that group CBT-based interventions influenced some aspects of work performance-related factors. Overall, the reported effect sizes varied widely, from small to large. This review supports the idea that group CBT-based interventions in a non-clinical working population may partially influence mental health and work performance-related factors. All ten included articles were published after 2015. Additional research on this topic, such as through meta-analysis, is necessary to assess whether group CBT-based intervention is effective for supporting mental health and enhancing work performance-related factors in non-clinical working populations.

AB  - Objectives: No systematic review or meta-analysis concerning the prevalence of shift work disorder (SWD) has been conducted so far. The aim was thus to review prevalence studies of SWD, to calculate an overall prevalence by a random effects meta-analysis approach and investigate correlates of SWD prevalence using a random-effects meta-regression.
   Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in ISI Web of Science, PsycNET, PubMed, and Google Scholar using the search terms "shift work disorder" and "shift work sleep disorder." No restrictions in terms of time frame were used. Included studies had to present original data on the prevalence of SWD in an occupational sample published in English. A total of 349 unique hits were made. In all, 29 studies were finally included from which two authors independently extracted data using predefined data fields. The meta-regression included four predictors (diagnostic criteria, study country, type of workers, and sample size).
   Results: The overall prevalence of SWD was 26.5% (95% confidence interval = 21.0-32.8). Cochran Q was 1,845.4 (df = 28, p < 0.001), and the I-2 was 98.5%, indicating very high heterogeneity across the observed prevalence estimates. Diagnostic criteria (International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2 = 0, International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3 = 1) and sample size were inversely related to SWD prevalence.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of SWD was high across the included studies. The between-study disparity was large and was partly explained by diagnostic criteria and sample size. In order to facilitate comparative research on SWD, there is a need for validation and standardization of assessment methodology as well as agreement in terms of sample restrictions.

AB  - Background This comprehensive meta-analysis aimed to combine data from different studies and to estimate the association between FKBP5 polymorphisms and depression.
   Methods We performed a meta-analysis of observational studies. An electronic search was conducted on four databases for articles published before July 1, 2020.
   Results A total of 5125 patients with depression and 8399 controls from 16 independent studies were included in the analysis. The results showed that FKBP5 rs1360780 was associated with the risk of depression in the codominant model (CT vs. CC; OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.00-1.20, P = .04); rs4713916 polymorphism was associated with depression in the codominant model (AG vs. GG; OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.34, P = .008) and recessive model (AA vs. AG + GG; OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.56-0.99, P = .04); a significant association between rs3800373 and depression was found in the codominant genetic model (AC vs. AA; OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.05-1.34, P = .007) and dominant model (CC + AC vs. AA; OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.03-1.30, P = .02); there was no significant association of FKBP5 rs9470080 or rs9296158 with depression in any genetic model (P > .05). No publication bias was observed in our analysis. Moreover, sensitivity analyses demonstrated the Zobel's study significantly affected the heterogeneity for rs4713916 and rs3800373.
   Conclusions FKBP5 rs1360780 was associated with an increased risk of depression in the codominant model. We also found that rs4713916 and rs3800373 were involved in depression, rs4713916 was positively associated with depression in the codominant model and recessive model, and rs3800373 was related to an elevated risk of depression in the codominant model and dominant model.

AB  - This article reports the findings from a systematic review of qualitative research evidence exploring the views of children and young people identified as having Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH) needs and their experiences of the SEMH label. A systematic search identified seven papers that were reviewed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. Thematic synthesis of the literature identified the impact of the SEMH label for children and young people as well as their perceptions of this label. Key themes included the negative and positive impact of labels associated with SEMH and the impact on children and young people's identity. Implications for practice are considered including the importance of promoting the voice of children and young people in a description of their needs and working systemically with schools to raise awareness of the implications of language and to consider the impact of wider contextual factors on pupil's difficulties.

AB  - Background: People with a personality disorder (PD) suffer from enduring inflexible patterns in cognitions and emotions, leading to significant subjective distress, affecting both self and interpersonal functioning. In clinical practice, Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) is provided to clients with a PD, and although research continuously confirms the value of DMT for many populations, to date, there is very limited information available on DMT and PD. For this study, a systematic literature review on DMT and PD was conducted to identify the content of the described DMT interventions and the main treatment themes to focus upon in DMT for PD.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted across the following databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, WEB OF SCIENCE, PsycINFO/OVID, and SCOPUS following the PRISMA guidelines. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies was used to rank the quality of the articles. The Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine standards were applied to determine the hierarchical level of best evidence. Quantitative content analysis was used to identify the intervention components: intended therapeutic goals, therapeutic activities leading to these goals, and suggested therapeutic effects following from these activities. A thematic synthesis approach was applied to analyze and formulate overarching themes.
   Results: Among 421 extracted articles, four expert opinions met the inclusion criteria. Six overarching themes were found for DMT interventions for PD: self-regulation, interpersonal relationships, integration of self, processing experiences, cognition, and expression and symbolization in movement/dance. No systematic descriptions of DMT interventions for PD were identified. A full series of intervention components could be synthesized for the themes of self-regulation, interpersonal relationships, and cognition. The use of body-oriented approaches and cognitive strategies was in favor of dance-informed approaches.
   Conclusions: Dance movement therapists working with PD clients focus in their interventions on body-related experiences, non-verbal interpersonal relationships, and to a lesser extent, cognitive functioning. A methodological line for all intervention components was synthesized for the themes of self-regulation, interpersonal relationships, and cognition, of importance for developing systematic intervention descriptions. Future research could focus on practitioners' expertise in applying DMT interventions for PD to develop systematic intervention descriptions and explore the suitability of the identified themes for clinical application. Clients' experiences could offer essential insights on how DMT interventions could address PD pathology and specific PD categories.

AB  - Healthcare workers are at a high risk of psychological morbidity in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is significant variability in the impact of this crisis on individual healthcare workers, which can be best explained through an appreciation of the construct of resilience. Broadly speaking, resilience refers to the ability to successfully adapt to stressful or traumatic events, and thus plays a key role in determining mental health outcomes following exposure to such events. A proper understanding of resilience is vital in enabling a shift from a reactive to a proactive approach for protecting and promoting the mental well-being of healthcare workers. Research in the past decade has identified six areas that provide promising leads in understanding the biological basis of individual variations in resilience. These are: (1) the key role played by the monoamines noradrenaline and serotonin, (2) the centrality of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in influencing stress vulnerability and resilience, (3) the intimate links between the immune system and stress sensitivity, (4) the role of epigenetic modulation of gene expression in influencing the stress response, (5) the role played by certain neuropeptides as a natural "brake" mechanism in the face of stress, and (6) the neurobiological mechanisms by which environmental factors, such as exercise, diet, and social support, influence resilience to subsequent life events. Though much of this research is still in its early stages, it has already provided valuable information on which strategies - including dietary changes, lifestyle modification, environmental modification, psychosocial interventions, and even pharmacological treatments - may prove to be useful in fostering resilience in individuals and groups. This paper examines the above evidence more closely, with a specific focus on the challenges faced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provides suggestions regarding how it may be translated into real-world interventions, as well as how the more tentative hypotheses advanced in this field may be tested during this critical period.

AB  - Antipsychotic medications are critical to child and adolescent psychiatry, from the stabilization of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression to behavioral treatment of autism spectrum disorder, tic disorders, and pediatric aggression. While effective, these medications carry serious risk of adverse events-most commonly, weight gain and cardiometabolic abnormalities. Negative metabolic consequences affect up to 60% of patients and present a major obstacle to long-term treatment. Since antipsychotics are often chronically prescribed beginning in childhood, cardiometabolic risk accumulates. An increased susceptibility to antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) has been repeatedly documented in children, particularly rapid weight gain. Associated cardiometabolic abnormalities include central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation. Lifestyle interventions and medications such as metformin have been proposed to reduce risk but remain limited in efficacy. Furthermore, antipsychotic medications touted to be weight-neutral in adults can cause substantial weight gain in children. A better understanding of the biological underpinnings of AIWG could inform targeted and potentially more fruitful treatments; however, little is known about the underlying mechanism. As yet, modest genetic studies have nominated a few risk genes that explain only a small percentage of the risk. Recent investigations have begun to explore novel potential mechanisms of AIWG, including a role for gut microbiota and microbial metabolites. This article reviews the problem of AIWG and AP metabolic side effects in pediatric populations, proposed mechanisms underlying this serious side effect, and strategies to mitigate adverse impact. We suggest future directions for research efforts that may advance the field and lead to improved clinical interventions.

AB  - Objective The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) is considered the gold standard for detecting sleep loss and circadian misalignment related changes in performance in laboratory and field settings. This short 3-, 5- or 10-min test appraises an individual's sustained vigilant attention on a visual stimulus through reaction time, false starts and performance lapses. The PVT has been widely used as a measure to assess vigilant attention among shift workers, but information evaluating the application and performance of this test in different naturalistic shift work settings is limited. The purpose of this review is to synthesise and evaluate existing literature which has used the PVT to assess and monitor psychomotor performance in response to shift work schedules and rosters performed in real-world settings. Methods A systematic search of studies examining PVT performance in response to 24/7 shift work schedules (e.g., day, afternoon, evening and night shifts) performed under naturalistic conditions was conducted. Articles were identified by searching Medline, Embase, CINHAL and PsycINFO databases in April 2020. Results The search yielded 135 results, of which 16 publications were suitable to be included in this review. Articles were grouped according to when the PVT was applied to a research cohort, which included (a) multiple instances per shift, (b) commencement and cessation of shift and (c) other varying times. Conclusions This review suggests PVT performance is typically congruent across studies when the test is applied at generally consistent time intervals. The lack of research concerning the use of the PVT during extended duty shifts (e.g., shifts and on call work > 30 h) is an area for future research.

AB  - Background: Mental disorders (MDs) are known risk factors for suicide. This systematic review updates the evidence base for this association and improves upon analytic approaches by incorporating study-level and methodological variables to account for measurement error in pooled suicide risk estimates. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to review studies on MDs as risk factors for suicide. Relevant studies were searched using PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, and existing reviews from 2010 to 19. Studies were eligible if they were longitudinal/case-control studies, representative of the general population, used diagnostic instruments, and quantified suicide risk. The outcome assessed was relative risks (RRs) for suicide due to MDs. A multi-level meta-regression approach was used to obtain pooled RRs adjusted for covariates and between-study effects. Findings: We identified 20 eligible studies yielding 69 RRs. Disorder type, age, sex, use of psychological autopsy, study design, and adjustment for confounders were tested as predictors of pooled suicide risk. Overall, all disorders were significant predictors of suicide with predicted adjusted RRs ranging from 4.11 [2.09, 8.09] for dysthymia to 7.64 [4.3, 13.58] for major depressive disorder. Interpretation: Our results indicate that MDs are important risk factors for suicide. This systematic review provides pooled RRs that have been adjusted for methodological sources of bias. Findings from our paper may inform suicide prevention strategies as part of national health agendas.

AB  - BackgroundAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe eating disorder, recognized by a relentless pursuit for thinness and extreme low body weight. The disorder is often accompanied by comorbid disorders such as anxiety and depression, and altered neuropsychological function in terms of poor set-shifting and reduced central coherence. The aim of this review was to evaluate whether neuropsychological impairments in AN are influenced by body mass index, anxiety or depression.MethodA systematic review approach was used, following the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Literature was identified via searches in PubMed, PsychInfo and Embase database, by using the search words [anorexia nervosa] AND [central coherence], and [anorexia nervosa] AND [set-shifting]. Studies were included if they were written in English, peer-reviewed, included individuals with AN, included tests measuring set-shifting and/or central coherence, investigated associations between set-shifting/central coherence with anxiety and/or depression and/or BMI. Risk of bias was assessed by using a critical appraisal checklist from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Results were summarized in a narrative synthesis.ResultsAlthough results are heterogeneous, the majority of studies report that neither body mass index (BMI), anxiety or depression is associated with altered central coherence and set-shifting in individuals with AN.ConclusionsFindings indicate that BMI, depression and anxiety does not influence neuropsychological function in AN, suggesting that it could be a characteristic of the disorder. A complete understanding of predisposing, precipitating and maintaining factors in AN needs to be addressed in future research. This could contribute to the development of better and more targeted treatment strategies.

AB  - An integrated view of the stress response requires consideration of both the emotional and hormonal sequelae of stress, which are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Understanding the extent of the association between emotions and cortisol at the momentary level can shed light on the biopsychological pathways linking stress to health. Research in this area has adopted heterogeneous approaches and produced mixed findings; thus, it is critical to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis. Systematic searches in major databases identified 22 studies (negative emotions [k = 19; 38,418 momentary observations]; positive emotions [k = 15; 31,721 momentary observations]). Meta-analysis found a significant positive association between momentary negative emotions and cortisol (r = .06, p < .001) and a significant negative association between momentary positive emotions and cortisol (r = -.05, p = .003). No methodological differences moderated these associations. Our findings suggest that emotional states correlate with cortisol levels at the momentary level. We discuss the health implications of our findings and provide recommendations for advancing this area of research.

AB  - Multimodal neuroimaging studies combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) to quantify GABA and/or glutamate concentrations and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity non-invasively have advanced understanding of how neurochemistry and neurophysiology may be related at a macroscopic level. The present study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies examining the relationship between H-1-MRS glutamate and/or GABA levels and task-related fMRI signal in the healthy brain. Ovid (Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO) and Pubmed databases were systematically searched to identify articles published until December 2019. The primary outcome of interest was the association between resting levels of glutamate or GABA and task-related fMRI. Fifty-five papers were identified for inclusion in the systematic review. A further 22 studies were entered into four separate meta-analyses. These meta-analyses found evidence of significant negative associations between local GABA levels and (a) fMRI activation to visual tasks in the occipital lobe, and (b) activation to emotion processing in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, there was no significant association between mPFC/ACC glutamate levels and fMRI activation to cognitive control tasks or to emotional processing, with the relationship to emotion processing related neural activity narrowly missing significance. Moreover, our systematic review also found converging evidence of negative associations between GABA levels and local brain activity, and positive associations between glutamate levels and distal brain activity, outside of the H-1-MRS sampling region. Albeit less consistently, additional relationships between GABA levels and distal brain activity and between glutamate levels and local brain activity were found. It remains unclear if the absence of effects for other brain regions and other cognitive-emotional domains reflects study heterogeneity or potential confounding effects of age, sex, or other unknown factors. Advances in H-1-MRS methodology as well as in the integration of H-1-MRS readouts with other imaging modalities for indexing neural activity hold great potential to reveal key aspects of the pathophysiology of mental health disorders involving aberrant interactions between neurochemistry and neurophysiology such as schizophrenia.

AB  - Background:This mixed methods review synthesizes the evidence of acceptability, effectiveness and gender-responsiveness of participatory arts interventions (PAIs) in promoting mental health and wellbeing among adults. Methods: The search was restricted to empirical studies of PAIs that reported on outcomes relating to common mental health problems and wellbeing among adults aged >= 18 years old. The mixed methods appraisal tool was used for quality appraisal. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Results:Thirty-two studies were included (1,058 participants). Typical PAI features are discussed. The evidence for effectiveness is limited by methodological issues. PAIs are perceived to benefit mental health via improved connectedness; emotional regulation; meaning-making & re-defining identity; and personal growth & empowerment. Conclusion: The review highlights the dearth of studies focused on men. Research standards to establish the evidence of effectiveness and the need to expand the evidence of acceptability beyond the "perceived effectiveness" domain are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: The present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of depression in Iranian children. Method: This meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO with code (CRD42020216632) and performed based on the MOOSE protocol and PRISMA guidelines. Title and abstract of articles were searched without time limit until April 2020 in international databases PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EBSCO, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Iranian databases.
   Results: In 34 studies with a sample size of 23,779 Iranian children, the prevalence of depression was estimated 42.3 % (95 %CI: 34.9-50.0). Prevalence of depression in girls in 20 studies with a sample size of 11,170 was estimated 42.1 % (95 %CI: 32.7-52.1) and the prevalence of depression in males in 20 studies with a sample size of 4678 was estimated 29.6 % (95 %CI: 21.2-39.7). The odds ratio of female to male depression was 1.33 (95 % CI: 1.07-1.65, P < 0.011). Prevalence of mild, moderate, major and deep depression was 20.3 % (95 %CI: 16.4-24.9), 15.0 % (95 %CI: 11.3-19.7), 14.5 % (95 %CI: 10.8-19.1), and 4.3 % (95 %CI: 1.8-9.8), respectively. In subgroup analysis for prevalence of depression in Iranian children, the variables of geographical area (P = 0.258), quality of studies (P = 0.186), type of questionnaire (P = 0.907), sample size (P = 0.500) and year of studies (P = 0.538) were not significant, but subgroup analysis of province (P < 0.001) and school grade (P < 0.001) were significant.
   Conclusion: The results of the present meta-analysis showed that depression is common in Iranian children and is much higher than global estimates. These findings emphasize the importance of identifying and providing treatment to children who are most in need.

AB  - Adult onset idiopathic dystonia (AOID) is the third most common movement disorder in adults. Co-existing depressive symptoms and disorders represent major contributors of disability and quality of life in these patients, but their prevalence remains unclear. We investigated the point prevalence of supra-clinical threshold depressive symptoms/depressive disorders in AOID in a systematic review with qualitative synthesis and metaanalysis. Our search identified 60 articles suitable for qualitative synthesis and 54 for meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of either supra-clinical threshold depressive symptoms or depressive disorders was 31.5 % for cervical dystonia, 29.2 % for cranial dystonia, and 33.6 % for clinical samples with mixed forms of AOID. Major depressive disorder was more prevalent than dysthymia in cervical dystonia, whereas dysthymia was more prevalent in cranial dystonia. In cervical dystonia, the prevalence of supra-clinical threshold depressive symptoms screened by rating scales was higher than that of depressive disorders diagnosed with structured interviews. Prevalence studies using rating scales yielded higher heterogeneity. More research is warranted to standardize screening methodology and characterization of mood disorders in AOID.

AB  - Film-based interventions have been embraced by adolescents as educational tools, but their efficacy in mental health education remains under-explored. In this review, we systematically examined the use of film-based interventions in adolescent mental health education. A systematic review of the empirical literature was conducted using the following databases: Academic Search Complete, Education Full Text [H.W. Wilson], CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Humanities Full Text [H.W. Wilson], MEDLINE, APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Social Sciences Full Text [H.W. Wilson], Soc Index, ERIC. Risk of Bias were assessed using Version 2 of the Cochrane RoB tool for randomised trials (RoB2) or the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). Ten peer-reviewed studies were included in this review. Film emerged as a promising education method for enhancing metal health literacy and reducing stigma. Mixed reports were found for improving attitudes towards help-seeking, with narrative-based films having a weaker effect on attitudes towards help-seeking when compared with more instructive approaches. No study focussed on resilience. This review highlights the utility and potential for film-based interventions in adolescent mental health education. Further research is warranted around how best to implement such interventions to engage adolescents.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, non-coding, regulatory RNA molecules that function as post transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Altered expression of multiple miRNAs was found to be extensively involved in the pathogenesis of different neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. miRNAs are implicated in the pathogenesis of excitotoxicity, apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and blood-brain barrier protection. Consequently, miRNAs can serve as biomarkers for different neurological disorders. In recent years, advances in the miRNA field led to identification of potentially novel prospects in the development of new therapies for incurable CNS disorders. MiRNA-based therapeutics include miRNA mimics and inhibitors that can decrease or increase the expression of target genes. Better understanding of the mechanisms by which miRNAs are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders may provide novel targets to researchers for innovative therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Objective To systematically review evidence for an association between parental death in childhood, and the subsequent development of an anxiety, affective or psychotic disorder.
   Methods Electronic databases (Scopus, Medline (for Ovid), EMBASE and PsychINFO) were searched for peer-reviewed, cohort studies in the English language. Meta-analyses were performed for studies reporting hazard ratios, incidence rate ratios and odds ratios. Two studies reported risk ratios, and these were included in an overall pool of odds, risk and incidence rate ratios. Sensitivity analyses were performed (removal of one study at a time) for all meta-analyses, and study quality assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
   Results Fifteen studies were retained, and where required, data were averaged in advance of pooling. Significant results were observed in studies reporting hazard ratios (k = 4, 1.48 [95% CI = 1.32-1.66]), incidence rate ratios (k = 3, 1.37 [95% CI = 1.01-1.85]), but not odds ratios (k = 4, 0.87 [95% CI = 0.72, 1.05]). However, the overall pooled effect (using odds, incidence rate and risk ratios) was statistically significant (k = 9, 1.22 [95% CI = 1.03-1.44]).
   Conclusion Overall, the evidence suggests that there is a positive association between the death of a parent before age 18, and the subsequent development of an anxiety, affective or psychotic disorder. The lack of a significant pooled effect in studies reporting results as odds ratios is likely an artefact of study design.
   Limitations Data were clustered in four countries making generalizability uncertain. Studies adjusted for a variety of possible confounders, and follow-up after death varied considerably.

AB  - Survivors of sepsis often develop long-term cognitive impairments. This review aimed at exploring the results of the behavioral tools and tests which have been used to evaluate cognitive dysfunction in different animal models of sepsis. Two independent investigators searched for sepsis-and cognition-related keywords. 6323 publications were found, of which 355 were selected based on their title, and 226 of these were chosen based on manuscript review. LPS was used to induce sepsis in 171 studies, while CLP was used in 55 studies. Inhibitory avoidance was the most widely used method for assessing aversive memory, followed by fear conditioning and continuous multi-trial inhibitory avoidance. With regard to non-aversive memory, most studies used the water maze, openfield, object recognition, Y-maze, plus maze, and radial maze tests. Both CLP and LPS models of sepsis were effective in inducing short-and long-term behavioral impairment. Our findings help elucidate the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced cognitive changes, as well as the available methods and tests used to study this in animal models.

AB  - Previous reviews have established that workplace wellbeing initiatives are effective at promoting wellbeing, but less is known about which intervention characteristics or "active ingredients" underpin this effectiveness (i.e., behavior change techniques [BCTs]). This review aims to illuminate the connections between the types of BCTs and the level of intervention intensity with intervention effectiveness. A systematic search for peer-reviewed studies evaluating a workplace wellbeing initiative was undertaken across five databases: Medline, Scopus, PsycInfo, and CINAHL (Ovid Emcare). Eligible studies included those that evaluated the effect of a workplace wellbeing initiative on participants' physical wellbeing (e.g., physical activity and quality of life) and psychological wellbeing (e.g., mental health and stress), were published between 2009 and September 2019, and utilized a comparator (e.g., control group or prepost change). Studies were screened in independent duplicate to minimize bias. Effect sizes were calculated. Following removal of duplicates, 1,541 studies were identified and screened for eligibility. Of these, 23 studies reporting 28 comparisons were deemed to meet eligibility criteria. Just over 50% of these studies reported evidence of either a strong or moderate effect across a physical and a psychological outcome, providing a positive indication that workplace wellbeing programs can promote physical and psychological wellbeing in workers. Interventions tended to employ multiple BCTs (mean range 8.1-9.4), however, no discernible patterns between the types or numbers of BCTs employed and intervention effectiveness was found. Further experimental work is required that compares and contrasts workplace wellbeing initiatives to enable a better understanding of how to develop and implement highly effective programs.

AB  - Purpose: As of November 28, 2020, COVID-19 has been reported in 220 countries with 61,036,793 confirmed cases and 1,433,316 confirmed deaths; countries became vigilant around the world. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 causing pneumonia, many studies have reported ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19. This article describes the effects and possible underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 on ischemic stroke.
   Materials and methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and other COVID-dedicated databases and the combination of the keywords 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID-19' and 'ischemic stroke' up to November 28, 2020.
   Results: SARS-CoV-2 invades the host through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is expressed not only in the lungs, but also in the brain and vascular endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause direct vascular disease or enhance the immunogenic thrombosis environment through several mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate the host immune response and can cause inflammation, coagulation disorders, renin angiotensin system disorders, hypoxia, and stress disorders, which may lead to the occurrence of ischemic stroke.
   Conclusions: Some patients with COVID-19 can develop ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke has a high risk of causing disability and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is hoped that when medical staff treat patients with COVID-19, they would pay attention to the occurrence of ischemic stroke to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Background Lebanon, an Eastern Mediterranean country, suffers a large burden of injury as a consequence of conflict and war, political instability, and the lack of policies and safety regulations. This article aims to systematically map and comprehensively describe the injury research literature in Lebanon and, to identify gaps for future research.
   Methods MEDLINE, Embase, Eric and SafetyLit, and the grey literature, including conference proceedings, theses and dissertations, government and media reports, were searched without any date or language limits. Data were extracted from 467 documents using REDCap.
   Results War-related injuries were the most prevalent type of injury in Lebanon, followed by homicide and other forms of violence. While existing literature targeted vulnerable and at-risk populations, the vast majority focused solely on reporting the prevalence of injuries and associated risk factors. There are considerable gaps in the literature dealing with the integration of preventive programs and interventions across all populations.
   Conclusions Lebanon, historically and currently, experiences a high number of injuries from many different external causes. To date, efforts have focused on reporting the prevalence of injuries and making recommendations, rather than implementing and evaluating interventions and programs to inform policies. Future injury related work should prioritize interventions and prevention programs.

AB  - Introduction: As anti-immigrant hostility toward Latino populations grows, more fervent attention is needed to consider strength-based approaches to attenuate the effects of perceived discrimination. This systematic review synthesizes the evidence about the effects of racial/ethnic discrimination on mental, physical, and health behaviors of Latinos and examines the coping mechanisms and cultural factors that attenuate the negative association between discrimination and health among adult Latinos living in the United States. Method: The search criteria included articles that (a) examined ethnic/racial discrimination in relationship to a health outcome, (b) had study samples composed of least 25% Latino adults, and (c) were written in English. Results: A total of 33 studies were included in the review. Our findings demonstrated the negative relationship between perceived discrimination, mental health, and health behaviors. The evidence for the relationship between perceived discrimination and physical health was less robust. For mental health, greater feeling of ethnic pride and belonging attenuated the negative relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential for building on ethnic identity for addressing mental health and perceived discrimination. Future research directions are outlined to address identified gaps.
