AB  - Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and NPY receptors are widely expressed in the mammalian central nervous system. Studies in both humans and rodent models revealed that brain NPY levels are altered in some neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Machado-Joseph_disease. In this review, we will focus on the roles of NPY in the pathological mechanisms of these disorders, highlighting NPY as a neuroprotective agent, as a neural stem cell proliferative agent, as an agent that increases trophic support, as a stimulator of autophagy and as an inhibitor of excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Moreover, the effect of NPY in some clinical manifestations commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Machado Joseph disease, such as depressive symptoms and body weight loss, are also discussed. In conclusion, this review highlights NPY system as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives In the midst of large-scale changes across our nation's health care system, including the Affordable Care Act and Patient-Centered Medical Home initiatives, integrated primary care models afford important opportunities for those in the field of pediatric psychology. Despite the extensive and growing attention, this subspecialty has received in recent years, a comprehensive set of core professional competencies has not been established. Methods A subset of an Integrated Primary Care Special Interest Group used two well-established sets of core competencies in integrated primary care and pediatric psychology as a basis to develop a set of integrated pediatric primary care-specific behavioral anchors. Conclusions The current manuscript describes these behavioral anchors and their development in the context of professional training as well as with regard to Triple Aim goals and securing psychology's role in integrated pediatric primary care settings.

KW  - Attitudes

KW  - teaching
AB  - A number of initiatives are aimed at reducing mental illness stigma, yet stigma remains a problem in the general population. A focus on stigma reduction with students is particularly relevant, as students often hold negative attitudes toward mental illness, have regular contact with persons experiencing mental health difficulties, and because stigma influences students' own help-seeking attitudes and behaviors. The psychology classroom presents an ideal opportunity to address stigma, since many courses include mental health-related topics and are taken by large numbers of students from diverse fields. This paper undertook a review of the published literature to determine the extent that knowledge and/or contact-based strategies to address stigma were implemented in the psychology classroom; successful interventions are described and contextualized within the larger stigma reduction literature. Recommendations for instructors who are interested in integrating an anti-stigma approach in their classroom include (1) consider a social contact-based approach, (2) look locally for resources, (3) be familiar with optimal conditions for contact, and (4) evaluate your outcomes.

AB  - Climate change has the potential to impair livestock health, with consequences for animal welfare, productivity, greenhouse gas emissions, and human livelihoods and health. Modelling has an important role in assessing the impacts of climate change on livestock systems and the efficacy of potential adaptation strategies, to support decision making for more efficient, resilient and sustainable production. However, a coherent set of challenges and research priorities for modelling livestock health and pathogens under climate change has not previously been available. To identify such challenges and priorities, researchers from across Europe were engaged in a horizon-scanning study, involving workshop and questionnaire based exercises and focussed literature reviews. Eighteen key challenges were identified and grouped into six categories based on subject-specific and capacity building requirements. Across a number of challenges, the need for inventories relating model types to different applications (e.g. the pathogen species, region, scale of focus and purpose to which they can be applied) was identified, in order to identify gaps in capability in relation to the impacts of climate change on animal health. The need for collaboration and learning across disciplines was highlighted in several challenges, e.g. to better understand and model complex ecological interactions between pathogens, vectors, wildlife hosts and livestock in the context of climate change. Collaboration between socio-economic and biophysical disciplines was seen as important for better engagement with stakeholders and for improved modelling of the costs and benefits of poor livestock health. The need for more comprehensive validation of empirical relationships, for harmonising terminology and measurements, and for building capacity for under-researched nations, systems and health problems indicated the importance of joined up approaches across nations. The challenges and priorities identified can help focus the development of modelling capacity and future research structures in this vital field. Well-funded networks capable of managing the long-term development of shared resources are required in order to create a cohesive modelling community equipped to tackle the complex challenges of climate change.

AB  - BackgroundLanguage and communication skills are essential aspects of child development, which are often disrupted in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Cutting edge research in psycholinguistics suggests that multilingualism has potential to influence social, linguistic and cognitive development. Thus, multilingualism has implications for clinical assessment, diagnostic formulation, intervention and support offered to families. We present a systematic review and synthesis of the effects of multilingualism for children with neurodevelopmental disorders and discuss clinical implications.
   MethodsWe conducted systematic searches for studies on multilingualism in neurodevelopmental disorders. Keywords for neurodevelopmental disorders were based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition categories as follows; Intellectual Disabilities, Communication Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Specific Learning Disorder, Motor Disorders, Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders. We included only studies based on empirical research and published in peer-reviewed journals.
   ResultsFifty studies met inclusion criteria. Thirty-eight studies explored multilingualism in Communication Disorders, 10 in ASD and two in Intellectual Disability. No studies on multilingualism in Specific Learning Disorder or Motor Disorders were identified. Studies which found a disadvantage for multilingual children with neurodevelopmental disorders were rare, and there appears little reason to assume that multilingualism has negative effects on various aspects of functioning across a range of conditions. In fact, when considering only those studies which have compared a multilingual group with developmental disorders to a monolingual group with similar disorders, the findings consistently show no adverse effects on language development or other aspects of functioning. In the case of ASD, a positive effect on communication and social functioning has been observed.
   ConclusionsThere is little evidence to support the widely held view that multilingual exposure is detrimental to the linguistic or social development of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, we also note that the available pool of studies is small and the number of methodologically high quality studies is relatively low. We discuss implications of multilingualism for clinical management of neurodevelopmental disorders, and discuss possible directions for future research.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThis is the first review of studies on the epidemiology of eating disorders on the African continent.Recent findingsThe majority of articles found through our search did not assess formal diagnoses, but only screened for eating attitudes and behaviors. Only four studies - including only one recent study - provided specific epidemiological data on anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and/or eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). No cases of anorexia nervosa according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria were found among a total of 1476 (young) females. The combined point-prevalence rate of bulimia nervosa is 0.87% (95% CI 0.22-1.51) and of EDNOS is 4.45% (95% CI 2.74-6.16) in young women in Africa.SummaryThe epidemiological study of eating disorders in Africa is still in its infancy. Over time in total four studies providing epidemiological data on specific, formally assessed eating disorders were found. No cases of anorexia nervosa were reported in African epidemiological studies, which concurs with the very low prevalence rates of anorexia nervosa in Latin Americans and in African Americans in the USA. With the DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa, some women in the African studies would have fulfilled the criteria for anorexia nervosa. The prevalence rate of bulimia nervosa in women in Africa is within the range reported for western populations, as well as African Americans and Latin Americans.

AB  - Krabbe's disease (KD; also called globoid cell leukodystrophy) is a genetic disorder involving demyelination of the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. The disease may be subdivided into three types, an infantile form, which is the most common and severe; a juvenile form; and a rare adult form. KD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of galactocerebrosidase activity in lysosomes, leading to accumulation of galactoceramide and neurotoxic galactosylsphingosine (psychosine [PSY]) in macrophages (globoid cells) as well as neural cells, especially in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. This ultimately results in damage to myelin in both CNS and PNS with associated morbidity and mortality. Accumulation of PSY, a lysolipid with detergent-like properties, over a threshold level could trigger membrane destabilization, leading to cell lysis. Moreover, subthreshold concentrations of PSY trigger cell signaling pathways that induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, inflammation, endothelial/vascular dysfunctions, and neuronal and axonal damage. From the time the "psychosine hypothesis" was proposed, considerable efforts have been made in search of an effective therapy for lowering PSY load with pharmacological, gene, and stem cell approaches to attenuate PSY-induced neurotoxicity. This Review focuses on the recent advances and prospective research for understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic approaches for KD. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) is a tropical evergreen tree (Fam. Meliacae; Subfam. Melioideae) traditionally well known for its medicinal value. Beneficialt effects of different parts of neem are attributed to its biologically active principle 'Azadirachtin'. Apart from Indian subcontinent, neem is widely used in African countries as therapeutics, preservatives and insecticides. Neem leaves, natural source of fiavonoids, polyphenols, isoprenoids, sulphurous and polysaccharides, play important role in scavenging the free radical and subsequently arresting disease pathogenesis. Considerable research has gone into neem for developing cost effective and non-toxic products. The present review has compiled different phytochemicals isolated from neem leaves, methods of extraction and their therapeutic use in preventing several diseases. Here, we highlighted the mechanism of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of neem leaf that underscores the disease through regulation of physiological responses. Also, multiple roles of neem leaf and commercial use of neem formulation as an alternative in paving a frontier in the field of drug discovery are discussed.

AB  - Late-life depression is a growing public health concern. Exercise may be of added value but the literature remains equivocal. We conducted a systematic overview of meta-analyses and an exploratory pooled analysis of previous meta-analyses to determine the effect of exercise on depression in older adults. Two independent researchers searched Pubmed, CINAHL, Cochrane Plus, PsycArticles, and PsycInfo for meta analyses on exercise in late-life depression. Methodological quality was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Instrument. We pooled effect sizes from previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials to determine the effect of exercise on depression in older adults. The systematic review yielded 3 meta-analyses. In total, 16 unique cohorts of 1487 participants were included. The quality of the three included meta-analyses was considered as "moderate" according to AMSTAR scores. No serious adverse events were reported. Compared to controls (n=583), those exercising (n=541) significantly reduced depressive symptoms. Our umbrella review indicates that exercise is safe and efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms in older people. Since exercise has many other known health benefits, it should be considered as a core intervention in the multidisciplinary treatment of older adults experiencing depression.

AB  - Population aging and the associated changes in demographic structures and healthcare needs is a key challenge across Europe. Healthy aging strategies focus on ensuring the ability to maintain health, quality of life and independent living at old age. Concurrent to the process of population aging, the demographics of Europe are affected by increased migration resulting in substantial ethnic diversity. In this paper, we narratively review the health profile of the growing proportion of aging migrants in Europe, outline key factors shaping health among this diverse group and consider ways of addressing their healthcare needs.
   Although factors shaping aging processes are largely similar across populations, migrant-specific risk factors exist. These include exposure to health risks before and during migration; a more disadvantaged socioeconomic position; language barriers and low health literacy; cultural factors influencing health-seeking behaviours; and psychosocial vulnerability and discrimination affecting health and quality of life. Overall, migrants experience the same morbidity and mortality causes as the native populations, but with different relative importance, severity and age of onset and with substantial differences within and between migrant groups. Little is known regarding health behaviours among aging migrants, although differences in cancer screening behaviours have been identified. Indications of widening health differentials between migrants and native populations with age and informal barriers to quality healthcare for aging migrants are causes of concern.
   In conclusion, there is a need for attention to migration alongside other determinants of healthy aging. The diversity in individual characteristics, life course processes and contextual factors shaping aging processes among migrants point to the need for a sensitive and comprehensive approach to policies, practices and research within the field of healthy aging. This is important to accommodate for the needs of the growing number of aging migrants in Europe and counter inequities in health and well-being at old age.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder with 1-3% prevalence. OCD is characterized by recurrent thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). The pathophysiology of OCD remains unclear, stressing the importance of pre-clinical studies. The aim of this article is to critically review a proposed animal model of OCD that is characterized by the induction of compulsive checking and behavioral sensitization to the D2/D3 dopamine agonist quinpirole. Changes in this model have been reported at the level of brain structures, neurotransmitter systems and other neurophysiological aspects. In this review, we consider these alterations in relation to the clinical manifestations in OCD, with the aim to discuss and evaluate axes of validity of this model. Our analysis shows that some axes of validity of quinpirole sensitization model (QSM) are strongly supported by clinical findings, such as behavioral phenomenology or roles of brain structures. Evidence on predictive validity is contradictory and ambiguous. It is concluded that this model is useful in the context of searching for the underlying pathophysiological basis of the disorder because of the relatively strong biological similarities with OCD.

AB  - The stimulation of some facial regions is known to trigger the trigemino-cardiac reflex: the main stimulus is represented by the contact of the face with water. This phenomenon called diving reflex induces a set of reactions in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems occurring in all mammals, especially marine (whales, seals). During the immersion of the face in the water, the main responses are aimed at reducing the oxygen consumption of the organism. Accordingly reduction in heart rate, peripheral vasoconstriction, blood pooling in certain organs, especially the heart, and brain and an increase in blood pressure have been reported. Moreover, the speed and intensity of the reflex is inversely proportional to the temperature of the water: more cold the water, more reactions as described are strong. In the case of deep diving an additional effect, such as blood deviation, has been reported: the blood is sequestered within the lungs, to compensate for the increase in the external pressure, preventing them from collapsing. The trigeminal-cardiac reflex is not just confined to the diving reflex; recently it has been shown that a brief proprioceptive stimulation (10 min) by jaw extension in rats produces interesting effects both at systemic and cerebral levels, reducing the arterial blood pressure, and vasodilating the pial arterioles. The arteriolar dilation is associated with rhythmic diameter changes characterized by an increase in the endothelial activity. Fascinating the stimulation of trigeminal nerve is able to activate the nitric oxide release by vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, the aim of this review was to highlight the effects due to trigeminal cardiac reflex induced by a simple mandibular extension. Opposite effects, such as hypotension, and modulation of cerebral arteriolar tone, were observed, when these responses were compared to those elicited by the diving reflex.

AB  - Adaptation is fundamental to life. All organisms adapt over timescales that span from evolution to generations and lifetimes to moment-by-moment interactions. The nervous system is particularly adept at rapidly adapting to change, and this in fact may be one of its fundamental principles of organization and function. Rapid forms of sensory adaptation have been well documented across all sensory modalities in a wide range of organisms, yet we do not have a comprehensive understanding of the adaptive cellular mechanisms that ultimately give rise to the corresponding percepts, due in part to the complexity of the circuitry. In this Perspective, we aim to build links between adaptation at multiple scales of neural circuitry by investigating the differential adaptation across brain regions and sub-regions and across specific cell types, for which the explosion of modern tools has just begun to enable. This investigation points to a set of challenges for the field to link functional observations to adaptive properties of the neural circuit that ultimately underlie percepts.

KW  - CARE MODELS
AB  - Background: The aim of health service integration is to provide a sustainable and integrated health system that better meets the needs of the end user. Yet, definitions of health service integration, methods for integrating health services, and expected outcomes are varied. This review was commissioned by Queensland Health, the government department responsible for health service delivery in Queensland, Australia, to inform efforts to integrate their mental health services. This review reports on the characteristics, reported outcomes, and design quality of studies included in systematic reviews of health service integration research.
   Method: The review was developed by systematically searching nine electronic databases to find peer-reviewed Australian and international systematic reviews with a focus on health service integration. Reviews were included if they were in the English language and published between 2000 and 2015. A standardized assessment tool was used to analyze the study design quality of included reviews. Data relating to the integration types, methods, and reported outcomes of integration were synthesized.
   Results: Seventeen publications met the inclusion criteria. Eleven (65%) reviews were published during the past 5 years, which may indicate a trend for increased awareness of the need for service integration. The majority of reviews were published by researchers in the UK (8/47%), USA (3/18%), and Australia (3/18%). Included reviews focused on a variety of integration types, including integrated care pathways, governance models, integration of interventions, collaborative/integrated care models, and integration of different types of health care. Most (53%) of the reviews reported on the cost-effectiveness of service integration, e.g., positive results, no effect, or inconclusive. Only one of the reviews reported on the importance of consumer involvement. The overall design of 70% of the reviews was high, 18% medium, and 12% low.
   Conclusion: There is no "one size fits all" approach to health service integration. Instead, this literature review highlighted the complexity of service integration, which in most primary studies involved a range of strategies. Rigorous assessments of cost-effectiveness and reporting on consumer involvement are required in future research.

AB  - One of the salient features of most neurodegenerative diseases is the aggregation of specific proteins in the brain. This proteostasis imbalance is proposed as a key event triggering the neurodegenerative cascade. The unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy pathways are emerging as critical processes implicated in handling disease-related misfolded proteins. However, in some conditions, perturbations in the buffering capacity of the proteostasis network may be part of the etiology of the disease. Thus, pharmacological or gene therapy strategies to enhance autophagy or UPR responses are becoming an attractive target for disease intervention. Here, we discuss current evidence depicting the complex involvement of autophagy and ER stress in brain diseases. Novel pathways to modulate protein misfolding are discussed including the relation between aging and growth factor signaling. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI:Autophagy.

AB  - Emerging evidence that autophagy serves as a sweeper for toxic materials in the brain gives us new insight into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis associated with metabolism. Some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are accompanied by altered metabolism and autophagy in the brain. In this review, we discuss how hormones and nutrients regulate autophagy in the brain and affect neurodegeneration.

AB  - Background: Research on health inequalities can be instrumental in drawing attention to the health of socioeconomically vulnerable groups in India in the context of rapid economic growth. It can shape the dialogue for public health action, emphasizing the need for greater investments in health, and monitor effectiveness of health programs. Our objective was to examine trends in studies on health inequalities in the last 25 years.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of studies on health inequalities published from 1990. The year, 1990, marked the beginning of economic reforms and liberalization in India. We searched PubMED using key terms to identify 8800 articles between 1990 and 2016; we identified 1,312 final studies for review. Key domains of analysis included measures of equity, health outcomes, populations studied, year of publication, study methodology, study focus (descriptive versus analytical), and location of main author.
   Results: We found an increase in studies on health inequalities after 2005. About 88 % of the studies utilized quantitative methods for analysis. About 8 % of the studies related to health interventions or programs; the number of intervention studies have been increasing since 2010. A majority of studies were led by authors based in India. Early studies focused on mortality, communicable and non-communicable diseases, and nutrition, while later studies have focused on non-communicable diseases, mental health, risk factors, and injuries. Studies on women and children comprised nearly half of the literature; studies on the youth (15-24 years or as defined by the study) and elderly have been rising. Wealth and income were the most common measures of equity, followed by education and gender. The proportion of studies on wealth, education, region and caste have stayed consistent over time, while studies on gender disparities have been rising.
   Conclusion: In a country as diverse as India with large social inequalities combined with rapid economic growth, research on health inequalities has a special significance for policy. We recommend that studies on health inequalities in the future focus on evaluations of policy and health programs, and on underrepresented health outcomes and populations.

AB  - Undocumented migrants (UMs) are at higher risk for health problems because of their irregular status and the consequences of economic and social marginalization. Moreover, the emergent reality of undocumented migration in Europe calls for action in the field of management of UM's health demands as their access to health services has become a sensitive political and social issue. In this light, this paper aims to address UMs' entitlement and barriers to healthcare and related policies citing evidence from peer-reviewed and grey literature concerning people living in a country within the European Union without the legal right to be/remain in the destination country. A systematic review was performed using several databases and websites, and a total of 54 publications in English, with full text available, were taken into consideration.
   Between 2000 and 2015, Europe hosted the second largest number of international migrants (20 million, 1.3 million per year) after Asia. Even though there is limited evidence specifically focused on UMs' health, it is possible to state that infectious diseases, chronic illnesses, mental disorders, maternal-child conditions, dental issues, acute illnesses and injuries are the most common pathologies. In most cases across Europe, UMs have access only to emergency care. Even in countries where they are fully entitled to healthcare, formal and informal barriers hinder them from being or feeling entitled to this right. Socio-cultural barriers, such as language and communication problems, lack of formal and informal social and healthcare networks and lack of knowledge about the healthcare system and about informal networks of healthcare professionals are all common impediments. From the healthcare providers' perspective, there can be difficulties in providing appropriate care and in dealing with cultural and language barriers and false identification. Communication strategies play a central role in addressing the inequalities in access to healthcare services, and the definition and provision of specific training, focused on UMs' health needs, would be desirable. Improving access to healthcare for UMs is an urgent priority since the lack of access is proven to have serious consequences for UMs' health and wellbeing. Notwithstanding, few available examples of policies and best practices aimed at overcoming barriers in the delivery of healthcare to UMs are available.

AB  - This work reviews key behavioural, neurophysiological and neuroimaging data on the neural substrates for processing the meaning of linguistic material, and tries to articulate the picture emerging from those findings with the notion of meaning coming from specific approaches in philosophy of language (the "internalist" view) and linguistics (words point at experiential clusters).
   The reviewed findings provide evidence in favour of a causal role of brain neural structures responsible for sensory, motor and even emotional experiences in attributing meaning to words expressing those experiences and, consequently, lend substantial support to an embodied and "internalist" conception of linguistic meaning. Key evidence concern verbs, nouns and adjectives with a concrete content, but the challenge that abstract domains pose to the embodied approach to language is also discussed. This work finally suggests that the most fundamental role of embodiment might be that of establishing commonalities among individual experiences of different members of a linguistic community, and that those experiences ground shared linguistic meanings.

AB  - Background
   People with a history of self-harm are at a far greater risk of suicide than the general population. However, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex.
   Aims
   To undertake the first systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies of risk factors and risk assessment scales to predict suicide following self-harm.
   Method
   We conducted a search for prospective cohort, studies of populations who had self-harmed. For the review of risk scales we also included studies examining the risk of suicide in people under specialist mental healthcare, in order to broaden the scope of the review and increase the number of studies considered. Differences in predictive accuracy between populations were examined where applicable.
   Results
   Twelve studies on risk factors and 7 studies on risk scales were included. Four risk factors emerged from the meta analysis, with robust effect sizes that showed little change when adjusted for important potential confounders. These included: previous episodes of self-harm (hazard ratio (HR)=1.68, 95% CI 1.38-2.05, K=4), suicidal intent (HR=2.7, 95% CI 1.91-3.81, K=3), physical health problems (HR=1.99, 95% CI 1.16-3.43, K=3) and male gender (HR=2.05, 95% CI 1.70-2.46, K=5). The included studies evaluated only three risk scales (Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) and Scale for Suicide Ideation). Where meta analyses were possible (BHS, SIS), the analysis was based on sparse data and a high heterogeneity was observed. The positive predictive values ranged from 1.3 to 16.7%.
   Conclusions
   The four risk factors that emerged, although of interest, are unlikely to be of much practical use because they are comparatively common in clinical populations. No scales have sufficient evidence to support their use. The use of these scales, or an over-reliance on the identification of risk factors in clinical practice, may provide false reassurance and is, therefore, potentially dangerous. Comprehensive psychosocial assessments of the risks and needs that are specific to the individual should be central to the management of people who have self-harmed.

AB  - The adrenal and gonadal stress steroids [i.e., cortisol, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)] have gathered considerable attention in the last few decades due to their very broad physiological and psychological actions. Their diurnal patterns have become a particular focus following new data implicating altered diurnal hormone patterns in various endocrine, behavioral and cardiovascular risk profiles. In this review of the current literature, we present a brief overview of the altered diurnal patterns of these hormones that may occur in relation to chronic stress, nutritional behaviors, physical exercise, drugs and sleep deprivation/shift. We also present data on the altered diurnal hormone patterns implicated in cardiometabolic and psychiatric/neurologic diseases, cancer and other complex pathologies. We consider the occasionally discrepant results of the studies, and summarize the current knowledge in this new field of interest, underlining the potential effects on both biological and psychological functioning, and assess the implications of these effects. Last, we conclude with some practical considerations and perspectives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder that affects some carriers of the fragile X premutation (PM). In PM carriers, there is a moderate expansion of a CGG trinucleotide sequence (55-200 repeats) in the fragile X gene (FMR1) leading to increased FMR1 mRNA and small to moderate decreases in the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. The key symptoms of FXTAS include cerebellar gait ataxia, kinetic tremor, sensorimotor deficits, neuropsychiatric changes, and dementia. While the specific trigger(s) that causes PM carriers to progress to FXTAS pathogenesis remains elusive, the use of animal models has shed light on the underlying neurobiology of the altered pathways involved in disease development. In this review, we examine the current use of mouse models to study PM and FXTAS, focusing on recent advances in the field. Specifically, we will discuss the construct, face, and predictive validities of these PM mouse models, the insights into the underlying disease mechanisms, and potential treatments.

AB  - Proteins along the secretory pathway are co-translationally translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as unfolded polypeptide chains. Afterwards, they are usually modified with N-linked glycans, correctly folded and stabilized by disulfide bonds. ER chaperones and folding enzymes control these processes. The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates a signaling response, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). The hallmark of this response is the coordinated transcriptional up-regulation of ER chaperones and folding enzymes. In order to discuss the importance of the proper folding of certain substrates we will address the role of ER chaperones in normal physiological conditions and examine different aspects of its contribution in neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence is at a turning point, with a substantial increase in projects aiming to implement sophisticated forms of human intelligence in machines. This research attempts to model specific forms of intelligence through brute-force search heuristics and also reproduce features of human perception and cognition, including emotions. Such goals have implications for artificial consciousness, with some arguing that it will be achievable once we overcome short-term engineering challenges. We believe, however, that phenomenal consciousness cannot be implemented in machines. This becomes clear when considering emotions and examining the dissociation between consciousness and attention in humans. While we may be able to program ethical behavior based on rules and machine learning, we will never be able to reproduce emotions or empathy by programming such control systems these will be merely simulations. Arguments in favor of this claim include considerations about evolution, the neuropsychological aspects of emotions, and the dissociation between attention and consciousness found in humans. Ultimately, we are far from achieving artificial consciousness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - People with severe mental illness (SMI) have high prevalence of lifetime victimization, but little is known about the extent and risk of recent domestic/sexual violence. The objective was to synthesize evidence on prevalence, odds, and risk factors for recent violence against people with SMI, with a focus on domestic and sexual violence. Relevant studies were identified through literature searches in Medline, Psychinf, Embase (for studies published in 2010-2015), and through existing systematic reviews (for studies published in 2000-2014). The review included 30 studies (with 16 140 SMI participants), including six on domestic violence and 11 on sexual violence. Prevalence of recent domestic violence ranged from 15-22% among women and from 4-10% among men/mixed samples; with little evidence on risk compared with the general population. Median prevalence of sexual violence was 9.9% (IQR=5.9-18.1%) in women and 3.1% (IQR=2.5-6.7%) in men; with 6-fold higher odds of victimization compared with the general population. There was little evidence on risk factors for domestic or sexual violence. In conclusion, people with SMI have a high prevalence of recent domestic and sexual violence, but little is known about risk factors for these violence types, or extent of domestic violence victimization compared to the general population.

AB  - Maternal prenatal stress is associated with preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and developmental delay. However, the impact of prenatal stress on hemodynamics during pregnancy remains unclear. This systematic review was conducted in order to assess the quality of the evidence available to date regarding the relationship between prenatal stress and maternal-fetal hemodynamics. The PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care, Trip, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases were searched using the search terms pregnancy; stress; fetus; blood; Doppler; ultrasound. Studies were eligible for inclusion if prenatal stress was assessed with standardized measures, hemodynamics was measured with Doppler ultrasound, and methods were adequately described. A specifically designed data extraction form was used. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using well-accepted quality appraisal guidelines. Of 2532 studies reviewed, 12 met the criteria for inclusion. Six reported that prenatal stress significantly affects maternal or fetal hemodynamics; six found no significant association between maternal stress and circulation. Significant relationships between prenatal stress and uterine artery resistance (RI) and pulsatility (PI) indices, umbilical artery RI, PI, and systolic/diastolic ratio, fetal middle cerebral artery PI, cerebroplacental ratio, and umbilical vein volume blood flow were found. To date, there is limited evidence that prenatal stress is associated with changes in circulation. More carefully designed studies with larger sample sizes, repeated assessments across gestation, tighter control for confounding factors, and measures of pregnancy-specific stress will clarify this relationship.

AB  - Objective: About 21,000 suicides in the United States in 2014 involved a firearm. The authors reviewed evidence from around the world regarding the relationship between firearm ownership rates and firearm suicide rates and the potential effectiveness of policy-based strategies for preventing fire-arm suicides in the United States.
   Method: Relevant publications were identified by searches of PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar from 1980 to September 2015, using the search terms suicide AND firearms OR guns. Excluding duplicates, 1,687 results were found, 60 of which were selected for inclusion; these sources yielded an additional 10 studies, for a total of 70 studies.
   Results: Case-control and ecological studies investigating geographic and temporal variations in firearm ownership and firearm suicide rates indicate that greater firearm availability is associated with higher firearm suicide rates. Time-series analyses, mostly from other countries, show that legislation reducing firearm ownership towers firearm suicide rates. Because the Second Amendment curtails legislation broadly restricting firearm access in the United States, the emphasis is shifted to restricting access for those at risk of harming themselves or others. Most suicides involve guns purchased years earlier. Targeted initiatives like gun violence restraining orders, smart gun technology, and gun safety education campaigns potentially reduce access to already purchased firearms by suicidal individuals. Such measures are too new to have evidence of effectiveness.
   Conclusions: Broadly reducing availability and access to firearms has lowered firearm suicide rates in other countries but does not appear feasible in the United States. Approaches restricting access of at-risk individuals to already purchased firearms by engaging the public and major stakeholders require urgent implementation and outcome evaluation for firearm suicide prevention.

AB  - Data science uses computer science and statistics to extract new knowledge from high-dimensional datasets (ie, those with many diff erent variables and data types). Mental health research, diagnosis, and treatment could benefi t from data science that uses cohort studies, genomics, and routine health-care and administrative data. The UK is well placed to trial these approaches through robust NHS-linked data science projects, such as the UK Biobank, Generation Scotland, and the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) programme. Data science has great potential as a low-cost, high-return catalyst for improved mental health recognition, understanding, support, and outcomes. Lessons learnt from such studies could have global implications.

AB  - The major clinical feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is impairment in motor control as a result of extensive dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The central pathological hallmark of PD is the formation of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions of insoluble proteins called Lewy bodies, of which fibrillar aggregates of misfolded alpha Synuclein are the major components. Despite intense research on the pathogenic mechanism that trigger neuronal loss and disease progression, the neurogenesis of PD remains unknown. However, studies on genetics of PD have identified specific genes and proteins linked to this disease. Genetic mutations linked with different forms of familial PD have unveiled a closer relationship between pathology and impairments at different points in the secretory pathway. Accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and disruptions in protein clearance mechanisms result in activation of an adaptive stress pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR signaling is mediated by three stress sensors that induce independent and convergent signaling branches that help to maintain homeostasis, or eventually trigger cell death under chronic stress conditions. Signs of ER stress are observed in post-mortem tissue from sporadic human PD cases and in most animal models of the disease, implicating all three branches of this cellular response. However, the exact contribution of the UPR in the progression of PD or in dopaminergic neuron survival is not yet well understood. A large number of studies reveal a clear activation of the UPR in toxicological models resembling sporadic PD, where ATF6, XBP1 and CHOP have a functional role in controlling dopaminergic neuron survival in neurotoxin-based models of PD in vivo. Also pharmacological and gene therapy approaches aimed to target different points of this pathway have revealed an important functional role in PD pathogenesis.

AB  - Prior studies suggest that foreign-born individuals have a health advantage, referred to as the Healthy Immigrant Paradox, when compared to native-born persons of the same socio-economic status. This systematic review examined whether the immigrant advantage found in health literature is mirrored by child maltreatment in general and its forms in particular. The author searched Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, CINAHL PLUS, Family and Society Studies Worldwide, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Social Work Abstracts, and SocINdex for published literature through December 2015. The review followed an evidence-based Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. The author identified 822 unique articles, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria. The reviewed data showed strong support for the healthy immigrant paradox for a general form of maltreatment and physical abuse. The evidence for emotional and sexual abuse was also suggestive of immigrant advantage though relatively small sample size and lack of multivariate controls make these findings tentative. The evidence for neglect was mixed: immigrants were less likely to be reported to Child Protective Services; however, they had higher rates of physical neglect and lack of supervision in the community data. The study results warrant confirmation with newer data possessing strong external validity for immigrant samples.

AB  - In neurological disorders, both acute and chronic neural stress can disrupt cellular proteostasis, resulting in the generation of pathological protein. However in most cases, neurons adapt to these proteostatic perturbations by activating a range of cellular protective and repair responses, thus maintaining cell function. These interconnected adaptive mechanisms comprise a 'proteostasis network' and include the unfolded protein response, the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy. Interestingly, several recent studies have shown that these adaptive responses can be stimulated by preconditioning treatments, which confer resistance to a subsequent toxic challenge - the phenomenon known as hormesis. In this review we discuss the impact of adaptive stress responses stimulated in diverse human neuropathologies including Parkinson's disease, Wolfram syndrome, brain ischemia, and brain cancer. Further, we examine how these responses and the molecular pathways they recruit might be exploited for therapeutic gain.

AB  - Protein aggregation is a common feature of the protein misfolding or conformational diseases, among them most of the neurodegenerative diseases. These disorders are a major scourge, with scarce if any effective therapies at present. Recent research has identified ER stress as a major mechanism implicated in cytotoxicity in these diseases. Whether amyloid-beta or tau in Alzheimer's, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's, huntingtin in Huntington's disease or other aggregation-prone proteins in many other neurodegenerative diseases, there is a shared pathway of oligomerization and aggregation into amyloid fibrils. There is increasing evidence in recent years that the toxic species, and those that evoke ER stress, are the intermediate oligomeric forms and not the final amyloid aggregates. This review focuses on recent findings on the mechanisms and importance of the development of ER stress upon protein aggregation, especially in neurodegenerative diseases, and possible therapeutic approaches that are being examined.

AB  - Childhood trauma has been associated with long term effects on prefrontal-limbic grey matter. A literature search was conducted to identify structural magnetic resonance imaging studies of adults with a history of childhood trauma. We performed three meta-analyses. Hedges' g effect sizes were calculated for each study providing hippocampal or amygdala volumes of trauma and non-trauma groups. Seed based differential mapping was utilised to synthesise whole brain voxel based morphometry(VBM) studies. A total of 38 articles (17 hippocampus, 13 amygdala, 19 whole brain VBM) were included in the meta-analyses. Trauma cohorts exhibited smaller hippocampus and amygdala volumes bilaterally. The most robust findings of the whole brain VBM meta-analysis were reduced grey matter in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right hippocampus amongst adults with a history of childhood trauma. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions showed results were moderated by age, gender, the cohort's psychiatric health and the study's definition of childhood trauma. We provide evidence of abnormal grey matter in prefrontal-limbic brain regions of adults with a history of childhood maltreatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concept of affordances indicates "action possibilities" as characterized by object properties the environment provides to interacting organisms. Affordances relate to both perception and action and refer to sensory-motor processes emerging from goal-directed object interaction. In contrast to stable properties, affordances may vary with environmental context. A sub-classification into stable and variable affordances was proposed in the framework of the ROSSI project (Borghi et al., 2010; Borghi and Riggio, 2015, 2009). Here, we present a coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional imaging studies on object interaction targeting consistent anatomical correlates of these different types of affordances. Our review revealed the existence of two parallel (but to some extent overlapping) functional pathways. The network for stable affordances consists of predominantly left inferior parietal and frontal cortices in the ventro-dorsal stream, whereas the network for variable affordances is localized preferentially in the dorso-dorsal stream. This is in line with the proposal of differentiated affordances: stable affordances are characterized by the knowledge of invariant object features, whereas variable affordances underlie adaptation to changing object properties.

AB  - Computerised cognitive training (CCT) is an increasingly popular intervention for people experiencing cognitive symptoms. This systematic review evaluated the evidence for CCT in adults with acquired brain injury (ABI), focusing on how outcome measures used reflect efficacy across components of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Database searches were conducted of studies investigating CCT to treat cognitive symptoms in adult ABI. Scientific quality was rated using the PEDro-P and RoBiNT Scales. Ninety-six studies met the criteria. Most studies examined outcomes using measures of mental functions (93/96, 97%); fewer studies included measures of activities/participation (41/96, 43%) or body structures (8/96, 8%). Only 14 studies (15%) provided Level 1 evidence (randomised controlled trials with a PEDro-P score 6/10), with these studies suggesting strong evidence for CCT improving processing speed in multiple sclerosis (MS) and moderate evidence for improving memory in MS and brain tumour populations. There is a large body of research examining the efficacy of CCT, but relatively few Level 1 studies and evidence is largely limited to body function outcomes. The routine use of outcome measures of activities/participation would provide more meaningful evidence for the efficacy of CCT. The use of body structure outcome measures (e.g., neuroimaging) is a newly emerging area, with potential to increase understanding of mechanisms of action for CCT.

AB  - Objective ADHD is a prevalent and highly heritable mental disorder associated with significant impairment, morbidity and increased rates of mortality. This combination of high prevalence and high morbidity/mortality seen in ADHD and other mental disorders presents a challenge to natural selection-based models of human evolution. Several hypotheses have been proposed in an attempt to resolve this apparent paradox. The aim of this study was to review the evidence for these hypotheses.
   Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature on empirical investigations of natural selection-based evolutionary accounts for ADHD in adherence with the PRISMA guideline. The PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were screened for relevant publications, by combining search terms covering evolution/selection with search terms covering ADHD.
   Results The search identified 790 records. Of these, 15 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and three were included in the review. Two of these reported on the evolution of the seven-repeat allele of the ADHD-associated dopamine receptor D4 gene, and one reported on the results of a simulation study of the effect of suggested ADHD-traits on group survival. The authors of the three studies interpreted their findings as favouring the notion that ADHD-traits may have been associated with increased fitness during human evolution. However, we argue that none of the three studies really tap into the core symptoms of ADHD, and that their conclusions therefore lack validity for the disorder.
   Conclusions This review indicates that the natural selection-based accounts of ADHD have not been subjected to empirical test and therefore remain hypothetical.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) interventions have shown promising in improving core symptoms of children and adolescents with ADHD, yet treatment dropout may pose a challenge to routine implementation in clinical practice. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence and predictors of treatment dropout from PA interventions in children and adolescents with ADHD. Electronic databases were searched from inception until 06/2016. Randomized control trials of PA interventions in children and adolescents with ADHD reporting dropout rates were included. A random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were performed. In 8 studies involving 9 PA intervention arms, 148 children or adolescents assigned to a PA intervention (mean age range = 8.2-15.8 years, 87.8% male) were included. The trim and fill adjusted treatment dropout rate was 17.5% (95%CI = 9.8%-29.4%). The prevalence of dropouts in exercisers was not significantly different from the dropouts in control conditions (odds ratio, OR = 1.12; 95%CI = 0.48-2.65; I-2 = 0). Lower dropout was observed in sports interventions compared with structured aerobic exercise or yoga (p = 0.049). A higher proportion of male participants (beta = 0.05; 95%CI = 0.001 to 0.10; p = 0.045, R-2 = 1.0) appeared to moderate higher dropout rates from PA interventions. Our findings suggest that in order to maximize PA participation, and therefore health benefits, sports-related interventions should be offered in the multidisciplinary treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD. Our data also suggest that males with ADHD may be more likely to dropout. Dropout rates are comparable to control conditions, suggesting that PA interventions are feasible in adolescents with ADHD.

AB  - is acknowledged that people with a schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis experience higher levels of stigma compared to any other mental health diagnosis. As a consequence, their experience of internalised stigma is likely to be the most detrimental and pervasive. Internalised stigma interventions have shown some benefits in those who experience serious mental illness including those with a schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis. A systematic narrative review and meta-analysis were conducted examining the efficacy of internalised stigma interventions for people with a schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis. Randomised Controlled Trials, controlled trials, and cohort studies were included and assessed against quality criteria. The search identified 12 studies; 7 randomised controlled trials, 3 cohort studies and 2 controlled trials. A variety of psychosocial interventions were utilised with the majority employing Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), psychoeducation and social skills training. The core outcomes used to examine the efficacy of the intervention were internalised stigma, self-esteem, empowerment, and functioning. The meta-analysis revealed an improvement in internalised stigma favouring the internalised stigma intervention but was not significant (5 RCTs, n=200). Self-efficacy and insight were significantly improved favouring the internalised stigma intervention. Internalised stigma interventions show promise in those with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses. Existing interventions have demonstrated small effects and employed small samples. Large scale RCTs are required to further develop the evidence base of more targeted interventions.

AB  - Purpose: Although the predictive value of vagal nerve activity, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), has been confirmed in a variety of diseases, its value in the prediction of survival in cancer patients still remains controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the predictive value of HRV in cancer patients in an evidence based manner.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted through a comprehensive search of the PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Library databases for all studies regarding HRV, vagal nerve activity and cancer. Pooled data of overall survival was analyzed.
   Results: Six studies with 1286 patients were included in our meta analysis. Analysis of the pooled data revealed that overall survival was significantly longer in the higher HRV group than in the lower HRV group (HR 0.70, 95% CI [0.60, 0.82]; P < 0.001, 12 = 27%).
   Conclusion: The current evidence indicates a predictive value of HRV in the survival of patients with cancer and higher vagal nerve activity might predict longer survival, but the results should be applied with caution considering the heterogeneity between included studies.

AB  - Recent prospective studies in emergency services have identified impaired fear extinction learning and memory to be a significant predictor of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), complementing a wealth of cross-sectional evidence of extinction deficits associated with the disorder. Additional fields of research show specific risk factors and biomarkers of the disorder, including candidate genotypes, stress and sex hormones, cognitive factors, and sleep disturbances. Studies in mostly nonclinicat populations also reveal that the aforementioned factors are involved in fear extinction learning and memory. Here, we provide a comprehensive narrative review of the literature linking PTSD to these risk factors, and linking these risk factors to impaired fear extinction. On balance, the evidence suggests that fear extinction may play a role in the relationship between risk factors and PTSD. Should this notion hold true, this review carries important implications for the improvement of exposure-based treatments, as well as strategies for the implementation of treatment.

AB  - I begin with some memories of Abdus Salam who was my PhD supervisor. After reviewing the theory of nonlinear realisations and Kac-Moody algebras, I explain how to construct the nonlinear realisation based on the Kac-Moody algebra E-11 and its vector representation. I explain how this field theory leads to dynamical equations which contain an infinite number of fields defined on a space-time with an infinite number of coordinates. I then show that these unique dynamical equations, when truncated to low level fields and the usual coordinates of space-time, lead to precisely the equations of motion of 11-dimensional supergravity theory. By taking different group decompositions of E-11 we find all the maximal supergravity theories, including the gauged maximal supergravities, and as a result the nonlinear realisation should be thought of as a unified theory that is the low energy effective action for type II strings and branes. These results essentially confirm the E-11 conjecture given many years ago.

AB  - The Deepwater Horizon oil spill constituted an ecosystem-level injury in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Much oil spread at 1100-1300 m depth, contaminating and affecting deepwater habitats. Factors such as oil biodegradation, ocean currents and response measures (dispersants, burning) reduced coastal oiling. Still, >2100 km of shoreline and many coastal habitats were affected. Research demonstrates that oiling caused a wide range of biological effects, although worst-case impact scenarios did not materialize. Biomarkers in individual organisms were more informative about oiling stress than population and community indices. Salt marshes and seabird populations were hard hit, but were also quite resilient to oiling effects. Monitoring demonstrated little contamination of seafood. Certain impacts are still understudied, such as effects on seagrass communities. Concerns of long-term impacts remain for large fish species, deep-sea corals, sea turtles and cetaceans. These species and their habitats should continue to receive attention (monitoring and research) for years to come. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is reported as one of the most complex chronic diseases worldwide. In the United States, Type 2 DM (T2DM) is the seventh leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Individuals with diabetes require lifelong personal care to reduce the possibility of developing long-term complications. A good knowledge of diabetes risk factors, including obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, family history of DM, and sedentary lifestyle, play an essential role in prevention and treatment. Also, sociodemographic, economic, psychological, and environmental factors are directly and indirectly associated with diabetes control and health outcomes. Our review intends to analyze the interaction between demographics, knowledge, environment, and other diabetes-related factors based on an extended literature search, and to provide insight for improving glycemic control and reducing the incidence of chronic complications.

AB  - Context: More than half of the bipolar disorder (BD) cases have an additional diagnosis; one of the most difficult to manage is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Although some authors recently investigated the co-occurrence of anxiety and BD, the topic remains insufficiently studied. The current study aimed to investigate differences in comorbid OCD between BD-I and BD-II.
   Evidence Acquisition: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on the prevalence and predictors of comorbid BDI/BD-II and OCD. Relevant papers published until June 30, 2015 were identified searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library.
   Results: Fourteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of BD-I in OCD was 3.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4 to 6.4, I2 = 83%, Q = 56) while that of BD-II in OCD was 13.5% (95% CI, 9.3 to 19.3, I2 = 89%, Q = 91). The pooled prevalence of OCD in BD-I was 21.7 (95% CI, 4.8 to 60.3, I2 = 84%, Q = 95). With regard to OCD-BD predictors, mean age and rate of males did not predict the prevalence of BD-I (beta = 0.0731, 95% CI, -0.1097 to 0.256, z = 0.78; beta = 0.035, 95% CI, -0.2356 to 0.1656, z = 0.34) and BD-II (beta = 0.0577, 95% CI, -0.1942 to 0.0788, z = 0.83; beta = -0.0317, 95% CI, -0.1483 to 0.085, z = 0.53) in OCD. The mean age explained some of the observed heterogeneity (R2 = 0.13; R2 = 0.08).
   Conclusions: This first systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and predictors of comorbid BD-I/BD-II and OCD suggests that BD-OCD comorbidity is a common condition in psychiatry. However, the available evidence does not allow to assess whether BD-I or BD-II are more common in patients with OCD.

AB  - Background: Socioeconomic trends herald what many describe as the Asian Century, whereby Asian economic, political and cultural influence is in global ascendency. Broadening relevant ties between Australia and Asia is evident and logical and may include strengthening alliances in mental health systems.
   Aim: We argue the importance of strengthening Asian mental health systems and some of the roles Australian mental health workers could have in promoting strengthening the Asian mental health system.
   Methods: This paper is a narrative review which sources data from reputable search databases.
   Results: A well-articulated Australian strategy to support strengthening the mental health system in Asia is lacking. While there are active initiatives operating in this space, these remain fragmented and underdeveloped. Coordinated, collaborative and culturally respectful efforts to enhance health education, research, policy, leadership and development assistance are key opportunities.
   Conclusion: Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have a unique opportunity to contribute to improved mental health outcomes in Asia.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally classified as a movement disorder because patients mainly complain about motor symptoms. Recently, non-motor symptoms of PD have been recognized by clinicians and scientists as early signs of PD, and they are detrimental factors in the quality of life in advanced PD patients. It is crucial to comprehensively understand the essence of behavioral assessments, from the simplest measurement of certain symptoms to complex neuropsychological tasks. We have recently reviewed behavioral assessments in PD research with animal models (Asakawa et al., 2016). As a companion volume, this article will systematically review the behavioral assessments of motor and non-motor PD symptoms of human patients in current research. The major aims of this article are: (1) promoting a comparative understanding of various behavioral assessments in terms of the principle and measuring indexes; (2) addressing the major strengths and weaknesses of these behavioral assessments for a better selection of tasks/tests in order to avoid biased conclusions due to inappropriate assessments; and (3) presenting new concepts regarding the development of wearable devices and mobile internet in future assessments. In conclusion we emphasize the importance of improving the assessments for non-motor symptoms because of their complex and unique mechanisms in human PD brains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Millions of individuals with active TB do not receive recommended treatments, and instead may use botanicals, or use botanicals concurrently with established treatments. Many botanicals protect against oxidative stress, but this can interfere with redox-dependent activation of isoniazid and other prodrugs used for prophylaxis and treatment of TB, as suggested by results of a recent clinical trial of the South African botanical Sutherlandia frutescens (L.) R. Br. (Sutherlandia). Here we provide a brief summary of Sutherlandia's effects upon rodent microglia and neurons relevant to tuberculosis of the central nervous system (CNSTB). We have observed that ethanolic extracts of Sutherlandia suppress production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rat primary cortical neurons stimulated by NMDA and also suppress LPS-and interferon gamma (IFN gamma)-induced ROS and nitric oxide (NO) production by microglial cells. Sutherlandia consumption mitigates microglial activation in the hippocampus and striatum of ischemic brains of mice. RNAseq analysis indicates that Sutherlandia suppresses gene expression of oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling and toll-like receptor pathways that can reduce the host's immune response to infection and reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As a precautionary measure, we recommend that individuals receiving isoniazid for pulmonary or cerebral TB, be advised not to concurrently use botanicals or dietary supplements having antioxidant activity.

AB  - The term "territory" and its correlates have become commonplace in the field of Mental Health since the psychiatric reform, a potentially emancipatory milestone in non-hospital-centered ideals. However, in a previous empirical study, we found a lack of consistent concepts and practices (corresponding to the use of this term) in the territorial reinsertion of persons with mental illness. To clarify the term's various uses and its possible correlations in practice, we have conducted a systematic survey of scientific articles and official documents, comparing them to each other and with the concept of territory from Critical Geography. We conclude that in the Mental Health field in Brazil, despite numerous and repeated critical efforts, a functional notion of territory has prevailed, overlooking power relations and symbolic appropriations, increasing the tendency of subjecting the reinsertion of persons with mental illness to a given territory rather than favoring socio-spatial transformations for the coexistence of differences.

AB  - Manual actions are a hallmark of humanness. Their underlying neural circuitry gives rise to species specific skills and interacts with language processes. In particular, multiple studies show that hand-related expressions - verbal units evoking manual activity - variously affect concurrent manual actions, yielding apparently controversial results (interference, facilitation, or null effects) in varied time windows. Through a systematic review of 108 experiments, we show that such effects are driven by several factors, such as the level of verbal processing, action complexity, and the time-lag between linguistic and motor processes. We reconcile key empirical patterns by introducing the Hand-Action-Network Dynamic Language Embodiment (HANDLE) model, an integrative framework based on neural coupling dynamics and predictive-coding principles. To conclude, we assess HANDLE against the backdrop of other action-cognition theories, illustrate its potential applications to understand high-level deficits in motor disorders, and discuss key challenges for further development. In sum, our work aligns with the 'pragmatic turn', moving away from passive and static representationalist perspectives to a more dynamic, enactive, and embodied conceptualization of cognitive processes.

AB  - Human emotional experiences naturally occur while interacting in a spontaneous, dynamic and response contingent fashion with other humans. This resonates with both theoretical considerations as well as neuroimaging findings that illustrate the nexus between the "social" and "emotional" brain suggesting a domain-general organization of the brain. Nevertheless, most knowledge in affective neuroscience stems from studying the brain in isolation from its natural social environment. Whether social interactions are constitutive or not to the understanding of other people's intentions, incorporating such interactions is clearly required for ecological validity. Moreover, since interpersonal interactions may influence emotional experiences and expressions, interactive paradigms may advance the theoretical understanding of what emotions are and what about them is social, and will correspondingly characterize their underlying neural substrates. We highlight the recent conceptual and experimental advances of bringing realistic social interactions into the neuroimaging lab; review emotion-induction paradigms and consider their congruency with features of social interactions; and emphasize the importance of embedding such spontaneous and dynamic interactive paradigms in the field of affective neuroscience.

   Trials evaluating efficacy of omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAS) in major depressive disorder report discrepant findings.
   Aims
   To establish the reasons underlying inconsistent findings among randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of omega-3 HUFAS for depression and to assess implications for further trials.
   Method
   A systematic bibliographic search of double-blind RCTs was conducted between January 1980 and July 2014 and an exploratory hypothesis-testing meta-analysis performed in 35 RCTs including 6665 participants receiving omega-3 HUFAs and 4373 participants receiving placebo.
   Results
   Among participants with diagnosed depression, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-predominant formulations (>50% EPA) demonstrated clinical benefits compared with placebo (Hedge's G=0.61, P<0.001) whereas docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-predominant formulation's (>50% DHA) did not. EPA failed to prevent depressive symptoms among populations not diagnosed for depression.
   Conclusions
   Further RCTs should be conducted on study populations with diagnosed or clinically significant depression of adequate duration using EPA-predominant omega-3 HUFA formulations.

AB  - Current pharmacological strategies for Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common neurological movement disorder worldwide, are predominantly symptom relieving and are often plagued with undesirable side effects after prolonged treatment. Despite this, they remain as the mainstay treatment for PD due to the lack of better alternatives. Nutraceuticals are compounds derived from natural food sources that have certain therapeutic value and the advent of which has opened doors to the use of alternative strategies to tackle neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. Notably, nutraceuticals are able to position themselves as a "safer'' strategy due to the fact that they are naturally derived compounds, therefore possibly having less side effects. Significant efforts have been put into better comprehending the role of nutraceuticals in PD, and we will look at some of them in this review. Broadly speaking, these compounds execute their positive effects via modulating signalling pathways, inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, as well as regulating mitochondrial homoeostasis. Importantly, we will highlight how a component of green tea, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), confers neuroprotection in PD via its ability to activate AMP kinase and articulate how its beneficial effects in PD are possibly due to enhancing mitochondrial quality control.

AB  - Objective: The authors examined the safety and efficacy of antidepressants added to antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia.
   Method: Multiple databases and previous publications were searched through June 2015 to identify all randomized controlled trials of any add-on antidepressants compared with placebo or no-treatment in schizophrenia. Depressive and negative symptoms (primary outcomes), overall symptoms, positive symptoms, side effects, exacerbation of psychosis, and responder rates were examined. Subgroup, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were performed, as well as investigations of publication bias and risk of bias.
   Results: Eighty-two randomized controlled trials with a total of 3,608 participants were included. Add-on antidepressants appeared more efficacious than controls for depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.25, 95% Cl = -0.38 to -0.12), negative symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.30, 95% Cl = -0.44 to -0.16), overall symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.24, 95% Cl = -0.39 to -0.09), positive symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.17, 95% Cl = -0.33 to -0.01), quality of life (standardized mean difference: -0.32, 95% Cl = -0.57 to -0.06), and responder rate (risk ratio: 1.52, 95% Cl = 1.29 to 1.78; number needed-to-treat-to-benefit: 5, 95% Cl = 4 to 7). The effects on depressive and negative symptoms appeared more pronounced when minimum thresholds of these symptoms were inclusion criteria (standardized mean difference: -0.34, 95% Cl = -0.58 to -0.09 and standardized mean difference:-0.58, 95% Cl = -0.94 to -0.21, respectively). There were no significant differences between antidepressants and controls in terms of exacerbation of psychosis, premature discontinuation, and the number of participants with at least one adverse event. More patients taking add-on antidepressants suffered from abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness, and dry mouth.
   Conclusions: Analysis of primary outcomes (depressive and negative symptoms) suggests small, beneficial effects of adjunctive antidepressants. It would appear that this augmentation can be accomplished with a tow risk of exacerbation of psychosis and adverse effects. However, secondary and subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously and considered exploratory.

AB  - Methoxetamine (MXE) is a novel psychoactive compound (NPS) that emerged in 2010 as a substitute for the dissociative anaesthetic ketamine. MXE has a reputation of carrying a lower risk of harm than ketamine, however a number of deaths have been reported. Currently very little is known about the psychopharmacological effects of this compound or its toxicity; therefore we tested, in Wistar rats, the effects of MXE in a series of behavioural tasks, measured its pharmacokinetics and urinary metabolites.
   Locomotor activity and its spatial characteristics (in the open field) and sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition; PPI) were evaluated after 5, 10 and 40 mg/kg subcutaneous (sc.) MXE. Pharmacokinetics and brain: serum ratios were evaluated after 10 mg/kg sc. MXE so that peak drug concentration data could be used to complement interpretation of maximal behavioural effects. Finally, quantification of metabolites in rat urine collected over 24 h was performed after single bolus of MXE 40 mg/kg sc.
   5 and 10 mg/kg MXE induced significant locomotor stimulation, in addition it increased thigmotaxis and decreased time spent in the centre of the open field (indicative of anxiogenesis). By contrast, 40 mg/kg reduced locomotion and increased time spent in the centre of the arena, suggesting sedation/anaesthesia or stereotypy. The duration of effects was present for at least 60-90 min, although for 5 mg/kg, locomotion diminished after 60 min. MXE decreased baseline acoustic startle response (ASR) and disrupted PPI, irrespective of testing-onset. MXE (all doses) reduced habituation but only at 60 min. Maximal brain levels of MXE were observed 30 min after administration, remained high at 60 min and progressively declined to around zero after six hours. MXE accumulated in the brain; the brain: serum ratio was between 2.06 and 2.93 throughout the whole observation. The most abundant urinary metabolite was O-desmethylmethoxetamine followed by normethoxetamine.
   To conclude, MXE acts behaviourally as a typical dissociative anaesthetic with stimulant and anxiogenic effects at lower doses, sedative/anaesthetic effects at higher doses, and as a disruptor of sensorimotor gating. Its duration of action exceeds that of ketamine which is consistent with reports from MXE users. The accumulation of the drug in brain tissue might reflect MXE's stronger potency compared to ketamine and indicate increased toxicity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stroke is the second foremost cause of mortality worldwide and a major cause of long-term disability. Due to changes in lifestyle and an aging population, the incidence of stroke continues to increase and stroke mortality predicted to exceed 12 % by the year 2030. However, the development of pharmacological treatments for stroke has failed to progress much in over 20 years since the introduction of the thrombolytic drug, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. These alarming circumstances caused many research groups to search for alternative treatments in the form of neuroprotectants. Here, we consider the potential use of phytochemicals in the treatment of stroke. Their historical use in traditional medicine and their excellent safety profile make phytochemicals attractive for the development of therapeutics in human diseases. Emerging findings suggest that some phytochemicals have the ability to target multiple pathophysiological processes involved in stroke including oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of plant sources rich in phytochemicals may reduce stroke risk, and so reinforce the possibility of developing preventative or neuroprotectant therapies for stroke. In this review, we describe results of preclinical studies that demonstrate beneficial effects of phytochemicals in experimental models relevant to stroke pathogenesis, and we consider their possible mechanisms of action.

AB  - Emotion recognition has been identified as critical in the development of social communication and interaction in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The literature review investigated interventions incorporating technology to target emotion recognition. The search yielded 10 pertinent studies conducted from 2010 to 2016, which examined the efficacy of discrete trial training and videos, FaceSay, Mind Reading, The Transporters, and MiX. The limited number of studies which addressed emotion recognition provides promising results. However, the studies contain methodological limitations and implications for future research, which include controlling confounding variables, including individuals with low functioning ASD, identifying participant prerequisite skills, determining treatment frequency and duration boundaries, and enhancing generalization and maintenance of emotion recognition skills.

AB  - Hydrocarbon discharges into the ocean, both regulated and accidental, occur from offshore drilling and production operations, and can result in oil sheen (<= 3 mu m thick) and slick (>3 mu m thick) formation, potentially harming marine birds. Sheens may commonly occur around offshore oil and gas platforms in Atlantic Canada, however, there is little information on regularity of occurrence. Further, there are few direct studies on potential impacts of sheens, associated with offshore oil and gas operations, on marine birds. We reviewed potential sources and frequency of hydrocarbon accumulation on sea surfaces from offshore oil and gas operations in Atlantic Canada, and the likelihood of overlap with marine birds. We conducted a literature review on lethal and sub-lethal effects of low levels of oil contact and ingestion on marine birds, focusing on studies that describe measured dosages of oil. We extrapolated from these data on low-dose oil exposure to link possible effects to marine birds resulting from exposure to sheens. We found that sheens occur around production operations in Atlantic Canada at allowable levels of oil concentrations in produced water. Frequency and extent of occurrence cannot be estimated from current monitoring practices. While immediate lethal effects to seabirds likely are not common from external oiling of feathers from sheens, added stressors, such as cold weather, can result in external oiling from sheens having significant impact on seabird metabolic rate and can be ultimately lethal. Ingestion of small amounts of oil, doses that realistically could be expected from exposure to sheens, in some cases resulted in sub-lethal effects to adult seabirds, primarily affecting metabolic rate, sub-lethal health impacts, and reproductive output. Nestlings and eggs do not come in direct contact with sheens, yet these life stages are highly sensitive to oil, and transfer of oil from adults exposed to sheens likely is above tolerance levels at times. Negative effects to reproductive output from small doses of ingested oil could be causing undetected impacts on marine birds and marine bird populations. Lack of standardized monitoring of marine bird contact with sheens and potential harm makes assessments of magnitude and extent of impact problematic.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a range of motor symptoms. Besides the cardinal symptoms (akinesia and bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity), PD patients show additional motor deficits, including: gait disturbance, impaired handwriting, grip force and speech deficits, among others. Some of these motor symptoms (e.g., deficits of gait, speech, and handwriting) have similar clinical profiles, neural substrates, and respond similarly to dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Here, we provide an extensive review of the clinical characteristics and neural substrates of each of these motor symptoms, to highlight precisely how PD and its medical and surgical treatments impact motor symptoms. In conclusion, we offer a unified framework for understanding the range of motor symptoms in PD. We argue that various motor symptoms in PD reflect dysfunction of neural structures responsible for action selection, motor sequencing, and coordination and execution of movement.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) affects millions around the world. The Braak hypothesis proposes that in PD a pathologic agent may penetrate the nervous system via the olfactory bulb, gut, or both and spreads throughout the nervous system. The agent is unknown, but several environmental exposures have been associated with PD. Here, we summarize and examine the evidence for such environmental exposures. We completed a comprehensive review of human epidemiologic studies of pesticides, selected industrial compounds, and metals and their association with PD in PubMed and Google Scholar until April 2016. Most studies show that rotenone and paraquat are linked to increased PD risk and PD-like neuropathology. Organochlorines have also been linked to PD in human and laboratory studies. Organophosphates and pyrethroids have limited but suggestive human and animal data linked to PD. Iron has been found to be elevated in PD brain tissue but the pathophysiological link is unclear. PD due to manganese has not been demonstrated, though a parkinsonian syndrome associated with manganese is well-documented. Overall, the evidence linking paraquat, rotenone, and organochlorines with PD appears strong; however, organophosphates, pyrethroids, and polychlorinated biphenyls require further study. The studies related to metals do not support an association with PD.

AB  - Objective To assess the impact on health-related outcomes, of group microfinance schemes based on collective empowerment.
   Methods We searched the databases Social Sciences Citation Index, Embase, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, Social Policy & Practice and Conference Proceedings Citation Index for articles published between 1 January 1980 and 29 February 2016. Articles reporting on health impacts associated with group-based microfinance were included in a narrative synthesis.
   Findings We identified one cluster-randomized control trial and 22 quasi-experimental studies. All of the included interventions targeted poor women living in low- or middle-income countries. Some included a health-promotion component. The results of the higher quality studies indicated an association between membership of a microfinance scheme and improvements in the health of women and their children.The observed improvements included reduced maternal and infant mortality, better sexual health and, in some cases, lower levels of interpersonal violence. According to the results of the few studies in which changes in empowerment were measured, membership of the relatively large and well-established microfinance schemes generally led to increased empowerment but this did not necessarily translate into improved health outcomes. Qualitative evidence suggested that increased empowerment may have contributed to observed improvements in contraceptive use and mental well-being and reductions in the risk of violence from an intimate partner.
   Conclusion Membership of the larger, well-established group-based microfinance schemes is associated with improvements in some health outcomes. Future studies need to be designed to cope better with bias and to assess negative as well as positive social and health impacts.

AB  - Objective: A systematic review was conducted of the biomedical literature regarding pastoral care (PaC) providers on inpatient psychiatric units with the aim of answering 3 questions: (1) What are the risks and benefits of PaC providers' presence on inpatient psychiatric units? (2) What are current recommendations for integration of PaC providers into a psychiatric team? and (3) What gaps exist in the literature?
   Methods: PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched from the start of each database to July 9, 2014 using terms related to PaC providers and inpatient psychiatry. Two independent reviewers performed full-text reviews of each article identified by independent review of all titles/abstracts from the electronic search and by a hand search of articles included in reference lists. Inclusion criteria were: English-language article, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and focus on a PaC provider working in a psychiatric hospital setting. One author performed data extraction.
   Results: Forty-nine articles were identified by electronic (84%) and hand search (16%), 18 of which were evaluative studies: 5 qualitative and 13 quantitative. Most of the literature viewed integration of PaC providers in inpatient treatment teams as beneficial. Potential harms were noted and mitigation strategies suggested, including providing training to PaC providers concerning psychiatric illness, clearly defining roles, and enhancing team integration. None of the articles reported outcomes data.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric inpatients often have unmet spiritual needs. Although the literature suggests potential benefits of PaC providers for psychiatric inpatients, more rigorous studies are needed to establish these benefits as efficacious. The authors of this review recommend the cautious integration of PaC providers into the psychiatric inpatient care team.

In addition, it considered developmental level (age) as a moderator of the social anxiety-internet use relationship.
   Method: We conducted a literature search using PubMed and PsycINFO databases. Our meta-analysis was based on 22 studies and included 13,460 participants.
   Results and discussion: Results indicated that social anxiety (a) is correlated positively with feelings of comfort online, (b) is not correlated with total time spent online, email use and IM, but is correlated positively with time spent on gamming, and (c) is correlated positively with PIU. The study also found developmental level to be a moderator of the correlations between social anxiety and internet use variables. Research and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - Chronic neuroinflammation is a pathological feature of a number of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and is mediated by sustained activation of microglial cells, the innate immune cells of the CNS. Studies have mainly focused on identifying the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of microglial activation. This is crucial in designing therapeutic strategies for neuropathologies in which prolonged microglial activation is known to exacerbate disease condition. In recent years, increasing evidence show that naturally occurring compounds present in regular diet could function as "nutraceuticals,'' arresting microglial activation, and thus conferring neuroprotection. This review summarizes our understanding of the role of dietary phenolic nutraceuticals in mitigating microgliamediated neuroinflammation. Studies show that these natural phenols inhibit key signaling pathways in activated microglia such as the NFjB, MAPK and JAK-STAT that trigger microglia-mediated inflammation in various neuropathological conditions such as injury, infection, stroke, autism and neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect exerted by these natural phenols have shown considerable success in improving disease condition in animal models of neuropathologies, and thus seem to be suitable candidates for developing therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Neurodegenerative conditions present a group of complex disease pathologies mostly due to unknown aetiology resulting in neuronal death and permanent neurological disability. Any undesirable stress to the brain, disrupts homeostatic balance, through a remarkable convergence of pathophysiological changes and immune dysregulation. The crosstalk between inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms results in the release of neurotoxic mediators apparently spearheaded by myeloperoxidase derived from activated microglia, astrocytes, neurons as well as peripheral inflammatory cells. These isolated entities combinedly have the potential to flare up and contribute significantly to neuropathology and disease progression. Recent, clinicopathological evidence support the association of myeloperoxidase and its cytotoxic product, hypochlorous acid in a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, Stroke, Epilepsy etc. But the biochemical and mechanistic insights into myeloperoxidase mediated neuroinflammation and neuronal death is still an uncharted territory. The current review outlines the emerging recognition of myeloperoxidase in neurodegeneration, which may offer novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets for neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is one of the main pollutants in paddy fields, and its accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and subsequent transfer to food chain is a global environmental issue. This paper reviews the toxic effects, tolerance mechanisms, and management of Cd in a rice paddy. Cadmium toxicity decreases seed germination, growth, mineral nutrients, photosynthesis, and grain yield. It also causes oxidative stress and genotoxicity in rice. Plant response to Cd toxicity varies with cultivars, growth condition, and duration of Cd exposure. Under Cd stress, stimulation of antioxidant defense system, osmoregulation, ion homeostasis, and over production of signaling molecules are important tolerance mechanisms in rice. Several strategies have been proposed for the management of Cd-contaminated paddy soils. One such approach is the exogenous application of hormones, osmolytes, and signaling molecules. Moreover, Cd uptake and toxicity in rice can be decreased by proper application of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, zinc, iron, and selenium in Cd-contaminated soils. In addition, several inorganic (liming and silicon) and organic (compost and biochar) amendments have been applied in the soils to reduce Cd stress in rice. Selection of low Cd-accumulating rice cultivars, crop rotation, water management, and exogenous application of microbes could be a reasonable approach to alleviate Cd toxicity in rice. To draw a sound conclusion, long-term field trials are still required, including risks and benefit analysis for various management strategies.

AB  - This article provides an overview of the history of substance use and misuse and chronicles the long shared history humans have had with psychoactive substances, including alcohol. The practical and personal functions of substances and the prevailing views of society towards substance users are described for selected historical periods and within certain cultural contexts. This article portrays how the changing historical and cultural milieu influences the prevailing medical, moral, and legal conceptualizations of substance use as reflected both in popular opinion and the consensus of the scientific community and represented by the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Finally, this article discusses the efforts to classify substance use disorders (SUDs) and associated psychopathology in the APA compendium. Controversies both lingering and resolved in the field are discussed, and implications for the future of SUD diagnoses are identified.

AB  - Chronic stress and its subsequent effects on biological stress systems have long been recognized as predisposing and perpetuating factors in chronic fatigue, although the exact mechanisms are far from being completely understood. In this review, we propose that sensitivity of immune cells to glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines (CATs) may be the missing link in elucidating how stress turns into chronic fatigue. We searched for in vitro studies investigating the impact of GCs or CATs on mitogen-stimulated immune cells in chronically stressed or fatigued populations, with 34 original studies fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Besides mixed cross-sectional findings for stress- and fatigue-related changes of GC sensitivity under basal conditions or acute stress, longitudinal studies indicate a decrease with ongoing stress. Research on CATs is still scarce, but initial findings point towards a reduction of CAT sensitivity under chronic stress. In the long run, resistance of immune cells to stress signals under conditions of chronic stress might translate into self-maintaining inflammation and inflammatory disinhibition under acute stress, which in turn lead to fatigue.

AB  - Purpose of review
   The huge percentages of persons with obesity in many countries constitute a public health crisis. The severe consequences of obesity for physical health and emotional wellbeing already emerge in childhood. Therefore, the acknowledgment of early risk factors is essential to provide recommendations for prevention strategies. This review outlines the current state of research concerning early risk factors for obesity, that is, factors that even contribute to later obesity of the offspring during gestation. In this regard, this review specifically addresses the link between restricted eating behavior of the mother and obesity in her offspring. We systematically searched for articles in PsychINFO, PsychINDEX, MEDLINE, PubMed, MEDPILOT, and Web of Science, and we identified additional studies in bibliographies.
   Recent findings
   Although some risk factors (e.g., short period of breastfeeding, gestational diabetes, and high maternal BMI) have a vast evidence base, others (e.g., restricted eating behavior and second-hand smoking) are insufficiently studied.
   Summary
   Physical activity and diet programs in pregnancy can reduce not only the occurrence of gestational diabetes, but also the risk of inappropriate weight gain. As smoking during pregnancy and inappropriate eating behavior are associated with lower education, psychoeducation, for instance in sex education classes, could be easily conceivable.

AB  - Different aspects of the self have been reported to be affected in many neurological or psychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), including mainly higher-level cognitive self-unawareness. This higher sense of self-awareness is most likely related to and dependent on episodic memory, due to the proper integration of ourselves in time, with a permanent conservation of ourselves (i.e., sense of continuity across time). Reviewing studies in this field, our objective is thus to raise possible explanations, especially with the help of neuroimaging studies, for where such self-awareness deficits originate in AD patients. We describe not only episodic (and autobiographical memory) impairment in patients, but also the important role of cortical midline structures, the Default Mode Network, and the resting state (intrinsic brain activity) for the processing of self-related information.

AB  - Neuronal diseases, including retinal disorders, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury, affect a large number of people worldwide and cause heavy social and economic burdens. Although many efforts have been made by scientists and clinicians to develop novel drug and healthcare strategies, few of them received satisfactory outcomes to date. Lycium barbarum is a traditional homology of medicine and food in Chinese medicine, with the capability to nourish the eyes, liver and kidneys. Recent studies have also explored its powerful neuro-protective effects on a number of neuronal diseases. In the current review, we collected key recent findings regarding the neuro-protective effects and mechanisms of L. barbarum derivatives, primarily its polysaccharide (LBP), in some common diseases of the nervous system. A comprehensive comparison with currently available drugs has also been discussed. In general, LBP is a promising neuronal protector with potent ameliorative effects on key pathological events, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and cell death with minimal side effects.

AB  - It has been proposed that language impairments in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) stem from atypical neural processing of speech and/or nonspeech sounds. However, the strength of this proposal is compromised by the unreliable outcomes of previous studies of speech and nonspeech processing in ASD. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was an association between poor spoken language and atypical event-related field (ERF) responses to speech and nonspeech sounds in children with ASD (n=14) and controls (n=18). Data from this developmental population (ages 6-14) were analysed using a novel combination of methods to maximize the reliability of our findings while taking into consideration the heterogeneity of the ASD population. The results showed that poor spoken language scores were associated with atypical left hemisphere brain responses (200 to 400ms) to both speech and nonspeech in the ASD group. These data support the idea that some children with ASD may have an immature auditory cortex that affects their ability to process both speech and nonspeech sounds. Their poor speech processing may impair their ability to process the speech of other people, and hence reduce their ability to learn the phonology, syntax, and semantics of their native language.

AB  - Enrichment of cereal grains is a priority area for research and an effective strategy compared to supplementation and food diversification. This paper discusses the current state of knowledge on the biofortification and nutritional value of food products from spring durum wheat grain, achieved by an agrotechnical method named 'from field to table' production. Biofortification refers to the production of safe food fortified with micronutrients and to the introduction of microorganisms that increase the bioretention of nutrients by plants, thus creating a new quality of food products as well as contributing to the protection of soil, perceived as a crucial resource in agricultural production. It is based on our knowledge of the physiology of yielding in conjunction with an increased productivity and higher value, essential in the context of health disorders due to dietary deficiencies. The choice of a durum wheat cultivation method depends on the crop's habitat requirements, climate, proper selection of a previous crop, nutritional requirements, plant protection and storage. The conventional cultivation system diversifies the content of components, increasing Mn and Cu while decreasing P, K, Ca and Zn concentrations. Cultivation of this species on soil classified as very good wheat complex or good wheat ensures the highest yields characterised by high grain quality. This wheat is tolerant to water stress, although irrigation of spring durum wheat has been shown to improve nitrogen agronomic efficiency and to increase the yield of protein and energy. The recommended amount of nitrogen in plant fertilization is between 80-160 kg ha(-1). Durum wheat flour has a higher content of yellow pigments and better qualitative composition of gluten proteins, while its kernels have lighter and thinner hulls. Durum wheat flour absorbs less water during bread baking. Owing to this attribute, pasta from durum wheat is more adhesive to sauces, has compact texture and is more difficult to overcook.

AB  - A wealth of research indicates that cue reactivity is critical to understanding the neurobiology of nicotine and alcohol addiction and developing treatments. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalograph (EEG) studies have shown abnormal cue reactivity in various conditions between nicotine or alcohol addicts and the healthy. Although the causes of these abnormalities are still unclear, cultural effect can not be ignored. We conduct an review of fMRI and EEG studies about the cue reactivity in nicotine and alcohol addiction and highlight the cultural perspective. We suggest that cultural cue reactivity is a field worth of exploring which may has an effect on addictive behavior through emotion and attention. The cultural role of nicotine and alcohol addiction would provide new insight into understanding the mechanisms of nicotine and alcohol addiction and developing culture-specific therapies. We consider that culture as a context may be a factor that causes confusing outcomes in exploring nicotine and alcohol addiction which makes it possible to control the cultural influences and further contribute to the more consistent results.

AB  - Background: Children's exposure to manganese (Mn) is a public health concern and consistent policy guidelines for safe levels of Mn exposure is lacking. The complexity of establishing exposure thresholds for Mn partially relates to its dual role as an essential micronutrient with low levels required for good health, but also as a neurotoxin at high levels. Questions exist about the age-related susceptibility to excess Mn, particularly for children, and how best to measure chronic exposures. To address this concern we conducted a systematic review of studies examining children's exposure to Mn and neurodevelopmental outcomes focused on selection of biomarker-based and environmental measurements of Mn exposure to identify the scientific advances and research gaps.
   Methods: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through March 2016 for studies that were published in English, used a biomarker-based or environmental measurement of Mn exposure, and measured at least one neurological outcome for children aged 0-18 years. Ultimately, thirty-six papers from 13 countries were selected. Study designs were cross-sectional (24), prospective cohorts (9), and case control (3). Neurodevelopmental outcomes were first assessed for Mn exposure in infants (6 papers), toddlers or preschoolers (3 papers) and school-age children (27 papers).
   Results: Studies of school-aged children most frequently measured Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores using Mn biomarkers of hair or blood. Higher hair concentrations of Mn were consistently associated with lower IQ scores while studies of blood biomarkers and IQ scores had inconsistent findings. Studies of infants and toddlers most frequently measured mental and psychomotor development; findings were inconsistent across biomarkers of Mn (hair, cord blood, tooth enamel, maternal or child blood and dentin).
   Although few studies measured environmental sources of Mn, hair biomarkers were associated with Mn in drinking water and infant formula. Only one paper quantified the associations between environmental sources of Mn and blood concentrations.
   Conclusion: Hair-Mn was the more consistent and valid biomarker of Mn exposure in school-aged children. Accurate measurement of children's exposure to Mn is crucial for addressing these knowledge gaps in future studies. However, research on biomarkers feasible for fetuses and infants is urgently needed given their unique vulnerability to excessive Mn.

AB  - Growing evidence supports the view that neurodegenerative diseases have multiple and common mechanisms in their aetiologies. These multifactorial aspects have changed the broadly common assumption that selective drugs are superior to "dirty drugs" for use in therapy. This drives the research in studies of novel compounds that might have multiple action mechanisms. In neurodegeneration, loss of neuronal signaling is a major cause of the symptoms, so preservation of neurotransmitters by inhibiting the breakdown enzymes is a first approach. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are the drugs preferentially used in AD and that one of these, rivastigmine, is licensed also for PD. Several studies have shown that monoamine oxidase (MAO) B, located mainly in glial cells, increases with age and is elevated in Alzheimer (AD) and Parkinson's Disease's (PD). Deprenyl, a MAO B inhibitor, significantly delays the initiation of levodopa treatment in PD patients. These indications underline that AChE and MAO are considered a necessary part of multi target designed ligands (MTDL). However, both of these targets are simply symptomatic treatment so if new drugs are to prevent degeneration rather than compensate for loss of neurotransmitters, then oxidative stress and mitochondria' events must also be targeted. MAO inhibitors can protect neurons from apoptosis by mechanisms unrelated to enzyme inhibition. Understanding the involvement of MAO and other proteins in the induction and regulation of the apoptosis in mitochondria will aid progress toward strategies to prevent the loss of neurons. In general, the oxidative stress observed both in PD and AD indicate that antioxidant properties are a desirable part of MTDL molecules. After two or more properties are incorporated into one molecule, the passage from a lead compound to a therapeutic tool is strictly linked to its pharmacokinetic and toxicity. In this context the interaction of any new molecules with cytochrome P450 and other xenobiotic metabolic processes is a crucial point. The present review covers the biochemistry of enzymes targeted in the design of drugs against neurodegeneration and the cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of MTDLs.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases affect a significant portion of the aging population. Several lines of evidence suggest a positive association between environmental exposures, which are common and cumulative in a lifetime, and development of neurodegenerative diseases. Environmental or occupational exposure to manganese (Mn) has been implicated in neurodegeneration due to its ability to induce mitochondria' dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) aggregation. The role of the alpha-Syn protein visa-vis Mn is controversial, as it seemingly plays a duplicitous role in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. alpha-Syn has low affinity for Mn, however an indirect interaction cannot be ruled out. In this review we will examine the current knowledge surrounding the interaction of alpha-Syn and Mn in neurodegenerative process.

KW  - COMMUNICATION
AB  - AimAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder impairing social skills and communication. Adolescents with ASD have sexual needs, but may not understand their physical and emotional development resulting in inappropriate sexual behaviour. The aim of this review is to describe the type of inappropriate behaviour that presents in these adolescents, explain why such behaviours occur, suggest what education is suitable and identify current gaps in research.
   MethodThe databases EMBASE, OVID MEDLINE and PSYCINFO were searched for relevant articles. In total, 5241 articles were found, with an additional 15 sources found via soft searches, of which 42 met inclusion criteria and were subsequently reviewed.
   ResultsSexual behaviours that occur in these adolescents with ASD include hypermasturbation, public masturbation, inappropriate romantic gestures, inappropriate arousal and exhibitionism. Such behaviours are thought to be caused via a lack of understanding of normal puberty, the absence of appropriate sex education, the severity of their ASD and other associated problems. It is suggested that individualized, repetitive education should be started from an early age in an accessible form. Social skills development is also important before more technical aspects of sex education are taught.
   ConclusionDespite being such a common problem for schools, institutions and families to manage, it is surprising how sparse literature is particularly regarding why inappropriate behaviour occurs and what education is effective.

AB  - The right to vote is an important right signifying freedom of thought as well as full citizenship in any setting. Right to vote is enshrined and protected by international human rights treaties. The right of 'everyone' to take part in the political process and elections is based on universal and equal suffrage. Although these International Conventions have been ratified by the large majority of United Nations Member States, their application across the globe is by no means universal. This study sets out to examine the domestic laws of UN Member States in order to explore whether individuals with mental health problems have the right to vote in actuality and, thu,s can participate in political life. Through various searches, electoral laws and Constitutions of 193 Member States of the United Nations were studied. The authors were able to find legislation and/or Constitutional provisions in 167 of the 193 Member States. Twenty-one countries (11%) only placed no restrictions on the right to vote by persons with mental health problems. Over one third of the countries (36%) deny all persons with any mental health problems a right to vote without any qualifier. Some of these discriminatory attitudes are reflected in the multiplicity of terms used to describe persons with mental health problems. Another 21 countries (11%) denied the right to vote to detained persons; of these, nine Member States specifically denied the right to vote to persons who were detained under the mental health law, while the remainder denied the right to vote to all those who were interdicted or judicially interdicted. It would appear that in many countries the denial of voting rights is attributed to a lack of ability to consent by the individuals with mental illness. Further exploration of explanation is required to understand these variations, which exist in spite of international treaties.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that schizophrenia is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities, glutathione deficit, and increased brain oxidative stress (free radicals). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a strong antioxidant with potential therapeutic benefit in schizophrenia, according to some reports. We conducted a review of the published controlled studies, with the goal of determining the efficacy profile of NAC as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia.
   METHODS: An online search was conducted for all placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials of NAC in schizophrenia, and a review was conducted.
   RESULTS: Two studies met the criteria for inclusion. Berk et al (2008) used NAC as an adjunctive treatment to atypical antipsychotics in subjects with chronic schizophrenia who were stable on antipsychotic medications. Treatment at 8 weeks was less efficacious than placebo, but at 24 weeks produced significant reductions vs placebo in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative (d = 0.52), general (d = 0.46), and total (d = 0.57) scores. Farokhnia et al (2013) used NAC as an adjunctive treatment to risperidone in subjects with chronic schizophrenia who were experiencing an acute exacerbation episode. Eight weeks of treatment led to clinically significant reductions vs placebo in PANSS negative (d = 0.96), general (d = 0.59), and total (d = 0.88) scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that adjunctive NAC may be efficacious in reducing negative and general symptoms in schizophrenia.

AB  - The aim of this review is to evaluate the health and social effects of accessible home environments for people with functional limitations, in order to provide evidence to promote well-informed decision making for policy guideline development and choices about public health interventions. MEDLINE and nine other electronic databases were searched between December 2014 and January 2015, for articles published since 2004. All study types were included in this review. Two reviewers independently screened 12,544 record titles or titles and abstracts based on our pre-defined eligibility criteria. We identified 94 articles as potentially eligible; and assessed their full text. Included studies were critically appraised using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool, version 2011. Fourteen studies were included in the review. We did not identify any meta-analysis or systematic review directly relevant to the question for this systematic review. A narrative approach was used to synthesise the findings of the included studies due to methodological and statistical heterogeneity. Results suggest that certain interventions to enhance the accessibility of homes can have positive health and social effects. Home environments that lack accessibility modifications appropriate to the needs of their users are likely to result in people with physical impairments becoming disabled at home.

AB  - In the current literature, there are no meta-analyses assessing quality of life (QOL) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Knowledge of QOL domains mainly impaired in OCD could provide specific areas for intervention. The current meta-analysis assessed differences in global, work and social, family, and emotional QOL outcomes between patients with OCD and heathy controls. Age, gender and OCD severity were examined as moderators.
   Case-control studies were included if patients with primary OCD were compared with controls on QOL outcomes. Electronic databases (1966-October 2014) were searched.
   Thirteen case-control studies were included (n = 26,015). Patients with OCD had significantly lower scores on QOL relative to controls, with moderate effect sizes on global QOL and large effect size on work and social, emotional and family QOL outcomes. Studies using higher percentages of female patients and patients with less severe OCD symptoms reported significantly lower QOL outcomes for patients with OCD than controls.
   Studies comparing patients with OCD and patients with other psychiatric disorders were not included. Treatments should address QOL in OCD, particularly emotional QOL. Additional strategies targeting QOL should be implemented for female patients with less severe OCD symptoms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Autophagy is an evolutionarily ancient mechanism that ensures the lysosomal degradation of old, supernumerary or ectopic cytoplasmic entities. Most eukaryotic cells, including neurons, rely on proficient autophagic responses for the maintenance of homeostasis in response to stress. Accordingly, autophagy mediates neuroprotective effects following some forms of acute brain damage, including methamphetamine intoxication, spinal cord injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage. In some other circumstances, however, the autophagic machinery precipitates a peculiar form of cell death (known as autosis) that contributes to the aetiology of other types of acute brain damage, such as neonatal asphyxia. Here, we dissect the context-specific impact of autophagy on non-infectious acute brain injury, emphasizing the possible therapeutic application of pharmacological activators and inhibitors of this catabolic process for neuroprotection.

AB  - The interpersonal theory of suicide suggests that most forms of self-directed violent behaviors lie on a continuum, with each behavior successively increasing the capability of committing suicide. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the continuum may begin with Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI). This theory can be important in developing interventions for suicide prevention. However, in India, consistent usage of definitions of various forms of self-directed violent behaviors is lacking. In the present study, we reviewed definitions of various forms of self-directed violent behaviors that have been investigated in India. Further, we compared the usage of these definitions with the usage by WHO. Additionally, we reviewed NSSI research in India. Thirty-eight publications were identified by a comprehensive electronic search undertaken in Indian psychiatry, psychology, and mental health-related databases. Inconsistent definitions of eight self-directed violent behaviors were observed in Indian literature. Agreement on consistent definitions of various forms of self-directed behaviors is essential. Based on the findings of the current review, it can be suggested that culturally relevant large-scale research on NSSI in India is required to confirm the limited evidence that suggests high prevalence of NSSI in India.

AB  - This article was aimed at systematically reviewing the literature on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among victims of terrorist attacks. Electronic and hand searches of the literature identified 35 studies addressing PTSD prevalence based on validated diagnostic interviews. Overall, in the year after terrorist attacks, 33% to 39% of direct victims developed PTSD, whereas the percentage of indirect victims with PTSD was lower (4% in the affected community, 5%-6% among emergency, rescue, and recovery workers, and 17%-29% among relatives and friends of the injured or killed victims), but nonetheless above the prevalence in the general population. With the passing of time, a significant reduction of PTSD can be expected in the affected community and in the emergency and rescue personnel, but not in the injured victims, in the relatives and friends of the injured or killed victims, and in nontraditional, more vulnerable disaster workers. The implications of these results for the psychological treatment of terrorism victims are discussed.

AB  - Background Self-harm (intentional acts of non-fatal self-poisoning or self-injury) is common, particularly in young adults aged 15-35 years, often repeated, and strongly associated with suicide. Effective aftercare of individuals who self-harm is therefore important. We have undertaken a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults.
   Methods We searched five electronic databases (CCDANCTR-Studies and References, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO) between Jan 1, 1998, and April 29, 2015, for randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for adults after a recent (within 6 months) episode of self-harm. Most interventions were assessed in single trials. We report results for interventions for which at least three randomised controlled trials comparing interventions with treatment as usual have been published and hence might contribute to clinical guidance. The primary outcome was repetition of self-harm at the conclusion of treatment and at 6, 12, and 24 months' follow-up analysed, when available, with the intention-to-treat method; if this was not possible, we analysed with all available case data.
   Findings We identified 29 non-overlapping randomised controlled trials with three independent trials of the same intervention. Cognitive-behavioural-based psychotherapy (CBT; comprising cognitive-behavioural and problem-solving therapy) was associated with fewer participants repeating self-harm at 6 months' (odds ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.85; 12 trials; n= 1317) and at 12 months' follow-up (0.80, 0.65-0.98; ten trials; n= 2232). There were also significant improvements in the secondary outcomes of depression, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and problem solving. Patients receiving dialectical behaviour therapy (in three trials) were not less likely to repeat self-harm compared with those provided with treatment as usual at 6 months (odds ratio [OR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.16-2.15; n= 267, three trials) or at 12 months (0.36, 0.05-2.47; n= 172, two trials). However, the secondary endpoint of frequency of self-harm was associated with a significant reduction with use of dialectical behaviour therapy (mean difference -18.82, 95% CI -36.68 to -0.95). Four trials each of case management (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47-1.30; n= 1608) and sending regular postcards (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62-1.23; n= 3277) did not reduce repetition of self-harm.
   Interpretation CBT seems to be effective in patients after self-harm. Dialectical behaviour therapy did not reduce the proportion of patients repeating self-harm but did reduce the frequency of self-harm. However, aside from CBT, there were few trials of other promising interventions, precluding firm conclusions as to their effectiveness.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Despite the prevalence of antenatal depression and the fact that only one-third of pregnant women with depression consider it acceptable to take antidepressants, the effect of untreated depression on neonatal outcomes remains to be addressed thoroughly.
   OBJECTIVE To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to understand the effect of untreated depression on neonatal outcomes.
   DATA SOURCES We executed our search strategy, with emphasis on its exhaustiveness, in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science. The search was conducted in July, 2015.
   STUDY SELECTION We included randomized and nonrandomized studies that examined neonatal outcomes in women with depression receiving neither pharmacological nor nonpharmacological treatment compared with women without depression.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed their quality using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses, quantified heterogeneity using the I-2 statistic, and explored it with subgroup analyses by type of assessment of depression, severity, reported conflicts of interest, and study quality.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were preterm birth before 37 weeks and before 32 weeks, small and large for gestational age, low birth weight, and neonatal intensive care unit admission.
   RESULTS Of the 6646 titles initially identified, 23 studies met inclusion criteria, all observational, with a total of 25 663 women. Untreated depression was associated with significantly increased risks of preterm birth (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% CI, 1.25-1.94; 14 studies; I-2, 39%) and low birth weight (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.24-3.10; 8 studies; I-2, 48%), with a trend toward higher risks for exposure to more severe depression. While the odds of preterm birth more than doubled in studies reporting conflicts of interest (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.70-3.67; 5 studies; I-2, 0%), studies not reporting such conflicts showed more moderate results (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.08-1.66; 9 studies; I-2, 30%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results contrast with what is, to our knowledge, the only previous systematic review that examined the question of untreated depression because we found significant risks of 2 key perinatal outcomes, preterm birth and low birth weight. These are important results for pregnant women and clinicians to take into account in the decision-making process around depression treatment.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a highly complex disease involving a broad range of clinical, cellular, and biochemical manifestations that are currently not understood in combination. This has led to many views of AD, e.g. the amyloid, tau, presenilin, oxidative stress, and metal hypotheses. The amyloid hypothesis has dominated the field with its assumption that buildup of pathogenic beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide causes disease. This paradigm has been criticized, yet most data suggest that A beta plays a key role in the disease. Here, a new loss-of-function hypothesis is synthesized that accounts for the anomalies of the amyloid hypothesis, e.g. the curious pathogenicity of the A beta(42)/A beta(40), ratio, the loss of A beta caused by presenilin mutation, the mixed phenotypes of APP mutations, the poor clinical-biochemical correlations for genetic variant carriers, and the failure of A beta reducing drugs. The amyloid-loss view accounts for recent findings on the structure and chemical features of A beta variants and their coupling to human patient data. The lost normal function of APP/A beta is argued to be metal transport across neuronal membranes, a view with no apparent anomalies and substantially more explanatory power than the gain-of-function amyloid hypothesis. In the loss-of-function scenario, the central event of A beta aggregation is interpreted as a loss of soluble, functional monomer A beta rather than toxic overload of oligomers. Accordingly, new research models and treatment strategies should focus on remediation of the functional amyloid balance, rather than strict containment of A beta, which, for reasons rationalized in this review, has failed clinically.

AB  - Internet-connected devices are changing the way people live, work, and relate to one another. For prevention scientists, technological advances create opportunities to promote the welfare of human subjects and society. The challenge is to obtain the benefits while minimizing risks. In this article, we use the guiding principles for ethical human subjects research and proposed changes to the Common Rule regulations, as a basis for discussing selected opportunities and challenges that new technologies present for prevention science. The benefits of conducting research with new populations, and at new levels of integration into participants' daily lives, are presented along with five challenges along with technological and other solutions to strengthen the protections that we provide: (1) achieving adequate informed consent with procedures that are acceptable to participants in a digital age; (2) balancing opportunities for rapid development and broad reach, with gaining adequate understanding of population needs; (3) integrating data collection and intervention into participants' lives while minimizing intrusiveness and fatigue; (4) setting appropriate expectations for responding to safety and suicide concerns; and (5) safeguarding newly available streams of sensitive data. Our goal is to promote collaboration between prevention scientists, institutional review boards, and community members to safely and ethically harness advancing technologies to strengthen impact of prevention science.

AB  - Background A variety of workplace-based interventions exist to reduce stress and increase productivity. However, the efficacy of these interventions is sometimes unclear.
   Aims To determine whether complementary therapies offered in the workplace improve employee well-being.
   Methods We performed a systematic literature review which involved an electronic search of articles published between January 2000 and July 2015 from the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE and PubMed. We also undertook a manual search of all applicable article reference lists to ensure that no relevant studies were missed. We only selected published, full-length, English-language, peer-reviewed journal articles. Articles had to address the research objective using valid and reliable measures. We excluded articles concerning return to work or whose populations had been adversely affected by work resulting in the development of health issues.
   Results We included 10 articles in the review from 131 identified. Mindfulness and meditation-based interventions were most effective in improving workplace health and work performance; the latter demonstrating some evidence of maintaining gains up to 3 months later. The evidence for relaxation interventions was inconclusive.
   Conclusions Mindfulness and meditation interventions may be helpful in improving both psychosocial workplace health and work performance, but long-term efficacy has yet to be fully determined.

AB  - Objective: Database searches for studies of diagnostic test accuracy are notoriously difficult to filter, highly resource-intensive, and a potential barrier to quality evidence synthesis. We examined published meta-analyses of depression screening tool accuracy to evaluate the (1) proportion of included primary studies found in any online database in the original meta-analyses that were indexed in MEDLINE; (2) the proportion of patients from MEDLINE-indexed studies; and (3) the proportion of depression cases from studies indexed in MEDLINE.
   Methods: MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched from January 1, 2005 through October 31, 2014 for meta-analyses in any language on the accuracy of depression screening tools.
   Results: We identified 16 eligible meta-analyses that included 398 primary study citations, which had been identified via an online database in the original meta-analyses, including 257 unique citations and 234 unique patient samples. The 234 unique patient samples included 69,957 total patients and 11,867 depression cases. Of these, 220 samples (94%) were from studies indexed in MEDLINE, including 97% of all patients and 96% of all depression cases. When applying a peer-reviewed search strategy in MEDLINE, 91% of all samples, 96% of patients and 95% of depression cases were retrieved. Results were similar for total and unique citations.
   Conclusions: Restricting searches to MEDLINE may capture almost all eligible studies, patients and depression cases. Although not examined in the present study, MEDLINE may not be indexed as quickly as other databases. Thus, MEDLINE searches should be complemented by date-limited searches of other databases for recent citations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Several interventions are available for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults, but few studies have compared their relative efficacy in a single analysis. We aimed to simultaneously compare all available treatments using both direct and indirect data.
   Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched the two controlled trials registers maintained by the Cochrane Collaboration Common Mental Disorders group for trials published up to Feb 16, 2016. We selected randomised controlled trials in which an active psychotherapeutic or pharmacological intervention had been used in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder. We allowed all comorbidities except for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We excluded studies that focused exclusively on treatment-resistant patient populations defined within the same study. We extracted data from published reports. The primary outcome was symptom severity as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. We report mean differences with 95% credible intervals compared with placebo. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002441.
   Findings We identified 1480 articles in our search and included 53 articles (54 trials; 6652 participants) in the network meta-analysis. Behavioural therapy (mean difference -14.48 [95% credible interval -18.61 to -10.23]; 11 trials and 287 patients), cognitive therapy (-13.36 [-18.40 to -8.21]; six trials and 172 patients), behavioural therapy and clomipramine (-12.97 [-19.18 to -6.74]; one trial and 31 patients), cognitive behavioural therapy and fluvoxamine (-7.50 [-13.89 to -1.17]; one trial and six patients), cognitive behavioural therapy (-5.37 [-9.10 to -1.63]; nine trials and 231 patients), clomipramine (-4.72 [-6.85 to -2.60]; 13 trials and 831 patients), and all SSRIs (class effect -3.49 [95% credible interval -5.12 to -1.81]; 37 trials and 3158 patients) had greater effects than did drug placebo. Clomipramine was not better than were SSRIs (-1.23 [-3.41 to 0.94]). Psychotherapeutic interventions had a greater effect than did medications, but a serious limitation was that most psychotherapeutic trials included patients who were taking stable doses of antidepressants (12 [80%] of the 15 psychotherapy trials explicitly allowed antidepressants).
   Interpretation A range of interventions is effective in the management of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but considerable uncertainty and limitations exist regarding their relative efficacy. Taking all the evidence into account, the combination of psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions is likely to be more effective than are psychotherapeutic interventions alone, at least in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.

AB  - A large array of studies have investigated peripheral oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (ADH) as potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders, with highly conflicting and heterogenous findings. We searched Web of KnowledgeSM and Scopus (R) for English original articles investigating OT and/or ADH levels in different biological fluids (plasma/serum, saliva, urine and cerebrospinal fluid) across several psychiatric disorders. Sixty-four studies were included. We conducted 19 preliminary meta-analyses addressing OT alterations in plasma/serum, saliva, urine and cerebrospinal fluid of 7 psychiatric disorders and ADH alterations in plasma/serum, saliva, urine and cerebrospinal fluid of 6 psychiatric disorders compared to controls. Hedge's g was used as effect size measure, together with heterogeneity analyses, test of publication biases and quality control. None of them (except serum OT in anorexia nervosa) revealed significant differences. There is no convincing evidence that peripheral ADH or OT might be reliable biomarkers in psychiatric disorders. However, the lack of significant results was associated with high methodological heterogeneity, low quality of the studies, small sample size, and scarce reliability of the methods used in previous studies, which need to be validated and standardized.

AB  - Exercise has established efficacy as an antidepressant in people with depression. However, few meta analyses have assessed the effects of exercise across different domains of Quality of Life (QoL) in people with depression. Furthermore, there has been no previous meta-analysis of control group response in relation to QoL in exercise trials for depression. Randomized Clinical Trials(RCTs) were initially identified from a Cochrane review, and those including QoL assessments were included in the analysis. Search of major electronic databases were conducted to identify RCTs that compared the exercise effects on QoL versus control condition in people with depression. A random effects meta-analysis was employed to evaluate the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD). Six RCTs were included. Exercise significantly improved physical and psychological domains and overall QoL. Effects on social relationship and environment domains were not significant. No significant control group response was found for any domain or overall QoL. Exercise can be considered as a therapeutic strategy to improve physical and psychological domains and overall QoL of people with depression, with no effect evident across the social and environmental domains. The lack of improvement among control groups reinforces the role of exercise as a treatment for depression with benefits to QoL. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Family therapy and family-based treatment has been commonly applied in children and adolescents in mental health care and has been proven to be effective. There is an increased interest in economic evaluations of these, often expensive, interventions. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize and evaluate the evidence on cost-effectiveness of family/family-based therapy for externalizing disorders, substance use disorders and delinquency.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Education Resource information Centre (ERIC), Psycinfo and Cochrane reviews including studies conducted after 1990 and before the first of August of 2013. Full economic evaluations investigating family/family-based interventions for adolescents between 10 and 20 years treated for substance use disorders, delinquency or externalizing disorders were included.
   Results: Seven hundred thirty-one articles met the search criteria and 51 studies were initially selected. The final selection resulted in the inclusion of 11 studies. The quality of these studies was assessed. Within the identified studies, there was great variation in the specific type of family/family-based interventions and disorders. According to the outcomes of the checklists, the overall quality of the economic evaluations was low. Results varied by study. Due to the variations in setting, design and outcome it was not feasible to pool results using a meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: The quality of the identified economic evaluations of family/family-based therapy for treatment of externalizing disorders, adolescent substance use disorders and delinquency was insufficient to determine the cost-effectiveness. Although commonly applied, family/family-based therapy is costly and more research of higher quality is needed.

AB  - Acetylsalicylic acid is a frequently used medication worldwide. It is not used in pediatrics due its association with Reye syndrome. However, in case of pediatric intoxication, children are more fragile to salicylate poisoning because of their reduced ability of buffer the acid stress. Intoxication leads to a decoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and subsequently to a loss in mitochondrial function. Symptoms of poisoning are diverse; eventually they can lead to the death of the patient. Governmental websites of various EU countries were searched for legal information on acetylsalicylic acid availability in pharmacies and non-pharmacy stores. Various EU countries permit prescription-free sales of acetylsalicylic acid in pharmacies and non-pharmacy stores. In Sweden acetylsalicylic acid 500 mg may be sold in a maximum package size of 20 tablets or effervescent tablets in a non-pharmacy. In the UK a maximum of 16 tablets of acetylsalicylic acid 325 mg is allowed to sell in non-pharmacies. In Ireland acetylsalicylic acid is classified as S2 medication. Subsequently, acetylsalicylic acid is allowed to be sold prescription-free in pharmacies and non-pharmacy stores. In the Netherlands acetylsalicylic acid may only be sold in drug stores or pharmacies. A maximum of 24 tablets of 500 mg is allowed to purchase in a drug store. Several countries in the European Union are permitted to offer acetylsalicylic acid prescription-free in pharmacies and non-pharmacy stores without legal guidance on the storage position within the store. Further research is needed to investigate whether acetylsalicylic acid is located directly accessible to young children within the stores in EU countries which permit prescription-free sales of acetylsalicylic acid.

AB  - Ginsenosides represent the major bioactive components of ginseng. These triterpenoid saponins have been shown to exert numerous beneficial effects on the human body. Recent evidences suggest that ginsenosides may be useful for the management and treatment of several diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, numerous in vitro and in vivo models have shown that ginsenosides can modulate numerous pharmacological effects on the brain, including attenuation of excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, maintenance of neurotransmitter balance, anti-apoptotic effects, and mitochondrial stabilization effects. Regulations of these pathophysiological mechanisms have been shown to improve cognitive function and protect the brain against several neurodegenerative diseases. This review will critically address the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action of ginsenosides in the CNS, and particularly those associated with therapeutic efficacies in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and traumatic brain injury, and ischemia.

AB  - Spatial avoidance is a mechanism by which many organisms prevent their exposure to environmental stressors, namely chemical contaminants. Numerous studies on active avoidance and drift by aquatic organisms, as well as the main approaches used to measure both responses, were reviewed. We put forward a particular recommendation regarding methodological approaches: active avoidance should preferably be evaluated under a dilution gradient in a multi-compartmented system instead of in a bi-compartmented system. Available data on spatial avoidance from contamination indicate that emigration can occur at even lower contaminant concentrations than sub-individual noxious effects (assessed with the traditional forced-exposure assays), challenging the widely accepted paradigm in ecotoxicology that contaminant-driven adverse consequences at the population level result from a time delayed cascade of sequentially linked biochemical, cellular, physiological, and finally whole organism deleterious effects. Therefore, contaminants should not be viewed solely as potential toxicants at the individual level, but also as potential disturbers of habitats, by making the latter, at least partially, unsuited to accommodate life. Also, exposure to contamination is needed to trigger avoidance, but uptake is not mandatory, which demands the concept of exposure to be expanded, to include also the mere perception of the stressor. Since emigration eventually leads to local population extinction, and thus to severe implications for ecosystem structure and functioning, we then recommend that avoidance data be incorporated in environmental risk assessment schemes.

AB  - Interest in the study of psychological health and well-being has increased significantly in recent decades. A variety of conceptualizations of psychological health have been proposed including hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, quality-of-life, and wellness approaches. Although instruments for measuring constructs associated with each of these approaches have been developed, there has been no comprehensive review of well-being measures. The present literature review was undertaken to identify self-report instruments measuring well-being or closely related constructs (i.e., quality of life and wellness) and critically evaluate them with regard to their conceptual basis and psychometric properties. Through a literature search, we identified 42 instruments that varied significantly in length, psychometric properties, and their conceptualization and operationalization of well-being. Results suggest that there is considerable disagreement regarding how to properly understand and measure well-being. Research and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - This paper provides a critical review of measures of social and emotional development in early childhood for use within large-scale national surveys of child well-being and evaluations of early childhood interventions and initiatives. Key literature on social and emotional development was reviewed and organized around four commonly used subdomains: social competence, emotional competence, behavior problems, and self-regulation. Six measures, out of 75 which met criteria for more systematic review, were identified as good candidates for broader use with children birth to age five, based on their having a majority of 10 key features of strong assessments. The review also examines whether executive function is captured by measures of social and emotional development. Implications for enhancing the usefulness and effectiveness of social and emotional measures in the field and implications for future measures development are considered. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by burning of the oral mucosa in the absence of underlying dental or medical causes. The results of previous systematic reviews have generally been equivocal. However, findings for most interventions are based on searches of 5-10 years ago. This study therefore updates previous searches of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for pain as assessed by Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Secondary outcomes included quality of life, mood, taste and salivary flow.
   Methods: A search of MEDLINE and Embase up to 2016.
   Results: 24 RCTs were identified. Meta-analyses were impossible because of wide variations in study method and quality. The commonest interventions were alpha-lipoic add (ALA) (8 comparisons), capsaicin or an analogue (4 comparisons), clonazepam (3 comparisons) and psychotherapy (2 comparisons). ALA and capsaicin led to significantly greater improvements in VAS (4 studies each), as did clonazepam (all 3 studies), at up to two month follow-up. However, capsaicin led to prominent dyspepsia. Psychotherapy significantly improved outcomes in one study at two and 12 month follow-up. Catauma and tongue-protectors also showed promise (one study each). There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes except in the one study of tongue protectors.
   Conclusions: At least in some studies and for some outcomes, ALA, clonazepam, capsaicin and psychotherapy may show modest benefit in the first two months. However, these conclusions are limited by generally short follow-up periods, high study variability and low participant numbers. Further RCTs with follow-up of at least 12 months are indicated.

AB  - Background With growing numbers of older people worldwide, improving and maintaining quality of life during the extended years of life are a major focus for healthcare providers and policymakers. Some studies have suggested frailty may be associated with worse quality of life.
   Objectives To review the associations between frailty and quality of life among community-dwelling older people.
   Methods A systematic literature search was performed using five databases for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies examining associations between frailty and quality of life among community-dwelling older people published in 2000 or later. Reference lists of relevant studies were also manually searched. Authors were requested for data for a meta-analysis if necessary. Meta-analysis was attempted for studies using the same frailty criteria and quality-of-life instrument. Methodological quality, heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed.
   Results The systematic review identified 5145 studies, among which 11 cross-sectional studies and two longitudinal studies were included in this review. Meta-analysis including four cross-sectional studies using the Fried Phenotype and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey showed that those classified as frail and prefrail had significantly lower mental and physical quality-of-life scores than those classified as non-frail. High heterogeneity and possible publication bias were noted.
   Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis has demonstrated the evidence of a consistent inverse association between frailty/prefrailty and quality of life among community-dwelling older people. Interventions targeted at reducing frailty may have the additional benefit of improving corresponding quality of life. More longitudinal analysis is required to determine this effect.

AB  - Sleep disorders and sleep disturbances are considered nowadays a major public health problem. Within sleep problems, insomnia is the most common health complaint. The maintenance of insomnia symptoms may lead to a clinical disorder - Insomnia Disorder (ID). A significant amount of literature has shown the efficacy and effectiveness of psychological treatments for ID. Often, the evaluation of therapeutic processes and outcomes focuses on subjective measures such as sleep diaries. In this work, we review the few published studies that evaluate modifications in neurobiological domain related to evidence-based psychological interventions, namely cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). The search was carried out consulting Scopus, PubMed, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases. Only 12 studies were found. From the reviewed papers it was observed that the results are diverse, perhaps due to significant differences pertaining to the methodologies used. However, one interesting finding emerged: daytime experiments on insomnia comprising mainly cognitive tasks denoted hypofunction in ID patients, whereas nighttime experiments mainly associated with affective/emotional tasks denoted hyperarousal. We suggest that the study of the neural changes prompted by CBT-I is a major topic in the domain of psychotherapy and sleep medicine. Despite the scarce studies on neurobiological mechanisms of CBT-I, the results achieved until now are promising and should be taken into account in the future. Nonetheless, more research on this topic is needed.

AB  - Background: Benzodiazepine-resistant cases of alcohol withdrawal syndrome are common, and therefore alternate treatments are needed. Objective: Our aim was to conduct a systematic review of published reports on the use of barbiturates for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search of PUBMED for relevant citations that described the use of barbiturates either alone or in conjunction with other pharmacological agents to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Results: A total of 15 citations were identified; 2 citations looked at barbiturates alone; 1 found barbiturates effective in an emergency department setting at treating seizures and preventing return visits. A second showed that barbiturates caused a relatively low rate of respiratory depression. Further, 5 citations compared barbiturates with benzodiazepines; 1 suggested that they were better at treating severe withdrawal, and another showed they were more effective at preventing seizures; 4 citations found they were as effective as benzodiazepines, but 1 found a higher rate of respiratory depression. Also, 3 citations compared a combination of barbiturates and benzodiazepines to benzodiazepines alone; 1 showed decreased ventilation, another showed fewer intensive care unit admissions, and a third showed better symptom control; 3 citations described detailed reports of barbiturate protocols. Lastly, 2 citations compared barbiturates with other agents and found them equivalent. Conclusion: Barbiturates provide effective treatment for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In particular, they show promise for use in the emergency department and for severe withdrawal in the intensive care unit. Respiratory depression does not appear to be exceedingly common. Additional studies are needed to clarify the role of barbiturates in alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

AB  - Objective: Anxiety symptoms are common in older adults with or without anxiety disorders. Pharmacological options may be limited for these patients. Alternative treatments, such as physical activity (PA), are often indicated, although few trials have evaluated their efficacy. The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of regular PA on improving anxiety symptoms in older adults without anxiety disorders. Potential neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and oxidative mechanisms, as well as cognitive factors to explain these effects are also discussed.
   Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies, as well as case series including healthy previously sedentary older adults. We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases for articles published in English, with no set time limits.
   Results: Eight studies evaluating the effect of PA on anxiety symptoms in healthy older adults were included in this review. In all studies, regular and supervised PA was directly related to decreased anxiety symptoms in older individuals.
   Conclusion: Regular PA may be effective for improving anxiety symptoms in older adults. More studies are needed to identify the ideal PA modality, frequency, duration, and intensity for optimizing the positive effects of exercise on anxiety in this population.

AB  - According to the use it or lose it hypothesis, intellectually stimulating activities postpone age-related cognitive decline. A previous systematic review concluded that a high level of mental work demands and job control protected against cognitive decline. However, it did not distinguish between outcomes that were measured as cognitive function at one point in time or as cognitive decline. Our study aimed to systematically review which psychosocial working conditions were prospectively associated with high levels of cognitive function and/or changes in cognitive function over time. Articles were identified by a systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Web of Science (WOS), PsycNET, Occupational Safety and Health (OSH)). We included only studies with longitudinal designs examining the impact of psychosocial work conditions on outcomes defined as cognitive function or changes in cognitive function. Two independent reviewers compared title-abstract screenings, full-text screenings and quality assessment ratings. Eleven studies were included in the final synthesis and showed that high levels of mental work demands, occupational complexity or job control at one point in time were prospectively associated with higher levels of cognitive function in midlife or late life. However, the evidence to clarify whether these psychosocial factors also affected cognitive decline was insufficient, conflicting or weak. It remains speculative whether job control, job demands or occupational complexity can protect against cognitive decline. Future studies using methodological advancements can reveal whether workers gain more cognitive reserve in midlife and late life than the available evidence currently suggests. The public health implications of a previous review should thereby be redefined accordingly.

AB  - The incidence of psychotic disorders varies according to the geographical area, and it has been investigated whether neighbourhood level factors may be associated with this variation. The aim of this systematic review is to collate and appraise the literature on the association between social deprivation and the incidence or risk for psychotic disorders.
   A systematic review was conducted, and studies were included if they were in English, provided a measure of social deprivation for more than one geographically defined area and examined either the correlation, rate ratio or risk of psychotic disorder. A defined search strategy was undertaken with Medline, CINAHL Plus and PsychInfo databases.
   A total of 409 studies were identified in the search, of which 28 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, four examined the association between social deprivation at the time of birth, three examined the putative prodrome of psychosis or those at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis, and 23 examined the time at presentation with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) (one study examined two time points and one study included both UHR and FEP). Three of the studies that examined the level of social deprivation at birth found an association with a higher risk for psychotic disorders and increased social deprivation. Seventeen of the 23 studies found that there was a higher risk or rate of psychotic disorders in more deprived neighbourhoods at the time of presentation; however, adjusting for individual factors tended to weaken this association. Limited research has been conducted in the putative prodromal stage and has resulted in conflicting findings.
   Research conducted to date has not definitively identified whether the association is a result of social causation or social drift; however, the findings do have significant implications for service provision, such as the location and access of services.

AB  - We collected experimental kinetic rate constants for chemical processes responsible for the development and progress of neurodegeneration, focused on the enzymatic and non-enzymatic degradation of amine neurotransmitters and their reactive and neurotoxic metabolites. A gross scheme of neurodegeneration on the molecular level is based on two pathways. Firstly, reactive species oxidise heavy atom ions, which enhances the interaction with alpha-synuclein, thus promoting its folding to the beta form and giving rise to insoluble amyloid plaques. The latter prevents the function of vesicular transport leading to gradual neuronal death. In the second pathway, radical species, OH center dot in particular, react with the methylene groups of the apolar part of the lipid bilayer of either the cell or mitochondrial wall, resulting in membrane leakage followed by dyshomeostasis, loss of resting potential and neuron death. Unlike all other central neural system (CNS)-relevant biogenic amines, dopamine and noradrenaline are capable of a non-enzymatic auto-oxidative reaction, which produces hydrogen peroxide. This reaction is not limited to the mitochondrial membrane where scavenging enzymes, such as catalase, are located. On the other hand, dopamine and its metabolites, such as dopamine-o-quinone, dopaminechrome, 5,6-dihydroxyindole and indo-5,6-quinone, also interact directly with alpha-synuclein and reversibly inhibit plaque formation. We consider the role of the heavy metal ions, selected scavengers and scavenging enzymes, and discuss the relevance of certain foods and food supplements, including curcumin, garlic, N-acetyl cysteine, caffeine and red wine, as well as the long-term administration of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and occasional tobacco smoking, that could all act toward preventing neurodegeneration. The current analysis can be employed in developing strategies for the prevention and treatment of neurodegeneration, and, hopefully, aid in the building of an overall kinetic molecular model of neurodegeneration itself.

AB  - Background. Health disparities are aggravated when prevention and care initiatives fail to reach those they are intended to help. Groups can be classified as hardly reached according to a variety of circumstances that fall into 3 domains: individual (e.g., psychological factors), demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status), and cultural-environmental (e.g., social network). Several reports have indicated that peer support is an effective means of reaching hardly reached individuals. However, no review has explored peer support effectiveness in relation to the circumstances associated with being hardly reached or across diverse health problems.
   Objectives. To conduct a systematic review assessing the reach and effectiveness of peer support among hardly reached individuals, as well as peer support strategies used.
   Search methods. Three systematic searches conducted in PubMed identified studies that evaluated peer support programs among hardly reached individuals. In aggregate, the searches covered articles published from 2000 to 2015.
   Selection criteria. Eligible interventions provided ongoing support for complex health behaviors, including prioritization of hardly reached populations, assistance in applying behavior change plans, and social-emotional support directed toward disease management or quality of life. Studies were excluded if they addressed temporally isolated behaviors, were limited to protocol group classes, included peer support as the dependent variable, did not include statistical tests of significance, or incorporated comparison conditions that provided appreciable social support.
   Data collection and analysis. We abstracted data regarding the primary health topic, categorizations of hardly reached groups, program reach, outcomes, and strategies employed. We conducted a 2-sample t test to determine whether reported strategies were related to reach.
   Results. Forty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria, and these studies represented each of the 3 domains of circumstances assessed (individual, demographic, and cultural-environmental). Interventions addressed 8 health areas, most commonly maternal and child health (25.5%), diabetes (17.0%), and other chronic diseases (14.9%). Thirty-six studies (76.6%) assessed program reach, which ranged from 24% to 79% of the study population. Forty-four studies (94%) reported significant changes favoring peer support. Eleven strategies emerged for engaging and retaining hardly reached individuals. Among them, programs that reported a strategy of trust and respect had higher participant retention (82.8%) than did programs not reporting such a strategy (48.1%; P = .003). In 5 of the 6 studies examining moderators of the effects of peer support, peer support benefits were greater among individuals characterized by disadvantage (e.g., low health literacy).
   Conclusions. Peer support is a broad and robust strategy for reaching groups that health services too often fail to engage. The wide range of audiences and health concerns among which peer support is successful suggests that a basis for its success may be its flexible response to different contexts, including the intended audience, health problems, and setting.
   Public health implications. The general benefits of peer support and findings suggesting that it may be more effective among those at heightened disadvantage indicate that peer support should be considered in programs intended to reach and benefit those too often hardly reached. Because engendering trust and respect was significantly associated with participant retention, programs should emphasize this strategy.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a mysterious, chronic, multi-factorial and progressive disorder of the nervous system that is characterized by the selective loss of dopamine-producing cells of the substantia nigra leading to dopamine deficiency in the striatum. PD is exemplified by oxidative stress, alpha-synuclein accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, defective ubiquitin proteasome system, aberrant autophagy, inflammation, and atypical apoptosis, which eventually lead to slowness of movement, resting tremor, stiffness, and loss of balance. Despite incomprehensible etiology, timely diagnosis, and permanent cure, a handful of synthetic and natural agents rescue from the symptomatic features and delay disease progression. At low doses, a natural polyphenol, trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene (resveratrol), delays neurodegeneration in the cellular and animal models and lessens oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, aberrant apoptosis, and defective autophagy. The present article explains neuroprotective efficacy, advantages, and downsides of resveratrol in the conventional and preclinical models. This piece of writing also examines its probable neuroprotective mechanisms and constraints of realistic recital in clinical investigations and likely endeavors to minimize apprehensions.

AB  - Background. Health disparities are aggravated when prevention and care initiatives fail to reach those they are intended to help. Groups can be classified as hardly reached according to a variety of circumstances that fall into 3 domains: individual (e.g., psychological factors), demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status), and cultural-environmental (e.g., social network). Several reports have indicated that peer support is an effective means of reaching hardly reached individuals. However, no review has explored peer support effectiveness in relation to the circumstances associated with being hardly reached or across diverse health problems.
   Objectives. To conduct a systematic review assessing the reach and effectiveness of peer support among hardly reached individuals, as well as peer support strategies used.
   Search methods. Three systematic searches conducted in PubMed identified studies that evaluated peer support programs among hardly reached individuals. In aggregate, the searches covered articles published from 2000 to 2015.
   Selection criteria. Eligible interventions provided ongoing support for complex health behaviors, including prioritization of hardly reached populations, assistance in applying behavior change plans, and social-emotional support directed toward disease management or quality of life. Studies were excluded if they addressed temporally isolated behaviors, were limited to protocol group classes, included peer support as the dependent variable, did not include statistical tests of significance, or incorporated comparison conditions that provided appreciable social support.
   Data collection and analysis. We abstracted data regarding the primary health topic, categorizations of hardly reached groups, program reach, outcomes, and strategies employed. We conducted a 2-sample t test to determine whether reported strategies were related to reach.
   Results. Forty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria, and these studies represented each of the 3 domains of circumstances assessed (individual, demographic, and cultural-environmental). Interventions addressed 8 health areas, most commonly maternal and child health (25.5%), diabetes (17.0%), and other chronic diseases (14.9%). Thirty-six studies (76.6%) assessed program reach, which ranged from 24% to 79% of the study population. Forty-four studies (94%) reported significant changes favoring peer support. Eleven strategies emerged for engaging and retaining hardly reached individuals. Among them, programs that reported a strategy of trust and respect had higher participant retention (82.8%) than did programs not reporting such a strategy (48.1%; P = .003). In 5 of the 6 studies examining moderators of the effects of peer support, peer support benefits were greater among individuals characterized by disadvantage (e.g., low health literacy).
   Conclusions. Peer support is a broad and robust strategy for reaching groups that health services too often fail to engage. The wide range of audiences and health concerns among which peer support is successful suggests that a basis for its success may be its flexible response to different contexts, including the intended audience, health problems, and setting.
   Public health implications. The general benefits of peer support and findings suggesting that it may be more effective among those at heightened disadvantage indicate that peer support should be considered in programs intended to reach and benefit those too often hardly reached. Because engendering trust and respect was significantly associated with participant retention, programs should emphasize this strategy.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCH), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are devastating neurological disorders, which increasingly contribute to global morbidity and mortality. Although the pathogenic mechanisms of these conditions are quite diverse, chronic neuroinflammation is one underlying feature shared by all these diseases. Even though the specific root causes of these diseases remain to be identified, evidence indicates that the observed neuroinflammation is initiated by unique pathological features associated with each specific disease. If the initial acute inflammation is not resolved, a chronic neuroinflammatory state develops and ultimately contributes to disease progression. Chronic neuroinflammation is characterized by adverse and non-specific activation of glial cells, which can lead to collateral damage of nearby neurons and other glia. This misdirected neuroinflammatory response is hypothesized to contribute to neuropathology in MDD, SCH, AD, and PD. Physical activity (PA), which is critical for maintenance of whole body and brain health, may also beneficially modify neuroimmune responses. Since PA has neuroimmune-modifying properties, and the common underlying feature of MDD, SCH, AD, and PD is chronic neuroinflammation, we hypothesize that PA could minimize brain diseases by modifying glia-mediated neuroinflammation. This review highlights current evidence supporting the disease-altering potential of PA and exercise through modifications of neuroimmune responses, specifically in MDD, SCH, AD and PD.

AB  - Planning impairment is often observed in children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but attempts to differentiate planning in ASD from children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TD) have yielded inconsistent results. This study examined differences between these groups by focusing on development and analyzing performance in searching ahead several steps ("search depth") in addition to commonly used global performance measures in planning. A cross-sectional consecutive sample of 83 male patients (6-13 years), subgrouped as ASD without (ASD-, n = 18) or with comorbid ADHD (ASD+, n = 23), ADHD only (n = 42) and n = 42 TD children (6-13 years) were tested with the Tower-of-London-task. For global performance, ASD+ showed the lowest accuracy in younger children, but similar performance as TD at older ages, suggesting delayed development. Typically, a prolongation of planning time with increasing problem difficulty is observed in older children as compared to younger children. Here, this was most pronounced in ASD-, but under-expressed in ADHD. In contrast to global performance, effects of search depth were independent of age. ASD-, but not ASD+, showed increased susceptibility to raised demands on mentally searching ahead, along with the longest planning times. Thus, examining both global and search depth performance across ages revealed discernible patterns of planning between groups. Notably, the potentially detrimental impact of two diagnosed disorders does not add up in ASD+ in this task. Rather, our results suggest paradoxical enhancement of performance, ostensibly attributable to disruption of behavioral rigidity through increased impulsivity, which did not take place in ASD-.

AB  - Neurons of different brain regions change their response when a stimulus is repeated. In inferior temporal cortex (IT), stimulus repetition typically reduces the responses of single neurons, i.e., IT neurons show repetition suppression. Single unit recordings in IT showed that individual neurons vary in their degree of adaptation effects, ranging from strong suppression to slight enhancement of the response to the repeated stimulus. The suppression is maximal after the peak of the response and then reduces during the further course of the response. Repetition suppression in IT is still present for interstimulus intervals of at least 900 msec. I discuss the contribution of mechanisms that have been proposed to explain adaptation effects of IT responses. Firing-rate dependent response fatigue, e.g., a prolonged hyperpolarization, intrinsic to the recorded neuron cannot explain the stimulus specificity of the adaptation effect. The latter can be explained by synaptic depression or an adapted input from other IT neurons. We observed repetition suppression of IT neurons when adapter and test stimuli were presented at locations that differed by 8 degree of visual angle, suggesting that at least part of the adaptation effect is not inherited from retinotopic visual areas with small receptive fields. We observed no effect of repetition probability on repetition suppression in macaque IT using images of various categories, suggesting a dissociation between top-down expectation effects and repetition suppression. Together, our data agree with the hypothesis that adaptation in IT serves to reduce the saliency of recently seen stimuli, highlighting stimuli that differ from recently presented ones.

AB  - Environmental temperature has pervasive effects on the rate of life processes in ectothermic animals. Animal performance is affected by temperature, but there are finite thermal limits for vital body functions, including contraction of the heart. This Review discusses the electrical excitation that initiates and controls the rate and rhythm of fish cardiac contraction and is therefore a central factor in the temperature-dependent modulation of fish cardiac function. The control of cardiac electrical excitability should be sensitive enough to respond to temperature changes but simultaneously robust enough to protect against cardiac arrhythmia; therefore, the thermal resilience and plasticity of electrical excitation are physiological qualities that may affect the ability of fishes to adjust to climate change. Acute changes in temperature alter the frequency of the heartbeat and the duration of atrial and ventricular action potentials (APs). Prolonged exposure to new thermal conditions induces compensatory changes in ion channel expression and function, which usually partially alleviate the direct effects of temperature on cardiac APs and heart rate. The most heat-sensitive molecular components contributing to the electrical excitation of the fish heart seem to be Na+ channels, which may set the upper thermal limit for the cardiac excitability by compromising the initiation of the cardiac AP at high temperatures. In cardiac and other excitable cells, the different temperature dependencies of the outward K+ current and inward Na+ current may compromise electrical excitability at temperature extremes, a hypothesis termed the temperature-dependent depression of electrical excitation.

AB  - Ribosomal proteins (RPs), the essential components of the ribosome, are a family of RNA-binding proteins, which play prime roles in ribosome biogenesis and protein translation. Recent studies revealed that RPs have additional extra-ribosomal functions, independent of protein biosynthesis, in regulation of diverse cellular processes. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how RPs regulate apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, cell proliferation, neoplastic transformation, cell migration and invasion, and tumorigenesis through both MDM2/p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. We also discuss the roles of RPs in the maintenance of genome integrity via modulating DNA damage response and repair. We further discuss mutations or deletions at the somatic or germline levels of some RPs in human cancers as well as in patients of Diamond-Blackfan anemia and 5q-syndrome with high susceptibility to cancer development. Moreover, we discuss the potential clinical application, based upon abnormal levels of RPs, in biomarker development for early diagnosis and/or prognosis of certain human cancers. Finally, we discuss the pressing issues in the field as future perspectives for better understanding the roles of RPs in human cancers to eventually benefit human health.

AB  - Objective: Patients with factitious disorder (FD) fabricate illness, injury or impairment for psychological reasons and, as a result, misapply medical resources. The demographic and clinical profile of these patients has yet to be described in a sufficiently large sample, which has prevented clinicians from adopting an evidence-based approach to FD. The present study aimed to address this issue through a systematic review of cases reported in the professional literature.
   Method: A systematic search for case studies in the MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE databases was conducted. A total of 4092 records were screened and 684 remaining papers were reviewed. A supplementary search was conducted via GoogleScholar, reference lists of eligible articles and key review papers. In total, 372 eligible studies yielded a sample of 455 cases. Information extracted included age, gender, reported occupation, comorbid psychopathology, presenting signs and symptoms, severity and factors leading to the diagnosis of FD.
   Results: A total of 66.2% of patients in our sample were female. Mean age at presentation was 34.2 years. A healthcare or laboratory profession was reported most frequently (N=122). A current or past diagnosis of depression was described more frequently than personality disorder in cases reporting psychiatric comorbidity (41.8% versus 16.5%) and more patients elected to self-induce illness or injury (58.7%) than simulate or falsely report it. Patients were most likely to present with endocrinological, cardiological and dermatological problems. Differences among specialties were observed on demographic factors, severity and factors leading to diagnosis of FD.
   Conclusions: Based on the largest sample of patients with FD analyzed to date, our findings offer an important first step toward an evidence-based approach to the disorder. Future guidelines must be sensitive to differing methods used by specialists when diagnosing FD. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It is well accepted that climate change will have a significant effect on aquatic environments and together with temperature as one of the most important variables, it will represent a major driver of shift in the ecosystem. The increasing temperature in waters of temperate zones will have stressful effect on coldwater adapted fish species that may lead to the shrink of their area of occurrence or even to their extinction. The fish species able to replace the disappearing native populations would be the ones characterized with high plasticity of phenotypes, and strong biological flexibility, which manifest in quick change of life-history traits. Such species are likely to track the changes in their environment relatively rapidly, whereas the responses of majority native species are slower. The given overview on this topic will try to predict and describe global effect of climate change on ecosystems, impact of invasive species on native fish communities and their possible replacement in the future.

This article reviews recent evidences from physiology, genetics, epigenetics, and brain imaging which allow to consider AN as an abnormality of reward pathways or an attempt to preserve mental homeostasis. Special emphasis is put on ghrelino-resistance and the importance of orexigenic peptides of the lateral hypothalamus, the gut microbiota and a dysimmune disorder of neuropeptide signaling. Physiological processes, secondary to underlying, and premorbid vulnerability faetors the "pondero-nutritional-feeding basements"- are also discussed.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. This chronic, progressive disease is characterized by loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies (LBs) in surviving neurons. PD is attributed to a combination of environment and genetic factors, but the precise underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Oxidative stress is generally recognized as one of the main causes of PD, and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to DA neuron vulnerability and eventual death. Several studies have demonstrated that small non-coding RNAs termed microRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo models of PD. Relevant miRNAs involved in oxidative stress can prevent ROS mediated damage to DA neurons, suggesting that specific miRNAs may be putative targets for novel therapeutic targets in PD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder presenting as progressive cognitive decline with dementia that does not, to this day, benefit from any disease-modifying drug. Multiple etiologic pathways have been explored and demonstrate promising solu-tions. For example, iron ion chelators, such as deferoxa-mine, are a potential therapeutic solution around which future studies are being directed. Another promising domain is related to thrombin inhibitors. In this minireview, a common pathophysiological pathway is suggested for the pathogenesis of AD to prove that all these mechanisms converge onto the same cascade of neuroinflammatory events. This common pathway is initiated by the presence of vascular risk factors that induce brain tissue hypoxia, which leads to endothelial cell activation. However, the ensuing hypoxia stimulates the production and release of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory proteins. Furthermore, the endothelial activation may become excessive and dysfunctional in predisposed individuals, leading to thrombin activation and iron ion decompartmentalization. The oxidative stress that results from these modifications in the neurovascular unit will eventually lead to neuronal and glial cell death, ultimately leading to the development of AD. Hence, future research in this field should focus on conducting trials with combinations of potentially efficient treatments, such as the combination of intra-nasal deferoxamine and direct thrombin inhibitors.

AB  - AIM: To review the literature on sex differences in facial emotion perception (FEP) across the schizophrenia spectrum.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of empirical articles that were included in five separate meta-analyses of FEP across the schizophrenia spectrum, including meta-analyses that predominantly examined adults with chronic schizophrenia, people with early (onset prior to age 18) or recent-onset (experiencing their first or second psychotic episode or illness duration less than 2 years) schizophrenia, and unaffected first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia. We also examined articles written in English (from November 2011 through June 2015) that were not included in the aforementioned meta-analyses through a literature search in the PubMed database. All relevant articles were accessed in full text. We examined all studies to determine the sample sizes, diagnostic characteristics, demographic information, methodologies, results, and whether each individual study reported on sex differences. The results from the meta-analyses themselves as well as the individual studies are reported in tables and text.
   RESULTS: We retrieved 134 articles included in five separate meta-analyses and the PubMed database that examined FEP across the schizophrenia spectrum. Of these articles, 38 examined sex differences in FEP. Thirty of these studies did not find sex differences in FEP in either chronically ill adults with schizophrenia, early-onset or recently diagnosed people with schizophrenia, or first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia. Of the eight studies that found sex differences in FEP, three found that chronically ill women outperformed men, one study found that girls with early-onset schizophrenia outperformed boys, and two studies found that women (including first-degree relatives, adults with schizophrenia, and the healthy control group) outperformed men on FEP tasks. In total, six of the eight studies that examined sex differences in FEP found that women outperformed men across the schizophrenia spectrum.
   CONCLUSION: Evidence to date suggests few sex differences in FEP in schizophrenia; both men and women across the schizophrenia spectrum have deficits in FEP.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to nearly a third of all injury-related deaths in the United States. For survivors of TBI, depending on severity, patients can be left with devastating neurological disabilities that include impaired cognition or memory, movement, sensation, or emotional function. Despite the efforts to identify novel therapeutics, the only strategy to combat TBI is risk reduction (helmets, seat belts, removal of fall hazards, etc.). Enormous heterogeneity exists within TBI, and it depends on the severity, the location, and whether the injury was focal or diffuse. Evidence from recent studies support the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, chromatin post-translational modification, and miRNA regulation of gene expression in the post-injured brain. In this review, we discuss studies that have assessed epigenetic changes and mechanisms following TBI, how epigenetic changes might not only be limited to the nucleus but also impact the mitochondria, and the implications of these changes with regard to TBI recovery.

AB  - Fast neuronal network oscillations in the gamma frequency band (30-100 Hz) occur in various cortex regions, require timed synaptic excitation and inhibition with glutamate and GABA, respectively, and are associated with higher brain functions such as sensory perception, attentional selection and memory formation. However, little is known about energy and ion homeostasis during the gamma oscillation. Recent studies addressed this topic in slices of the rodent hippocampus using cholinergic and glutamatergic receptor models of gamma oscillations (GAM). Methods with high spatial and temporal resolution were applied in vitro, such as electrophysiological recordings of local field potential (LFP) and extracellular potassium concentration ([K+](o)), live-cell fluorescence imaging of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide [NAD(P)H and FAD, respectively] (cellular redox state), and monitoring of the interstitial partial oxygen pressure (pO(2)) in depth profiles with microsensor electrodes, including mathematical modeling. The main findings are: (i) GAM are associated with high oxygen consumption rate and significant changes in the cellular redox state, indicating rapid adaptations in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation; (ii) GAM are accompanied by fluctuating elevations in [K+](o) of less than 0.5 mmol/L from baseline, likely reflecting effective K+-uptake mechanisms of neuron and astrocyte compartments; and (iii) GAM are exquisitely sensitive to metabolic stress induced by lowering oxygen availability or by pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These findings reflect precise cellular adaptations to maintain adenosine-5 '-triphosphate (ATP), ion and neurotransmitter homeostasis and thus neural excitability and synaptic signaling during GAM. Conversely, the exquisite sensitivity of GAM to metabolic stress might significantly contribute the exceptional vulnerability of higher brain functions in brain disease.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) is a neuromodulator that regulates different brain circuits involved in cognitive functions, motor coordination, and emotions. Dysregulation of DA is associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease and substance abuse. Several lines of research have shown that the midbrain DA system is regulated by the central adrenergic system. This review focuses on adrenergic interactions with midbrain DA neurons. It discusses the current neuroanatomy including source of adrenergic innervation, type of synapses, and adrenoceptors expression. It also discusses adrenergic regulation of DA cell activity and neurotransmitter release. Finally, it reviews several neurological and psychiatric disorders where changes in adrenergic system are associated with dysregulation of the midbrain DA system.

AB  - Background: Brief Contact Interventions (BCIs) have been of increasing interest to suicide prevention clinicians, researchers and policy makers. However, there has been no systematic assessment into the mechanisms underpinning BCIs. The aim of the current paper is to provide a systematic review of the proposed mechanisms underpinning BCIs across trial studies.
   Method: A systematic review was conducted of trials using BCIs (post-discharge telephone contacts; emergency or crisis cards; and postcard or letter contacts) for suicide or self-harm. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the reference lists of all past reviews in the area. Secondary searches of reference lists were undertaken.
   Results: Sixteen papers provided a description of possible mechanisms which we grouped into three main areas: social support; suicide prevention literacy, and; learning alternative coping behaviours. After assessment of the studies and considering the plausibility of mechanisms, we suggest social support and improved suicide prevention literacy are the most likely mechanisms underpinning BCIs.
   Conclusion: Researchers need to better articulate and measure the mechanisms they believe underpin BCIs in trial studies. Understanding more about the mechanisms of BCIs' will inform the development of future interventions for self-harm and suicide.

AB  - Background: Few studies have investigated protective factors against suicide.
   Objectives: To identify whether reasons for living (RFL), measured with the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFLI), protect against suicidal ideation (SI), attempts (SA) and suicide death.
   Method: This systematic review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) statement guidelines. PubMed database was searched for studies published until October 2015. Studies were eligible if they used RFLI or one of its versions. All eligible studies were included, regardless of study design, quality indicators, and target populations. No publication year limit was imposed. We included 39 studies.
   Results: RFL may protect against SI and SA and yield a predictive value. The role of two specific reasons for living (Moral Objections to Suicide and Survival and Coping Beliefs) was particularly emphasized. No study investigating suicide death was found.
   Conclusion: RFL may moderate suicide risk factors and correlate with resilience factors. Moreover, RFL may depend on and interact with numerous factors such as DSM-IV Axis I disorders, personality disorders and features, coping abilities and social support. Clinicians could develop therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing RFL, like Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapies, to prevent suicidal thoughts and behaviors and improve the care management of suicidal patients.

AB  - Background: Numerous practice guidelines (PGs) relevant to child and youth mental health (CYMH) are available, but their quality is uncertain. We used systematic review methodology to identify the methods employed to develop PGs in CYMH and assess whether they align with international quality standards. Methods: We used prespecified inclusion criteria to search for CYMH PGs (2009-2014) in journals of professional associations or websites of organizations who produce or house PGs. Eligible PGs and organization websites were screened to identify PG development methods. Two reviewers assessed the alignment of the PG development methods with PG quality criteria using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) domains and Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards. Results: Five sets of eligible development methods were identified in 70 eligible PGs. Three sets adhered to all (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) or most (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) AGREE II domains and IOM standards, and were used to develop 31.4% of PGs. The two remaining sets of development methods had important weaknesses (e.g. lack of mandatory rigorous systematic reviews, multidisciplinary development groups, or transparent conflict of interest methods) and were associated with 21.4% of PGs. No development methods could be identified in 40.0% of PGs; ineligible development methods were referenced in 7.1% of PGs. Conclusions: Up to 69% of available CYMH PGs may have been developed using methods that do not align with AGREE II quality criteria or IOM standards. The quality of available CYMH PGs needs to be assessed, and strategies designed to guide practitioners to high quality PGs and facilitate adherence by PG developers to international quality standards are needed.

AB  - Malaria is a serious public health threat in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and its transmission risk varies geographically. Modelling its geographic characteristics is essential for identifying the spatial and temporal risk of malaria transmission. Remote sensing (RS) has been serving as an important tool in providing and assessing a variety of potential climatic/environmental malaria transmission variables in diverse areas. This review focuses on the utilization of RS-driven climatic/environmental variables in determining malaria transmission in SSA. A systematic search on Google Scholar and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge(SM) databases (PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect) was carried out. We identified thirty-five peer-reviewed articles that studied the relationship between remotely-sensed climatic variable(s) and malaria epidemiological data in the SSA sub-regions. The relationship between malaria disease and different climatic/environmental proxies was examined using different statistical methods. Across the SSA sub-region, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from either the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) or Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite sensors was most frequently returned as a statistically-significant variable to model both spatial and temporal malaria transmission. Furthermore, generalized linear models (linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression) were the most frequently-employed methods of statistical analysis in determining malaria transmission predictors in East, Southern and West Africa. By contrast, multivariate analysis was used in Central Africa. We stress that the utilization of RS in determining reliable malaria transmission predictors and climatic/environmental monitoring variables would require a tailored approach that will have cognizance of the geographical/climatic setting, the stage of malaria elimination continuum, the characteristics of the RS variables and the analytical approach, which in turn, would support the channeling of intervention resources sustainably.

TI  - A Review on Fracture-Initiation and -Propagation Pressures for Lost Circulation and Wellbore Strengthening
KW  - LOSSES
AB  - Fracture-initiation pressure (FIP) and fracture-propagation pressure (FPP) are both important considerations for preventing and mitigating lost circulation. For significant fluid loss to occur, a fracture must initiate on an intact wellbore or reopen on a wellbore with pre-existing fractures, and then propagate into the far-field region. Wellbore-strengthening operations are designed to increase one or both of these two pressures to combat lost circulation. Currently, some theoretical models assume that FIPs and FPPs are only functions of in-situ stress and rock-mechanical properties. However, as demonstrated by numerous field and laboratory observations, they are also highly related to drilling-fluid properties and to interactions between the drilling fluid and formation rock.
   This paper discusses the mechanisms of lost circulation and wellbore strengthening, with an emphasis on factors that can affect FIP and FPP. These factors include microfractures on the wellbore wall, in-situ-stress anisotropy, pore pressure, fracture toughness, filter-cake development, fracture bridging/plugging, bridge location, fluid leakoff, rock permeability, pore size of rock, mud type, mud solid concentration, and critical capillary pressure. The conclusions of this paper include information seldom considered in lost-circulation studies, such as the effect of microfractures on FIP and the effect of capillary forces on FPP. Research results described in this paper may be useful for lost-circulation mitigation and wellbore-strengthening design, as well as hydraulic- fracturing design and leakoff-test (LOT) interpretation.

AB  - AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are assemblies of four core subunits, GluA1-4, that mediate most fast excitatory neurotransmission. The component subunits determine the functional properties of AMPARs, and the prevailing view is that the subunit composition also determines AMPAR trafficking, which is dynamically regulated during development, synaptic plasticity and in response to neuronal stress in disease. Recently, the subunit dependence of AMPAR trafficking has been questioned, leading to a reappraisal of this field. In this Review, we discuss what is known, uncertain, conjectured and unknown about the roles of the individual subunits, and how they affect AMPAR assembly, trafficking and function under both normal and pathological conditions.

AB  - Mass gatherings bring large numbers of people into physical proximity. Typically, this physical proximity has been assumed to contribute to ill health (e.g., through being stressful, facilitating infection transmission, etc.). In this paper, we add a new dimension to the emerging field of mass gatherings medicine. Drawing on psychological research concerning group processes, we consider the psychological transformations that occur when people become part of a crowd. We then consider how these transformations may have various consequences for health and well-being. Some of these consequences may be positive. For example, a sense of shared identity amongst participants may encourage participants to view others as a source of social support which in turn contributes to a sense of health and well-being. However, some consequences may be negative. Thus, this same sense of shared identity may result in a loss of disgust at the prospect of sharing resources (e.g., drinking utensils) which could, in turn, facilitate infection transmission. These, and related issues, are illustrated with research conducted at the Magh Mela (North India). We conclude with an agenda for future research concerning health practices at mass gatherings.

AB  - Personality disorders often act as a common denominator for many psychiatric problems, and studies on personality disorders contribute to the etiopathology, diagnosis, and treatment of many mental disorders. In recent years, increasing evidence from various studies has shown distinctive features of personality disorders, and that from genetic and neuroimaging studies has been especially valuable. Genetic studies primarily target the genes encoding neurotransmitters and enzymes in the serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems, and neuroimaging studies mainly focus on the frontal and temporal lobes as well as the limbic-paralimbic system in patients with personality disorders. Although some studies have suffered due to unclear diagnoses of personality disorders and some have included few patients for a given personality disorder, great opportunities remain for investigators to launch new ideas and technologies in the field.

AB  - Social cognitive dysfunction, including deficits in facial emotion recognition and theory of mind, is a core feature of schizophrenia and more strongly predicts functional outcome than neurocognition alone. Although traditionally considered to play an important role in motor coordination, the cerebellum has been suggested to play a role in emotion processing and theory of mind, and also shows structural and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the specific role of the cerebellum in emotion and theory of mind deficits in schizophrenia using previously published functional neuroimaging studies. PubMed and PsycINFO were used to search for all functional neuroimaging studies reporting altered cerebellum activity in schizophrenia patients during emotion processing or theory of mind tasks, published until December 2014. Overall, 14 functional neuroimaging studies were retrieved. Most emotion studies reported lower cerebellum activity in schizophrenia patients relative to healthy controls. In contrast, the theory of mind studies reported mixed findings. Altered activity was observed across several posterior cerebellar regions involved in emotion and cognition. Weaker cerebellum activity in schizophrenia patients relative to healthy controls during emotion processing may contribute to blunted affect and reduced ability to recognise emotion in others. This research could be expanded by examining the relationship between cerebellum function, symptomatology and behaviour, and examining cerebellum functional connectivity in patients during emotion and theory of mind tasks.

AB  - Background: Use of hypnotics or anxiolytic drugs is common and various studies have reported increased mortality with hypnotics or anxiolytic use.
   Objective: To consolidate the evidence on mortality risk associated with hypnotics or anxiolytic use
   Methods: Major databases were searched through April 2014 for studies reporting mortality risk associated with hypnotics or anxiolytics use. A pooled hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval was estimated using random-effects model.
   Results: After screening 2188 articles, 25 studies (24 cohort, 1 case-control) enrolling 2,350,093 patients with 59% females (age 18-102 years) were included in the meta-analysis. Hypnotics or anxiolytic users had 43% higher risk of mortality than non-users (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, [1.12, 1.84]). Eight studies reported risk estimates for each gender category and pooled results from these studies showed increased risk of mortality among men (hazard ratio = 1.60, 95% confidence interval = [1.29,1.99]) and women (hazard ratio = 1.68, 95% confidence interval = [1.38, 2.04]). Pooled results from 10 studies showed higher mortality among benzodiazepine users compared to non-users (hazard ratio = 1.60, 95% confidence interval = [1.03, 2.49]), while pooled results from five studies showed an increased risk of mortality with Z-drugs use although the effect could not reach statistical significance (hazard ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval = [0.95, 3.16]). Significant heterogeneity was observed in the analyses and the quality of included studies was good.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that hypnotics or anxiolytics drugs use is associated with increased mortality and hence should be used with caution. Future studies focused on underlying mechanism of increased mortality with hypnotics or anxiolytics use are required.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of debilitating neurodevelopmental disorders thought to have genetic etiology, due to their high heritability. The endosomal system has become increasingly implicated in ASD pathophysiology. In an attempt to summarize the association between endosomal system genes and ASDs we performed a systematic review of the literature. We searched PubMed for relevant articles. Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) gene database was used to exclude articles regarding genes with less than minimal evidence for association with ASDs. Our search retained 55 articles reviewed in two categories: genes that regulate and genes that are regulated by the endosomal system. Our review shows that the endosomal system is a novel pathway implicated in ASDs as well as other neuropsychiatric disorders. It plays a central, role in aspects of cellular physiology on which neurons and glial cells are particularly reliant, due to their unique metabolic and functional demands. The system shows potential for biomarkers and pharmacological intervention and thus more research into this pathway is warranted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present review explores emotion-focused treatments for anorexia nervosa (AN).
   We conducted a systematic literature search across key databases (PsychINFO, PubMed/Medline, and Web of Science) prior to September 2015. Twenty studies were selected for systematic review.
   The present review found initial evidence supporting the acceptability and feasibility of emotion-focused treatments for AN. Although preliminary results are promising, further controlled studies are necessary to establish the efficacy of emotion-focused treatments for AN.
   Future controlled trials should compare emotion-focused treatments against each other and against other AN treatments. Future studies should also examine the mechanisms of action for the emotion-focused treatments and treatment moderators.

AB  - Objective: There is burgeoning interest in augmentation strategies for improving inadequate response to antidepressants. The adjunctive use of standardized pharmaceutical grade nutrients, known as nutraceuticals, has the potential to modulate several neurochemical pathways implicated in depression. While many studies have been conducted in this area, to date no specialized systematic review (or meta analysis) has been conducted.
   Method: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted up to December 2015 for clinical trials using adjunctive nutrients for depression. Where sufficient data were available, a random-effects model analyzed the standard mean "difference between treatment and placebo in the change from baseline to endpoint, combining the effect size data. Funnel plot and heterogeneity analyses were also performed.
   Results: Primarily positive results were found for replicated studies testing S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), methylfolate, omega-3 (primarily EPA or ethyl-EPA), and vitamin D, with positive isolated studies for creatine, folinic acid, and an amino acid combination. Mixed results were found for zinc, folic add, vitamin C, and tryptophan, with nonsignificant results for inositol. No major adverse effects were noted in the studies (aside from minor digestive disturbance). A meta-analysis of adjunctive omega-3 versus placebo revealed a significant and moderate to strong effect in favor of omega-3. Conversely, a meta analysis of folic acid revealed a nonsignificant difference from placebo. Marked study heterogeneity was found in a Higgins test for both omega-3 and folic acid studies; funnel plots also revealed asymmetry (reflecting potential study bias).
   Conclusions: Current evidence supports adjunctive use of SAMe, methylfolate, omega-3, and vitamin D with antidepressants to reduce depressive symptoms.

AB  - Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a large cluster of RNAs that do not encode proteins, but have multiple functions in diverse cellular processes. Mounting evidence indicates the involvement of ncRNAs in the physiology and pathophysiology of the central and peripheral nervous systems. It has been shown that numerous ncRNAs, especially microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, are differentially expressed after insults such as acquired brain injury, spinal cord injury, and peripheral nerve injury. These ncRNAs affect neuronal survival, neurite regrowth, and glial phenotype primarily by targeting specific mRNAs, resulting in translation repression or degradation of the mRNAs. An increasing number of studies have investigated the regulatory roles of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs in neural injury and regeneration, and thus a new research field is emerging. In this review, we highlight current progress in the field in an attempt to provide further insight into post-transcriptional changes occurring after neural injury, and to facilitate the potential use of ncRNAs for improving neural regeneration. We also suggest potential directions for future studies.

AB  - Adolescence represents a crucial phase of synaptic maturation characterized by molecular changes in the developing brain that shape normal behavioral patterns. Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in these neuromaturation processes. Perturbations of normal epigenetic programming during adolescence by ethanol can disrupt these molecular events, leading to synaptic remodeling and abnormal adult behaviors. Repeated exposure to binge levels of alcohol increases the risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and comorbid psychopathology including anxiety in adulthood. Recent studies in the field clearly suggest that adolescent alcohol exposure causes widespread and persistent changes in epigenetic, neurotrophic, and neuroimmune pathways in the brain. These changes are manifested by altered synaptic remodeling and neurogenesis in key brain regions leading to adult psychopathology such as anxiety and alcoholism. This review details the molecular mechanisms underlying adolescent alcohol exposure-induced changes in synaptic plasticity and the development of alcohol addiction-related phenotypes in adulthood.

AB  - The World Health Organization has predicted that by 2040 neurodegenerative diseases will overtake cancer to become the world's second leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease. This has sparked the development of several European and American brain research initiatives focusing on elucidating the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Connexin (Cx) and pannexin (Panx) membrane channel proteins are conduits through which neuronal, glial, and vascular tissues interact. In the brain, this interaction is highly critical for homeostasis and brain repair after injury. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these membrane channels function, in health and disease, might be particularly influential in establishing conceptual frameworks to develop new therapeutics against Cx and Panx channels. This review focuses on current insights and emerging concepts, particularly the impact of connexin43 and pannexin1, under neuroprotective and neurodegenerative conditions within the context of astrocytes.

AB  - Parkinson disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder, the etiology of which remains largely unknown. Progressive impairment of voluntary motor control, which represents the primary clinical feature of the disease, is caused by a loss of midbrain substantia nigra dopamine (DA) neurons. We present here a synthetic overview of cell-autonomous mechanisms that are likely to participate in DA cell death in both sporadic and inherited forms of the disease. In particular, we describe how damage to vulnerable DA neurons may arise from cellular disturbances produced by protein misfolding and aggregation, disruption of autophagic catabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, or loss of calcium homeostasis. Where pertinent, we show how these mechanisms may mutually cooperate to promote neuronal death.

AB  - Spontaneous activity patterns propagate through many parts of the developing nervous system and shape the wiring of emerging circuits. Prior to vision, waves of activity originating in the retina propagate through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus to primary visual cortex (V1). Retinal waves have been shown to instruct the wiring of ganglion cell axons in LGN and of thalamocortical axons in V1 via correlation-based plasticity rules. Across species, retinal waves mature in three stereotypic stages (I-III), in which distinct circuit mechanisms give rise to unique activity patterns that serve specific functions in visual system refinement. Here, I review insights into the patterns, mechanisms, and functions of stage Ill retinal waves, which rely on glutamatergic signaling. As glutamatergic waves spread across the retina, neighboring ganglion cells with opposite light responses (ON vs. OFF) are activated sequentially. Recent studies identified lateral excitatory networks in the inner retina that generate and propagate glutamatergic waves, and vertical inhibitory networks that desynchronize the activity of ON and OFF cells in the wavefront. Stage Ill wave activity patterns may help segregate axons of ON and OFF ganglion cells in the LGN, and could contribute to the emergence of orientation selectivity in V1.

AB  - The number of publications investigating heart rate variability (HRV) in psychiatry and the behavioral sciences has increased markedly in the last decade. In addition to the significant debates surrounding ideal methods to collect and interpret measures of HRV, standardized reporting of methodology in this field is lacking. Commonly cited recommendations were designed well before recent calls to improve research communication and reproducibility across disciplines. In an effort to standardize reporting, we propose the Guidelines for Reporting Articles on Psychiatry and Heart rate variability (GRAPH), a checklist with four domains: participant selection, interbeat interval collection, data preparation and HRV calculation. This paper provides an overview of these four domains and why their standardized reporting is necessary to suitably evaluate HRV research in psychiatry and related disciplines. Adherence to these communication guidelines will help expedite the translation of HRV research into a potential psychiatric biomarker by improving interpretation, reproducibility and future meta-analyses.

AB  - This paper presents a narrative review of anti-stigma programming using examples from different countries to understand and describe current best practices in the field. Results highlight the importance of targeting the behavioural outcomes of the stigmatization process (discrimination and social inequity), which is consistent with rights-based or social justice models that emphasize social and economic equity for people with disabilities (such as equitable access to services, education, work, etc.). They also call into question large public education approaches in favour of more targeted contact-based interventions. Finally, to add to the research base on best practices, anti-stigma programs are encouraged to create alliances with university researchers in order to critically evaluate their activities and build better, evidence informed practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1987, Kay et al published the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the PANSS manual to address the limitations of existing instruments for schizophrenia research. The PANSS has been one of the most widely used instruments in schizophrenia research until now. Because of recent advances in neuroscience research, it has become essential to reevaluate the performance of the PANSS since its development 3 decades ago.
   METHODS: A comprehensive literature review of the PANSS from 1987 to 2015 using a PubMed search was conducted.
   RESULTS: Five drawbacks to the PANSS have been cited in the literature. Although several authors have pointed out flaws of the PANSS, no revisions or modifications have been attempted to address them. In addition, some researchers do not use the PANSS as intended by the authors, and other researchers misuse it.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PANSS is a reliable and valid instrument that has served the scientific research community well for decades. New advances in experimental psychopathology and personalized psychiatry and the new National Institute of Mental Health paradigm of Research Domain Criteria necessitate a new instrument compatible with advances in clinical neuroscience research.

AB  - Grounded in four theoretical positionsstructural, cognitive, phenomenological, and ethicalthe present review demonstrates the empirical evidence for the incremental validity of narrative identity as a cross-sectional indicator and prospective predictor of well-being, compared with other individual difference and situational variables. In doing so, we develop an organizational framework of four categories of narrative variables: (a) motivational themes, (b) affective themes, (c) themes of integrative meaning, and (d) structural elements. Using this framework, we detail empirical evidence supporting the incremental association between narrative identity and well-being, a case that is strongest for motivational, affective, and integrative meaning themes. These categories of themes serve as vital complimentary correlates and predictors of well-being, alongside commonly assessed variables such as dispositional personality traits. We then use the theoretically grounded review of the empirical literature to develop concrete areas of future research for the field.

AB  - Background. Previous reviews have demonstrated a higher risk of suicide attempts for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons (sexual minorities), compared with heterosexual groups, but these were restricted to general population studies, thereby excluding individuals sampled through LGB community venues. Each sampling strategy, however, has particular methodological strengths and limitations. For instance, general population probability studies have defined sampling frames but are prone to information bias associated with underreporting of LGB identities. By contrast, LGB community surveys may support disclosure of sexuality but overrepresent individuals with strong LGB community attachment.
   Objectives. To reassess the burden of suicide-related behavior among LGB adults, directly comparing estimates derived from population-versus LGB community-based samples.
   Search methods. In 2014, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for articles addressing suicide-related behavior (ideation, attempts) among sexual minorities.
   Selection criteria. We selected quantitative studies of sexual minority adults conducted in nonclinical settings in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
   Data collection and analysis. Random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression assessed for a difference in prevalence of suicide-related behavior by sample type, adjusted for study or sample-level variables, including context (year, country), methods (medium, response rate), and subgroup characteristics (age, gender, sexual minority construct). We examined residual heterogeneity by using tau(2).
   Main results. We pooled 30 cross-sectional studies, including 21 201 sexual minority adults, generating the following lifetime prevalence estimates of suicide attempts: 4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3%, 5%) for heterosexual respondents to population surveys, 11% (95% CI = 8%, 15%) for LGB respondents to population surveys, and 20% (95% CI = 18%, 22%) for LGB respondents to community surveys (Figure 1). The difference in LGB estimates by sample type persisted after we accounted for covariates with meta-regression. Sample type explained 33% of the between-study variability.
   Author's conclusions. Regardless of sample type examined, sexual minorities had a higher lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts than heterosexual persons; however, the magnitude of this disparity was contingent upon sample type. Community-based surveys of LGB people suggest that 20% of sexual minority adults have attempted suicide.
   Public health implications. Accurate estimates of sexual minority health disparities are necessary for public health monitoring and research. Most data describing these disparities are derived from 2 sample types, which yield different estimates of the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts. Additional studies should explore the differential effects of selection and information biases on the 2 predominant sampling approaches used to understand sexual minority health.

AB  - Reversible phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications in mammalian cells. Because this molecular switch is an important mechanism that diversifies and regulates proteins in cellular processes, knowledge about the extent and quantity of phosphorylation is very important to understand the complex cellular interplay. Although phosphoproteomics strategies are applied worldwide, they mainly include only molecular mass spectrometry (like MALDI or ESI)-based experiments. Although identification and relative quantification of phosphopeptides is straightforward with these techniques, absolute quantification is more complex and usually requires for specific isotopically phosphopeptide standards. However, the use of elemental mass spectrometry, and in particular inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), in phosphoproteomics-based experiments, allow one to absolutely quantify phosphopeptides. Here, these phosphoproteomic applications with ICP-MS as elemental detector are reviewed. Pioneering work and recent developments in the field are both described. Additionally, the advantage of the parallel use of molecular and elemental mass spectrometry is stressed. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Mass Spec Rev 35:350-360, 2016.

   Supported employment is a vocational rehabilitation approach that eschews prevocational training in favor of rapid job search for competitive work and follow-along supports to sustain employment, with the individual placement and support (IPS) model being the most standardized and researched model. This review covers recent research on the IPS model of supported employment.
   Recent findings
   The evidence base for IPS-supported employment continues to grow, with seven new randomized controlled trials published, most conducted abroad, resulting in a total of 23 controlled studies showing that IPS is effective at improving work outcomes. Several reviews have concluded that competitive work improves quality of life in persons with serious mental illness, and some research has suggested that employment may confer clinical benefits. Encouraging research has been published on modifications of the IPS model (such as inclusion of supported education), augmentations (such as cognitive remediation) and adaptations for underserved populations (such as persons with criminal justice involvement). Recent studies have also described the effective strategies for implementing and sustaining IPS; others have reported its cost-effectiveness.
   Research continues to accumulate on the effectiveness of IPS-supported employment, adaptations of the model and overcoming programme and policy barriers to its widespread implementation.

AB  - Purpose Older adults with depression are more likely to experience fractures, but it is unclear if this group has reduced bone mineral density (BMD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare BMD in older adults (60 years or older) with or without depression.
   Methods Two independent authors conducted searches of major electronic databases from inception till April 2015. Articles that measured BMD (in g/cm(2)) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the hip or lumbar spine in a sample with depression (including those with major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms, henceforth called depression) and a control group were included. A random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted.
   Results Eleven publications across 10 unique studies representing 2511 participants with depression (mean [standard deviation] = 67.4 [6.5] years, 41.8% female) and 32,574 matched controls (mean [standard deviation] = 67.5 [5.9] years, 38.9% female) were included. Only one study confirmed a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, seven studies used a screening measure to define depressive symptoms, and two studies categorized depression by antidepressant medication use. Meta-analysis established that BMD is reduced at the hip in older adults with depression (g = -0.141, 95% confidence interval = -0.220 to -0.062, p < .0001, I-2 = 61%). Meta-analysis from seven studies suggests that lumbar spine BMD may be reduced (g = -0.122, 95% confidence interval = -0.250 to 0.005, p = .06, I-2 = 71%).
   Conclusions Hip BMD is reduced in older adults with depression, although the effect size is small. Nevertheless, considering the deleterious impact of hip fractures in this population, the results are important. Future research should seek to disentangle the independent effects of depression and antidepressant medication on bone loss in older age.

AB  - Background: For the past 3decades, mental health practitioners have increasingly adopted aspects and tools of strength-based approaches. Providing strength-based intervention and amplifying strengths relies heavily on effective interpersonal processes.
   Aim: This article is a critical review of research regarding the use of strength-based approaches in mental health service settings. The aim is to discuss strength-based interventions within broader research on recovery, focussing on effectiveness and advances in practice where applicable.
   Method: A systematic search for peer-reviewed intervention studies published between 2001 and December 2014 yielded 55 articles of potential relevance to the review.
   Results: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was used to appraise the quality of the studies. Our review found emerging evidence that the utilisation of a strength-based approach improves outcomes including hospitalisation rates, employment/educational attainment, and intrapersonal outcomes such as self-efficacy and sense of hope.
   Conclusion: Recent studies confirm the feasibility of implementing a high-fidelity strength-based approach in clinical settings and its relevance for practitioners in health care. More high-quality studies are needed to further examine the effectiveness of strength-based approaches.

AB  - Objective To clarify the prevalence and predictors of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and where possible compare this to healthy controls.
   Methods We searched major electronic databases until May 2015 for studies reporting T2DM prevalence in people with PTSD. Two independent authors extracted data and completed methodological quality appraisal. A random-effects meta-analysis was used.
   Results From 1171 candidate publications after exclusions, nine publications were included (n = 23,396; 28.6% male; mean age = 35-60 years). The overall prevalence of T2DM was 10.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.1%-12.0%). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that war veterans experience higher prevalence of T2DM (16.3%; 95% CI = 5.2%-31.8%; n studies = 3, n = 473) compared with mixed samples (11.8%; 95% CI = 6.34-18.7, p < .001; n studies = 4, n = 2753). Increasing age ( = 0.0593, 95% CI = 0.010-0.109, z = 2.34, p = .019), median year of publication ( = -0.08, 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.03, z = -3.09, p = .002), and a lower percentage of white participants ( = -3.21, 95% CI = -5.12 to -1.29, z = -2.28, p = .001) predicted prevalence of T2DM. A relative risk meta-analysis comparing controls (n = 125,723) against those with PTSD (n = 23,203) demonstrated a significantly increased risk of T2DM (n studies = 5, relative risk = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.17-1.89, p = .001).
   Conclusions People with PTSD are at a high risk for developing T2DM. The current findings should, however, be interpreted with caution because most studies were based on self-report data.

AB  - Background
   Reports linking the deinstitutionalisation of psychiatric care with homelessness and imprisonment have been published widely.
   Aims
   To identify cohort studies that followed up or traced back long-term psychiatric hospital residents who had been discharged as a consequence of deinstitutionalisation.
   Method
   A broad search strategy was used and 9435 titles and abstracts were screened, 416 full articles reviewed and 171 articles from cohort studies of deinstitutionalised patients were examined in detail.
   Results
   Twenty-three studies of unique populations assessed homelessness and imprisonment among patients discharged from long-term care. Homelessness and imprisonment occurred sporadically; in the majority of studies no single case of homelessness or imprisonment was reported.
   Conclusions
   Our results contradict the findings of ecological studies which indicated a strong correlation between the decreasing number of psychiatric beds and an increasing number of people with mental health problems who were homeless or in prison.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, caused by an expansion of the CAG repeat in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. The disease generally manifests in middle age with both physical and mental symptoms. There are no effective treatments or cures and death usually occurs 10-20 years after initial symptoms. Since the original identification of the Huntington disease associated gene, in 1993, a variety of models have been created and used to advance our understanding of HD. The most recent advances have utilized stem cell models derived from HD-patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offering a variety of screening and model options that were not previously available. The discovery and advancement of technology to make human iPSCs has allowed for a more thorough characterization of human HD on a cellular and developmental level. The interaction between the genome editing and the stem cell fields promises to further expand the variety of HD cellular models available for researchers. In this review, we will discuss the history of Huntington's disease models, common screening assays, currently available models and future directions for modeling HD using iPSCs-derived from HD patients.

AB  - In recent years there has been increasing interest in the neural mechanisms underlying altered emotional processes in children and adolescents with psychopathology. This review provides a brief overview of the most up-to-date findings in the field of event related potentials (ERPs) to facial and vocal emotional expressions in the most common child psychopathological conditions. In regards to externalizing behavior (i.e., ADHD, CD), ERP studies show enhanced early components to anger, reflecting enhanced sensory processing, followed by reductions in later components to anger, reflecting reduced cognitive-evaluative processing. In regards to internalizing behavior, research supports models of increased processing of threat stimuli especially at later more elaborate and effortful stages. Finally, in autism spectrum disorders abnormalities have been observed at early visual-perceptual stages of processing. An affective neuroscience framework for understanding child psychopathology can be valuable in elucidating underlying mechanisms and inform preventive intervention.

AB  - In the majority of cases published between 1907 and 2014, FAS is due to a neurogenic etiology. Only a few reports about FAS with an assumed psychogenic origin have been published. The present article discusses the findings of a careful database search on psychogenic FAS. This review may be particularly relevant as it is the first to analyze the salient features of psychogenic FAS cases to date. This article hopes to pave the way for the view that psychogenic FAS is a cognate of neurogenic FAS. It is felt that this variant of FAS may have been underreported, as most of the psychogenic cases have been published after the turn of the century. This review may improve the diagnosis of the syndrome in clinical practice and highlights the importance of recognizing psychogenic FAS as an independent taxonomic entity.

AB  - New psychoactive substances (NPS) are a heterogeneous and rapidly evolving class of molecules available on the global illicit drug market (e.g smart shops, internet, "dark net") as a substitute for controlled substances. The use of NPS, mainly consumed along with other drugs of abuse and/or alcohol, has resulted in a significantly growing number of mortality and emergency admissions for overdoses, as reported by several poison centers from all over the world. The fact that the number of NPS have more than doubled over the last 10 years, is a critical challenge to governments, the scientific community, and civil society [EMCDDA (European Drug Repel), 2014; UNODC, 2014b; Trends and developments]. The chemical structure (phenethylamines, piperazines, cathinones, tryptamines, synthetic cannabinoids) of NPS and their pharmacological and clinical effects (hallucinogenic, anesthetic, dissociative, depressant) help classify them into different categories. In the recent past, 50% of newly identified NPS have been classified as synthetic cannabinoids followed by new phenethylamines (17%) (UNODC, 2014b). Besides peripheral toxicological effects, many NPS seem to have addictive properties. Behavioral, neurochemical, and electrophysiological evidence can help in detecting them. This manuscript will review existing literature about the addictive and rewarding properties of the most popular NPS classes: cannabimimetics (JWH, HU, CP series) and amphetamine-like stimulants (amphetamine, methamphetamine, methcathinone, and MDMA analogs). Moreover, the review will include recent data from our lab which links JWH-018, a CB1 and CB2 agonist more potent than Delta(9)-THC, to other cannabinoids with known abuse potential, and to other classes of abused drugs that increase dopamine signaling in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) shell. Thus the neurochemical mechanisms that produce the rewarding properties of JWH-018, which most likely contributes to the greater incidence of dependence associated with "Spice" use, will be described (De I et al., 2015a). Considering the growing evidence of a widespread use of NPS, this review will be useful to understand the new trends in the field of drug reward and drug addiction by revealing the rewarding properties of NPS, and will be helpful to gather reliable data regarding the abuse potential of these compounds.

AB  - Mutations of F-box protein 7 (FBXO7) and Parkin, two proteins in ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), are both implicated in pathogenesis of dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin is a HECT/ RING hybrid ligase that physically receives ubiquitin on its catalytic centre and passes ubiquitin onto its substrates, whereas FBXO7 is an adaptor protein in Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) SCFFBXO7 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex to recognize substrates and mediate substrates ubiquitination by SCFFBXO7 E3 ligase. Here, we discuss the overlapping pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical features linking Parkin and FBXO7 with autosomal recessive PD. Both proteins play an important role in neuroprotective mitophagy to clear away impaired mitochondria. Parkin can be recruited to impaired mitochondria whereas cellular stress can promote FBXO7 mitochondrial translocation. PD-linked FBXO7 can recruit Parkin into damaged mitochondria and facilitate its aggregation. WT FBXO7, but not PD-linked FBXO7 mutants can rescue DA neuron degeneration in Parkin null Drosophila. A better understanding of the common pathophysiologic mechanisms of these two proteins could unravel specific pathways for targeted therapy in PD.

AB  - Brain disorders remain one of the defining challenges of modern medicine and among the most poorly served with new therapeutics. Advances in human neurogenetics have begun to shed light on the genomic architecture of complex diseases of mood, cognition, brain development, and neurodegeneration. From genome-wide association studies to rare variants, these findings hold promise for defining the pathogenesis of brain disorders that have resisted simple molecular description. However, the path from genetics to new medicines is far from clear and can take decades, even for the most well-understood genetic disorders. In this review, we define three challenges for the field of neurogenetics that we believe must be addressed to translate human genetics efficiently into new therapeutics for brain disorders.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in persistent cognitive, behavioral and emotional deficits. However, the vast majority of patients are not chronically hospitalized; rather they have to manage their disabilities once they are discharged to home. Promoting recovery to pre-injury level is important from a patient care as well as a societal perspective. Electrical neuromodulation is one approach that has shown promise in alleviating symptoms associated with neurological disorders such as in Parkinson's disease (PD) and epilepsy. Consistent with this perspective, both animal and clinical studies have revealed that TBI alters physiological oscillatory rhythms. More recently several studies demonstrated that low frequency stimulation improves cognitive outcome in models of TBI. Specifically, stimulation of the septohippocampal circuit in the theta frequency entrained oscillations and improved spatial learning following TBI. In order to evaluate the potential of electrical deep brain stimulation for clinical translation we review the basic neurophysiology of oscillations, their role in cognition and how they are changed post-TBI. Furthermore, we highlight several factors for future pre-clinical and clinical studies to consider, with the hope that it will promote a hypothesis driven approach to subsequent experimental designs and ultimately successful translation to improve outcome in patients with TBI.

AB  - Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as neurotransmitters and hormones. In addition to the "classical" biogenic amines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as "trace" amines (TAs), are now recognized to play significant neurophysiological and behavioral functions. At the turn of the century, the discovery of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as beta-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tyramine, and structurally-related amphetamines, unveiled mechanisms of action for TAs other than interference with aminergic pathways, laying the foundations for deciphering the functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1. Although, its molecular interactions and downstream targets have not been fully elucidated, TAAR1 activation triggers accumulation of intracellular cAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the beta-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and therefore designing more efficacious therapeutic interventions for, a range of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve aminergic dysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has uncovered the remarkable potential of TAAR1-based medications as new generation pharmacotherapies in neuropsychiatry. This review summarizes recent developments in the study of TAs and TAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is one of the most frequently diagnosed neurological disorders in emergency departments. Although there are established recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment in the acute stage, there is an on-going debate in which diagnostic methods and risk factors predict unfavourable long-term outcome after mTBI. This literature review addresses the question, which diagnostic approaches may best predict persistent post-traumatic symptoms (pPTS). A literature search for experimental studies from January 2000 to September 2014 evaluating the following diagnostic approaches (1) susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), (2) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), (3) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), (4) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as predictive factors of pPTS or unfavourable cognitive outcome in adult populations with mTBI was performed. DTI has been proved to be a valuable tool to identify diffuse axonal injury (DAI) after mTBI. Additionally, some studies showed associations between DAI and unfavourable cognitive outcome. SWI has shown to be a highly sensitive imaging method to identify microbleeds. The presence and quantity of microbleeds in this imaging technique can further provide aetiological evidence for pPTS. MRS provides information about local neurons metabolism and preliminary data show that creatine-phosphocreatine levels measured after mTBI are predictive of cognitive outcome and emotional distress. The results of one study have shown fMRI as a useful tool to differentiate mTBI patients with pPTS from controls and mTBI patients without pPTS in a resting-state condition. From the evaluated diagnostic approaches to predict pPTS after mTBI, DTI, SWI, MRS, and fMRI seem to have adequate sensitivity and specificity as predictive diagnostic tools for pPTS. Large longitudinal clinical trials are warranted to validate the prognostic applicability and practicability in daily clinical practice.

AB  - Many studies indicate that oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Oxidative stress can induce neuronal damages, modulate intracellular signaling and ultimately leads to neuronal death by apoptosis or necrosis. To review antioxidants preventive effects on oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases we accumulated data from international medical journals and academic informations' sites. According to many studies, antioxidants could reduce toxic neuronal damages and many studies confirmed the efficacy of polyphenol antioxidants in fruits and vegetables to reduce neuronal death and to diminish oxidative stress. This systematic review showed the antioxidant activities of phytochemicals which play as natural neuroprotectives with low adverse effects against some neurodegenerative diseases as Parkinson or Alzheimer diseases.

AB  - Although community mental health services aim to support patients' autonomy and independence, they have repeatedly been criticised for making patients dependent. Yet, it remains often unclear what exactly is meant with dependency in this context. This review aimed to identify the meaning of the term dependency on community services in the literature.
   A systematic search and conceptual review of papers where dependency is used in the context of community mental health services. Narrative synthesis was used to identify thematic concepts linked to dependency in these settings.
   Fifteen papers met the inclusion criteria. The analysis identified five different concepts of dependency on community mental health services: dislocation from the outside world; inflexibility and lack of freedom; obligation as resentment or appreciation; living with or without meaningful activities; and security.
   The findings suggest that, distinct from the exclusively negative connotation of the term dependency in a conventional medical context, dependency on community mental health services contains both negative and positive aspects. The different aspects might guide the future evaluation of the care provided in such services.

AB  - BackgroundEarly detection of schizophrenia risk is a critical goal in the field. Endophenotypes in children to relatives of affected individuals may contribute to this early detection. One of the lowest cost and longest theorized domains is motor development in children.
   MethodsA meta-analysis was conducted comparing individuals 21 years old with affected first-degree relatives (FDR) with (1) individuals from unaffected families (controls), or (2)individuals with FDR having other psychiatric disorders. Studies were classified by motor outcome and separate meta-analyses were performed across six correlated domains, with available N varying by domain.
   ResultsInclusion criteria were met by k=23 independent studies with a total N=18,582, and N across domains varying from 167 to 8619. The youth from affected families had delays in gross and fine motor development in infancy (k=3, n=167, Hedges'g=0.644, confidence intervals (CI)=[0.328, 0.960], p<.001), walking milestones (k=3, n=608, g=0.444, CI=[0.108, 0.780], p=.01), coordination (k=8, n=8619, g=0.625, CI=[0.453, 0.797], p<.0001), and had more abnormal movements such as involuntary movements (k=6, n=8365, g=0.291, CI=[0.041, 0.542], p=.02) compared with controls. However, not all effects survived correction for publication bias. Effects for neurological soft signs were small and not reliably different from zero (k=4, n=548, g=0.238, CI=[-0.106, 0.583], p=.18). When comparing the FDR group to youth from families with other psychiatric disorders, the FDR group was distinguished by poorer gross and fine motor skills (k=2, n=275, g=0.847, CI=[0.393, 1.300], p<.001).
   ConclusionsMotor deficits during development likely represent an endophenotype for schizophrenia, although its specificity is limited in relation to other serious mental disorders. It holds promise as a low cost domain for early risk detection, although it will have to be combined with other indicators to achieve clinically usable prediction accuracy. Impaired coordination was the most robust result with a moderate effect size and lack of heterogeneity and publication bias.

AB  - The highly stereotyped, crystal-like architecture of the cerebellum has long served as a basis for hypotheses with regard to the function(s) that it subserves. Historically, most clinical observations and experimental work have focused on the involvement of the cerebellum in motor control, with particular emphasis on coordination and learning. Two main models have been suggested to account for cerebellar functioning. According to Llinas's theory, the cerebellum acts as a control machine that uses the rhythmic activity of the inferior olive to synchronize Purkinje cell populations for fine-tuning of coordination. In contrast, the Ito-Marr-Albus theory views the cerebellum as a motor learning machine that heuristically refines synaptic weights of the Purkinje cell based on error signals coming from the inferior olive. Here, we review the role of timing of neuronal events, oscillatory behavior, and synaptic and non-synaptic influences in functional plasticity that can be recorded in awake animals in various physiological and pathological models in a perspective that also includes non-motor aspects of cerebellar function. We discuss organizational levels from genes through intracellular signaling, synaptic network to system and behavior, as well as processes from signal production and processing to memory, delegation, and actual learning. We suggest an integrative concept for control and learning based on articulated oscillation templates.

AB  - The aim of this review was to verify data concerning the relationship between the existent lifestyle and glycemic control in patients with Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 (DM1). The methods applied included the literature search strategy, selection of studies by means of inclusion and exclusion strategies, according to the characteristics of the studies. The search was conducted in the Lilacs, Medline, PubMed, Cochrame, SciELO and IBECS databases between in the period between 2005 and 2014. The articles selected were studies in humans, investing lifestyle, physical activities and glycemic levels. Of the 1798 studies initially identified, 11 met the eligibility criteria. Among the studies analyzed, 1 cohort; 1 longitudinal prospective, 1 case control and 8 transversal studies that approached the proposed theme were related. Regular physical activity was the variable that presented greatest relationship with the improvement in glycemic levels. Healthy active life, balanced diet, physical activities and education in diabetes improved the glycemic control of the DM1 patient. The results allowed the authors to conclude that a lifestyle based on physical activities interfered directly in the health of patients with DM1, in addition to contributing the glycemic control.

AB  - Objectives: (1) To collect, analyze and synthetize the evidence on muscle dysmorphia diagnosis as defined by Pope et al. and (2) To discuss its appropriate nosology and inclusion as a specific category in psychiatric classificatory systems.
   Method: A systematic search in the MEDLINE, the PsycNET, the LILACS and SciELO databases and in the International Journal of Eating Disorders was conducted looking for articles published between January 1997 and October 2014 and in EMBASE database between January 1997 and August 2013. Only epidemiological and analytical studies were considered for selection. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed according to the Evidence-Based Mental Health and the National Health and Medical Research Council's guidelines. The support for inclusion of muscle dysmorphia in psychiatric classificatory systems was examined against Blashfield et al.'s criteria.
   Results: Thirty-four articles were considered eligible out of 5136. Most of the studies were cross-sectional and enrolled small, non-clinical samples. The methodological quality of all selected papers was graded at the lowest hierarchical level due to studies' designs. Forty-one percent of the publications considered the available evidence insufficient to support the inclusion of muscle dysmorphia in any existing category of psychiatric disorders. The current literature does not fulfill Blashfield et al.'s criteria for the inclusion of muscle dysmorphia as a specific entity in psychiatric diagnostic manuals.
   Conclusion: The current evidence does not ensure the validity, clinical utility, nosological classification and inclusion of muscle dysmorphia as a new disorder in classificatory systems of mental disorders.

AB  - This paper reviews recent research on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in elderly depressed patients. The PubMed database was searched for literature published within the past 4 years, using the search terms: "electroconvulsive elderly," "electroconvulsive geriatric," "ECT and elderly," and "ECT elderly cognition." The studies in this review indicate excellent efficacy for ECT in geriatric patients. Adverse cognitive effects of ECT in this population are usually transient and not typically severe. In addition, continuation/maintenance ECT (C/M-ECT) may be a favorable strategy for relapse prevention in the elderly after a successful acute course of ECT. ECT is an important treatment option for depressed geriatric patients with severe and/or treatment-resistant illness. New data add to the evidence demonstrating that ECT is a highly effective, safe, and well-tolerated antidepressant treatment option for geriatric patients.

   Methods: We conducted a systematic search of original empirical articles published between January 1, 1990 and June 1, 2015. The qualitative synthesis was performed using the Theory of Triadic Influence as a framework.
   Results: Fifty-two studies were reviewed. Intrapersonal (e.g., personality traits, drinking motives and expectancies, depression), interpersonal (e.g., parental and peer alcohol use, violence exposure) and attitudinal factors (e.g., media exposure to alcohol, religiosity) influence ARNCs. Emerging evidence of new trends contributing to ARNCs include ready mixed alcohol drinks and childhood trauma and abuse.
   Conclusions: Risk factors from all domains of influence were observed. More research is needed on protective factors and how alcohol use interacts with preventive factors in predicting ARNCs. The conceptualization of negative consequences varies significantly between studies and may impact the external validity of previous research.

AB  - The mechanism by which a learnt synaptic weight change can contribute to learning or adaptation of brain function is a type of credit assignment problem, which is a key issue for many parts of the brain. In the cerebellum, detailed knowledge not only of the local circuitry connectivity but also of the topography of different sources of afferent/external information makes this problem particularly tractable. In addition, multiple forms of synaptic plasticity and their general rules of induction have been identified. In this review, we will discuss the possible roles of synaptic and cellular plasticity at specific locations in contributing to behavioral changes. Focus will be on the parts of the cerebellum that are devoted to limb control, which constitute a large proportion of the cortex and where the knowledge of the external connectivity is particularly well known. From this perspective, a number of sites of synaptic plasticity appear to primarily have the function of balancing the overall level of activity in the cerebellar circuitry, whereas the locations at which synaptic plasticity leads to functional changes in terms of limb control are more limited. Specifically, the postsynaptic forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at the parallel fiber synapses made on interneurons and Purkinje cells, respectively, are the types of plasticity that mediate the widest associative capacity and the tightest link between the synaptic change and the external functions that are to be controlled.

AB  - Production and utilization of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), which are smart materials with ability of sensing and destroying chemical contaminants, is growing rapidly. However, these materials seem to have some ecological and health adverse effects. Hence, the main goal of this review study is to give a brief description about the recent developments of the commercial available engineered nano particles in the environmental remediation and also to note the current state of findings about the toxic effects of such advanced materials. The key references revealed the potential in vitro and/or in vivo toxic effects of some ENPs which are commonly used in environmental remediation. However, with respect to highly potential physicochemical and biochemical properties of ENPs, the studies which have been carried out till now are not ample to obtain satisfactory exposure data for both human beings and the environment. Therefore, more surveys should be done in this field to fill the gap of high quality data and to develop new engineered nanoparticles with minimum toxicity.

AB  - Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method mostly utilised in the treatment of major depression. The aim of the current study was to systematically review the literature on the cognitive effects of DTMS applied with the H-coil system in major psychiatric disorders. Following a literature search in Psyclnfo and PubMed (any time to December 2015), 13 out of 32 studies on DTMS and cognitive functioning were included in the current review. Three studies included 38 healthy participants, eight studies included 158 unipolar or bipolar depression patients and two studies included 45 schizophrenia patients. Low-frequency DTMS (1-3 sessions) had little effect on cognitive functioning in healthy participants. The most consistent cognitive and clinical improvements were reported in the short-term (after 20 daily sessions of high-frequency DTMS with H1-coil) in studies with major depression patients. There was also a trend towards a short-term cognitive and clinical improvement in studies with schizophrenia patients. High-frequency DTMS might improve cognitive functioning and alleviate clinical symptoms in the short-term, particularly in major depression. However, this conclusion is based on data from mostly uncontrolled, open-label studies with patients receiving concurrent antidepressants or antipsychotics. Randomised, sham-controlled trials are needed to investigate the magnitude of the cognitive outcomes of DIMS in the short-term and beyond the daily stimulation phase in major psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: For people with mental illness that are violent, a range of interventions have been adopted with the aim of reducing violence outcomes. Many of these interventions have been borrowed from other (offender) populations and their evidence base in a Serious Mental Illness (SMI) population is uncertain.
   Aims: To aggregate the evidence base for non-pharmacological interventions in reducing violence amongst adults with SMI and PD (Personality Disorder), and to assess the efficacy of these interventions. We chose to focus on distinct interventions rather than on holistic service models where any element responsible for therapeutic change would be difficult to isolate.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review and narrative synthesis of non-pharmacological interventions intended to reduce violence in a SMI population and in patients with a primary diagnosis of PD. Five online databases were searched alongside a manual search of seven relevant journals, and expert opinion was sourced. Eligibility of all returned articles was independently assessed by two authors, and quality of studies was appraised via the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for Assessing Risk of Bias.
   Results: We included 23 studies of diverse psychological and practical interventions, with a range of experimental and quasi-experimental study designs that included 7 Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs). The majority were studies of Mentally Disordered Offenders. The stronger evidence existed for patients with a SMI diagnosis receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or modified Reasoning & Rehabilitation (R&R). For patients with a primary diagnosis of PD, a modified version of R&R appeared tolerable and Enhanced Thinking Skills showed some promise in improving attitudes over the short-term, but studies of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy in this population were compromised by high risk of experimental bias. Little evidence could be found for non-pharmacological, non-psychological interventions.
   Conclusions: The evidence for non-pharmacological interventions for reducing violence in this population is not conclusive. Long-term outcomes are lacking and good quality RCTs are required to develop a stronger evidence base. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Advances in salivary bioscience enable unique opportunities to explore individual differences in biological mechanisms related to learning and memory, psychiatric disorders, and more recently neurodegenerative diseases, neurotrauma/stroke, pain, and sleep. Sampling oral fluid is not only minimally invasive, but specimens can be collected easily and quickly in clinical and field settings. Salivary analytes allow neuroscientists to index endocrine, autonomic, immune, metabolic, and inflammatory processes within close proximity of discrete behavioral, biological, and social events, which is particularly important to advancing our understanding of human neuroscience. This review provides an update on the advances in salivary bioscience for specialty fields within neuroscience, presents novel salivary analytes of interest to neuroscience and the status of their development, and outlines a procedural framework to facilitate integration of these concepts and methods into neuroscience.

AB  - Given the importance of unemployment in health inequalities, re-employment of unemployed persons into paid employment may be a powerful intervention to increase population health. It is suggested that integrated programmes of vocational reintegration with health promotion may improve the likelihood of entering paid employment of long-term unemployed persons with severe mental health problems. However, the current evidence regarding whether entering paid employment of this population will contribute to a reduction in health problems remains unambiguous. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of re-employment programmes with regard to health and quality of life. Three electronic databases were searched (up to March 2015). Two reviewers independently selected articles and assessed the risk of bias on prespecified criteria. Measures of effects were pooled and random effect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was conducted, where possible. Sixteen studies were included. Nine studies described functioning as an outcome measure. Five studies with six comparisons provided enough information to calculate a pooled effect size of -0.01 (95% CI -0.13 to 0.11). Fifteen studies presented mental health as an outcome measure of which six with comparable psychiatric symptoms resulted in a pooled effect size of 0.20 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.62). Thirteen studies described quality of life as an outcome measure. Seven of these studies, describing eight comparisons, provided enough information to calculate a pooled effect size of 0.28 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.52). Re-employment programmes have a modest positive effect on the quality of life. No evidence was found for any effect of these re-employment programmes on functioning and mental health.

AB  - Background: Several lines of evidence implicate dysfunctional neuronal plasticity in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ). Aberrant glutamatergic and gamma aminobutyric acid neurotransmission are thought to underlie core cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of SCZ. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) allows for the in vivo study of cortical plasticity and excitability at the systems level of the human motor cortex. This review will focus on summarizing the available neurophysiological evidence for impaired motor cortical plasticity in SCZ assessed by NIBS.
   Methods: A search of MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed was performed on the use of NIBS techniques to investigate neuroplasticity in the motor cortex of SCZ patients. The relevant articles were summarized.
   Conclusion: Our review of the literature reveals evidence for disrupted neuroplasticity in SCZ and its close association to alterations in cortical inhibition and dysfunctional intracortical connectivity. Further investigations are required to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie dysfunctional plasticity in SCZ in order to develop more targeted therapeutic interventions for SCZ patients.

AB  - The multifactorial origin of most chronic disorders of the brain, including schizophrenia, has been well accepted. Consequently, pharmacotherapy would require multitargeted strategies. This contrasts to the majority of drug therapies used until now, addressing more or less specifically only one target molecule. Nevertheless, quite some searches for multiple molecular targets specific for mental disorders have been undertaken. For example, genome-wide association studies have been conducted to discover new target genes of disease. Unfortunately, these attempts have not fulfilled the great hopes they have started with. Polypharmacology and network pharmacology approaches of drug treatment endeavor to abandon the one-drug one-target thinking. To this end, most approaches set out to investigate network topologies searching for modules, endowed with "important" nodes, such as "hubs" or "bottlenecks", encompassing features of disease networks, and being useful as tentative targets of drug therapies. This kind of research appears to be very promising. However, blocking or inhibiting "important" targets may easily result in destruction of network integrity. Therefore, it is suggested here to study functions of nodes with lower centrality for more subtle impact on network behavior. Targeting multiple nodes with low impact on network integrity by drugs with multiple activities ("dirty drugs") or by several drugs, simultaneously, avoids to disrupt network integrity and may reset deviant dynamics of disease. Natural products typically display multi target functions and therefore could help to identify useful biological targets. Hence, future efforts should consider to combine drug-target networks with target-disease networks using mathematical (graph theoretical) tools, which could help to develop new therapeutic strategies in long-term psychiatric disorders.

AB  - AIM: To provide a comprehensive overview of clinical studies on the clinical picture of Internet-use related addictions from a holistic perspective. A literature search was conducted using the database Web of Science.
   METHODS: Over the last 15 years, the number of Internet users has increased by 1000%, and at the same time, research on addictive Internet use has proliferated. Internet addiction has not yet been understood very well, and research on its etiology and natural history is still in its infancy. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association included Internet Gaming Disorder in the appendix of the updated version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as condition that requires further research prior to official inclusion in the main manual, with important repercussions for research and treatment. To date, reviews have focused on clinical and treatment studies of Internet addiction and Internet Gaming Disorder. This arguably limits the analysis to a specific diagnosis of a potential disorder that has not yet been officially recognised in the Western world, rather than a comprehensive and inclusive investigation of Internet-use related addictions (including problematic Internet use) more generally.
   RESULTS: The systematic literature review identified a total of 46 relevant studies. The included studies used clinical samples, and focused on characteristics of treatment seekers and online addiction treatment. Four main types of clinical research studies were identified, namely research involving (1) treatment seeker characteristics; (2) psychopharmacotherapy; (3) psychological therapy; and (4) combined treatment.
   CONCLUSION: A consensus regarding diagnostic criteria and measures is needed to improve reliability across studies and to develop effective and efficient treatment approaches for treatment seekers.

AB  - Identifying biomarkers that can be used as diagnostics or predictors of treatment response (theranostics) in people with schizophrenia (Sz) will be an important step towards being able to provide personalized treatment. Findings from the studies in brain tissue have not yet been translated into biomarkers that are practical in clinical use because brain biopsies are not acceptable and neuroimaging techniques are expensive and the results are inconclusive. Thus, in recent years, there has been search for blood-based biomarkers for Sz as a valid alternative. Although there are some encouraging preliminary data to support the notion of peripheral biomarkers for Sz, it must be acknowledged that Sz is a complex and heterogeneous disorder which needs to be further dissected into subtype using biological based and clinical markers. The scope of this review is to critically examine published blood-based biomarker of Sz, focusing on possible uses for diagnosis, treatment response, or their relationship with schizophrenia-associated phenotype. We sorted the studies into six categories which include: (1) brain-derived neurotrophic factor; (2) inflammation and immune function; (3) neurochemistry; (4) oxidative stress response and metabolism; (5) epigenetics and microRNA; and (6) transcriptome and proteome studies. This review also summarized the molecules which have been conclusively reported as potential blood-based biomarkers for Sz in different blood cell types. Finally, we further discusses the pitfall of current blood-based studies and suggest that a prediction model-based, Sz specific, blood oriented study design as well as standardize blood collection conditions would be useful for Sz biomarker development.

AB  - AIM: To identify findings concerning white matter (WM) fibre microstructural alterations in anorexia nervosa (AN).
   METHODS: A systematic electronic search was undertaken in several databases up to April 2015. The search strategy aimed to locate all studies published in English or Spanish that included participants with AN and which investigated WM using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Trials were assessed for quality assessment according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses checklist and a published quality index guideline.
   RESULTS: A total of 6 studies met the inclusion criteria, four of people in the acute state of the illness, one included both recovered and unwell participants, and one included people who had recovered. Participants were female with ages ranging from 14 to 29 years. All studies but one measured a range of psychopathological features. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were the main DTI correlates reported. Alterations were reported in a range of WM structures of the limbic system, most often of the fornix and cingulum as well as the fronto-occipital fibre tracts, i.e., regions associated with anxiety, body image and cognitive function. Subtle abnormalities also appeared to persist after recovery.
   CONCLUSION: This diversity likely reflects the symptom complexity of AN. However, there were few studies, they applied different methodologies, and all were cross-sectional.

   Methods: CINAHL, PubMed, and Science Direct were used to search for materials.
   Results and conclusion: Evidence from this review is that there is a necessity to increase the availability and quality of mental health care. Mental health policy and services in Palestine need development in order to better meet the needs of service users and professionals. It is essential to raise awareness of mental health and increase the integration of mental health services with other areas of health care. Civilians need their basic human needs met, including having freedom of movement and seeing an end to the occupation. There is a need to enhance the resilience and capacity of community mental health teams. There is a need to increase resources and offer more support, up-to-date training and supervision to mental health teams.

AB  - Selective motor neuron degeneration is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Around 10% of all cases present as familial ALS (FALS), while sporadic ALS (SALS) accounts for the remaining 90%. Diverse genetic mutations leading to FALS have been identified, but the underlying causes of SALS remain largely unknown. Despite the heterogeneous and incompletely understood etiology, different types of ALS exhibit overlapping pathology and common phenotypes, including protein aggregation and mitochondrial deficiencies. Here, we review the current understanding of mechanisms leading to motor neuron degeneration in ALS as they pertain to disrupted cellular clearance pathways. ATP biogenesis, calcium buffering and mitochondrial dynamics. Through focusing on impaired autophagic and mitochondrial functions, we highlight how the convergence of diverse cellular processes and pathways contributes to common pathology in motor neuron degeneration.

AB  - The strength model of self-control assumes that all acts of self-control (e.g., emotion regulation, persistence) are empowered by a single global metaphorical strength that has limited capacity. This strength can become temporarily depleted after a primary self-control act, which, in turn, can impair performance in subsequent acts of self-control. Recently, the assumptions of the strength model of self-control also have been adopted and tested in the field of sport and exercise psychology. The present review paper aims to give an overview of recent developments in self-control research based on the strength model of self-control. Furthermore, recent research on interventions on how to improve and revitalize self-control strength will be presented. Finally, the strength model of self-control has been criticized lately, as well as expanded in scope, so the present paper will also discuss alternative explanations of why previous acts of self-control can lead to impaired performance in sport and exercise.

AB  - In Brazil, the history of droughts has been marked by constant social and health tragedies, with estimates of up to 3 million deaths from the early 19th century until the late 20th century. There is a record of nearly 32,000 events related to the above and more than 96 million people were affected between 1991 and 2010. Although droughts have historically brought disasters to Brazil, which was noted in the scientific expeditions of Arthur Neiva and Belisario Penna that documented these droughts, there have not been many studies on them. The objective of this paper is to present a revision of the scientific articles related to droughts and public health. The following databases were used: PubMed, the Preparation and Response to Disasters Portal from BVS and the Capes Periodical Portal. The descriptors drought and health were used to search titles and summaries of articles in English, Portuguese and Spanish. Among the repercussions related to health that were discovered: malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies, mental health problems, issues relating to water and air quality and commitments made concerning access to health services. As there is a trend for more intense droughts and a scarcity of water until 2030, there is an urgent need for more research and studies in these areas.

   MethodsFourteen databases were searched to identify qualitative and quantitative researches that examined barriers and/or facilitators to mental health care among the six groups of potentially disadvantaged young people.
   ResultsOut of 62 studies identified, 3 were conducted with ATSI young people, 1 with CALD young people, 4 with LGBTQI young people, 14 with homeless young people, 24 with substance-using young people, and 16 with young people residing in rural or remote areas. Findings generally confirmed barriers already established for all young people, but indicated that some may be heightened for young people in the six identified groups. Findings also pointed to both similarities and differences between these groups, suggesting that ATSI, CALD, LGBTQI, homeless, substance-using, and rural young people have some similar needs with respect to not only mental health care, but also other needs likely to reflect their individual circumstances.
   DiscussionThis systematic review highlights that young people from potentially disadvantaged groups have distinct needs that must be recognized to improve their experiences with mental health care. Future research of good methodological quality with young people is needed to increase accessibility of, and engagement with, mental health care.

AB  - Objective: There has been an increasing number of employer best practice guidelines (BPGs) for the return to work (RTW) from mental disorder-related disability leave. This systematic review addresses 2 questions: 1) What is the quality of the development and recommendations of these BPGs? and 2) What are the areas of agreement and discrepancy among the identified guidelines related to the RTW from mental illness-related disability leave?
   Method: A systematic literature search was performed using publically available grey literature and best practice portals. It focused on the RTW of workers with medically certified disability leave related to mental disorders. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) was used to assess the quality of the development and recommendations of these BPGs.
   Results: A total of 58 unique documents were identified for screening. After screening, 5 BPGs were appraised using AGREE II; 3 BPGs were included in the final set. There were no discrepancies among the 3, although they were from different countries. They all agreed there should be: 1) well-described organizational policies and procedures for the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders, 2) a disability leave plan, and 3) work accommodations. In addition, one guideline suggested supervisor training and mental health literacy training for all staff.
   Conclusion: Although there were no discrepancies among the 3 BPGs, they emphasized different aspects of RTW and could be considered to be complementary. Together, they provide important guidance for those seeking to understand employer best practices for mental illness-related disability.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Antipsychotics are used increasingly in youth for nonpsychotic and off-label indications, but cardiometabolic adverse effects and (especially) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk have raised additional concern.
   OBJECTIVE To assess T2DM risk associated with antipsychotic treatment in youth.
   DATA SOURCES Systematic literature search of PubMed and PsycINFO without language restrictions from database inception until May 4, 2015. Data analyses were performed in July 2015, and additional analyses were added in November 2015.
   STUDY SELECTION Longitudinal studies reporting on T2DM incidence in youth 2 to 24 years old exposed to antipsychotics for at least 3 months.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression of T2DM risk.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary outcomes were study-defined T2DM, expressed as cumulative T2DM risk or as T2DM incidence rate per patient-years. Secondary outcomes included the comparison of the coprimary outcomes in antipsychotic-treated youth with psychiatric controls not receiving antipsychotics or with healthy controls
   RESULTS Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 185 105 youth exposed to antipsychotics and 310 438 patient-years. The mean (SD) age of patients was 14.1 (2.1) years, and 59.5% were male. The mean (SD) follow-up was 1.7 (2.3) years. Among them, 7 studies included psychiatric controls (1 342 121 patients and 2 071 135 patient-years), and 8 studies included healthy controls (298 803 patients and 463 084 patient-years). Antipsychotic-exposed youth had a cumulative T2DM risk of 5.72 (95% CI, 3.45-9.48; P < .001) per 1000 patients. The incidence rate was 3.09 (95% CI, 2.35-3.82; P < .001) cases per 1000 patient-years. Compared with healthy controls, cumulative T2DM risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.58; 95% CI, 1.56-4.24; P < .0001) and incidence rate ratio (IRR) (IRR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.71-5.35; P < .0001) were significantly greater in antipsychotic-exposed youth. Similarly, compared with psychiatric controls, antipsychotic-exposed youth had significantly higher cumulative T2DM risk (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.50-52.90; P < .0001) and IRR (IRR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.31-2.44; P < .0001). In multivariable meta-regression analyses of 10 studies, greater cumulative T2DM risk was associated with longer follow-up (P < .001), olanzapine prescription (P < .001), and male sex (P = .002) (r(2) = 1.00, P < .001). Greater T2DM incidence was associated with second-generation antipsychotic prescription (P <= .050) and less autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (P = .048) (r(2) = 0.21, P = .044).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although T2DM seems rare in antipsychotic-exposed youth, cumulative risk and exposure-adjusted incidences and IRRs were significantly higher than in healthy controls and psychiatric controls. Olanzapine treatment and antipsychotic exposure time were the main modifiable risk factors for T2DM development in antipsychotic-exposed youth. Antipsychotics should be used judiciously and for the shortest necessary duration, and their efficacy and safety should be monitored proactively.

AB  - Background: Hippocrates flagged the value of sleep for good health. Nonetheless, historically, researchers with an interest in developmental psychopathology have largely ignored a possible role for atypical sleep. Recently, however, there has been a surge of interest in this area, perhaps reflecting increased evidence that disturbed or insufficient sleep can result in poor functioning in numerous domains. This review outlines what is known about sleep in the psychiatric diagnoses most relevant to children and for which associations with sleep are beginning to be understood. While based on a comprehensive survey of the literature, the focus of the current review is on the latest science (largely from 2010). There is a description of both concurrent and longitudinal links as well as possible mechanisms underlying associations. Preliminary treatment research is also considered which suggests that treating sleep difficulties may result in improvements in behavioural areas beyond sleep quality. Findings: To maximise progress in this field, there now needs to be: (a) greater attention to the assessment of sleep in children; (b) sleep research on a wider range of psychiatric disorders; (c) a greater focus on and examination of mechanisms underlying associations; (d) a clearer consideration of developmental questions and (e) large-scale well-designed treatment studies. Conclusions: While sleep problems may sometimes be missed by parents and healthcare providers; hence constituting a hidden risk for other psychopathologies-knowing about these difficulties creates unique opportunities. The current excitement in this field from experts in diverse areas including developmental psychology, clinical psychology, genetics and neuropsychology should make these opportunities a reality.

AB  - People affected by neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are frequently the target of social stigmatization. To date not much attention has been given to stigma in relation to NTDs. The objective of this review is to identify the extent of social stigma and the similarities and differences in the causes, manifestations, impact of stigma and interventions used between the NTDs.
   A systematic review was conducted in Pubmed, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge. The search encompassed 17 NTDs, including podoconiosis, but not leprosy as this NTD has recently been reviewed. However, leprosy was included in the discussion.
   The 52 selected articles provided evidence on stigma related to lymphatic filariasis (LF), podoconiosis, Buruli ulcer, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, trachoma, soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and human African trypanosomiasis. The similarities predominated in stigma related to the various NTDs; only minimal differences in stigma reasons and measures were found.
   These similarities suggest that joint approaches to reduce stigmatization may be feasible. Lessons from leprosy and other stigmatized health conditions can be used to plan such joint approaches. Further research will be necessary to study the efficacy of joint interventions and to investigate stigma related to NTDs for which no evidence is available yet.

AB  - Background The association between fish consumption and risk of depression is controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the association.
   Methods A literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science database for all relevant studies up to March 2015. We pooled the relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs from individual studies with random effects model, and conducted meta-regression to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was estimated by Egger's test and the funnel plot.
   Results A total of 26 studies involving 150 278 participants were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled RR of depression for the highest versus lowest consumption of fish was 0.83 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.93). The findings remained significant in the cohort studies (RR= 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94, n= 10) as well as in the cross-sectional studies (RR= 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00, n= 16). When men and women were analysed separately, a significant inverse association was also observed. There was no evidence of publication bias.
   Conclusions This meta-analysis indicates that high-fish consumption can reduce the risk of depression.

AB  - The objective of this review is to report on recent developments in youth mental health incorporating all levels of severity of mental disorders encouraged by progress in the field of early intervention in psychotic disorders, research in deficiencies in the current system and social advocacy.
   The authors have briefly reviewed the relevant current state of knowledge, challenges and the service and research response across four countries (Australia, Ireland, the UK and Canada) currently active in the youth mental health field.
   Here we present information on response to principal challenges associated with improving youth mental services in each country. Australia has developed a model comprised of a distinct front-line youth mental health service (Headspace) to be implemented across the country and initially stimulated by success in early intervention in psychosis; in Ireland, Headstrong has been driven primarily through advocacy and philanthropy resulting in front-line services (Jigsaw) which are being implemented across different jurisdictions; in the UK, a limited regional response has addressed mostly problems with transition from child-adolescent to adult mental health services; and in Canada, a national multi-site research initiative involving transformation of youth mental health services has been launched with public and philanthropic funding, with the expectation that results of this study will inform implementation of a transformed model of service across the country including indigenous peoples.
   There is evidence that several countries are now engaged in transformation of youth mental health services and in evaluation of these initiatives.

AB  - Background: Women of reproductive potential with substance use disorders, especially those who are pregnant, present many clinical challenges to healthcare providers, including comorbid psychiatric disorders, a history of trauma and abuse, avoidance of or poor access to prenatal care, fear of legal consequences, and countertransference reactions. Methods: In November 2013, members of the Women's Mental Health Special Interest Group of the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine presented a Workshop reviewing substance abuse in pregnancy, highlighting the specific contributions that psychosomatic medicine specialists can make in the care of these patients. The discussion focused on epidemiology; maternal and fetal risks; and screening and treatment considerations for tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, stimulants, and several other substances. Objective: Our purpose in publishing this review is to provide clinicians and educators with the most up-to-date summary in this field to better engage these patients in care and break the intergenerational cycle of abuse and addiction.

AB  - Recently, more and more researchers have been using salivary cortisol reactivity to evaluate stress in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The aim of this integrative literature review was to summarize the evidence of interventions leading to a change in salivary cortisol from the baseline in preterm infants in the NICU. The electronic databases of PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were studies with preterm infants exposed to an intervention evaluated by salivary cortisol reactivity before discharge from the NICU, which were published in English. In total, 16 studies were included. Eye-screening examination and heel lance provoked an increase in the salivary cortisol level. Music, prone position, and co-bedding among twins decreased the salivary cortisol level. Several studies reported a low rate of successful saliva sampling or did not use control groups. Future studies need to focus on non-painful interventions in order to learn more about salivary cortisol regulation in preterm infants. Moreover, these studies should use study designs comprising homogenous gestational and postnatal age groups, control groups, and reliable analysis methods that are able to detect cortisol in small amounts of saliva.

AB  - MDMA ("ecstasy") is widely used as a recreational drug, although there has been some debate about its neurotoxic effects in humans. However, most studies have investigated subjects with heavy use patterns, and the effects of transient MDMA use are unclear. In this review, we therefore focus on subjects with moderate use patterns, in order to assess the evidence for harmful effects. We searched for studies applying neuroimaging techniques in man. Studies were included if they provided at least one group with an average of <50 lifetime episodes of ecstasy use or an average lifetime consumption of <100 ecstasy tablets. All studies published before July 2015 were included. Of the 250 studies identified in the database search, 19 were included.
   There is no convincing evidence that moderate MDMA use is associated with structural or functional brain alterations in neuroimaging measures. The lack of significant results was associated with high methodological heterogeneity in terms of dosages and co-consumption of other drugs, low quality of studies and small sample sizes.

AB  - Background: Delirium and depression are often thought of as mutually exclusive conditions. However, several studies cite depression as a risk factor for delirium whereas others note that patients with delirium often manifest depressive symptoms. Whether these depressive symptoms persist after delirium resolves remains unclear. Objectives: This article reviews published studies that have investigated the relationship between depression and delirium. Methods: Literature searches on PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PsycInfo were conducted using search criteria "delirium" AND "depress*" as keywords or MeSH terms. Results: Of 722 search results, 10 prospective cohort studies were identified for inclusion. These studies were categorized regarding the time of assessment for depressive symptoms. Included studies varied greatly (regarding their index population, their methods of assessment, and their timing of assessments). Of the studies, 3 involved patients undergoing hip fracture repair. They demonstrated more severe depressive symptoms both during delirium and after delirium ended. Conversely, the other studies did not find any statistically significant correlations between the 2 conditions. Conclusions: The literature suggests a correlation between depression and delirium in patients with hip fracture. Whether other specific populations have higher comorbidity is unclear. Unfortunately, studies varied widely in their methods, precluding a meta-analysis. Nonetheless, our review provides a foundation for future research.

AB  - Objective: The goal of this review was to consolidate the evidence concerning the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (onabotulinumtoxinA) in depression.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Scopus through May 5, 2014, for studies evaluating the efficacy of botulinum toxin A in depression. Only randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. A pooled mean difference in primary depression score, and pooled odds ratio for response and remission rate with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran Q test and chi(2) statistic.
   Results: Of the 639 articles that were initially retrieved, 5 studies enrolling 194 subjects (age 49 +/- 9.6 y) were included in the systematic review, and 3 randomized controlled trials enrolling 134 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a significant decrease in mean primary depression scores among patients who received botulinum toxin A compared with placebo (-9.80; 95% CI, -12.90 to -6.69) with modest heterogeneity between the studies (Cochran Q test, chi(2) = 70). Response and remission rates were 8.3 and 4.6 times higher, respectively, among patients receiving botulinum toxin A compared with placebo, with no heterogeneity between the studies. The 2 studies excluded from the meta-analysis also found a significant decrease in primary depression scores in patients after receiving botulinum toxin A. A few subjects had minor side effects, which were similar between the groups receiving botulinum toxin and those receiving placebo.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that botulinum toxin A can produce significant improvement in depressive symptoms and is a safe adjunctive treatment for patients receiving pharmacotherapy for depression. Future trials are needed to evaluate the antidepressant effect per se of botulinum toxin A and to further elucidate the underlying antidepressant mechanism of botulinum toxin A.

AB  - Climate changes are expected to be greatest in the polar and temperate areas, where predictions point to an increase in freeze-thaw events and changes in precipitation, evaporation, and salinity patterns. These events will therefore affect biological activity of the soil compartment that may result in large impacts in ecosystem functioning and dynamics therein. This concern becomes even more important when considering the presence of contaminants due to intense anthropogenic activity, which may lead to synergistic or antagonistic effects and increase or decrease the impact on natural ecosystems. This paper reviews the effect of physical and chemical stressors on enchytraeids, with special emphasis on Enchytraeus albidus because most relevant studies have involved this species. E. albidus is a freeze-tolerant and euryhaline organism and several studies suggest that the absence of salinity may have important (negative) consequences not only for their freeze tolerance ability but also for their reproduction and capacity to deal with the presence of contaminants, such as metals and fungicides. Single and joint effects of constant freezing or freeze-thaw cycles and surfactants, such as 4-nonylphenol, affected negatively E. albidus freeze tolerance by decreasing the levels of cryoprotectants, membrane fluidity and interfering with cellular energy allocation. Because enchytraeids are of ecological significance in many important habitats along the Artic and cold-temperate environments, a reduction in abundance may result in disturbances of the decomposition processes in soils. The knowledge of the biological, physiological, and biochemical limits of enchytraeids to combined effect of physical and chemical stressors are crucial to provide a scientific basis for improving the setting of safety factors when extrapolating from controlled (and optimal) laboratory conditions to natural soil ecosystems. Therefore, there is a need to expand and evolve experiments that more realistically mimic the situation in the field, where interactions between factors are highly relevant. The synergistic or antagonistic interactions identified in the present review may also represent a stepping stone in the evaluation and possible inclusion of natural factors, like cold and salinity, in standardized enchytraeid test guidelines and consequently in risk assessment of chemicals.

AB  - Background
   Light therapy is a known treatment for patients with seasonal affective disorder. However, the efficacy of light therapy in treating patients with non-seasonal depression remains inconclusive.
   Aims
   To provide the current state of evidence for efficacy of light therapy in non-seasonal depressive disorders.
   Method
   Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and CENTRAL from their inception to September 2015. Study selection, data abstraction and risk of bias assessment were independently conducted in duplicate. Meta-analyses were performed to provide a summary statistic for the included RCTs. The reporting of this systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines.
   Results
   A meta-analysis including 881 participants from 20 RCTs demonstrated a beneficial effect of light therapy in non-seasonal depression (standardised mean difference in depression score -0.41 (95% CI -0.64 to -0.18)). This estimate was associated with significant heterogeneity (I-2= 60%, P= 0.0003) that was not sufficiently explained by subgroup analyses. There was also high risk of bias in the included trials limiting the study interpretation.
   Conclusions
   The overall quality of evidence is poor due to high risk of bias and inconsistency. However, considering that light therapy has minimal side-effects and our meta-analysis demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients achieved a clinically significant response, light therapy may be effective for patients with non-seasonal depression and can be a helpful additional therapeutic intervention for depression.

AB  - Many aspects of long-term pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders (AnxDs) are still debated. We undertook an updated systematic review of long-term pharmacological studies on panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Relevant studies dating from January 1, 2012 to August 31, 2015 were identified using the PubMed database and a review of bibliographies. Of 372 records identified in the search, five studies on PD and 15 on GAD were included in the review. No studies on SAD were found. Our review confirms the usefulness of long-term pharmacological treatments for PD and GAD and suggests that they can provide further improvement over that obtained during short-term therapy. Paroxetine, escitalopram, and clonazepam can be effective for long-term treatment of PD. However, further studies are needed to draw conclusions about the long-term benzodiazepine use in PD, particularly for the possible cognitive side-effects over time. Pregabalin and quetiapine can be effective for long-term treatment of GAD, while preliminary suggestions emerged for agomelatine and vortioxetine. We did not find any evidence for determining the optimal length and/or dosage of medications to minimize the relapse risk. Few investigations have attempted to identify potential predictors of long-term treatment response. Personalized treatments for AnxDs can be implemented using predictive tools to explore those factors affecting treatment response/tolerability heterogeneity, including neurobiological functions/clinical profiles, comorbidity, biomarkers, and genetic features, and to tailor medications according to each patient's unique features.

AB  - Objective: Suicide is a significant public health issue, and is especially concerning in adolescents and young adults, who are over-represented both in attempts and completed suicide. Emerging technologies represent a promising new approach to deliver suicide prevention interventions to these populations. The current systematic review aims to identify online and mobile psychosocial suicide prevention interventions for young people, and evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. Method: PsycINFO, Medline, Embase and The Cochrane Library were electronically searched for all articles published between January, 2000 and May, 2015. Peer-reviewed journal articles reporting on interventions for young people aged 12-25 years with suicidality as a primary outcome were eligible for inclusion. No exclusions were placed on study design. Results: One study met inclusion criteria, and found significant reductions in the primary outcome of suicidal ideation, as well as depression and hopelessness. Two relevant protocol papers of studies currently underway were also identified. Conclusions: There is a paucity of current evidence for online and mobile interventions for suicide prevention in youth. More high quality empirical evidence is required to determine the effectiveness of these novel approaches to improving suicide outcomes in young people.

Methods A systematic search was conducted to identify studies with factors related to anticipatory distress to painful medical procedures in children aged 0-18 years. The search retrieved 7,088 articles to review against inclusion criteria. A total of 77 studies were included in the review. Results 31 factors were found to predict anticipatory distress to painful medical procedures in children. A narrative synthesis of the evidence was conducted, and a summary figure is presented. Conclusions Many factors were elucidated that contribute to the occurrence of anticipatory distress to painful medical procedures. The factors that appear to increase anticipatory distress are child psychopathology, difficult child temperament, parent distress promoting behaviors, parent situational distress, previous pain events, parent anticipation of distress, and parent anxious predisposition. Longitudinal and experimental research is needed to further elucidate these factors.

AB  - RAGE, the receptor of advanced glycation end-products, is thought to be one of the potential contributors to the neurodegeneration. It has been shown that RAGE activation triggers an increase in proinflammatory molecules, oxidative stressors and cytokines. RAGE involvement has been documented in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative diseases such amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Creutzfeld-Jakob' diseases and various neurodegenerative conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, Charcot neuroarthropathy and vasculitic neuropathy. Although the detailed mechanisms of RAGE contribution to the neurodegeneration remains unclear, studies indicate that RAGE detrimental actions are exerted via its binding to the pro-inflammatory ligands such as advanced glycation end-products, S100/calgranulin and amphoterin and subsequent activation of downstream regulatory pathways such as NF-kappa B, STAT and JKN pathways. Here, in this review we attempt to shed light onto molecular events and pathological pathways involved in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and its emerging role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder, summarizing current knowledge and the prospect of RAGE in the pathogenesis of this disastrous disease.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly heterogeneous developmental conditions characterized by deficits in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and obsessive/stereotyped patterns of behavior and repetitive movements. Social interaction impairments are the most characteristic deficits in ASD. There is also evidence of impoverished language and empathy, a profound inability to use standard nonverbal behaviors (eye contact, affective expression) to regulate social interactions with others, difficulties in showing empathy, failure to share enjoyment, interests and achievements with others, and a lack of social and emotional reciprocity. In developed countries, it is now reported that 1%-1.5% of children have ASD, and in the US 2015 CDC reports that approximately one in 45 children suffer from ASD. Despite the intense research focus on ASD in the last decade, the underlying etiology remains unknown. Genetic research involving twins and family studies strongly supports a significant contribution of environmental factors in addition to genetic factors in ASD etiology. A comprehensive literature search has implicated several environmental factors associated with the development of ASD. These include pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls, solvents, air pollutants, fragrances, glyphosate and heavy metals, especially aluminum used in vaccines as adjuvant. Importantly, the majority of these toxicants are some of the most common ingredients in cosmetics and herbicides to which almost all of us are regularly exposed to in the form of fragrances, face makeup, cologne, air fresheners, food flavors, detergents, insecticides and herbicides. In this review we describe various scientific data to show the role of environmental factors in ASD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: Suicide prevention is a health service priority. Some surveys have assessed suicidal behaviors and potential risk factors.
   Objectives: The current paper aimed to gather information about etiology of suicide attempts in Iran.
   Data Sources: Pubmed, ISI web of science, PsychInfo, IranPsych, IranMedex, IranDoc as well as gray literature were searched.
   Study Selection: By electronic and gray literature search, 128 articles were enrolled in this paper. Pubmed, ISI web of science, PsychInfo, IranPsych, IranMedex, IranDoc were searched for electronic search. After reading the abstracts, 84 studies were excluded and full texts of 44 articles were reviewed critically.
   Data Extraction: Pubmed, ISI web of science, PsychInfo, IranPsych, IranMedex, IranDoc as well as gray literature were searched to find any study about etiologic factors of suicide attempt in Iran.
   Results: Depressive disorder was the most common diagnosis in suicide attempters that is 45% of the evaluated cases had depression. One study that had used Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (MMPI) found that Histrionics in females and Schizophrenia and Paranoia in males were significantly influential. Family conflicts with 50.7% and conflict with parents with 44% were two effective psychosocial factors in suicidal attempts. In around one fourth (28.7%) of the cases, conflict with spouse was the main etiologic factor.
   Conclusions: According to the methodological limitations, outcomes should be generalized cautiously. Further studies will help to plan preventive strategies for suicidal attempts; therefore, continued researches should be conducted to fill the data gaps.

AB  - Background: Hypersomnia is a common complaint in medical offices. Often patients are given psychiatric diagnoses, but a primary sleep disorder may be present. The new diagnosis of "hypersomnolence disorder" (HD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition is a primary sleep disorder most similar to the diagnosis "idiopathic hypersomnia" (IH) in sleep literature and can be missed in psychiatric settings. Methods: A systematic review of the computerized databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Psychinfo using the search criteria "idiopathic AND (hypersomnolence OR hypersomnia)," as well as "hypersomnolence disorder was conducted." Articles were included if they were in English and included information regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathophysiology, or treatment of IH or HD. Where relevant, weighted means and 95% CI were calculated based on the number of subjects in each study. Results: A total of 143 articles discussed IH, whereas no articles were found regarding HD. Most articles were review articles, prospective studies, or studies of pathophysiology. IH is found in approximately 0.02%-0.010% of the general population, has a mean age of onset of 21.8 years, and is associated with several somatic symptoms. Alterations in histaminergic or dopaminergic signaling may be involved in IH. Treatment with modafinil or other stimulants appears moderately effective. IH can be differentiated from psychiatric hypersomnolence by formal polysomnography. Conclusions: IH and HD are relatively uncommon disorders and little is known about them. However, they are distinct from psychiatric disorders and respond well to treatment once properly identified.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study is to review articles published between June 2014 and 2015 that report research on neurodevelopmental disorders in both children and adults living in Taiwan. The most common of the major neurodevelopmental disorders that cause neuropsychiatric or various behavior problems in children are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger syndrome, and cerebral palsy.Recent findingsThe review examines articles written by authors from Taiwan and published in professional journals from June 2014 to 2015. About 146 articles were accessed, but only the 23 articles that address general trends in the prevalence of, and the prescription of drugs and treatment for, neurocognitive disorders are included in this review. Nearly 95% of these studies used data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Most of the remaining 5% obtained their data from field work, laboratory experiments, or examination of human tissue.SummaryThe reviewed publications indicate increases in the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and other types of neurodevelopmental disorders in children living in Taiwan, from less than 1.3% in the early 1990s to nearly 3% today. The findings also indicate that drugs are very frequently prescribed to stabilize emotional and behavior problems in school age children up to age 13 and in adults with intellectual disabilities. Early onset and indicators of dementia have been two major areas of research with adults with intellectual disabilities, but so far results have been inconclusive.

AB  - Previous studies suggested a possible association between serum uric acid levels and peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes, but no definite evidence was available. A systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies were performed to comprehensively estimate the association. Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and China Biology Medicine (CBM) databases were searched for eligible studies. Study-specific data were combined using random-effect or fixed-effect models of meta-analysis according to between-study heterogeneity. Twelve studies were finally included into the meta-analysis, which involved a total of 1388 type 2 diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy and 4746 patients without peripheral neuropathy. Meta-analysis showed that there were obvious increased serum uric acid levels in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 50.03 mu mol/L, 95 % confidence interval [95%CI] 22.14-77.93, P = 0.0004). Hyperuricemia was also significantly associated with increased risk of peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes (risk ratio [RR] = 2.83, 95%CI 2.13-3.76, P < 0.00001). Meta-analysis of two studies with adjusted risk estimates showed that hyperuricemia was independently associated with increased risk of peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetic patients (RR = 1.95, 95%CI 1.23-3.11, P = 0.005). Type 2 diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy have obvious increased serum uric acid levels, and hyperuricemia is associated with increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Further prospective cohort studies are needed to validate the impact of serum uric acid levels on peripheral neuropathy risk.

AB  - Cognitive ecologist posits that the more efficiently an animal uses information from the biotic and abiotic environment, the more adaptive are its cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, this approach does not test for natural neurodegenerative processes under field or experimental conditions, which may recover animals information processing and decision making and may explain, mechanistically, maladaptive behaviors. Here, we call for integrative approaches to explain the relationship between ultimate and proximate mechanisms behind social behavior. We highlight the importance of using the endemic caviomorph rodent Octodon degus as a valuable natural model for mechanistic studies of social behavior and to explain how physical environments can shape social experiences that might influence impaired cognitive abilities and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease. We consequently suggest neuroecological approaches to examine how key elements of the environment may affect neural and cognitive mechanisms associated with learning, memory processes and brain structures involved in social behavior. We propose the following three core objectives of a program comprising interdisciplinary research in O. degus, namely: (1) to determine whether diet types provided after weaning can lead to cognitive impairment associated with spatial memory, learning and predisposing to develop Alzheimer disease in younger ages; (2) to examine if early life social experience has long term effects on behavior and cognitive responses and risk for development Alzheimer disease in later life and (3) To determine if an increase of social interactions in adult degu reared in different degree of social stressful conditions alter their behavior and cognitive responses.

AB  - Background: Alcohol is a leading cause of global suffering. Europe reports the uppermost volume of alcohol consumption in the world, with Ireland and the United Kingdom reporting the highest levels of binge drinking and drunkenness. Levels of consumption are elevated among university students. Thus, this literature review aims to summarise the current research on alcohol consumption among university students in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
   Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsychInfo were systematically searched for literature from January 2002 until December 2014. Each database was searched using the following search pillars: alcohol, university student, Ireland or the United Kingdom and prevalence studies.
   Results: Two thousand one hundred twenty eight articles were retrieved from electronic database searching. These were title searched for relevance. 113 full texts were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. Of these, 29 articles were deemed to meet inclusion criteria for the review. Almost two thirds of students reported a hazardous alcohol consumption score on the AUDIT scale. Over 20 % reported alcohol problems over their lifetime using CAGE while over 20 % exceed sensible limits each week. Noteworthy is the narrowing of the gender gap throughout the past decade.
   Conclusion: This is the first review to investigate consumption patterns of university students in Ireland and the United Kingdom. A range of sampling strategies and screening tools are employed in alcohol research which preclude comparability. The current review provides an overview of consumption patterns to guide policy development.

AB  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) enables the non-invasive measurement of spatiotemporal characteristics of brain function, which has received increasing attention during the last years. This new birth of interest is attributable to unique characteristics of the NIRS technique, which may be summarised in certain technical advantages: its experimental and ecological validity and the extension of application to clinical samples. This paper presents the main applications of the NIRS technique that measures changes in brain activation to study emotions and social neuroscience field. In the first part of this paper, we discuss the basic principles, strengths, and limitations of NIRS for the study of principal emotional functions. In the second part, we focus on the actual applications of NIRS in emotional and social research. In this regard, first, we consider some main topics of emotional contexts, such as visual (facial expression) and auditory cues recognition, and social neuroscience field. Second, we discuss the utility to apply NIRS simultaneously to other techniques (electroencephalography, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to improve the intrinsic power of such measures. Third, we consider the possible applications of NIRS devices to study specific emotion-related functions (such as connectivity and plasticity applications).

AB  - Team reflexivity posits that the extent to which teams reflect upon and adapt their functioning is positively related to team performance. While remarkable progress has been made to provide evidence of this relationship, the underlying framework is missing elements of current theoretical streams for analyzing and describing teamwork, leaving the diversity of effects of team reflexivity often untouched. In this article, we present an update for this framework, by reviewing previous research on reflexivity, addressing gaps in the literature, and revising the original model by integrating feedback and dynamic team effectiveness frameworks for describing temporal developments of reflexivity. We furthermore propose a new dimensional structure for reflexivity, relying on prior work conceptualizing teams as information-processing systems that learn and advance through social-cognitive elements. Our model is therefore not only suitable for explaining the diverse set of relationships between team reflexivity on outcomes, but also provides valuable directions for viewing reflexivity as process that takes place during both transition and action phases of teamwork. We conclude with implications for managers, identify limitations, and propose an agenda for further research into this area. This article contributes an extended perspective relevant for further theory development and for effectively managing reflexivity in teams.

AB  - Introduction: Health inequalities are recognised as a public health issue worldwide, but only a few countries have developed national strategies to monitor and reduce them. Despite its considerable health inequalities, Portugal seems to lack a systematic strategy to tackle them, possibly due to the absence of organised evidence on the issue. We performed a systematic review that aimed to describe the available evidence on social inequalities in health in Portugal, in order to contribute towards a comprehensive and focused strategy to tackle them.
   Methods: We followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed for studies that looked at the association between a measure of socioeconomic status and a health outcome in the Portuguese resident population since the year 2000. We excluded health behaviours and healthcare use from our search. We performed a qualitative description of the results.
   Results: Seventy-one publications were selected, all reporting observational analyses, most of them using cross-sectional data. These publications showed strong evidence for health inequalities related to education and gender, chiefly for obesity, self-rated health and mental health.
   Conclusions: Analysis of the eligible publications showed that current research does not seem to have consistently covered the link between health and key Portuguese social problems. A strategy focusing on the monitoring of most prevalent diseases, most determining socioeconomic factors and vulnerable populations would be crucial to guide academic research in a country in which health inequalities are so ubiquitous and deeply rooted.

KW  - SEVERITY
KW  - BENEFITS

AB  - Background
   It has been suggested that the efficacy of antidepressants has been overestimated in clinical trials owing to unblinding of drug treatments by adverse events.
   Aims
   To investigate the association between adverse events and the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).
   Method
   The literature was searched to identify randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of SSRIs in the treatment of major depression. Efficacy outcomes were response to treatment and change in depressive symptoms. Reporting of adverse events was used as an indicator of tolerability. Random effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled estimates. Meta-regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between adverse events and efficacy. Potential mediation was investigated with the Baron & Kenny approach.
   Results
   A total of 68 trials (n=17646) were included in the analyses. In meta-analysis SSRIs were superior to placebo in terms of efficacy (odds ratio, OR=1.62, 95% CI 1.51-1.72). More patients allocated to SSRIs reported adverse events than did patients receiving placebo (OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.58-1.89). Meta-regression analyses did not find an association between adverse events and efficacy (P=0.439). There was no indication of adverse events mediating the effect of SSRI treatment.
   Conclusions
   Our results do not support, but also do not unequivocally disprove, the hypothesis that adverse events lead to an overestimation of the effect of SSRIs over placebo.

AB  - Background: The physical health of people with schizophrenia is poor, and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Unhealthy lifestyles and side-effects of antipsychotic medication contribute to cardiometabolic dysfunction. Yet it is unclear when this unhealthy profile starts. We aimed to see if people at ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR) have increased rates of cardliometabolic risk factors.
   Method: An electronic search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted on 1st May 2015 using terms associated with the ultra-high risk state and health. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed English language research articles with populations that met at-risk diagnostic criteria and reported cardiometabolic risk factors. A meta-analysis was conducted on smoking data, the cardiometabolic risk factor that yielded the most studies.
   Results: forty-seven eligible studies were identified. UHR samples had low levels of physical activity, and high rates of smoking and alcohol abuse compared with controls. No differences were found for body mass index. An overall pooled rate of smoking for UHR participants was 33% (95% Cl = 0.24-0.42) and significantly more UHR individuals smoked compared with controls with a pooled odds ratio of 2.3 (P < 0.05; 95% CI = 1.48-3.48).
   Conclusions: UHR samples display cardiometabolic risk factors which are largely modifiable. The UHR phase is an important opportunity for early intervention services to improve physical health.

AB  - Vitamin D (vitD) is known for its essential role in calcium homeostasis and bone health. VitD is made endogenously in the skin from UVB radiation from sunlight. VitD is now considered as a potent neurosteroid hormone, critical to brain development and normal brain function, and is known for its anti-inflammatory property affecting various aspects of human health. VitD ligand-receptor, a receptor that mediates much of vitD's biological actions, has been found throughout the body including the central nervous system. VitD deficiency is common in patients with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a debilitating chronic mental illness characterised by positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, and negative symptoms including flat affect and lack of motivation. Several environmental risk factors for schizophrenia, such as season of birth, latitude and migration, have been linked to vitD deficiency. Recent studies have suggested a potential role of vitD in the development of schizophrenia. For example, neonatal vitD status is associated with the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular disease, which are commonly seen in patients with schizophrenia. It has been well established that vitD deficiency is related to these metabolic problems. The biological mechanism is most likely related to vitD's action on the regulation of inflammatory and immunological processes, consequently affecting the manifestation of clinical symptoms and treatment response of schizophrenia. Potential benefits of vitD supplementation to improve schizophrenia symptoms as well as physical health in patients with schizophrenia should be further explored in future studies.

AB  - Objective: A number of randomized controlled trials in major depressive disorder have employed a sequential model, which consists of the use of pharmacotherapy in the acute phase and of psychotherapy in its residual phase. The aim of this review was to provide an updated meta-analysis of the efficacy of this approach in reducing the risk of relapse in major depressive disorder and to place these findings in the larger context of treatment selection.
   Method: Keyword searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library from inception of each database through October 2014. Randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of the administration of psychotherapy after successful response to acute-phase pharmacotherapy in the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder were considered for inclusion in the meta-analysis.
   Results: Thirteen high-quality studies with 728 patients in a sequential treatment arm and 682 in a control treatment arm were included. All studies involved cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The pooled risk ratio for relapse/recurrence was 0.781 (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.671-0.909; number needed to treat58), according to the random-effects model, suggesting a relative advantage in preventing relapse/recurrence compared with control conditions. A significant effect of CBT during continuation of antidepressant drugs compared with antidepressants alone or treatment as usual (risk ratio: 0.811; 95% CI 50.685-0.961; number needed to treat=10) was found. Patients randomly assigned to CBT who had antidepressants tapered and discontinued were significantly less likely to experience relapse/recurrence compared with those assigned to either clinical management or continuation of antidepressant medication (risk ratio: 0.674; 95% CI=0.482-0.943; number needed to treat=5).
   Conclusions: The sequential integration of CBT and pharmacotherapy is a viable strategy for preventing relapse in major depressive disorder. The current indications for the application of psychotherapy in major depressive disorder are discussed, with special reference to its integration with pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Objective: Previous studies suggested that the treatment response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in major depressive disorder follows a flat response curve within the therapeutic dose range. The present study was designed to clarify the relationship between dosage and treatment response in major depressive disorder.
   Method: The authors searched PubMed for randomized placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of SSRIs for treating adults with major depressive disorder. Trials were also required to assess improvement in depression severity at multiple time points. Additional data were collected on treatment response and all-cause and side effect-related discontinuation. All medication doses were transformed into imipramine-equivalent doses. The longitudinal data were analyzed with a mixed-regression model. Endpoint and tolerability analyses were analyzed using meta-regression and stratified subgroup analysis by predefined SSRI dose categories in order to assess the effect of SSRI dosing on the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs for major depressive disorder.
   Results: Forty studies involving 10,039 participants were included. Longitudinal modeling (dose-by-time interaction=0.0007,95% CI=0.0001-0.0013) and endpoint analysis (meta-regression: b=0.00053, 95% CI=0.00018-0.00088, z=2.98) demonstrated a small but statistically significant positive association between SSRI dose and efficacy. Higher doses of SSRIs were associated with an increased likelihood of dropouts due to side effects (meta-regression: b=0.00207, 95% CI=0.00071-0.00342, z=2.98) and decreased likelihood of all-cause dropout (meta-regression: b=-0.00093, 95% CI=-0.00165 to 20.00021, z=22.54).
   Conclusions: Higher doses of SSRIs appear slightly more effective in major depressive disorder. This benefit appears to plateau at around 250 mg of imipramine equivalents (50 mg of fluoxetine). The slightly increased benefits of SSRIs at higher doses are somewhat offset by decreased tolerability at high doses.

AB  - AimsPsychotic-like experiences (PLEs) or subclinical psychotic experiences have received increased attention as some studies have suggested continuity between PLEs and psychotic disorders. However, epidemiological and correlational studies of PLEs showed mixed findings - it is observed that different studies use a wide variety of definitions of PLEs, as well as different assessment tools that are designed to capture such described experiences. The differences in definitions and assessment tools adopted could contribute to the discrepancy of findings. The current review aims to examine the definitions and assessment tools adopted in the studies of PLEs.
   MethodsLiterature search was conducted between October 2013 and February 2014 using three search engines: Medline, Web of Science and PubMed.
   ResultsA total of 76 papers met the selection criteria and were included in the current review. It is found that the majority of papers reviewed defined PLEs quantitatively using assessment tools and do not have a specific phenomenological definition, whereas assessment tools adopted have a wide variety. Furthermore, phenomenological studies of PLEs were rare.
   ConclusionsThe variations in definitions and assessment tools of PLEs might contribute to mixed findings in researches. Reaching to a consensus through the study of phenomenology of PLEs is essential to further advancement of the research in this area.

AB  - Pesticide mixtures are common in the streams of agricultural or urban catchments. Individual and cartel toxicity of four different pesticides, namely Endosulfan, Carbofuran, Methyl parathion and Cypermethrin were studied. Sub acute exposure (1/10th of LC50) for 1, 7, 15, 30 and 60 days in Clarias batrachus active tissues such as brain, gills, blood and liver were evaluated. Growth, hepatosomatic index and survival performance were decreased, inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase, gills Na+/K+ ATPase activities, and abnormal behavior are noticed. The characteristics of the blood respiratory burst activity, erythrocyte count, contents of hematocrit and hemoglobin are dwindled. Plasma total proteins and liver glycogen decreased whereas blood glucose and serum creatinine, triglycerides are elevated. The immunological attributes such as white blood cell count was elevated, whereas albumin, globulins and lysozyme activity significantly decreased. Hepatic superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities and lipid peroxidation levels are elevated, whereas glutathione peroxidase and glutathione are reduced. Toxicity effect of pesticides reached to a crest on 30th day and showed a descent thereafter except in endosulfan which mounted its detrimental effect throughout the experimental period. Toxicity trends of the present study are determined to be highest in Mix group followed by cypermethrin, methyl parathion and carbofuran. Indiscriminate application of these chemicals pose a toxic threat to non-target organisms, damage the ecosystems and jeopardizes human health. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reviews the main studies dealing with epiphytes of both leaves and rhizomes of Posidonia oceanica, the main seagrass found in the Mediterranean Sea. A total of 660 epiphyte species has been recorded, including 430 on leaves and 437 on rhizomes. Of these, 205 are Rhodophyta, 59 Ochrophyta, 43 Chlorophyta, 78 Porifera, 82 Cnidaria, 19 Annelida, 155 Bryozoa and 19 Tunicata. The epiphyte assemblages demonstrate a gradient of dissimilarity from west to east, with the eastern area being the most unlike the others. The differences can be attributed mostly to rare species that differ amongst the Mediterranean regions. Many of the dominant taxa have been found in all meadows studied. Data concerning species composition, abundance, and patterns of spatial and temporal variability are summarized, and biotic and abiotic factors controlling the structure of assemblages are discussed. Responses of epiphyte assemblages to anthropogenic stressors, such as nutrient enrichment and biological invasions, are discussed in relation to the use of epiphytes as ecological indicators.

AB  - Personality disorders are common, and the core problems of interpersonal dysfunction and social disturbance are difficult to treat. One area gaining international attention is the impact that diet and nutrients can have on psychiatric/psychological symptoms. There are no empirical studies studying the specific relationship between nutrition and personality disorders. A systematic search revealed longitudinal studies following malnourished children, either during pregnancy or in early life that reported malnourishment is a risk factor that can express as maladaptive behaviours later in life. Other studies show associations between nutrient intake and personality styles. A small body of literature reveals a potential benefit of consuming nutrients therapeutically in order to address behaviours often associated with personality disorders. If we consider the broad patterns of behaviour that typify personality disorders, such as cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning and impulse control, there is a research rationale for studying the role that nutrition could play in protecting against the development of these problems as well as possibly modifying them. Whether it is too late to intervene with nutrition once the pathological behaviours are entrenched is unknown. Given the dearth of good evidence-based treatments currently available for people with personality disorders, it is an area worth investing in. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In the occupational environment, there are a considerable number of stressors that can affect physical performance in job tasks. Whole-body vibration (WBV), which arises from vehicle transit, is one such stressor that has been demonstrated to alter human function in several ways. This study identifies the known physical changes to human function which result from WBV, to comment on changes which may translate to performance in physically demanding occupational tasks.
   A systematic review is performed on the literature relating to changes in the neuromuscular, physiological and biomechanical properties of the human body, when exposed to WBV. Selection criteria are constructed to synthesise articles which strictly relate to in-vehicle WBV and physical responses.
   In total, 29 articles were identified which satisfied the criteria for inclusion. A range of physical responses produced from WBV are presented; however, little consistency exists in study design and the responses reported.
   Given the inconsistency in the reported responses, the precise changes to human function remain unknown. However, there is sufficient evidence to warrant the design of studies which investigate occupationally relevant physical performance changes following WBV.

AB  - Background
   Recent studies with intravenous (i.v.) application of ketamine show remarkable but short-term success in patients with MDD. Studies in patients with chronic pain have used different ketamine applications for longer time periods. This experience may be relevant for psychiatric indications.
   Aims
   To review the literature about the dosing regimen, duration, effects and side-effects of oral, intravenous, intranasal and subcutaneous routes of administration of ketamine for treatment-resistant depression and pain.
   Method
   Searches in PubMed with the terms 'oral ketamine', 'depression', 'chronic pain', 'neuropathic pain', 'intravenous ketamine', 'intranasal ketamine' and 'subcutaneous ketamine' yielded 88 articles. We reviewed all papers for information about dosing regimen, number of individuals who received ketamine, number of ketamine days per study, results and side-effects, as well as study quality.
   Results
   Overall, the methodological strength of studies investigating the antidepressant effects of ketamine was considered low, regardless of the route of administration. The doses for depression were in the lower range compared with studies that investigated analgesic use. Studies on pain suggested that oral ketamine may be acceptable for treatment-resistant depression in terms of tolerability and side-effects.
   Conclusions
   Oral ketamine, given for longer time periods in the described doses, appears to be well tolerated, but few studies have systematically examined the longer-term negative consequences. The short- and longer-term depression outcomes as well as side-effects need to be studied with rigorous randomised controlled trials.

AB  - Background and aims: Support of personal recovery represents the aim for many modern mental health services. There is a lack of conceptual clarity around the application of the term however and this is particularly problematic with regard to the personality disorder diagnoses. This study sought to review the existing qualitative methods literature in relation to the experience of personal recovery in personality disorder.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted. Identified studies were incorporated through meta-synthesis in order to develop higher order descriptive themes representative of the individual experience described within included studies.
   Results: Three studies were identified and incorporated into the meta-synthesis. Three novel higher order themes were developed: Safety and containment as a prerequisite to recovery, social networks and autonomy in the recovery process and identity construction as a process of change.
   Conclusion: Personal recovery in personality disorder is revealed as a complex process reflecting both personal and social experiences or desires. These findings have important implications for clinical practice - emphasising the need to work closely with individuals and to develop an understanding of both their social experience and networks. Further research, taking greater account of social context in the recovery process, is necessary.

AB  - The discovery of over 150 monogenic epilepsies and advances in early genetic diagnoses have launched a search for molecular strategies and developmental timetables to reverse or even prevent the course of these debilitating brain disorders. Orthologous rodent models of key disease genes are providing important examples of the range of targets, and serve as valuable test systems for perinatal therapeutic approaches. While gene specific analyses of single rare 'orphan' diseases are each narrow in scope, they illuminate downstream pathways converging onto interneurons, and treatments that strengthen inhibition during cortical maturation may provide broad protection against these seemingly disparate gene errors. Several genes, even those linked to malformations, show promise for postnatal correction before the onset of their clinical phenotype.

Given the considerable interest aroused by this topic in recent years and the growing number of publications related to it, the present article aims to provide a full and updated review of the field, ranging from the initial studies of the impact of math anxiety on numerical cognition, to the latest research exploring its electrophysiological correlates and brain bases from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Finally, this review describes the factors and mechanisms that have been claimed to play a role in the origins and/or maintenance of math anxiety, and it examines in detail the main explanations proposed to account for the negative effects of math anxiety on performance: competition for working memory resources, a deficit in a low-level numerical representation, and inhibition/attentional control deficit.

AB  - The prevailing view in the field of adolescent brain development is that heightened activity in the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system serves as a liability, orienting adolescents toward risky behaviors, increasing their sensitivity to social evaluation and loss, and resulting in compromised well-being. Several findings inconsistent with this deficit view challenge the perspective that adolescent reward sensitivity largely serves as a liability and highlights the potential adaptive function that heightened striatal reactivity can serve. The goal of this review is to refine our understanding of dopaminergic reward sensitivity in adolescence. I review several studies showing that ventral striatum activation serves an adaptive function for adolescents' health and well being relating to declines in both risk taking and depression and increases in cognitive persistence and achievement.

AB  - We analyzed features associated with a reduction in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). As a new approach, features were embedded in the WHO framework for measuring health and disability, the ICF model. From 609 articles screened, 114 articles were included. Features aligned with the ICF's body functions and structures domain (BFS) were investigated more often than personal features, activities of daily living, environmental factors, and participation in societal roles (95, 42, 35, 29 and 14 times, respectively). The strongest associations were found for the relationships between HRQoL and "psychosocial functioning" from the participation domain and HRQoL, and "mobility limitations" from the activities domain. For the BFS, non-motor symptoms were more closely associated with reduced HRQoL than motor symptoms. In conclusion, this systematic review (i) provides entirely new insights in the association of HRQoL with PD features, (ii) shows an imbalance between most extensively investigated and most relevant features for HRQoL, and (iii) demonstrates the usefulness of the ICF model for such an approach.

AB  - Objective: Women with a history of bipolar disorder, postpartum psychosis, or both are at high risk for postpartum relapse. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the risk of postpartum relapse in these three patient groups.
   Method: A systematic literature search was conducted in all public medical electronic databases, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if they reported postpartum relapse in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and/or a history of postpartum psychosis or mania according to DSM or ICD criteria or the Research Diagnostic Criteria.
   Results: Thirty-seven articles describing 5,700 deliveries in 4,023 patients were included in the quantitative analyses. The overall postpartum relapse risk was 35% (95% CI= 29, 41). Patients with bipolar disorder were significantly less likely to experience severe episodes postpartum (17%, 95% CI= 13, 21) than patients with a history of postpartum psychosis (29%, 95% CI= 20, 41). Insufficient information was available to determine relapse rates for patients with bipolar disorder and a history of postpartum episodes. In women with bipolar disorder, postpartum relapse rates were significantly higher among those who were medication free during pregnancy (66%, 95% CI= 57, 75) than those who used prophylactic medication (23%, 95% CI= 14, 37).
   Conclusions: One-third of women at high risk experience a postpartum relapse. In women with bipolar disorder, continuation of prophylactic medication during pregnancy appears highly protective for maintaining mood stability postpartum. In women with a history of isolated postpartum psychosis, initiation of prophylaxis immediately after delivery offers the opportunity to minimize the risk of relapse while avoiding in utero medication exposure.

AB  - Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) include individuals with a wide range of sexual orientations, physical characteristics, and gender identities and expressions. Data suggest that people in this group face a significant and poorly understood set of additional health risks and bear a higher burden of some diseases compared to the general population. A large amount of data is available on HIV/AIDS, but far less on other health problems. In this review we aimed to synthesize the knowledge on the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, mental health conditions and violence experienced by SGM, based on available systematic reviews. We conducted a global review of systematic reviews, including searching the Cochrane and the Campbell Collaboration libraries, as well as PubMed, using a range of search terms describing the populations of interest, without time or language restrictions. Google Scholar was also scanned for unpublished literature, and references of all selected reviews were checked to identify further relevant articles. We found 30 systematic reviews, all originally written in English. Nine reviews provided data on HIV, 12 on other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 4 on cancer, 4 on violence and 3 on mental health and substance use. A quantitative meta-analysis was not possible. The findings are presented in a narrative format. Our review primarily showed that there is a high burden of disease for certain subpopulations of SGM in HIV, STIs, STI-related cancers and mental health conditions, and that they also face high rates of violence. Secondly, our review revealed many knowledge gaps. Those gaps partly stem from a lack of original research, but there is an equally urgent need to conduct systematic and literature reviews to assess what we already know on the disease burden in SGM. Additional reviews are needed on the non-biological factors that could contribute to the higher disease burden. In addition, to provide universal access to health-care for all, more information is needed on the barriers that SGM face in accessing health services, including the attitudes of health-care providers. Understanding these barriers and the additional health risks they impose is crucial to improving the health status of SGM.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Animal models have contributed a large part to our understanding and therapeutics developed for treatment of PD. There are several more exhaustive reviews of literature that provide the initiated insights into the specific models; however a novel synthesis of the basic advantages and disadvantages of different models is much needed. Here we compare both neurotoxin based and genetic models while suggesting some novel avenues in PD modeling. We also highlight the problems faced and promises of all the mammalian models with the hope of providing a framework for comparison of various systems.

AB  - Shipping industry and seaborne trade have rapidly increased over the last fifty years, mainly due to the continuous increasing demand for chemicals and fuels. Consequently, despite current regulations, the occurrence of accidental spills poses an important risk. Hazardous and noxious substances (HNSs) have been raising major concern among environmental managers and scientific community for their heterogeneity, hazardous potential towards aquatic organisms and associated social-economic impacts. A literature review on ecotoxicological hazards to aquatic organisms was conducted for seven HNSs: acrylonitrile, n-butyl acrylate, cyclohexylbenzene, hexane, isononanol, trichloroethylene and xylene. Information on the mechanisms of action of the selected HNS was also reviewed. The main purpose was to identify: i) knowledge gaps in need of being addressed in future research; and ii) a set of possible biomarkers suitable for ecotoxicological assessment and monitoring in both estuarine and marine systems.
   Main gaps found concern the scarcity of information available on ecotoxicological effects of HNS towards marine species and their poorly understood mode of action in wildlife. Differences were found between the sensitivity of freshwater and seawater organisms, so endpoints produced in the former may not be straightforwardly employed in evaluations for the marine environment. The relationship between sub-individual effects and higher level detrimental alterations (e.g. behavioural, morphological, reproductive effects and mortality) are not fully understood. In this context, a set of biomarkers associated to neurotoxicity, detoxification and anti-oxidant defences is suggested as potential indicators of toxic exposure/effects of HNS in marine organisms.
   Overall, to support the development of contingency plans and the establishment of environmental safety thresholds, it will be necessary to undertake targeted research on HNS ecotoxicity in the marine environment. Research should address these issues under more realistic exposure scenarios reflecting the prevailing spatial and temporal variability in ecological and environmental conditions.

AB  - Fatigue is a severe problem for many people living with Parkinson's disease (PD). Best estimates suggest that more than 50% of patients experience this debilitating symptom. Little is known about its etiology or treatment, making the understanding of fatigue a true unmet need. As part of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation Community Choice Research Program, patients, caregivers, and scientists attended a symposium on fatigue on 16 and 17 October 2014. We present a summary of that meeting, reviewing what is known about the diagnosis and treatment of fatigue, its physiology, and what we might learn from multiple sclerosis (MS), depression, and cancer-disorders in which fatigue figures prominently too. We conclude with focused recommendations to enhance our understanding and treatment of this prominent problem in PD.

AB  - eHealth interventions are recognized to have a tremendous potential to promote patient engagement. To date, the majority of studies examine the efficacy of eHealth in enhancing clinical outcomes without focusing on patient engagement in its specificity. This paper aimed at reviewing findings from the literature about the use of eHealth in engaging patients in their own care process. We undertook a comprehensive literature search within the peer-reviewed international literature. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. eHealth interventions reviewed were mainly devoted to foster only partial dimensions of patient engagement (i.e., alternatively cognitive, emotional or behavioral domains related to healthcare management), thus failing to consider the complexity of such an experience. This also led to a great heterogeneity of technologies, assessed variables and achieved outcomes. This systematic review underlines the need for a more holistic view of patient needs to actually engage them in eHealth interventions and obtaining positive outcomes. In this sense, patient engagement constitute a new frontiers for healthcare models where eHealth could maximize its potentialities.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates a variety of biological processes predominantly via binding to the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB. It is a potential therapeutic target in numerous neurological, mental and metabolic disorders. However, the lack of efficient means to deliver BDNF into the body imposes an insurmountable hurdle to its clinical application. To address this challenge, we initiated a cell-based drug screening to search for small molecules that act as the TrkB agonist. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is our first reported small molecular TrkB agonist, which has now been extensively validated in various biochemical and cellular systems. Though binding to the extracellular domain of TrkB, 7,8-DHF triggers TrkB dimerization to induce the downstream signaling. Notably, 7,8-DHF is orally bioactive that can penetrate the brain blood barrier (BBB) to exert its neurotrophic activities in the central nervous system. Numerous reports suggest 7,8-DHF processes promising therapeutic efficacy in various animal disease models that are related to deficient BDNF signaling. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge on the binding activity and specificity, structure-activity relationship, pharmacokinetic and metabolism, and the pre-clinical efficacy of 7,8-DHF against some human diseases.

AB  - Adolescents presenting with gender-related concerns are increasingly seeking support from providers from a variety of disciplines within health care settings across the world. For those treating young people who meet the criteria for the DSM 5 diagnosis of gender dysphoria (GD), complex decisions in clinical care are common. Defining best practice with this population with respect to interventions that span mental health, physical, and surgical domains can be challenging, given a relative dearth of empirical data available; yet practice guidelines have emerged from different professional organizations which can aid with this. For this review paper, a broad literature search was performed to identify relevant studies pertaining to the care of adolescents with GD. In addition, an overview of trends in clinical practice, including shifts in conceptualization of how clinicians and patients define care that is considered affirming when working with this population, is described. This paper explores the characteristics of referral patterns to specialized clinics, provides a brief overview of gender identity development in adolescence, and then describes the phenomenology of known aetiological factors and co-occurring psychiatric issues in adolescents with GD. Additionally, clinical management considerations that detail assessment aims and common treatment interventions across disciplines will be explored.

AB  - This article reports a systematic review of findings on the long-term development of employee well-being, taking into account the effects of time lag, age, and job change. High-quality quantitative empirical studies focusing on employee affective well-being based on the circumplex model and utilizing measurements at more than two points in time were searched from eight databases. The systematic analysis of the 40 studies revealed that the level of employee well-being was generally high but not fixed - instead changes in mean levels over time were typical. In addition, the stability of well-being was found to be relatively low, as the explained variances were below 50%. Age and change of job were the major factors influencing stability: younger employees and job changers tended to display larger across time changes in well-being than older employees and job stayers, both at the mean level and in terms of their position relative to others. The findings of this review suggest that the indicators of employee affective well-being studied here (i.e. burnout, engagement, and job satisfaction) can meaningfully be applied in future research in measuring changes in employees' well-being. In conclusion, based on the designs, methodologies, and main findings of the reviewed studies, seven avenues for future longitudinal research on employee well-being are proposed.

AB  - Concerns over limited medical equipment and resources, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs), have raised the issue of medical futility. Medical futility draws a contrast between physician's authority and patients' autonomy and it is one of the major issues of end-of-life ethical decision-making. The aim of this study was to review medical futility and its challenges. In this systematized review study, a comprehensive search of the existing literature was performed using an internet search with broad keywords to access related articles in both Persian and English databases. Finally, 89 articles were selected and surveyed. Medical futility is a complex, ambiguous, subjective, situation-specific, value-laden, and goal-dependent concept which is almost always surrounded by some degrees of uncertainty; hence, there is no objective and valid criterion for its determination. This concept is affected by many different factors such as physicians' and patients' value systems, medical goals, and sociocultural and religious context, and individuals' emotions and personal characteristics.
   It is difficult to achieve a clear consensus over the concept of medical futility; hence, it should be defined and determined at an individual level and based on the unique condition of each patient.

AB  - Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a therapeutic approach focusing on the role of interpersonal dynamics in creating psychological difficulties that may be particularly relevant to the field of counselling psychology. IPT's development within randomized controlled trials in the 1970s resulted in a strong empirical foundation without a cohesive theory. Regardless, theorists have since created a theoretical framework for IPT, which has received empirical support. Counselling psychologists have contributed to this research base and may have unique expertise to enhance IPT. Specifically, counselling psychologists can help integrate multicultural and diversity perspectives into IPT with the goal of creating a more culturally competent approach. For example, several aspects of IPT can be expanded to reflect these perspectives, such as integrating cultural sensitivity, cultural knowledge, cultural empathy, and cultural guidance. The authors conclude that IPT is a well-researched and effective treatment approach that holds potential for continued development within counselling psychology.

AB  - Performing music at a professional level is probably one of the most complex human accomplishments requiring extensive training periods. The superior skills of musicians are mirrored in plastic adaptations of the brain involving gray and white matter increase in sensory motor and auditory areas and enlargement of receptive fields. Motor disturbances in musicians are common and include mild forms, such as temporary motor fatigue, painful overuse injuries following prolonged practice, anxiety-related motor failures during performances, and more persistent losses of motor control, termed "dynamic stereotypes." Musician's dystonia is characterized by a permanent loss of motor control when playing a musical instrument linked to genetic susceptibility and to maladaptive plasticity. In this review article, we argue that these motor failures developing on a continuum from motor fatigue to musician's dystonia require client tailored treatment and accordingly specific psychological and neurological interventions.

AB  - Many studies have highlighted the role that positive emotions play in promoting eudaimonic well-being, yet often fail to differentiate between discrete positive emotions (e.g. gratitude, compassion, pride, and contentment). As such, potential functional differences among positive emotions in contributing to eudaimonic well-being may have been overlooked. The present study (N=273) differentiated communion from agency motivation as well as other-focused from self-focused eudaimonic well-being. In line with a hypothesized model, pride contributed positively to self-focused eudaimonic well-being indirectly via agency motivation, and contentment was directly linked positively to self-focused eudaimonic well-being. Compassion contributed positively to other-focused eudaimonic well-being indirectly via communion motivation and gratitude was directly linked positively to other-focused eudaimonic well-being. While several other links were observed, hypothesized links were generally stronger. These findings highlight the potential utility of adopting approaches that differentiate among positive emotions in applied and theoretical work in the field of positive psychology.

AB  - Drug addiction is widely recognized to afflict some but not all individuals by virtue of underlying risk markers and traits involving multifaceted interactions between polygenic and external factors. Remarkably, only a small proportion of individuals exposed to licit and illicit drugs develop compulsive drug-seeking behavior, maintained in the face of adverse consequences and associated detrimental patterns of drug intake involving extended and repeated bouts of binge intoxication, withdrawal and relapse. As a consequence, research has increasingly endeavored to identify distinctive neurobehavioral mechanisms and endophenotypes that predispose individuals to compulsive drug use. However, research in active drug users is hampered by the difficulty in categorizing putatively causal behavioral traits prior to the initiation of drug use. By contrast, research in experimental animals is often hindered by the validity of approaches used to investigate the neural and psychological mechanisms of compulsive drug-seeking habits in humans. Herein, we survey and discuss the principal findings emanating from preclinical animal research on addiction and highlight how specific behavioral endophenotypes of presumed genetic origin (e.g. trait anxiety, novelty preference and impulsivity) differentially contribute to compulsive forms of drug seeking and taking and, in particular, how these differentiate between different classes of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs of abuse.

AB  - Some yoga-based practices have been found to be useful for patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The authors could not find a validated yoga therapy module available for OCD. This study attempted to formulate a generic yoga-based intervention module for OCD. A yoga module was designed based on traditional and contemporary yoga literature. The module was sent to 10 yoga experts for content validation. The experts rated the usefulness of the practices on a scale of 1-5 (5 = extremely useful). The final version of the module was pilot-tested on patients with OCD (n = 17) for both feasibility and effect on symptoms. Eighty-eight per cent (22 out of 25) of the items in the initial module were retained, with modifications in the module as suggested by the experts along with patients' inputs and authors' experience. The module was found to be feasible and showed an improvement in symptoms of OCD on total Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score (p = 0.001). A generic yoga therapy module for OCD was validated by experts in the field and found feasible to practice in patients. A decrease in the symptom scores was also found following yoga practice of 2 weeks. Further clinical validation is warranted to confirm efficacy.

AB  - Here we aimed at finding the neural correlates of the general aspect of visual aesthetic experience (VAE) and those more strictly correlated with the content of the artworks. We applied a general activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to 47 fMRI experiments described in 14 published studies. We also performed four separate ALE analyses in order to identify the neural substrates of reactions to specific categories of artworks, namely portraits, representation of real-world-visual-scenes, abstract paintings, and body sculptures. The general ALE revealed that VAE relies on a bilateral network of areas, and the individual ALE analyses revealed different maximal activation for the artworks' categories as function of their content. Specifically, different content-dependent areas of the ventral visual stream are involved in VAE, but a few additional brain areas are involved as well. Thus, aesthetic-related neural responses to art recruit widely distributed networks in both hemispheres including content-dependent brain areas of the ventral visual stream. Together, the results suggest that aesthetic responses are not independent of sensory, perceptual, and cognitive processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - Through the overview of studies on social representations of forced migrants (socio-cultural level of analysis), the purpose of this paper is to highlight how the variables implicated at the macro levels of analysis may affect the way social and health workers relate to and care for forced migrants (inter-personal level of analysis), as well as the settlement process of forced migrants and their identity reconstruction during the post-migration period.
   Design/methodology/approach - The narrative review analyses empirical studies from peer-reviewed journals in the field of social psychology that address forced migration. Indeed, the framework used for analysing this literature is the interplay within different levels of analysis, as proposed by Willem Doise's (1982) using the socio-psychological approach.
   Findings - Psychosocial factors play influential roles on structuring the way natives health and social professionals relate with forced migrants: among others, needs related to possible traumatising processes are attributed to forced migrants by natives providers. Therefore, identity negotiation process in the forced migration shows a tendency of migrants to reshape the definition of the self within those narrative boundaries that would ensure the protection by the law and that reinforce the social representation of the "medicalised" victim.
   Originality/value - The review would represent a possibility to reflect around dynamics created by the complex interplay within different social actors that contact during the settlement process of forced migrants inside host societies.

AB  - Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression defines the neurobiological mechanisms that bridge genetic and environmental risk factors with neurobehavioral dysfunction underlying the addictions. More than 1000 genes in the eukaryotic genome code for multifunctional RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that can regulate all levels of RNA biogenesis. More than 50% of these RBPs are expressed in the brain where they regulate alternative splicing, transport, localization, stability and translation of RNAs during development and adulthood. Dysfunction of RBPs can exert global effects on their targetomes that underlie neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Here, we consider the evidence that RBPs influence key molecular targets, neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and neurobehavioral dysfunction underlying the addictions. Increasingly well-powered genome-wide association studies in humans and mammalian model organisms combined with ever more precise transcriptomic and proteomic approaches will continue to uncover novel and possibly selective roles for RBPs in the addictions. Key challenges include identifying the biological functions of the dynamic RBP targetomes from specific cell types throughout subcellular space (e.g. the nuclear spliceome vs. the synaptic translatome) and time and manipulating RBP programs through post-transcriptional modifications to prevent or reverse aberrant neurodevelopment and plasticity underlying the addictions.

AB  - In recent times, a great deal of interest has been motivated on plant derived compounds known as nutraceuticals. These compounds exert important beneficial activities that improve people's health status when are consumed regularly, and now they appear as a viable option to explore their possible therapeutic effects against diseases like cancer. Particularly, lupane-type triterpenes have shown great ability to modulate multiple cancer-related signaling pathways and processes, including NF-kappa B, Wnt/beta-catenin, PI3K/Akt, apoptosis, and many other routes related to proliferation or cell death, which are uncontrolled in malignant tumors. These investigations have promoted in vitro and in vivo studies, searching their mechanisms of action; although more research is still needed to prove its potential in human clinical trials. This review focuses on the ability of betulin, betulinic acid and lupeol to show benefits against the most common types of malignant tumors, which are considered a major global threat for public health.

AB  - Motivation can be characterized as a series of cost-benefit valuations, in which we weigh the amount of effort we are willing to expend (the cost of an action) in return for particular rewards (its benefits). Human motivation has traditionally been measured with self-report and questionnaire-based tools, but an inherent limitation of these methods is that they are unable to provide a mechanistic explanation of the processes underlying motivated behavior. A major goal of current research is to quantify motivation objectively with effort-based decision-making paradigms, by drawing on a rich literature from nonhuman animals. Here, we review this approach by considering the development of these paradigms in the laboratory setting over the last three decades, and their more recent translation to understanding choice behavior in humans. A strength of this effort-based approach to motivation is that it is capable of capturing the wide range of individual differences, and offers the potential to dissect motivation into its component elements, thus providing the basis for more accurate taxonomic classifications. Clinically, modeling approaches might provide greater sensitivity and specificity to diagnosing disorders of motivation, for example, in being able to detect subclinical disorders of motivation, or distinguish a disorder of motivation from related but separate syndromes, such as depression. Despite the great potential in applying effort-based paradigms to index human motivation, we discuss several caveats to interpreting current and future studies, and the challenges in translating these approaches to the clinical setting.

AB  - Disorders of diminished motivation, such as apathy, are common and prevalent across a wide range of medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's dementia, stroke, depression, and schizophrenia. Such disorders have a significant impact on morbidity and quality of life, yet their management lacks consensus and remains unsatisfactory. Here, we review laboratory and clinical evidence for the use of dopaminergic therapies in the treatment of apathy. Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter that regulates motivated decision making in humans and other species. A large corpus of evidence suggests that it plays an important role in promoting approach behavior by attributing incentive salience to reward stimuli, and facilitating the overcoming of effort costs. Furthermore, dopaminergic neurons innervate several frontostriatal structures that mediate reward-guided behavior. Based on these findings, there are a priori reasons for considering dopamine in the treatment of disorders of diminished motivation. We highlight key studies that have attempted to use dopamine to manage patients with apathy, and that collectively offer cautious evidence in favor of its efficacy. However, many of these studies are small, unblinded, and uncontrolled, and utilize subjective, questionnaire-based measures of apathy. Given the development of novel paradigms which are able to objectively dissect motivational dysfunction, we are now well positioned to quantify the effect of specific classes of dopaminergic medication on reward-and effort-based decision making in apathy. We anticipate that such paradigms will lay the foundation for future studies to evaluate new and existing treatments for disorders of motivation, using sensitive measures of apathy as primary quantifiable end points.

AB  - Developmental theories can be affirmed, challenged, and augmented by incorporating knowledge about atypical ontogenesis. Investigations of the biological, socioemotional, and personality development in individuals with high-risk conditions and psychopathological disorders can provide an entree into the study of system organization, disorganization, and reorganization. This article examines child maltreatment to illustrate the benefit that can be derived from the study of individuals subjected to nonnormative caregiving experiences. Relative to an average expectable environment, which consists of a species-specific range of environmental conditions that support adaptive development among genetically normal individuals, maltreating families fail to provide many of the experiences that are required for normal development. Principles gleaned from the field of developmental psychopathology provide a framework for understanding multilevel functioning in normality and pathology. Knowledge of normative developmental processes provides the impetus to design and implement randomized control trial (RCT) interventions that can promote resilient functioning in maltreated children.

AB  - The lesion-deficit model dominates neuropsychology. This is unsurprising given powerful demonstrations that focal brain lesions can affect specific aspects of cognition. Nowhere is this more evident than in patients with bilateral hippocampal damage. In the past 60 years, the amnesia and other impairments exhibited by these patients have helped to delineate the functions of the hippocampus and shape the field of memory. We do not question the value of this approach. However, less prominent are the cognitive processes that remain intact following hippocampal lesions. Here, we collate the piecemeal reports of preservation of function following focal bilateral hippocampal damage, highlighting a wealth of information often veiled by the field's focus on deficits. We consider how a systematic understanding of what is preserved as well as what is lost could add an important layer of precision to models of memory and the hippocampus.

AB  - Background: Studies on "Spirituality, religion and health" (R/S) have been increasing worldwide, including in Brazil. Mapping this production can help researchers to understand this field and also to identify gaps in the Brazilian R/S studies. Objective: To analyze the Brazilian scientific articles on "Religion, Spirituality and Health" available on the main electronic databases using a bibliometric approach. Methods: A comprehensive review of four major databases (PubMed, Scopus, BVS and Web of Science) was conducted. Three reviewers performed the data analysis. Off-topic articles, articles from Portugal, books and thesis were excluded. Articles were then classified by: Publication year, journal, Central focus in R/S, Academic Area, Main topic and Study Type. Results: From 3,963 articles found, 686 studies were included in the final analysis (320 had central focus on R/S). There was an increase of articles in the last decade (most observational), with predominance of mental health issues, and from journals in the field of psychiatry, public health and nursing. Discussion: This study enabled us to widen our understanding about how the field of "spirituality, religion and health" has been established and how this field is increasing in Brazil. These findings can help in the development of future Brazilian studies.

AB  - Research examining associations between weather and human health frequently includes the effects of atmospheric humidity. A large number of humidity variables have been developed for numerous purposes, but little guidance is available to health researchers regarding appropriate variable selection. We examine a suite of commonly used humidity variables and summarize both the medical and biometeorological literature on associations between humidity and human health. As an example of the importance of humidity variable selection, we correlate numerous hourly humidity variables to daily respiratory syncytial virus isolates in Singapore from 1992 to 1994. Most water-vapor mass based variables (specific humidity, absolute humidity, mixing ratio, dewpoint temperature, vapor pressure) exhibit comparable correlations. Variables that include a thermal component (relative humidity, dewpoint depression, saturation vapor pressure) exhibit strong diurnality and seasonality. Humidity variable selection must be dictated by the underlying research question. Despite being the most commonly used humidity variable, relative humidity should be used sparingly and avoided in cases when the proximity to saturation is not medically relevant. Care must be taken in averaging certain humidity variables daily or seasonally to avoid statistical biasing associated with variables that are inherently diurnal through their relationship to temperature.

   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the relationship between shift work and errors and performance.
   METHODS: Searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, EBSCOhost, and CINAHL were conducted to identify articles that examined the relationship between shift work, errors, quality, productivity, and performance. All articles were assessed for study quality.
   RESULTS: A total of 435 abstracts were screened with 13 meeting inclusion criteria. Eight studies were rated to be of strong, methodological quality. Nine studies demonstrated a positive relationship that night shift workers committed more errors and had decreased performance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Night shift workers have worse health that may contribute to errors and decreased performance in the workplace.

AB  - Objective: A recent meta-analysis showed that breast cancer probably is more common in female patients with schizophrenia than in the general population (effect size = 1.25, P < 0.05). Increasing experimental and epidemiological data have alerted researchers to the influence of prolactin (PRL) in mammary carcinogenesis. We therefore investigated the possible relationship between antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia (HPRL) and breast cancer risk in female patients with schizophrenia.
   Method: A literature search (1950 until January 2015), using the MEDLINE database, was conducted for English-language published clinical trials to identify and synthesize data of the current state of knowledge concerning breast cancer risk (factors) in women with schizophrenia and its (their) relationship between HPRL and antipsychotic medication.
   Results: Although an increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of PRL in breast carcinogenesis, results of human prospective studies are limited, equivocal, and correlative (with risk ratios ranging from 0.70 to 1.9 for premenopausal women and from 0.76 to 2.03 for postmenopausal women). Moreover, these studies equally do not take into account the local production of PRL in breast epithelium, although amplification or overexpression of the local autocrine/paracrine PRL loop may be a more important mechanism in tumorigenesis. Until now, there is also no conclusive evidence that antipsychotic medication can increase the risk of breast malignancy and mortality.
   Conclusion: Other breast risk factors than PRL, such as nulliparity, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours (alcohol dependence, smoking, low physical activity), probably are of greater relevance in individual breast cancer cases within the population of female patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - The Thukela is the largest river on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coastline, located at the South-Western edge of the Indian Ocean. This coast and the KZN Bight, where the Thukelameets the ocean, is considered meso-oligotrophic with distinct sources of nutrients entering the system. These sources are a series of oceanographic phenomena, including an upwelling cell, and several estuaries, the largest of which is the Thukela River estuary. The shallow Thukela Bank, formed as a sediment plume just off the Thukela estuary mouth, is the major site of several fisheries, notably the prawn trawl and line fisheries. Riverine influence has long been thought to be important for this fishery, but oceanographic research has, until recently, suggested that the main ecosystem driver was the upwelling cell. However, recent studies have shown that the biology of the Bight is primarily maintained by riverine organic matter and nutrients, mainly from the Thukela River. This input has helped support subsistence, recreational and commercial fisheries in one of South Africa's most populated provinces. Despite the evidence of the Thukela's ecological importance for the marine environment, the possibility of increasing water abstraction from the Thukela catchment to meet the needs of a growing population has been considered in water-stressed South Africa. Policy makers will increasingly have to face trade-offs between water demands for human consumption and marine ecological functioning, which are likely to be complicated by uncertainty surrounding future climate change effects on the river and its associated marine ecosystems. This review examines the role played by the Thukela estuary, amongst other estuaries in the Bight, and assesses their overall importance for the area from an ecological and human perspective.

AB  - Background
   Secure hospitals are a high-cost, low-volume service consuming around a fifth of the overall mental health budget in England and Wales.
   Aims
   A systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse outcomes after discharge along with a comparison with rates in other clinical and forensic groups in order to inform public health and policy.
   Method
   We searched for primary studies that followed patients discharged from a secure hospital, and reported mortality, readmissions or reconvictions. We determined crude rates for all adverse outcomes.
   Results
   In total, 35 studies from 10 countries were included, involving 12 056 patients out of which 53% were violent offenders. The crude death rate for all-cause mortality was 1538 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 1175-1901). For suicide, the crude death rate was 325 per 100000 person-years (95% CI 235 415). The readmission rate was 7208 per 100000 person-years (95% CI 5916-8500). Crude reoffending rates were 4484 per 100000 person-years (95% CI 3679-5287), with lower rates in more recent studies.
   Conclusions
   There is some evidence that patients discharged from forensic psychiatric services have lower offending outcomes than many comparative groups. Services could consider improving interventions aimed at reducing premature mortality, particularly suicide, in discharged patients.

AB  - To persist in an ocean changing in temperature, pH and other stressors related to climate change, many marine species will likely need to acclimatize or adapt to avoid extinction. If marine populations possess adequate genetic variation in tolerance to climate change stressors, species might be able to adapt to environmental change. Marine climate change research is moving away from single life stage studies where individuals are directly placed into projected scenarios ('future shock' approach), to focus on the adaptive potential of populations in an ocean that will gradually change over coming decades. This review summarizes studies that consider the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates to climate change stressors and the methods that have been applied to this research, including quantitative genetics, laboratory selection studies and trans- and multigenerational experiments. Phenotypic plasticity is likely to contribute to population persistence providing time for genetic adaptation to occur. Transgenerational and epigenetic effects indicate that the environmental and physiological history of the parents can affect offspring performance. There is a need for long-term, multigenerational experiments to determine the influence of phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation and transgenerational effects on species' capacity to persist in a changing ocean. However, multigenerational studies are only practicable for short generation species. Consideration of multiple morphological and physiological traits, including changes in molecular processes (eg, DNA methylation) and long-term studies that facilitate acclimatization will be essential in making informed predictions of how the seascape and marine communities will be altered by climate change.

AB  - Evidence from neuropathological, genetic, animal model, and biochemical studies has indicated that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) is associated with, and probably induces, profound neuronal changes in brain regions critical for memory and cognition in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is considerable evidence that synapses are particularly vulnerable to AD, establishing synaptic dysfunction as one of the earliest events in pathogenesis, prior to neuronal loss. It is clear that excessive A.. levels can disrupt excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity, mainly due to dysregulation of the AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors in the brain. Importantly, AMPA receptors are the principal glutamate receptors that mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission. This is essential for synaptic plasticity, a cellular correlate of learning and memory, which are the cognitive functions that are most disrupted in AD. Here we review recent advances in the field and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie A beta-induced dysfunction of AMPA receptor trafficking. This review focuses primarily on NMDA receptor-and metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated signaling. In particular, we highlight several mechanisms that underlie synaptic long-term depression as common signaling pathways that are hijacked by the neurotoxic effects of A beta.

AB  - Neuropsychological assessment forms an essential part of the screening, diagnosis and general assessment of Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). A number of studies have evaluated the applicability of various neuropsychological tests within the context of ARBD assessment, yet little attempt has been made to collate this evidence and discuss its clinical application. The aim of this protocol is to outline the methodology for a systematic review that aims to identify the neuropsychological tools being used to assess cognitive impairments in individuals with ARBD and evaluate their efficacy within this context. We will search a number of online databases and other sources to identify studies using a neuropsychological tool in the screening, diagnosis or neuropsychological assessment of individuals with ARBD. Primary outcome measures of interest will be construct validity, convergent validity, reliability (retest and inter-rater), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and practical considerations. Results from the review will assist clinicians and researchers involved in the assessment and diagnosis of ARBD by providing a synthesis and critical analysis of the evidence base for each tool, allowing them to make efficient and well-informed test selections. Review findings could also be used to inform the development of guidelines for ARBD diagnosis and assessment.

AB  - Objective: Combining antidepressants (ADs) for therapy of acute depression is frequently employed, but randomized studies have yielded conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at determining efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy.
   Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases were systematically searched through March 2014 for controlled studies comparing combinations of ADs with AD monotherapy in adult patients suffering from acute depression. The prespecified primary outcome was standardized mean difference (SMD), secondary outcomes were response, remission, and dropouts.
   Results: Among 8688 articles screened, 38 studies were eligible, including 4511 patients. Combination treatment was statistically, significantly superior to monotherapy (SMD 0.29; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.42). During monotherapy, slightly fewer patients dropped out due to adverse events (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.53). Studies were heterogeneous (I-2 = 63%), and there was indication of moderate publication bias (fail-safe N for an effect of 0.1:44), but results remained robust across prespecified secondary outcomes and subgroups, including analyses restricted to randomized controlled trials and low risk of bias studies. Meta-regression revealed an association of SMD with difference in imipramine-equivalent dose. Combining a reuptake inhibitor with an antagonist of presynaptic 2-autoreceptors was superior to other combinations.
   Conclusion: Combining ADs seems to be superior to monotherapy with only slightly more patients dropping out. Combining a reuptake inhibitor with an antagonist of presynaptic 2-autoreceptors seems to be significantly more effective than other combinations. Overall, our search revealed a dearth of well-designed studies.
   Objectif: Combiner les antidepresseurs pour traiter la depression aigue est une methode frequemment utilisee, mais les etudes randomisees ont offert des resultats conflictuels. Nous avons mene une revue systematique et une meta-analyse visant a determiner l'efficacite et la tolerabilite du traitement combine ou polytherapie.
   Methodes: Une recherche des bases de donnees MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, et CENTRAL a ete systematiquement menee jusqu'en mars 2014 pour reperer les etudes controlees comparant les polytherapies d'antidepresseurs avec la monotherapie d'antidepresseur chez des patients adultes souffrant de depression aigue. Le resultat principal predetermine etait la difference des moyennes standardisees (DMS), et les resultats secondaires etaient la reponse, la remission, et les abandons.
   Resultats: Sur 8688 articles examines, 38 etudes etaient admissibles, portant sur 4511 patients. La polytherapie etait statistiquement significativement superieure a la monotherapie (DMS 0,29; IC a 95% 0,16 a 0,42). Durant la monotherapie, un nombre legerement moindre de patients ont abandonne en raison d'effets indesirables (RC 0,90; 0,53 a 1,53). Les etudes etaient heterogenes (I-2 = 63%), et il y avait une indication d'un biais de publication modere (N a securite integree pour un effet de 0,1: 44), mais les resultats demeuraient solides dans les resultats secondaires predetermines et les sous-groupes, y compris les analyses restreintes aux essais randomises et aux etudes a faible risque de biais. La meta-regression a revele une association de la DMS avec une difference d'imipramine pour une dose equivalente. Combiner un inhibiteur du recaptage avec un antagoniste des autorecepteurs 2 presynaptiques etait superieur aux autres combinaisons.
   Conclusion: Combiner des antidepresseurs semble etre superieur a la monotherapie, et un nombre legerement plus eleve de patients seulement abandonnent le traitement. Combiner un inhibiteur du recaptage avec un antagoniste des autorecepteurs 2 presynaptiques semble etre significativement plus efficace que les autres combinaisons. En general, notre recherche a revele une penurie d'etudes bien concues.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Administrative health databases are increasingly used to conduct population-based health research and surveillance; this has resulted in a corresponding growth in studies about their quality. Our objective was to describe the characteristics of published Canadian studies about administrative health database quality.
   METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Advanced were searched, along with websites of relevant organizations. English-language studies that evaluated the quality of one or more Canadian administrative health databases between 2004 and 2014 were selected for inclusion. Extracted information included data quality concepts and measures, year and type of publication, type of database, and geographic origin.
   SYNTHESIS: More than 3,000 publications were identified from the search. Twelve reports and 144 peer-reviewed papers were included. The majority (53.5%) of peer-review publications used databases from Ontario and Alberta, while 67% of the non-peer-review publications used data from multiple provinces/ territories. Almost all peer-reviewed papers (97.2%) were validation studies. Hospital discharge abstracts and physician billing claims were the most frequently validated databases. Approximately half of the publications (53.0%) validated case definitions and 37.7% focused on a chronic physical health condition.
   CONCLUSION: Gaps in the Canadian administrative data quality literature include a limited number of studies evaluating data from the Maritimes and across multiple jurisdictions, newer data sources, validating methods for identifying individuals with mental illness, and assessing the completeness and serviceability of the data. Data quality studies can aid researchers to understand the strengths and limitations of the data.

Virtual environments created by virtual reality (VR) tools can help to make the treatment of certain types of phobias more efficient. Attention to this form of phobia treatment with the help of VR is on the rise in the world, so we are also monitoring its development, as well. Our paper introduces the necessary hardware and software that has been piloted in our department, but also methods of creating virtual environments, models and application designed for medical therapies of patients. In our work we have searched for and tested the following methods for creating virtual environments: A) modelling using computer graphics, B) modelling animation using animation programs, C) taking pictures of static objects and scenes, D) filming moving objects and scenes using classic video or special scanning techniques to create 360 degrees panoramas or E) any combination of these methods.

AB  - Background Although people with serious mental illnesses have a high risk of contracting blood-borne viral infections, sexual health has largely been neglected by researchers and policy makers involved in mental health. Failure to address this shortcoming could increase morbidity and mortality as a result of undetected and untreated infection. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of blood-borne viral infection in people with serious mental illness.
   Method We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and DARE for studies of the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus in people with serious mental illness, published between Jan 1, 1980, and Jan 1, 2015. We group prevalence data by region and by virus and estimated pooled prevalence. We did a sensitivity analysis of the effect of study quality on prevalence.
   Findings After removal of duplicates, we found 373 abstracts, 91 of which met our eligibility criteria. The prevalences of blood-borne viral infections in people with serious mental illness were higher than in the general population in places with low prevalence of blood-borne viruses, such as the USA and Europe, and on par with the general population in regions with high prevalence of blood-borne viruses (Africa for HIV and southeast Asia for hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus). Pooled prevalence of HIV in people with serious mental illness in the USA was 6.0% (95% CI 4.3-8.3). Sensitivity analysis showed that quality scores did not significantly affect prevalence.
   Interpretation People with serious mental illness are at risk of blood-borne viral infections. However, because of methodological limitations of the studies the prevalence might be overestimated. Serious mental illness is unlikely to be a sole risk factor and risk of blood-borne viral infection is probably multifactorial and associated with low socioeconomic status, drug and alcohol misuse, ethnic origin, and sex. Health providers should routinely discuss sexual health and risks for blood-borne viruses (including risks related to drug misuse) with people who have serious mental illness, as well as offering testing and treatment for those at risk.

AB  - Introduction: For the past two decades, researchers have been using various approaches to investigate the relationship, if any, between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and violence. The need to clarify that relationship was reinforced by the tragic mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012 by an individual diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. The purpose of this article is ( 1) to provide an updated review of the literature on the association between ASD and violence, and ( 2) to examine implications for treating, and for preventing violence by, individuals with ASD.
   Method: A review of all published literature regarding ASD and violence from 1943 to 2014 was conducted using electronic and paper searches.
   Results: Although some case reports have suggested an increased violence risk in individuals with ASD compared to the general population, prevalence studies have provided no conclusive evidence to support this suggestion. Among individuals with ASD, however, generative (e.g., comorbid psychopathology, social-cognition deficits, emotion-regulation problems) and associational (e.g., younger age, Asperger's syndrome diagnosis, repetitive behavior) risk factors have been identified or proposed for violent behavior.
   Conclusions: While no conclusive evidence indicates that individuals with ASD are more violent than those without ASD, specific generative and associational risk factors may increase violence risk among individuals with ASD. Further research would help to clarify or confirm these findings, suggest potential directions for evaluation, treatment, and prevention, and potentially provide compelling empirical support for forensic testimony regarding defendants with ASD charged with violent crimes.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairments are a core feature in schizophrenia and are linked to poor social functioning. Numerous studies have shown that cognitive remediation can enhance cognitive and functional abilities in patients with this pathology. The underlying mechanism of these behavioral improvements seems to be related to structural and functional changes in the brain. However, studies on neural correlates of such enhancement remain scarce.
   Objectives: We explored the neural correlates of cognitive enhancement following cognitive remediation interventions in schizophrenia and the differential effect between cognitive training and other therapeutic interventions or patients' usual care.
   Method: We searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and ScienceDirect databases for studies on cognitive remediation therapy in schizophrenia that used neuroimaging techniques and a randomized design. Search terms included randomized controlled trial, cognitive remediation, cognitive training, rehabilitation, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, near infrared spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging. We selected randomized controlled trials that proposed multiple sessions of cognitive training to adult patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and assessed its efficacy with imaging techniques.
   Results: In total, 15 reports involving 19 studies were included in the systematic review. They involved a total of 455 adult patients, 271 of whom received cognitive remediation. Cognitive remediation therapy seems to provide a neurobiological enhancing effect in schizophrenia. After therapy, increased activations are observed in various brain regions mainly in frontal - especially prefrontal - and also in occipital and anterior cingulate regions during working memory and executive tasks. Several studies provide evidence of an improved functional connectivity after cognitive training, suggesting a neuroplastic effect of therapy through mechanisms of functional reorganization. Neurocognitive and social-cognitive training may have a cumulative effect on neural networks involved in social cognition. The variety of proposed programs, imaging tasks, and techniques may explain the heterogeneity of observed neural improvements. Future studies would need to specify the effect of cognitive training depending on those variables.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Musicians face numerous psychosocial and physical demands at work resulting in high prevalence of musculoskeletal problems. Unlike physical risks, little is known about psychosocial work factors influencing such health problems in this particular group.
   OBJECTIVE: The paper aimed to identify psychosocial work demands resulting in musculoskeletal problems among musicians.
   METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken to find data linking psychosocial work demands or stress with musculoskeletal disorders among musicians.
   RESULTS: The exploration of databases resulted in nine research studies linking psychosocial aspects of work or stress with musculoskeletal problems among musicians. The analyzed studies linked psychosocial aspects with musculoskeletal problems in three ways showing proportions of people indicating particular causes of pain, indicating correlations between these variables or performing regression analysis showing psychosocial predictors of musculoskeletal pain.
   CONCLUSIONS: Only a few studies have undertaken the issue of psychosocial risk factors for musculoskeletal problems among musicians. The results revealed that some psychosocial aspects of work, e.g. long hours at work, work content, high job demands, low control/influence, lack of social support, were related to musculoskeletal pain, however, the methods and results were inconsistent. The extant studies employed variety of definitions of psychosocial aspects that hindered the possibility for consistent conclusions. Basing on those conclusions, future directions were offered.

AB  - Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) is a CNS-enriched protein implicated in multiple neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. STEP regulates key signaling proteins required for synaptic strengthening as well as NMDA and AMPA receptor trafficking. Both high and low levels of STEP disrupt synaptic function and contribute to learning and behavioral deficits. High levels of STEP are present in human postmortem samples and animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia and in animal models of fragile X syndrome. Low levels of STEP activity are present in additional disorders that include ischemia, Huntington's chorea, alcohol abuse, and stress disorders. Thus the current model of STEP is that optimal levels are required for optimal synaptic function. Here we focus on the role of STEP in Alzheimer's disease and the mechanisms by which STEP activity is increased in this illness. Both genetic lowering of STEP levels and pharmacological inhibition of STEP activity in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease reverse the biochemical and cognitive abnormalities that are present. These findings suggest that STEP is an important point for modulation of proteins required for synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic oxido-inflammatory disorder of the lung. Oxidative stress is widely recognized as a central feature of IPF. Antioxidant therapy has been proposed as an effective treatment for IPF. An array of clinical trials describing the therapeutic impact of these drugs have been reporting albeit with conflicting evidence points. We performed a meta-analysis of trials in which efficacy of antioxidant therapy was compared with control in IPF. Systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CPCI-S (Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science), ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), and Google Scholar till June 2016 by two independent researchers. Various outcomes such as changes in pulmonary function tests (change in vital capacity [Delta VC], change in forced vital capacity [Delta FVC], change in percentage of predicted vital capacity [Delta% VC], and change in percentage of predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity [Delta%DLco]), changes in 6 minutes walking test distance (Delta 6MWT), rates of adverse events, and rates of death, were included. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan V.5.3. Twelve studies (n = 1062) were identified that used antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine and lecithinized superoxide dismutase) as a treatment for IPF. Overall, there was no association of antioxidant therapy with Delta FVC (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI:-0.07 to 0.61; P = 0.12), Delta FVC (%) (SMD = -0.10, 95% CI:-0.56 to 0.36; P = 0.66) and 6MWT (SMD = -0.04, 95% CI:-0.11 to 0.20; P = 0.59) in IPF patients. However, combined antioxidant therapy was found to be associated with % VC (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.64; P = 0.008) and Delta%DLco (SMD = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.29; P = 0.05) in IPF patients. Strong evidence was obtained that the antioxidants increased adverse effects adverse events (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 0.75 to 3.24; P = 0.23) but it did not associate mortality (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.44 to 2.11; P = 0.92). The use of significant clinical heterogeneity, low statistical power, high dropout rates, duration of follow-ups, and dosing regimens of antioxidant agents. Combined antioxidant therapy seems to be a safe and effective therapy for IPF patients which provides a more beneficial effect in terms of VC, and DLco rather than monotherapy. Further randomized controlled trials with homogeneous outcome measures are needed.

AB  - Objectives: Community treatment orders (CTOs) for people with severe mental illnesses are used across most of Canada. It is unclear if they can reduce health service use, or improve clinical and social outcomes. This review summarizes the evidence from studies conducted in Canada.
   Method: A systematic literature search of PubMed and MEDLINE to March 2015 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were quantitative and qualitative studies undertaken in Canada that presented data on the effect of CTOs on outcomes.
   Results: Nine papers from 8 studies were included in the review. Four studies compared health service use before and after compulsory treatment as well as engagement with psychosocial supports. Three were qualitative evaluations of patients, family, or staff and the last was a postal survey of psychiatrists. Hospital readmission rates and days spent in hospital were all reduced following CTO placement, while outpatient attendance and participation in psychiatric services and housing all improved. Family members and clinicians were generally positive about the effect of CTOs but patients were ambivalent. However, the strength of the evidence was limited as many of the studies were small, only one included control subjects, and there was no adjustment for potential confounders using either matching or multivariate analyses. Only 2 qualitative studies included the views of patients and their families.
   Conclusions: The evidence base for the use of CTOs in Canada is limited and this lack of Canadian research is in marked contrast to other countries where there have been large studies that have used randomized or matched control subjects. Their use should be kept under review.
   Objectifs: Les ordonnances de traitement en milieu communautaire (OTMC) pour les personnes souffrant de maladie mentale grave sont utilisees presque partout au Canada. Il n'est pas determine si elles peuvent reduire l'utilisation des services de sante, ou ameliorer les resultats cliniques et sociaux. Cette revue resume les donnees probantes des etudes menees au Canada.
   Methode: Une recherche systematique de la litterature a ete menee dans PubMed et MEDLINE jusqu'en mars 2015. Les criteres d'inclusion etaient des etudes quantitatives et qualitatives menees au Canada qui presentaient des donnees sur l'effet des OTMC sur les resultats.
   Resultats: Neuf articles sur huit etudes ont ete inclus dans la revue. Quatre comparaient l'utilisation des services de sante avant et apres le traitement obligatoire ainsi que le recours aux soutiens psychologiques. Trois etaient des evaluations qualitatives des patients, des familles ou du personnel, et le dernier consistait en un sondage postal des psychiatres. Les taux de rehospitalisation et de sejours a l'hopital etaient tous reduits par suite d'un placement d'OTMC, tandis que la frequentation et la participation des patients externes aux services psychiatriques et au logement se sont toutes ameliorees. Les membres de la famille et les cliniciens etaient generalement positifs au sujet de l'effet des OTMC, mais les patients etaient ambivalents. Cependant, la force des donnees probantes etait limitee car beaucoup d'etudes etaient de petite taille, une seule comportait des sujets temoins, et il n'y avait pas de correction pour les facteurs de confusion potentiels des analyses d'appariement ou multivariees utilisees. Seulement 2 etudes qualitatives incluaient les points de vue des patients et de leurs familles.
   Conclusions: La base des donnees probantes pour l'utilisation des OTMC au Canada est limitee et cette absence de recherche canadienne s'inscrit en contraste marque avec d'autres pays oU de vastes etudes ont utilise des temoins aleatoires ou apparies. L'utilisation des OTMC devrait continuer a faire l'objet d'une revue.

AB  - Ambient heat exposure is a well-known health hazard, which reduces human performance and work capacity at heat levels already common in tropical and subtropical areas. Various health problems have been reported. Increasing heat exposure during the hottest seasons of each year is a key feature of global climate change. Heat exhaustion and reduced human performance are often overlooked in climate change health impact analysis. Later this century, many among the four billion people who live in hot areas worldwide will experience significantly reduced work capacity owing to climate change. In some areas, 30-40% of annual daylight hours will become too hot for work to be carried out. The social and economic impacts will be considerable, with global gross domestic product (GDP) losses greater than 20% by 2100. The analysis to date is piecemeal. More analysis of climate change-related occupational health impact assessments is greatly needed.

AB  - Ever more extensive use of marine space by human activities and greater demands for marine natural resources has led to increases in both duration and spatial extent of pressures on the marine environment. In parallel, the global crisis of decreasing biodiversity and loss of habitats has revitalized scientific research on human impacts and lead to methodological development of cumulative pressure and impact assessments (CPIA). In Europe alone, almost 20 CPIAs have been published in the past 10 years and some more in other sea regions of the world. In this review, we have analyzed 40 recent marine CPIAs and focused on their methodological approaches. We were especially interested in uncovering methodological similarities, identifying best practices and analysing whether the CPIAs have addressed the recent criticism. The review results showed surprisingly similar methodological approaches in half of the studies, raising hopes for finding coherence in international assessment efforts. Although the CPIA methods showed relatively few innovative approaches for addressing the major caveats of previous CPIAs, the most recent studies indicate that improved approaches may be soon found.

KW  - mobbing in maritime
AB  - Nowadays, there are many reasons for people to be stressful and restless in their working environments. One of the reasons leading to this situation is known as "mobbing". The term "mobbing" means " bullying of an individual by a group". It usually happens among employees. The main effects of mobbing are the generation of stress and reduction of employee performance at work. In general, research shows that mobbing is particularly common in the public sector. The aim of this research is to understand the frequency of mobbing on employees in the Turkish maritime industry as a case study. In this study, a questionnaire survey on ship, shipyard, public and private company workers was applied to understand how often employees are exposed to mobbing. After analysing the results, it is also aimed to obtain information about the reasons and causes of mobbing, and then we can get some advice for this issue.

AB  - Background: Physical activity (PA) is increasingly advocated as an adjunct intervention for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific benefits of PA on the wide variety of impairments observed in patients with PD has yet to be clearly identified.
   Objective: Highlight health parameters that are most likely to improve as a result of PA interventions in patients with PD.
   Methods: We compiled results obtained from studies examining a PA intervention in patients with PD and who provided statistical analyses of their results. 868 outcome measures were extracted from 106 papers published from 1981 to 2015. The results were classified as having a statistically significant positive effect or no effect. Then, outcome measures were grouped into four main categories and further divided into sub-categories.
   Results: Our review shows that PA seems most effective in improving Physical capacities and Physical and cognitive functional capacities. On the other hand, PA seems less efficient at improving Clinical symptoms of PD and Psychosocial aspects of life, with only 50% or less of results reporting positive effects. The impact of PA on Cognitive functions and Depression also appears weaker, but few studies have examined these outcomes.
   Discussion: Our results indicate that PA interventions have a positive impact on physical capacities and functional capacities. However, the effect of PAon symptoms of the disease and psychosocial aspects of life are moderate and show more variability. This review also highlights the need for more research on the effects of PA on cognitive functions, depression as well as specific symptoms of PD.

AB  - Pain, especially chronic pain, is one of the most common clinical symptoms and has been considered as a worldwide healthcare problem. The transition from acute to chronic pain is accompanied by a chain of alterations in physiology, pathology, and psychology. Increasing clinical studies and complementary animal models have elucidated effects of stress regulation on the pain chronification via investigating activations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and changes in some crucial brain regions, including the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Although individuals suffer from acute pain benefit from such physiological alterations, chronic pain is commonly associated with maladaptive responses, like the HPA dysfunction and abnormal brain plasticity. However, the causal relationship among pain chronification, stress regulation, and brain alterations is rarely discussed. To call for more attention on this issue, we review recent findings obtained from clinical populations and animal models, propose an integrated stress model of pain chronification based on the existing models in perspectives of environmental influences and genetic predispositions, and discuss the significance of investigating the role of stress regulation on brain alteration in pain chronification for various clinical applications.

AB  - The human brain has an enormous capacity to adapt to a broad variety of environmental demands. Previous studies in the field of abacus training have shown that this training can induce specific changes in the brain. However, the neural mechanism underlying these changes remains elusive. Here, we reviewed the behavioral and imaging findings of comparisons between abacus experts and average control subjects and focused on changes in activation patterns and changes in brain structure. Finally, we noted the limitations and the future directions of this field. We concluded that although current studies have provided us with information about the mechanisms of abacus training, more research on abacus training is needed to understand its neural impact.

AB  - Risk assessments identify the presence of a Personality Disorder diagnosis as relevant to future violence. At present, risk assessments focus on the presence of the disorder rather than identifying key traits related to risk. Systematic searches of three databases were conducted from January 2000 until August 2014. Of 92,143, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. A lack of empirical research was found focusing on individual traits; instead most considered PD diagnosis as a sole entity. A preliminary model has been developed detailing the link between potential interactions of diagnostic traits and risk of violence. Recommendations for future research are made.

AB  - Purpose - Health impact assessment (HIA) is a systematic research and public engagement tool used to elevate health and equity in public policies. However, HIA practitioners often overlook potential mental health impacts. The purpose of this paper is to review the degree to which mental health is included in HIAs in the USA.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a systematic review of 156 HIAs that were completed between 1993 and 2013 for their inclusion of mental health. HIAs were subdivided to assess if mental health conditions or their determinants were measured, and if predictions or mitigation strategies were made in the scoping, assessment, or recommendations phases.
   Findings - Overall, 73.1 percent of HIAs included mental health. Of the HIAs that included mental health (n = 114), 85.1 percent also included the determinants of mental health and 67.6 percent included mental health outcomes. 37.7 percent of HIAs measured baseline mental health conditions and 64.0 percent predicted changes in mental health as the result of implementing the proposed policy, plan, or program. Among the HIAs that made predictions about mental health, 79.5 percent included recommendations for potential changes in mental health, while only 46.6 percent had measured mental health at baseline.
   Research limitations/implications - Although many HIAs included mental health in some capacity, this paper quantifies that mental health is not included in a robust way in HIAs in the USA. This presents a difficulty for efforts to address the growing issues of mental health and mental health inequities in the populations.
   Originality/value - This paper represents the first academic endeavor to systematically assess the state of the field of HIA for its inclusion of mental health.

AB  - Mutations in a number of genes cause rare familial forms of Parkinson's disease and provide profound insight into potential mechanisms governing disease pathogenesis. Recently, a role for translation and metabolism of mRNA has emerged in the development of various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, preliminary evidence supports a role for aberrant translation in the disease process stemming from mutations in several genes. Translation control is central to maintaining organism homeostasis under variable environmental conditions and deregulation of this may predispose to certain stressors. Hypothetically, deregulated translation may be detrimental to neuronal viability in PD through the misexpression of a subset of transcripts or through the impact of excessive bulk translation on energy consumption and burden on protein homeostatic mechanisms. While compelling preliminary evidence exists to support a role for translation in PD, much more work is required to identify specific mechanisms linking altered translation to the disease process.

AB  - Objective: Stigma toward individuals with mental disorders has been studied extensively. In the case of Latin America and the Caribbean, the past decade has been marked by a significant increase in information on stigma toward mental illness, but these findings have yet to be applied to mental health services in Latin America. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of studies relating to stigma toward mental illness in Latin America and the Caribbean. The authors specifically considered differences in this region as compared with manifestations reported in Western European countries.
   Methods: A systematic search of scientific papers was conducted in the PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, SciELO, LILACS, Imbiomed, and Bireme databases. The search included articles published from 2002 to 2014.
   Results: Twenty-six studies from seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean were evaluated and arranged into the following categories: public stigma, consumer stigma, family stigma, and multiple stigmas.
   Conclusion: We identified some results similar to those reported in high-income settings. However, some noteworthy findings concerning public and family stigma differed from those reported in Western European countries. Interventions designed to reduce mental illness-related stigma in this region may benefit from considering cultural dynamics exhibited by the Latino population.

Results Early hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response may impact initial trauma experience, with downstream effects on posttrauma adjustment reflected in posttrauma neurobiology, psychological health, and physical health. Conclusions Prospective research with children and adolescents exposed to trauma is needed to better characterize the genetic and epigenetic influences on the course of HPA and immune processes as related to posttrauma psychological and physical health outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Occupational therapy has presented an increasing growth in the health and occupational field, with interventions in rehabilitation, prevention, promotion and surveillance in occupational health. Objective: The study aimed to analyze occupational therapy scientific publications in the period from 2000 to 2013, based on the level of evidence. Method: A bibliographical research on the production of papers from the two main journals in the field of occupational therapy in Brazil was developed: Revista de Terapia Ocupacional from USP and Cadernos de Terapia Ocupacional from UFSCar, using as key words, in Portuguese, corresponding to "workers'health", "ergonomics", "work accidents", "worker", "RSI (Repetitive Strain Injuries)", "professional rehabilitation", and "people with disabilities". Results: The data were grouped and organized as: (a) production by types of work analyzed according to the level of evidence; (b) production by years of publications; and (c) publication in accordance with the object of study. The sample consisted of 30 papers, with 90% (n=27) with level of evidence six, 34% (n=10) of publications between the years 2011 to 2012 and regarding the first author affiliation, 90% (n=27) was affiliated to the educational institution. On the object of study 27% was RSI, 23% (n=7) was ergonomics, 17% (n=50) was mental health and work and 13% (n=40) people with disabilities. Conclusion: It was concluded that publications included in this research point to a predominance of publishing approach. The failure to find other studies showed the need for further research based on different methodological approaches.

AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are causing oceans to become more acidic, with consequences for all marine life including microorganisms. Studies reveal that from the microbes that occupy the open ocean to those intimately associated with their invertebrate hosts changing ocean chemistry will alter the critical functions of these important organisms. Our current understanding indicates that bacterial communities associated with their host will shift as pH drops by another 0.2-0.4 units over the next 100 years. It is unclear what impacts this will have for host health, however, increased vulnerability to disease seems likely for those associated with reef corals. Natural CO2 seeps have provided a unique setting for the study of microbial communities under OA in situ, where shifts in the bacterial communities associated with corals at the seep are correlated with a decline in abundance of the associated coral species. Changes to global biogeochemical cycles also appear likely as photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation by pelagic microbes becomes enhanced under low pH conditions. However, recent long-term studies have shown that pelagic microbes are also capable of evolutionary adaptation, with some physiological responses to a decline in pH restored after hundreds of generations at high pCO(2) levels. The impacts of ocean acidification (OA) also will not work in isolation, thus synergistic interactions with other potential stressors, such as rising seawater temperatures, will likely exacerbate the microbial response to OA. This review discusses our existing understanding of the impacts of OA on both pelagic and host-associated marine microbial communities, whilst highlighting the importance of controlled laboratory studies and in situ experiments, to fill the current gaps in our knowledge.

AB  - Spatial neglect (SN) is an extremely common disorder of attention; it is most frequently a consequence of stroke, especially to the right cerebral hemisphere. The current view of SN is that it is not a unitary deficit but a multicomponent syndrome. Crucially, it has been repeatedly shown that it has a considerable negative impact on rehabilitation outcome. Although a number of behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been developed, none of these appears to be applicable to all patients with SN or has proved unequivocally successful in clinical trials.
   One potential avenue for therapeutic intervention in neglect relates to the interaction between motivation and attention. A number of investigators, including ourselves, have observed a possible motivational component to the syndrome and showed that motivational stimulation can temporarily improve attention in patients with SN.
   In this chapter we review previous work looking at how motivation can modulate attention in healthy individuals and how it may be affected by neurological disease before discussing how motivational impairments may contribute to neglect, and how motivation has been used to modulate neglect. In the final section, we present recent experimental work examining how reward interacts with attentional biases in patients with SN. In this study, we adapted the classic Landmark task to explore the mechanisms behind the effect of reward in SN, and found that centrally located stimuli that were explicitly associated with reward appeared to improve neglect and reduce rightward bias. Our results suggest that positive motivation, in the form of anticipated monetary reward, may influence attentional bias via more general mechanisms, such as alerting and task engagement, rather than directly increasing salience of items in contralesional space. We conclude by discussing how motivation might be practically integrated into the rehabilitation of patients with this debilitating disorder.

AB  - With population aging and a projected exponential expansion of persons diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the development of treatment and prevention programs has become a fervent area of research and discovery. A growing body of evidence suggests that music exposure can enhance memory and emotional function in persons with AD. However, there is a paucity of research that aims to identify specific underlying neural mechanisms associated with music's beneficial effects in this particular population. As such, this paper reviews existing anecdotal and empirical evidence related to the enhancing effects of music exposure on cognitive function and further provides a discussion on the potential underlying mechanisms that may explain music's beneficial effect. Specifically, this paper will outline the potential role of the dopaminergic system, the autonomic nervous system, and the default network in explaining how music may enhance memory function in persons with AD.

AB  - A major goal of cognitive neuroscience is to delineate how brain systems give rise to mental function. Here we review the increasingly large role informatics-driven approaches are playing in such efforts. We begin by reviewing a number of challenges conventional neuroimaging approaches face in trying to delineate brain-cognition mappings-for example, the difficulty in establishing the specificity of postulated associations. Next, we demonstrate how these limitations can potentially be overcome using complementary approaches that emphasize large-scale analysis-including meta-analytic methods that synthesize hundreds or thousands of studies at a time; latent-variable approaches that seek to extract structure from data in a bottom-up manner; and predictive modeling approaches capable of quantitatively inferring mental states from patterns of brain activity. We highlight the underappreciated but critical role for formal cognitive ontologies in helping to clarify, refine, and test theories of brain and cognitive function. Finally, we conclude with a speculative discussion of what future informatics developments may hold for cognitive neuroscience.

AB  - The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by a great many observable changes, both molecular and physiological. These include oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and (more proximal to cognitive decline) the death of neuronal and other cells. A systems biology approach seeks to organize these observed variables into pathways that discriminate those that are highly involved (i.e., causative) from those that are more usefully recognized as bystander effects. We review the evidence that iron dysregulation is one of the central causative pathway elements here, as this can cause each of the above effects. In addition, we review the evidence that dormant, non-growing bacteria are a crucial feature of AD, that their growth in vivo is normally limited by a lack of free iron, and that it is this iron dysregulation that is an important factor in their resuscitation. Indeed, bacterial cells can be observed by ultrastructural microscopy in the blood of AD patients. A consequence of this is that the growing cells can shed highly inflammatory components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS). These too are known to be able to induce (apoptotic and pyroptotic) neuronal cell death. There is also evidence that these systems interact with elements of vitamin D metabolism. This integrative systems approach has strong predictive power, indicating (as has indeed been shown) that both natural and pharmaceutical iron chelators might have useful protective roles in arresting cognitive decline, and that a further assessment of the role of microbes in AD development is more than highly warranted.

Methods Using established systematic review guidelines, we searched PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PubMed (producing 216 PMTS papers published since 2005), extracted findings for review, and organized and interpreted findings within the Integrative Model framework. Results Recent PMTS research has included additional pediatric populations, used advanced longitudinal modeling techniques, clarified relations between parent and child PMTS, and considered effects of PMTS on health outcomes. Results support and extend the model's five assumptions, and suggest a sixth assumption related to health outcomes and PMTS. Conclusions Based on new evidence, the renamed Integrative Trajectory Model includes phases corresponding with medical events, adds family-centered trajectories, reaffirms a competency-based framework, and suggests updated assessment and intervention implications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interest in resilience has increased in recent years. The U.S. military focus is on personal health and adaptation following exposure to battle, while the civilian interest centers on adjustments subsequent to disastrous events. Coping skills are also relevant, yet the relationships between coping and resilience are unclear.
   OBJECTIVE: This brief review examines personal resilience and individual coping strategies, exploring definitions of each, along with their potential relationships to one another. Their potential contributions within a work setting are described.
   METHODS: A literature review was conducted using search terms of resilience, resiliency, personal resilience, coping and resilient coping.
   RESULTS: Coping refers to one's using purposeful actions to handle life situations. Coping techniques can be functional or dysfunctional and the situations one copes with may be acute or long term, severe or minor. Resilience refers to positive and functional handling of oneself and ones' life, referring to the ability to recover, recuperate, and regenerate following tragic events.
   CONCLUSIONS: While coping and resilience are related to one another, they are distinct concepts. Positive coping techniques may contribute to resilience. However, which coping techniques improve resilience, and in what circumstances, are questions for future research.

AB  - The United States, like many nations, continues to experience rapid growth in its racial minority population and is projected to attain so-called majority-minority status by 2050. Along with these demographic changes, staggering racial disparities persist in health, wealth, and overall well-being. In this article, we review the social psychological literature on race and race relations, beginning with the seemingly simple question: What is race? Drawing on research from different fields, we forward a model of race as dynamic, malleable, and socially constructed, shifting across time, place, perceiver, and target. We then use classic theoretical perspectives on intergroup relations to frame and then consider new questions regarding contemporary racial dynamics. We next consider research on racial diversity, focusing on its effects during interpersonal encounters and for groups. We close by highlighting emerging topics that should top the research agenda for the social psychology of race and race relations in the twenty-first century.

AB  - Contamination of soils with heavy metals (HMs) is an important issue due to the contamination of agricultural crops, which are further transferred into the food chain. Phytoremediation is an emerging method of remediating metal-contaminated soils. Sunflower has been widely adopted for phytomanagement of HM-contaminated soils owing to its high biomass production and capacity for metal accumulation. Sunflowers can tolerate the toxic effects of certain HMs through different mechanisms, such as enhancements in antioxidant enzyme activities, deposition in nonactive parts of the plant, and stimulation of osmolytes. Stress caused by HMs affected negatively the seed germination, nutritional status, photosynthesis, and growth of sunflower. However, the responses of sunflowers to this stress vary with cultivar/variety, soil type, metal type, dose, and duration of metal exposure. This review critically summarizes the effects of HMs in sunflowers and examines field-relevant approaches to improve the phytoextraction capability of sunflowers. Proper selection of tolerant cultivars along with agronomic practices may be an effective strategy for the phytomanagement of soils contaminated with HMs.

AB  - Objective: Community treatment orders (CTOs) exist in more than 75 jurisdictions worldwide. This review outlines findings from the international literature on CTO effectiveness.
   Method: The article draws on 2 comprehensive systematic reviews of the literature published before 2013, then uses the same search terms to identify studies published between 2013 and 2015. The focus is on what the literature as a whole tells us about CTO effectiveness, with particular emphasis on the strength and weaknesses of different methodologies.
   Results: The results from more than 50 nonrandomized studies show mixed results. Some show benefits from CTOs while others show none on the most frequently reported outcomes of readmission, time in hospital, and community service use. Results from the 3 existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show no effect of CTOs on a wider range of outcome measures except that patients on CTOs are less likely than controls to be a victim of crime. Patients on CTOs are, however, likely to have their liberty restricted for significantly longer periods of time. Meta-analyses pooling patient data from RCTs and high quality nonrandomized studies also find no evidence of patient benefit, and systematic reviews come to the same conclusion.
   Conclusion: There is no evidence of patient benefit from current CTO outcome studies. This casts doubt over the usefulness and ethics of CTOs. To remove uncertainty, future research must be designed as RCTs.
   Objective: Les ordonnances de traitement en milieu communautaire (OTMC) existent dans plus de 75 administrations du monde entier. Cette revue presente les resultats de la litterature internationale sur l'efficacite des OTMC.
   Methode: L'article puise a deux revues systematiques completes de la litterature publiee avant 2013, puis utilise les memes termes de recherche pour identifier les etudes publiees entre 2013 et 2015. L'accent est mis sur ce que la litterature dans son ensemble nous dit sur l'efficacite des OTMC, en insistant particulierement sur les forces et faiblesses des differentes methodologies.
   Resultats: Les resultats de plus de 50 etudes non randomisees etaient partages. Certains montrent les avantages des OTMC alors que d'autres ne presentent aucun des resultats les plus frequemment observes concernant: la rehospitalisation, le sejour a l'hopital, et l'utilisation des services communautaires. Les resultats des trois essais randomises controles (ERC) existants n'indiquent aucun effet des OTMC sur ces mesures des resultats (ou une gamme plus vaste de mesures), excepte que les patients des OTMC sont moins susceptibles d'etre victimes de criminalite. Les patients des OTMC sont toutefois susceptibles de se voir restreindre leur liberte pour des periodes de temps significativement plus longues. Les meta-analyses regroupant les donnees des patients des ERC, et les etudes non randomisees de grande qualite n'offrent pas non plus de preuves des avantages pour les patients, et les revues systematiques en viennent a la meme conclusion.
   Conclusion: Il n'y a pas de preuves des avantages pour les patients dans les etudes actuelles sur les resultats des OTMC. Cela jette un doute sur l'utilite et l'ethique des OTMC. Pour eliminer l'incertitude, la recherche future doit utiliser la methodologie des ERC.

KW  - Mediterranean
AB  - Temporary streams are characterized by the alternation of dry and wet hydrological phases, creating both a harsh environment for the biota as well as a high diversity of opportunities for adaptation. These systems are mainly microbial-based during several of these hydrological phases, and those growing on all solid substrata (biofilms) accordingly change their physical structure and community composition. Biofilms experience large decreases in cell densities and biomass, both of bacteria and algae, during dryness. Algal and bacterial communities show remarkable decreases in their diversity, at least locally (at the habitat scale). Biofilms also respond with significant physiological plasticity to each of the hydrological changes. The decreasing humidity of the substrata through the drying process, and the changing quantity and quality of organic matter and nutrients available in the stream during that process, causes unequal responses on the biofilm bacteria and algae. Biofilm algae are affected faster than bacteria by the hydric stress, and as a result the ecosystem respiration resists longer than gross primary production to the increasing duration of flow intermittency. This response implies enhancing ecosystem heterotrophy, a pattern that can be exacerbated in temporary streams suffering of longer dry periods under global change.

AB  - Concerns have increased within the medical and social science communities about the replicability of scientific findings, and subsequently, assessments of replicability and proposals for how it may be increased have become more common. Sexual scientists, however, with few exceptions, have yet to formally participate in the published discourses about replicability. In this commentary, I begin by highlighting how replicability is important for science in general, and then arguing that sexual science could be uniquely and negatively impacted without more direct involvement in the replicability movement from those within our field. I then briefly review several mechanisms through which replicability can be undermined in research, and some of the proposals for addressing these issues. I conclude by offering some ideas for how sexual scientists might begin to evaluate and improve the replicability of our field, and stress the need for sexual scientists to add their voices to the ongoing discussions about the problem of replicability of scientific findings.

AB  - Plants incessantly encounter abiotic and biotic stresses that limit their growth and productivity. However, conversely, plant growth can also be induced by treatments with various abiotic and biotic elicitors. Carrageenans are sulfated linear polysaccharides that represent major cellular constituents of seaweeds belonging to red algae (Rhodophyta). Recent research has unraveled the biological activity of carrageenans and of their oligomeric forms, the oligo carrageenans (OCs), as promoters of plant growth and as elicitors of defense responses against pests and diseases. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which carrageenans and OCs mediate plant growth and plant defense responses. Carrageenans and OCs improve plant growth by regulating various metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and ancillary pathways, cell division, purine and pyrimidine synthetic pathways as well as metabolic pathways involved in nitrogen and sulfur assimilation. Carrageenans and OCs also induce plant defense responses against viroids, viruses, bacteria, fungi and insects by modulating the activity of different defense pathways, including salicylate, jasmonate and ethylene signaling pathways. Further studies will likely substantiate the beneficial effects of carrageenans and of OCs on plant growth and plant defense responses and open new avenues for their use in agriculture and horticultural industry.

AB  - There is increasing interest regarding prayer in healthcare. Prayer is an activity related to spirituality and religion. Positive outcomes have been identified regarding spirituality in health. This study aims to investigate the effects on patients' health of using prayer. A systematic literature review was conducted in May 2015 and updated in November 2015. Electronic and international databases were searched and the inclusion criteria were based on PICOS: (Population) patients of any age and any clinical situation, (Intervention) all types of prayer, (Comparison) ordinary care, (Outcomes) any health change, (Study type) randomized clinical trials. Neither timeframe nor limitation in language were considered. A total of 92 papers were identified and 12 were included in the review. Prayer was considered a positive factor in seven studies, and several positive effects of prayer on health were identified: reducing the anxiety of mothers of children with cancer; reducing the level of concern of the participants who believe in a solution to their problem; and providing for the improved physical functioning of patients who believe in prayer. Prayer is a non-pharmacological intervention and resource, and should be included in the nursing holistic care aimed at patients' well-being.

AB  - Many communities are located near multiple sources of pollution, including current and former industrial sites, major roadways, and agricultural operations. Populations in such locations are predominantly low-income, with a large percentage of minorities and non-English speakers. These communities face challenges that can affect the health of their residents, including limited access to health care, a shortage of grocery stores, poor housing quality, and a lack of parks and open spaces. Environmental exposures may interact with social stressors, thereby worsening health outcomes. Age, genetic characteristics, and preexisting health conditions increase the risk of adverse health effects from exposure to pollutants. There are existing approaches for characterizing cumulative exposures, cumulative risks, and cumulative health impacts. Although such approaches have merit, they also have significant constraints. New developments in exposure monitoring, mapping, toxicology, and epidemiology, especially when informed by community participation, have the potential to advance the science on cumulative impacts and to improve decision making.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to amalgamate recommendations from contemporary national reports on healthcare provision and needs of people with intellectual disabilities. The paper combines these with recommendations for undergraduate curricula of medical students from the GMC and Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych).
   Design/methodology/approach - National reports from Mencap, Department of Health, Disability rights commission, NHS Executive, the GMC and RCPsych were searched for relevant recommendations to undergraduate medical education in ID psychiatry. Recommendations were collated and grouped to form a single list for use when planning future curricula or auditing existing teaching.
   Findings - In total, 13 relevant recommendations were identified in nine groups. These included that people with intellectual disabilities and their carers should be involved in the teaching. That teaching should include the ethical, moral and legal obligations and should include the mental capacity act and equality act. Institutional and individual discrimination should be highlighted as a problem and diagnostic overshadowing should be covered.
   Originality/value - This paper has collated in a single document the combined recommendations of multiple reports. These are relevant to medical undergraduate teaching and may also be of use to other undergraduate healthcare courses. They are a useful template for others wishing to examine or benchmark the content of their medical undergraduate ID psychiatry teaching against an amalgamated list.

AB  - Objective: Adjustment to cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) is multifaceted, involving several domains of psychological and social functioning. A substantial increase in research in this area has been evident in recent years, along with a preliminary shift in how adjustment to CL/P is conceptualised and measured. An updated and comprehensive review of the literature is needed in light of the rapidly expanding and changing field.Design: A narrative review of 148 quantitative and qualitative studies published between January 2004 and July 2015.Main outcome measures: Findings are presented according to five key domains of adjustment: Developmental Trajectory, Behaviour, Emotional Well-being, Social Experiences and Satisfaction with Appearance and Treatment. Data pertaining to General Psychological Well-being were also examined.Results: The overall impact of CL/P on psychological adjustment appears to be low. Nonetheless, the review demonstrates the complexity of findings both within and across domains, and highlights recurring methodological challenges.Conclusions: Research findings from the last decade are considered to be largely inconclusive, although some areas of emerging consensus and improvements in the approaches used were identified. Efforts to collect data from large, representative and longitudinal samples, which are comparable across studies and encompassing of the patient perspective, should be doubled.

AB  - Background: The detection of prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) is desirable to test drugs with neuroprotective potential, but will be affected by known disease variations.
   Objective: To assess the prevalence of four key non-motor prodromal PD markers, and evaluate the sensitivity of case detection when non-motor screening tools for prodromal PD are implemented in an early clinical PD cohort.
   Methods: Hyposmia (University of Pennsylvania smell identification test <= 15th centile or Sniffin' Sticks at or <= 10th centile corrected for age and sex), rapid-eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD questionnaire >4), constipation (<1 daily spontaneous bowel motion) and depression (Leeds >6) were recorded in recent onset PD cases, and proposed non-motor screening criteria applied.
   Results: In 1,719 PD cases, mean age 68.6 years (SD 8.1), 65.5% male, mean disease duration 1.3 years (SD 0.9), 72.2% were hyposmic, 43.3% had RBD, 22.1% depression, and 21.5% constipation. 11.6% of cases had no key non-motor features, 38.8% one, 32.1% two, 15.5% three, and 2.0% all four. Increasing numbers of non-motor features were associated with younger age (p = 0.019), higher motor scores (p <0.001), more postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) (p <0.001), greater cognitive impairment (p <0.001) and higher total non-motor burden (p <0.001). Cases with hyposmia alone were younger (p <0.001), had less severe cognitive (p = 0.006) and other non-motor features (p <0.001). All screening criteria selected younger patients (p = 0.001, p <0.001), three of four greater overall non-motor burden (p = 0.005, p <0.001), and inclusion of RBD more cognitive impairment (p = 0.003, p = 0.001) and PIGD (p = 0.004, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Varying sensitivity levels, and age and phenotype selectivity, are found when different non-motor screening methods to detect prodromal PD are applied to an early clinical PD cohort.

AB  - Epidemiological data indicate that infertility is a problem of global proportions, affecting one-fifth of couples trying to conceive worldwide (60-80 mln). According to the trends observed, the problem is predicted to increase by another two million cases annually. In Poland, infertility-related issues are found in about 19% of couples, including 4% with infertility and 15% with limited fertility. Inability to conceive occurs equally in men and women (50%), irrespective of the direct cause. Although it is generally thought that reproductive issues concern women, infertility affects men and women equally. This study is an attempted to systematize knowledge about the role of the male factor in infertility, particularly current knowledge concerning the environmental factors of infertility. For this purpose, the Medline and CINAHL databases and the Cochrane Library was searched for articles published in English during the last 10 years, using the following keywords: infertility, male factor, semen examination and environmental factor of infertility.

AB  - Recent shifts in focus on academic interventions for students diagnosed with emotional and behavioural disorders (EBD) create a need to evaluate existing interventional research in content areas such as mathematics. Literature reviews in the area of mathematics interventions for students with EBD have mostly focused on the outcomes and the rigour of existing studies with limited attention to the quality of the pedagogical methods used in those studies. The purpose of this conceptual review was to use a teaching-for-understanding lens to examine existing research interventions in mathematics for students with EBD. Teaching-mathematics-for-understanding requires pedagogical methods that aim to activate and capture students' mathematical reasoning and thinking. An iterative electronic and hand search of the literature found 30 studies covering three decades (1985-2015) that met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Results of the analysis include: (1) mathematics assessments utilised ranged from very basic to comprehensive, with most studies applying basic assessments; (2) a majority of the studies focused on intervention strategies targeting procedural and rote knowledge; (3) most studies utilised quantitative inquiry methods; and (4) in more recent years, studies have increasingly examined conceptual mathematical understanding and incorporated qualitative inquiry methods.

AB  - Neurofeedback, one of the primary examples of self-regulation, designates a collection of techniques that train the brain and help to improve its function. Since coming on the scene in the 1960s, electroencephalography-neurofeedback has become a treatment vehicle for a host of mental disorders; however, its clinical effectiveness remains controversial. Modern imaging technologies of the living human brain (e.g., real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging) and increasingly rigorous research protocols that utilize such methodologies begin to shed light on the underlying mechanisms that may facilitate more effective clinical applications. In this paper we focus on recent technological advances in the field of human brain imaging and discuss how these modem methods may influence the field of neurofeedback. Toward this end, we outline the state of the evidence and sketch out future directions to further explore the potential merits of this contentious therapeutic prospect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Positive development models shift focus for intervention from avoiding problems, deficits, or psychopathology to promoting skills, assets, and psychological well-being as the critical interests in development and intervention. The field can be characterized as multiple parallel lines of empirical inquiry from four frameworks: Social Competence, Social and Emotional Learning, Positive Youth Development, and Positive Psychology. This review is meant to organize understanding of implications for intervention by comparing these four frameworks along several dimensions including (1) key conceptual frameworks and constructs, (2) populations of interest, (3) measurement practices, and (4) intervention design and content implications to point out areas of overlap and distinction. Furthermore, the authors provide suggestions for the advancement beyond isolated scientific inquiry and unclear overlap and distinction, toward a more integrated approach to study and intervention design that promotes positive development.

AB  - Recently, a range of novel and cost-effective engineered wetland technologies for decentralization practices of domestic wastewater treatment have been developed with ecological process modification, the use of functionalized plants, and advanced biofilm formation. However, selecting the one that can be more appreciated for on-site sanitation is still uncertain. This paper reviews the role of plants, media materials, microorganisms, and oxygen transfer in domestic wastewater purification through constructed wetlands (CWs). The effectiveness of traditional and recently developed CWs and the necessity of an induced biofilm attachment surface (BAS) in these systems for the treatment of domestic sewage are presented. This review also elucidates the idea of CWs for domestic wastewater characteristics highly stressed by total dissolved solids and the adaptive strategies in mitigating the cold climate impacts on their efficiencies. Further research needed to enhance the stability and sustainability of CWs is highlighted. By a more advanced investigation, BAS CWs can be specified as an ideal treatment process in decentralization.

There is little consensus on the most appropriate interventions for MSDs. Our objective was to update a systematic review of workplace-based interventions for preventing and managing upper extremity MSD (UEMSD). We followed a systematic review process developed by the Institute for Work & Health and an adapted best evidence synthesis. 6 electronic databases were searched (January 2008 until April 2013 inclusive) yielding 9909 non-duplicate references. 26 high-quality and medium-quality studies relevant to our research question were combined with 35 from the original review to synthesise the evidence on 30 different intervention categories. There was strong evidence for one intervention category, resistance training, leading to the recommendation: Implementing a workplace-based resistance training exercise programme can help prevent and manage UEMSD and symptoms. The synthesis also revealed moderate evidence for stretching programmes, mouse use feedback and forearm supports in preventing UEMSD or symptoms. There was also moderate evidence for no benefit for EMG biofeedback, job stress management training, and office workstation adjustment for UEMSD and symptoms. Messages are proposed for both these and other intervention categories.

AB  - Preterm birth is an evolving challenge in neonatal health care. Despite declining mortality rates among extremely premature neonates, morbidity rates remain very high. Currently, perinatal diffuse white matter injury (WMI) is the most commonly observed type of brain injury in preterm infants and has become an important research area. Diffuse WMI is associated with impaired cognitive, sensory and psychological functioning and is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for autism-spectrum disorders, ADHD, and other psychological disturbances. No treatment options are currently available for diffuse WMI and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are far from being completely understood. Preterm birth is associated with maternal inflammation, perinatal infections and disrupted oxygen supply which can affect the cerebral microenvironment by causing activation of microglia, astrogliosis, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. This intricate interplay of events negatively influences oligodendrocyte development, causing arrested oligodendrocyte maturation or oligodendrocyte cell death, which ultimately results in myelination failure in the developing white matter. This review discusses the current state in perinatal WMI research, ranging from a clinical perspective to basic molecular pathophysiology. The complex regulation of oligodendrocyte development in healthy and pathological conditions is described, with a specific focus on signaling cascades that may play a role in WMI. Furthermore, emerging concepts in the field of WMI and issues regarding currently available animal models are put forward. Novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying impeded oligodendrocyte maturation in diffuse WMI may aid the development of novel treatment options which are desperately needed to improve the quality-of-life of preterm neonates.

AB  - Until recently, most studies investigating the acute relationships between affective and physical feeling states and physical activity were conducted in controlled laboratory settings, whose results might not translate well to everyday life. This review was among the first attempts to synthesize current evidence on the acute (e.g., within a few hours) relationships between affective and physical feeling states and physical activity from studies conducted in free-living, naturalistic settings in non-clinical populations. A systematic literature search yielded 14 eligible studies for review. Six studies tested the relationship between affective states and subsequent physical activity; findings from these studies suggest that positive affective states were positively associated with physical activity over the next few hours while negative affective states had no significant association. Twelve studies tested affective states after physical activity and yielded consistent evidence for physical activity predicting higher positive affect over the next few hours. Further, there was some evidence that physical activity was followed by a higher level of energetic feelings in the next few hours. The evidence for physical activity reducing negative affect in the next few hours was inconsistent and inconclusive. Future research in this area should consider recruiting more representative study participants, utilizing higher methodological standards for assessment (i.e., electronic devices combined with accelerometry), reporting patterns of missing data, and investigating pertinent moderators and mediators (e.g., social and physical context, intensity, psychological variables). Knowledge gained from this topic could offer valuable insights for promoting daily physical activity adoption and maintenance in non-clinical populations.

KW  - Systematic review
AB  - AIM: To examine and compare the effects of subjective and objective social isolation on behavioral health in elderly adults.
   METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed was performed for original research articles from peer-reviewed journals examining one of the following topics: "Social isolation and sleep disturbance", "social isolation and depression", or "social isolation and fatigue in older adults". Studies were selected following the criteria established based on the aim of this review. Data were extracted from the articles by two independent reviewers. Due to the heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures of the included studies, qualitative and narrative analyses were conducted.
   RESULTS: The set criteria were used to select a total of 16 studies for the review. Of the 16, 13 were cross-sectional studies. The characteristics of study populations were identified as follows. A total of 12 studies randomly selected subjects irrespective of pre-existing health conditions. Consequently, an unspecified number of the study subjects had chronic diseases in the studies compared. In addition, cultural and ethnic backgrounds of studies in this review were diverse, and included subjects living in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Both subjective and objective types of social isolation increased behavioral symptoms, such as sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and fatigue in older adults. Furthermore, a few recent studies reported stronger effects of subjective social isolation than objective social isolation on sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms.
   CONCLUSION: Social isolation affects behavioral health in older adults. Compared to the objective social isolation, subjective social isolation contributes more significantly to sleep disturbance and depression.

AB  - Patients with chronic inflammation are often associated with the emergence of depression symptoms, while diagnosed depressed patients show increased levels of circulating cytokines. Further studies revealed the activation of the brain immune cell microglia in depressed patients with a greater magnitude in individuals that committed suicide, indicating a crucial role for neuroinflammation in depression brain pathogenesis. Rapid advances in the understanding of microglial and astrocytic neurobiology were obtained in the past 15-20 years. Indeed, recent data reveal that microglia play an important role in managing neuronal cell death, neurogenesis, and synaptic interactions, besides their involvement in immune-response generating cytokines. The communication between microglia and neurons is essential to synchronize these diverse functions with brain activity. Evidence is accumulating that secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), comprising ectosomes and exosomes with a size ranging from 0.1-1 mu m, are key players in intercellular signaling. These EVs may carry specific proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs). Transfer of exosomes to neurons was shown to be mediated by oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes that may either be supportive to neurons, or instead disseminate the disease. Interestingly, several recent reports have identified changes in miRNAs in depressed patients, which target not only crucial pathways associated with synaptic plasticity, learning and memory but also the production of neurotrophic factors and immune cell modulation. In this article, we discuss the role of neuroinflammation in the emergence of depression, namely dynamic alterations in the status of microglia response to stimulation, and how their activation phenotypes may have an etiological role in neurodegeneneration, in particular in depressive-like behavior. We will overview the involvement of miRNAs, exosomes, ectosomes and microglia in regulating critical pathways associated with depression and how they may contribute to other brain disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which share several neuroinflammatory-associated processes. Specific reference will be made to EVs as potential biomarkers and disease monitoring approaches, focusing on their potentialities as drug delivery vehicles, and on putative therapeutic strategies using autologous exosome-based delivery systems to treat neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Since the discovery of the phosphorylation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) about four decades ago, much effort has been made to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of this post-translational modification. In the field of neuroscience, rpS6 phosphorylation is commonly used as a readout of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling activation or as a marker for neuronal activity. Nevertheless, its biological role in neurons still remains puzzling. Here we review the pharmacological and physiological stimuli regulating this modification in the nervous system as well as the pathways that transduce these signals into rpS6 phosphorylation. Altered rpS6 phosphorylation observed in various genetic and pathophysiological mouse models is also discussed. Finally, we examine the current state of knowledge on the physiological role of this post-translational modification and highlight the questions that remain to be addressed.

AB  - Air pollution has become a major environmental risk as far as public health is concerned. It has been proposed that reduction in levels of air pollution may result in lessening of the global burden of disease. Monitoring and management of air pollution has been carried out for a long time. However, the causes of air pollution and effects of air pollution on humans, animals, and plants are yet to be fully unraveled. Moreover, management of air pollution is facing challenges due to lack of availability of suitable tools and techniques. The latter half of the 19th century was dominated by research on the recognition and description of different pollutants and to some extent toward the search for tools and techniques to control and reduce air pollution. One of the major air pollutants is atmospheric particulate matter. Resuspended roadside dust is one of the sources of these particulate matters. Resuspended dust is composed of several elements from different sources. The elemental composition of these dust particulates varies with their size and the size sometimes is dependent on the sources. The atmospheric dust particles find their way onto the surfaces of leaves on the roadside either under gravity or via impaction due to wind. Assessment of the elemental distribution in dust adsorbed over leaves as well as in the leaf tissues makes plants as suitable biomonitor of air pollution. Moreover, physiological alterations in plants also can indicate the level of pollution in the respective areas. Hence plants can be used as biomonitors and bioindicators of air pollution. Dust interception capacities of plants can be exploited to use them as sinks for atmospheric particulate pollutants. Literatures available on these aspects are reviewed and the highlights are depicted in this review paper. This review report has five groups (i.e., reports) on worsening air quality around the world, studies on dust interception capacity of plants, physiological alterations in plants in response to dust load, elemental distribution in different environmental samples (ambient air, dust from plant canopies, roadside dust and plant tissues), and elemental and mineralogical profiling of urban dust particulates with respect to size distribution.

AB  - Synesthesia is a phenomenon in which additional perceptual experiences are elicited by sensory stimuli or cognitive concepts. Synesthetes possess a unique type of phenomenal experiences not directly triggered by sensory stimulation. Therefore, for better understanding of consciousness it is relevant to identify the mental and physiological processes that subserve synesthetic experience. In the present work we suggest several reasons why synesthesia has merit for research on consciousness. We first review the research on the dynamic and rapidly growing field of the studies of synesthesia. We particularly draw attention to the role of semantics in synesthesia, which is important for establishing synesthetic associations in the brain. We then propose that the interplay between semantics and sensory input in synesthesia can be helpful for the study of the neural correlates of consciousness, especially when making use of ambiguous stimuli for inducing synesthesia. Finally, synesthesia-related alterations of brain networks and functional connectivity can be of merit for the study of consciousness.

AB  - Anthropogenic stressors including acid deposition, invasive species, and calcium (Ca) decline have produced widespread damage to Canadian Shield lakes, especially to their zooplankton communities. Here, we review current knowledge on the individual effects on zooplankton by the non-indigenous predator Bythotrephes longimanus and Ca decline; we identify knowledge gaps in this literature and examine the likely interactive impacts of Bythotrephes invasions and Ca decline on zooplankton. The negative impacts of Bythotrephes longimanus on zooplankton communities are well known, whereas current understanding of the effects of declining Ca on zooplankton is restricted to Daphnia spp.; hence, there is a large knowledge gap on how declining Ca may affect zooplankton communities in general. The co-occurring impacts of Bythotrephes and declining Ca have rarely been studied at the species level, and we expect daphniids, particularly Daphnia retrocurva and Daphnia pulicaria, to be the most sensitive to both stressors. We also expect a synergistic negative interaction on cladocerans in lakes with both stressors, leaving a community dominated by Holopedium glacialis and (or) copepods. Our predictions form testable hypotheses but since species and ecosystem response to multiple stressors are difficult to predict, we may actually see ecological surprises in Canadian Shield lakes as Bythotrephes continues to spread and Ca levels continue to fall.

AB  - People with alcohol and substance use disorders (AUDs/SUDs) show worse facial emotion recognition (FER) than controls, though magnitude and potential moderators remain unknown.
   The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the association between AUDs, SUDs and FER impairment. Electronic databases were searched through April 2015. Pooled analyses were based on standardized mean differences between index and control groups with 95% confidence intervals, weighting each study with random effects inverse variance models. Risk of publication bias and role of potential moderators, including task type, were explored. Nineteen of 70 studies assessed for eligibility met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1352 individuals, of whom 714 (53%) had AUDs or SUDs. The association between substance related disorders and FER performance showed an effect size of -0.67 (-0.95, -0.39), and -0.65 (-0.93, -0.37) for AUDs and SUDs, respectively. There was no publication bias and subgroup and sensitivity analyses based on potential moderators confirmed core results. Future longitudinal research should confirm these findings, clarifying the role of specific clinical issues of AUDs and SUDs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is evidence of cognitive impairment that persists in the remission phase of bipolar disorder; however, the extent of the deficits that occur from the first onset of the disorder remains unclear. This is the first systematic review on cognitive functioning in the early stages of bipolar I disorder. The aim of the study was to identify the patterns and degree of cognitive impairment that exists from first-episode mania. Three electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed) were systematically searched for studies published from January 1980 to June 2014. Eligible studies were separated into two groups: acute and remission. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was utilised to measure the quality of the included studies. A total of seven studies (three acute and four remission), including 230 first-episode mania and 345 healthy control participants, were eligible for the review. The studies in the acute phase only examined aspects of executive functioning, with impairments identified in cognitive flexibility, though not in response inhibition and verbal fluency relative to healthy controls. The most consistent finding during the remission phase was a deficit in working memory, whereas in the other domains, the findings were equivocal. Non-verbal memory and verbal fluency were not impacted in remission from first-episode mania. In conclusion, deficits are present in some but not all areas of cognitive functioning during the early stages of bipolar I disorder. Further research is warranted to understand the longitudinal trajectory of change from first-episode mania.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to identify mental-health-relevant literature accessible to policy makers and healthcare workers in the island nations of the Western Pacific.
   Methods: Material collated to support the inaugural Leadership in Mental Health: Island Nations course held in Cairns in May 2015 was used as the basis of a "rapid review".
   Results: The rapid review considered 303 documents identified by a search carried out using James Cook University's OneSearch, Google Scholar, and the authors' knowledge. Search terms included mental health and the like, and terms with Pacific and current Pacific island country names. Findings were classified by region/country, year of release/publication, mental health issue addressed, peer-reviewed or grey literature, and type of study. Almost half of the findings had been released in the previous five years. However, only 36% were peer-reviewed publications and only 3.6% of the findings were intervention studies.
   Conclusions: There is limited easily accessible documentation to confidently direct practice or policies regarding which strategies are likely to be effective in responding to the high rates of mental ill-health experienced in the Pacific island nations, or to plan for increases as a consequence of rapid social and demographic changes that are transforming Pacific island societies.

AB  - Understanding how populations adapt to constantly changing environments requires approaches drawn from integrative and evolutionary biology as well as population ecology. Timing of reproduction and migration reflect seasonal pulses in resources, are driven by day length, and are also responsive to environmental cues that change with climate. Researchers focusing on birds have discovered accelerated breeding, reductions in migration, and extensive variation in perception, transduction, and response to the environment. We consider situations in which individuals experience the same environment but differ in the timing of the annual cycle. Such scenarios provide exceptional opportunities to study mechanisms related to among-population differences in timing (allochrony) and distribution (sympatry-allopatry-heteropatry), which have the potential either to enhance or reduce population divergence and biodiversity.

AB  - Humans and ecosystems are exposed to highly variable and unknown cocktail of chemicals and radiations. Although individual chemicals are typically present at low concentrations, they can interact with each other resulting in additive or potentially synergistic mixture effects. This was also observed with products obtained by radiation actions such as sunlight or electromagnetic fields that can change the effects of chemicals, such as pesticides, and metal trace elements on health. Concomitant presence of various pesticides and their transformation products adds further complexity to chemical risk assessment since chronic inflammation is a key step for cancer promotion. Degradation of a parent molecule can produce several by-products which can trigger various toxic effects with different impacts on health and environment. For instance, the cocktail of sunlight irradiated sulcotrione pesticide has a greater cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than parent molecule, sulcotrione, and questions about the impact of photochemical process on environment. Adjuvants were shown to modify the biological features of pesticides. Addition of other elements, metals or biological products, can differently enhance cell toxicity of pesticides or electromagnetic radiations suggesting a synergy in living organisms. Electromagnetic fields spreading, pesticide by-products and mixtures monitoring become greater for environmental contamination evaluations.

In this article, we address the impact of science and pseudoscience on psychotherapy in psychiatric practice. We describe the key principles of evidence-based intervention. We describe pseudoscience and provide illustrative examples of popular intervention practices that have not been abandoned, despite evidence that they are not efficacious and may be harmful. We distinguish efficacy from effectiveness, and describe modular approaches to treatment. Reasons for the persistence of practices that are not evidence based are examined at both the individual and the professional system level. Finally, we offer suggestions for the promotion of EBP through clinical practice guidelines, modelling of scientific decision making, and training in core skills.

AB  - Mental health is essential for functioning, general health, and quality of life in low and middle-income countries (LAMICs), as for high-income countries. This study aimed first to search in the English language peer-reviewed literature for reviews of mental health promotion interventions in the Asia-Pacific region. A global rapid review by Barry and colleagues indicated a paucity of publications on this topic in the peer-reviewed literature. The second aim of the study followed from this observation. Two systematic reviews of English language literature were conducted as case studies in two countries with known interest in mental health promotion, Thailand and China. The reviews covered publications in peer-reviewed journals and the grey literature. In Thailand, the review demonstrated: strong evidence for an empowerment program for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected mothers; a reduction in HIV-related stigma in a community-based program; and a coping program for adolescents. The second review concerned suicide prevention interventions in China. It found one relevant study, a WHO multi-site study of suicide prevention. We found surprisingly little evidence in either country of interventions focused on health equity or modifying the social determinants of mental health. We agree with Barry and colleagues that there is an urgent need to invest in the policy, practice, and research capacity for mental health promotion in LAMICs so that mental health promotion can be incorporated into the wider health promotion and global health development agenda. This includes the Global Action for Health Equity Network. Evidence-based interventions in parenting, schools, workplaces, and among older people can be initiated or adapted and evaluated in LAMIC settings.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a gasotransmitter that impacts fundamental aspects of neuronal function in large measure through S-nitrosylation, a redox reaction that occurs on regulatory cysteine thiol groups. For instance, S-nitrosylation regulates enzymatic activity of target proteins via inhibition of active site cysteine residues or via allosteric regulation of protein structure. During normal brain function, protein S-nitrosylation serves as an important cellular mechanism that modulates a diverse array of physiological processes, including transcriptional activity, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival. In contrast, emerging evidence suggests that aging and disease-linked environmental risk factors exacerbate nitrosative stress via excessive production of NO. Consequently, aberrant S-nitrosylation occurs and represents a common pathological feature that contributes to the onset and progression of multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. In the current review, we highlight recent key findings on aberrant protein S-nitrosylation showing that this reaction triggers protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional dysregulation, synaptic damage, and neuronal injury. Specifically, we discuss the pathological consequences of S-nitrosylated parkin, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) under neurodegenerative conditions. We also speculate that intervention to prevent these aberrant S-nitrosylation events may produce novel therapeutic agents to combat neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The older patient population is growing rapidly around the world and in the USA. Almost half of seniors over age 65 who live at home are dissatisfied with their sleep, and nearly two-thirds of those residing in nursing home facilities suffer from sleep disorders. Chronic and pervasive sleep complaints and disturbances are frequently associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and may result in impaired cognition, diminished intellect, poor memory, confusion, and psychomotor retardation all of which may be misinterpreted as dementia. The key sleep disorders impacting patients with dementia include insomnia, hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm misalignment, sleep disordered breathing, motor disturbances of sleep such as periodic leg movement disorder of sleep and restless leg syndrome, and parasomnias, mostly in the form of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). RBD is a pre-clinical marker for a class of neurodegenerative diseases, the "synucleinopathies", and requires formal polysomnographic evaluation. Untreated sleep disorders may exacerbate cognitive and behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia and are a source of considerable stress for bed partners and family members. When left untreated, sleep disturbances may also increase the risk of injury at night, compromise health-related quality of life, and precipitate and accelerate social and economic burdens for caregivers.

AB  - AimTo conduct a systematic review of parent and family factors associated with service use for young people with mental health problems, to inform early intervention efforts aimed at increasing service use by young people.
   MethodsA systematic search of academic databases was performed. Articles were included in the review if they had: a sample of young people aged between 5 and 18 years; service use as the outcome measure; one or more parental or family variables as a predictor; and a comparison group of non-service using young people with mental health problems. In order to focus on factors additional to need, the mental health symptoms of the young person also had to be controlled for. Stouffer's method of combining P-values was used to draw conclusions as to whether or not associations between variables were reliable.
   ResultsTwenty-eight articles were identified investigating 15 parental or family factors, 7 of which were found to be associated with service use for a young person with mental health needs: parental burden, parent problem perception, parent perception of need, parent psychopathology, single-parent household, change in family structure and being from the dominant ethnic group for the United States specifically. Factors not found to be related to service use were: family history of service use, parent-child relationship quality, family functioning, number of children, parent education level, parent employment status, household income and non-urban location of residence.
   ConclusionsA number of family-related factors were identified that can inform effective interventions aimed at early intervention for mental health problems. Areas requiring further research were also identified.

AB  - The 'informational content' of Earth's electromagnetic signaling is like a set of operating instructions for human life. These environmental cues are dynamic and involve exquisitely low inputs (intensities) of critical frequencies with which all life on Earth evolved. Circadian and other temporal biological rhythms depend on these fluctuating electromagnetic inputs to direct gene expression, cell communication and metabolism, neural development, brainwave activity, neural synchrony, a diversity of immune functions, sleep and wake cycles, behavior and cognition. Oscillation is also a universal phenomenon, and biological systems of the heart, brain and gut are dependent on the cooperative actions of cells that function according to principles of non-linear, coupled biological oscillations for their synchrony. They are dependent on exquisitely timed cues from the environment at vanishingly small levels. Altered 'informational content' of environmental cues can swamp natural electromagnetic cues and result in dysregulation of normal biological rhythms that direct growth, development, metabolism and repair mechanisms. Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) and radiofrequency radiation (RFR) can have the devastating biological effects of disrupting homeostasis and desynchronizing normal biological rhythms that maintain health. Non-linear, weak field biological oscillations govern body electrophysiology, organize cell and tissue functions and maintain organ systems. Artificial bioelectrical interference can give false information (disruptive signaling) sufficient to affect critical pacemaker cells (of the heart, gut and brain) and desynchronize functions of these important cells that orchestrate function and maintain health. Chronic physiological stress undermines homeostasis whether it is chemically induced or electromagnetically induced (or both exposures are simultaneous contributors). This can eventually break down adaptive biological responses critical to health maintenance; and resilience can be compromised. Electrohyper-sensitivity can be caused by successive assaults on human bioelectrochemical dynamics from exogenous electromagnetic fields (EMF) and RFR or a single acute exposure. Once sensitized, further exposures are widely reported to cause reactivity to lower and lower intensities of EMF/RFR, at which point thousand-fold lower levels can cause adverse health impacts to the electrosensitive person. Electrohy-persensitivity (EHS) can be a precursor to, or linked with, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) based on reports of individuals who first develop one condition, then rapidly develop the other. Similarity of chemical biomarkers is seen in both conditions [histamines, markers of oxidative stress, auto-antibodies, heat shock protein (HSP), melatonin markers and leakage of the blood-brain barrier]. Low intensity pulsed microwave activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) is postulated as a mechanism of action for non-thermal health effects.

AB  - Objective: Traumatic brain injury and stroke are among the leading causes of neurological disability worldwide. Although dopaminergic agents have long been associated with improvement of neuropsychiatric outcomes, to date much of the evidence to date has been in case reports and case series or open label trials.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review of double-blinded randomised controlled trials (RCT) to determine the effect of dopaminergic agents on pre-defined outcomes of (a) apathy; (b) psychomotor retardation; (c) behavioural management and (d) cognitive function. Databases searched were: Medline, EMBASE, and PsychInfo for human studies. The Cochrane Clinical Trials Database and the TRIP Medical database were also searched. All identified studies, were further hand-searched.
   Results: We identified six studies providing data on 227 participants, 150 of whom received dopaminergic therapy. Trials were compromised by cross-over design, inadequate wash out period, small numbers and heterogeneous outcome measures. However one good quality RCT demonstrates the efficacy of amantadine in behavioural management. One further RCT shows methylphenidate-levodopa is efficacious for mood post-stroke. One study shows rotigotine to improve hemi-inattention caused by prefrontal damage.
   Conclusion: Our systematic review demonstrates an evolving evidence base to suggest some benefits in agitation and aggression, mood and attentional deficits. However, there are key limitations of the studies undertaken to date involving small numbers of participants, heterogeneous outcome measures, and variable study designs. There is a need for on-going large prospective double-blind RCTs in these medications using standardised criteria and outcomes to fully understand their effectiveness in this patient group.

AB  - Background The epidemiological transition calls for redefining the roles of the various professionals involved in primary health care towards greater collaboration. We aimed to identify facilitators of, and barriers to, interprofessional collaboration in primary health care as perceived by the actors involved, other than nurses.
   Methods Systematic review using synthetic thematic analysis of qualitative research. Articles were retrieved from Medline, Web of science, Psychinfo and The Cochrane library up to July 2013. Quality and relevance of the studies were assessed according to the Dixon-Woods criteria. The following stakeholders were targeted: general practitioners, pharmacists, mental health workers, midwives, physiotherapists, social workers and receptionists.
   Results Forty-four articles were included. The principal facilitator of interprofessional collaboration in primary care was the different actors' common interest in collaboration, perceiving opportunities to improve quality of care and to develop new professional fields. The main barriers were the challenges of definition and awareness of one another's roles and competences, shared information, confidentiality and responsibility, team building and interprofessional training, long-term funding and joint monitoring.
   Conclusions Interprofessional organization and training based on appropriate models should support collaboration development. The active participation of the patient is required to go beyond professional boundaries and hierarchies. Multidisciplinary research projects are recommended.

AB  - In this review, we examine the importance of having a body as essential for the brain to transfer information about the outside world to generate appropriate motor responses. We discuss the context-dependent conditioning of the motor control neural circuits and its dependence on the completion of feedback loops, which is in close agreement with the insights of Hebb and colleagues, who have stressed that for learning to occur the body must be intact and able to interact with the outside world. Finally, we apply information theory to data from published studies to evaluate the robustness of the neuronal signals obtained by bypassing the body (as used for brain-machine interfaces) versus via the body to move in the world. We show that recording from a group of neurons that bypasses the body exhibits a vastly degraded level of transfer of information as compared to that of an entire brain using the body to engage in the normal execution of behaviour. We conclude that body sensations provide more than just feedback for movements; they sustain the necessary transfer of information as animals explore their environment, thereby creating associations through learning. This work has implications for the development of brain-machine interfaces used to move external devices.

AB  - Macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) are two important subtypes of autophagy that play a critical role in cellular quality control under physiological and pathological conditions. Despite the marked differences between these two autophagic pathways, macroautophagy and CMA are intimately connected with each other during the autophagy-lysosomal degradation process, in particular, in the setting of neurological illness. Macroautophagy serves as a backup mechanism to removal of malfunctioning proteins (i.e., aberrant alpha-synuclein) from the cytoplasm when CMA is compromised, and vice versa. The molecular mechanisms underlying the conversation between macroautophagy and CMA are being clarified. Herein, we survey current overviews concentrating on the complex interactions between macroautophagy and CMA, and present therapeutic potentials through utilization and manipulation of macroautophagy-CMA crosstalk in the treatment of neurological diseases.

AB  - The global burden of disorders has shifted from infectious disease to non-communicable diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Whereas infectious disease can sometimes be combated by targeting single causal mechanisms, such as prevention of contact-spread illness by handwashing, in the case of mental disorders multiple causal mechanisms are typically relevant. The emergent field of global mental health has emphasized the magnitude of the treatment gap, particularly in the low- and middle-income world and has paid particular attention to upstream causal factors, for example, poverty, inequality, and gender discrimination in the pathogenesis of mental disorders. However, this field has also been criticized for relying erroneously on Western paradigms of mental illness, which may not be relevant or appropriate to the low- and middle-income context. Here, it is important to steer a path between scientism and skepticism. Scientism regards mental disorders as essential categories, and takes a covering law approach to causality; skepticism regards mental disorders as merely social constructions and emphasizes the role of political power in causal relations. We propose an integrative model that emphasizes the contribution of a broad range of causal mechanisms operating at biological and societal levels to mental disorders and the consequent importance of broad spectrum and multipronged approaches to intervention.

AB  - Background: Social networks of patients with psychosis can provide social support, and improve health and social outcomes, including quality of life. However, patients with psychosis often live rather isolated with very limited social networks. Evidence for interventions targeting symptoms or social skills, are largely unsuccessful at improving social networks indirectly. As an alternative, interventions may directly focus on expanding networks. In this systematic review, we assessed what interventions have previously been tested for this and to what extent they have been effective.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted of randomised controlled trials, testing psychosocial interventions designed to directly increase the social networks of patients with psychosis. Searches of five online databases (PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Database, MEDLINE, Embase), hand searching of grey literature, and both forward and backward snowballing of key papers were conducted and completed on 12 December 2014. Trial reports were included if they were written in English, the social network size was the primary outcome, participants were >= 18 years old and diagnosed with a psychotic disorder.
   Results: Five studies (n = 631 patients) met the complete inclusion criteria. Studies were from different countries and published since 2008. Four trials had significant positive results, i.e. an observable increase in patients' social network size at the end of the intervention. The interventions included: guided peer support, a volunteer partner scheme, supported engagement in social activity, dog-assisted integrative psychological therapy and psychosocial skills training. Other important elements featured were the presence of a professional, and a focus on friendships and peers outside of services and the immediate family.
   Conclusions: Despite the small number and heterogeneity of included studies, the results suggest that interventions directly targeting social isolation can be effective and achieve a meaningful increase in patients' networks. Thus, although limited, the existing evidence is encouraging, and the range of interventions used in the reported trials leave various options for future research and further improvements. Future research is needed to test the findings in different settings, identify which components are particularly effective, and determine to what extent the increased networks, over time, impact on patients' symptoms and quality of life.

AB  - It has become almost a rule that the birth of scientific psychiatry and what we today term clinical psychology took place in the short period between the last decade of the XVIII century and the 1820s. Everything that happened before that period every description, diagnosis, and therapy-has been considered "pre-scientific," outdated, in a way worthless. In this paper, however, I am providing the argument that, first, the roots of contemporary psychiatry reach at least to England of the early modern period, and that, second, it may still turn out that in the field of mental health care historical continuities are more numerous and persistent than discontinuities. Thus, I briefly review the most important surviving documents about the treatment of mental disorders in England of Elizabethan and Jacobian period, organizing the argument around the well-known markers: diagnostics and etiology, therapy, organization of the asylum, the public image of the mentally ill.

AB  - Percussion makes a vital link between the activities of early human ancestors and other animals in tool-use and tool-making. Far more of the early human actions are preserved as archaeology, since the percussion was largely used for making hard tools of stone, rather than for direct access to food. Both primate tools and early hominin tools, however, offer a means to exploring variability in material culture, a strong focus of interest in recent primate studies. This paper charts such variability in the Acheulean, the longest-lasting tool tradition, extant form about 1.7 to about 0.1 Ma, and well known for its characteristic handaxes. The paper concentrates on the African record, although the Acheulean was also known in Europe and Asia. It uses principal components and discriminant analysis to examine the measurements from 66 assemblages (whole toolkits), and from 18 sets of handaxes. Its review of evidence confirms that there is deep-seated pattern in the variation, with variability within a site complex often matching or exceeding that between sites far distant in space and time. Current techniques of study allow comparisons of handaxes far more easily than for other components, stressing a need to develop common practice in measurement and analysis. The data suggest, however, that a higher proportion of traits recurs widely in Acheulean toolkits than in the chimpanzee record.

AB  - Background: Mental health literacy has received increasing attention as a useful strategy to promote early identification of mental disorders, reduce stigma and enhance help-seeking behaviors. However, despite the abundance of research on mental health literacy interventions, there is the absence of evaluations of current available mental health literacy measures and related psychometrics. We conducted a scoping review to bridge the gap.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and ERIC for relevant studies. We only focused on quantitative studies and English publications, however, we didn't limit study participants, locations, or publication dates. We excluded non-English studies, and did not check the grey literature (non peer-reviewed publications or documents of any type) and therefore may have missed some eligible measures.
   Results: We located 401 studies that include 69 knowledge measures (14 validated), 111 stigma measures (65 validated), and 35 help-seeking related measures (10 validated). Knowledge measures mainly investigated the ability of illness identification, and factual knowledge of mental disorders such as terminology, etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and consequences. Stigma measures include those focused on stigma against mental illness or the mentally ill; self-stigma; experienced stigma; and stigma against mental health treatment and help-seeking. Help-seeking measures included those of help-seeking attitudes, intentions to seek help, and actual help-seeking behaviors.
   Conclusions: Our review provides a compendium of available mental health literacy measures to facilitate applying existing measures or developing new measures. It also provides a solid database for future research on systematically assessing the quality of the included measures.

AB  - Seagrass ecosystems represent a global marine resource that is declining across its range. To halt degradation and promote recovery over large scales, management requires a radical change in emphasis and application that seeks to enhance seagrass ecosystem resilience. In this review we examine how the resilience of seagrass ecosystems is becoming compromised by a range of local to global stressors, resulting in ecological regime shifts that undermine the long-term viability of these productive ecosystems. To examine regime shifts and the management actions that can influence this phenomenon we present a conceptual model of resilience in seagrass ecosystems. The model is founded on a series of features and modifiers that act as interacting influences upon seagass ecosystem resilience. Improved understanding and appreciation of the factors and modifiers that govern resilience in seagrass ecosystems can be utilised to support much needed evidence based management of a vital natural resource.

AB  - Alpha-synuclein is a predominant player in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease. However, despite extensive study for two decades, its physiological and pathological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Alpha-synuclein forms a perplexing web of interactions with lipids, trafficking machinery, and other regulatory factors. One emerging consensus is that synaptic vesicles are likely the functional site for alpha-synuclein, where it appears to facilitate vesicle docking and fusion. On the other hand, the dysfunctions of alpha-synuclein are more dispersed and numerous: when mutated or over-expressed, alpha-synuclein affects several membrane trafficking and stress pathways, including exocytosis, ER-to-Golgi transport, ER stress, Golgi homeostasis, endocytosis, autophagy, oxidative stress, and others. Here we examine recent developments in alpha-synuclein's toxicity in the early secretory pathway placed in the context of emerging themes from other affected pathways to help illuminate its underlying pathogenic mechanisms in neurodegeneration.

AB  - The delivery of psychiatric care via video-teleconferencing (VTC) technology is thought to have reached a tipping point. As a medical speciality with relatively few material or technical requirements for service delivery, psychiatry has been one of the earliest to embrace the possibility of providing evaluations and treatment at a distance. Such technical infrastructure as is necessary can often be found in the institutions already in existence. It was natural therefore that institutionally based telepsychiatry would lay the foundation for the development of the field. In this article we review the history and development of institutional VTC in a wide variety of clinically supervised settings such as hospitals, outpatient clinics, and forensic settings. We cite evidence supporting institutionally sponsored use and expand on key takeaways for the development and expansion of videoconferencing in these settings. We also speculate on the future direction and development of psychiatric care provided by these arrangements.

AB  - We have reached a critical convergence in psychiatry between the changing systems of health care structure and funding, our evolution into a technology-based society, and growth in the science and delivery of psychiatric treatments. Fostered by this convergence is the maturation over the past two decades of telepsychiatry, in the form of live interactive video conferencing, as a critical tool to improve access, increase quality and reduce costs of psychiatric treatment. This article reviews the history and evolution of telepsychiatry including implications for the field in order to provide individual psychiatrists and psychiatric organizations guidance on how to formulate current and strategic directions. This article begins with a broad overview of the history of medicine providing contextualization of the development of the field of telepsychiatry. It concludes with projected trends and recommendations.

AB  - We conducted a scoping review to identify and summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the mental health effects associated with bed bugs.
   We employed a five-stage scoping review framework, to systematically identify and review eligible articles. Eligibility criteria included a focus on bed bug infestations and reference to mental health impacts. Descriptive information was then extracted from each article, including the specific mental health effects cited.
   An initial search yielded 920 unique articles on the topic of bed bugs. Of these, 261 underwent abstract review, and 167 underwent full-text review. Full-text review and subsequent review of reference lists yielded a final sample of 51 articles. Numerous mental health effects were linked to bed bug infestations, including severe psychiatric symptoms. However, the majority (n = 31) of the articles were commentary papers; only five original research articles were identified.
   Although significant mental health effects are often linked to bed bugs, such discussions remain largely anecdotal. Despite recognition that the impact of bed bugs constitutes an important public health concern, little empirical evidence currently exists on this topic.

AB  - Introduction
   Finding ways to provide better and less expensive health care for people with multiple chronic conditions or disability is a pressing concern. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate different approaches for caring for this high-need and high-cost population.
   Methods
   We searched Medline for articles published from May 31, 2008, through June 10, 2014, for relevant studies. Articles were considered eligible for this review if they met the following criteria: included people with multiple chronic conditions (behavioral or mental health) or disabilities (2 or more); addressed 1 or more of clinical outcomes, health care use and spending, or patient satisfaction; and compared results from an intervention group with a comparison group or baseline measurements. We extracted information on program characteristics, participant characteristics, and significant (positive and negative) clinical findings, patient satisfaction, and health care use outcomes. For each outcome, the number of significant and positive results was tabulated.
   Results
   Twenty-seven studies were included across 5 models of care. Of the 3 studies reporting patient satisfaction outcomes, 2 reported significant improvements; both were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of the 14 studies reporting clinical outcomes, 12 reported improvements (8 were RCTs). Of the 13 studies reporting health care use and spending outcomes, 12 reported significant improvements (2 were RCTs). Two models of care-care and case management and disease management-reported improvements in all 3 outcomes. For care and case management models, most improvements were related to health care use. For the disease management models, most improvements were related to clinical outcomes.
   Conclusions
   Care and case management as well as disease management may be promising models of care for people with multiple chronic conditions or disabilities. More research and consistent methods are needed to understand the most appropriate care for these high-need and high-cost patients.

AB  - DNA damage is correlated with and may drive the ageing process. Neurons in the brain are postmitotic and are excluded from many forms of DNA repair; therefore, neurons are vulnerable to various neurodegenerative diseases. The challenges facing the field are to understand how and when neuronal DNA damage accumulates, how this loss of genomic integrity might serve as a 'time keeper' of nerve cell ageing and why this process manifests itself as different diseases in different individuals.

AB  - Background: Eating disorders are severe psychiatric disorders with a complex etiology involving transactions among sociocultural, psychological, and biological influences. Most research and reviews, however, focus on only one level of analysis. To address this gap, we provide a qualitative review and summary using an integrative biopsychosocial approach. Methods: We selected variables for which there were available data using integrative methodologies (e.g., twin studies, gene-environment interactions) and/or data at the biological and behavioral level (e.g., neuroimaging). Factors that met these inclusion criteria were idealization of thinness, negative emotionality, perfectionism, negative urgency, inhibitory control, cognitive inflexibility, serotonin, dopamine, ovarian hormones. Literature searches were conducted using PubMed. Variables were classified as risk factors or correlates of eating disorder diagnoses and disordered eating symptoms using Kraemer et al.' s (1997) criteria. Findings: Sociocultural idealization of thinness variables (media exposure, pressures for thinness, thin-ideal internalization, thinness expectancies) and personality traits (negative emotionality, perfectionism, negative urgency) attained ` risk status' for eating disorders and/or disordered eating symptoms. Other factors were identified as correlates of eating pathology or were not classified given limited data. Effect sizes for risk factors and correlates were generally small-to-moderate in magnitude. Conclusions: Multiple biopsychosocial influences are implicated in eating disorders and/or disordered eating symptoms and several can now be considered established risk factors. Data suggest that psychological and environmental factors interact with and influence the expression of genetic risk to cause eating pathology. Additional studies that examine risk variables across multiple levels of analysis and that consider specific transactional processes amongst variables are needed to further elucidate the intersection of sociocultural, psychological, and biological influences on eating disorders.

AB  - The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were threefold: to estimate the prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms in immigrant women, compare this prevalence to non-immigrant women, and determine risk factors for postpartum depressive symptoms in immigrant women. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, ResearchGate and Google Scholar databases from 1950 until October 2014. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria of which 22 (12 cross-sectional and 10 prospective cohort) contributed data for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. The prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms in immigrant women was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17-23%, 18 studies, N = 13,749 women). Immigrant women were twice more likely to experience depressive symptoms in the postpartum period than non-immigrant women (pooled unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.10 [95% CI 1.62-2.73, 15 studies, N = 50,519 women] and adjusted OR = 2.18 [95% Cl 1.60-2.96, 7 studies, N = 35,557 women]). There was, however, evidence of publication bias with the pooled adjusted OR reduced to 1.63 (95% CI 1.22 -2.17) after adjustment for bias. Risk factors associated with postpartum depressive symptoms among immigrant women included shorter length of residence in the destination country, lower levels of social support, poorer marital adjustment, and perceived insufficient household income. This study suggests that postpartum depression is a common condition among immigrant women. Moreover, immigrant women are at higher risk of postpartum depression than non-immigrant women. Further prospective studies on the risk factors of postpartum depression among immigrant women verified by a clinical diagnosis are needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on information reported in systematic reviews (SRevs), this study aimed to find out whether psychosocial stress at work leads to cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality.
   A systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE (until 2014) used a string based on PICOS components. A manual search was followed. Applying the predefined criteria, two reviewers independently screened the titles, abstracts, selected full texts, and validated their quality. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion between reviewers. Studies of low quality were excluded. Contents of enrolled SRevs were extracted by one reviewer; a second reviewer evaluated their accurateness.
   The search resulted in 462 records. Six SRevs based on 81 studies (total population: similar to 1,468,670) fulfilled the inclusion criteria, four of "very good" (++) and two of "good" (+) quality. Excluded records were filed, and reasons for exclusion were documented in all cases. Different stress models were used to measure the work-related stress; the "demand-control model" was most commonly used. The two enrolled meta-analysis confirmed a modest (1.32, 95 % CI 1.09-1.59; Virtanen et al. 2013) to moderate evidence (1.45, 95 % CI 1.15-1.84; Kivimaki et al. 2006), predominantly among men, for the association between psychosocial stress at work and CV outcomes. Due to lacking information, it was not possible to give evidence on the dose-response relationship.
   Same to a SRev, an overview of SRev is used to summarize literature and identify areas in which research is needed. This overview can be used to: (a) Disseminate an up-to-date information on work-related stress as a risk factors for CV morbidity and mortality to government, health care providers, workers, and other stakeholders; (b) Encourage governments to better regulate the working conditions and consider work-related psychosocial stress as a hazardous factor that leads to CV diseases or mortality; and (c) Analyze gaps in the literature and provide a summary of research needs.

AB  - Background
   Most research on interventions to counter stigma and discrimination has focused on short-term outcomes and has been conducted in high-income settings.
   Aims
   To synthesise what is known globally about effective interventions to reduce mental illness-based stigma and discrimination, in relation first to effectiveness in the medium and long term (minimum 4 weeks), and second to interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Method
   We searched six databases from 1980 to 2013 and conducted a multi-language Google search for quantitative studies addressing the research questions. Effect sizes were calculated from eligible studies where possible, and narrative syntheses conducted. Subgroup analysis compared interventions with and without social contact.
   Results
   Eighty studies (n=422 653) were included in the review. For studies with medium or long-term follow-up (72, of which 21 had calculable effect sizes) median standardised mean differences were 0.54 for knowledge and -0.26 for stigmatising attitudes. Those containing social contact (direct or indirect) were not more effective than those without. The 11 LMIC studies were all from middle-income countries. Effect sizes were rarely calculable for behavioural outcomes or in LMIC studies.
   Conclusions
   There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions beyond 4 weeks follow-up in terms of increasing knowledge and reducing stigmatising attitudes. Evidence does not support the view that social contact is the more effective type of intervention for improving attitudes in the medium to long term. Methodologically strong research is needed on which to base decisions on investment in stigma-reducing interventions.

TI  - Mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian settings: reflections on a review of UNHCR's approach and activities
KW  - humanitarian settings
KW  - mental health and psychosocial support
KW  - refugees
AB  - Mental health and psychosocial support activities are increasingly becoming a core component of humanitarian response and support for displaced persons in emergencies. However, recognition of the mental health and psychosocial impacts of conflict, disaster and displacement is relatively new within the sphere of humanitarian assistance. This paper, therefore, describes and expands on findings from a review of the UN Refugee Agency's engagement with mental health and psychosocial support for refugees. While this review specifically focused on one agency within the humanitarian field, it should be useful to many humanitarian agencies working in the field as the number of displacement scenarios grow and mental health and psychosocial aspects of displacement are increasingly evident. This review identified three key themes; 1) engaging with mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian settings as an approach and as a set of interventions was found to be a useful framework; 2) challenges in measuring and evaluating mental health and psychosocial support activities, and the ways in which these challenges influence mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian settings is discussed; and 3) limitations in provision of clinical mental health services were evident.

AB  - Background: Cultural issues are important for diagnostic validity between different countries; little has been addressed from Latin America and Caribbean countries (LAC). Objective: To identify LAC studies on culture-bound syndromes (CBS) and extract potential empirical evidence about Susto, Nervios and Ataques de Nervios. Methods: Search strategies were carried out in Medline, Embase, Lilacs, ISI and PsycINFO, covering 1992 to 2015. Inclusion criteria: studies on CBS conducted on populations residing in LAC, LAC articles on diagnostic classification and culture, where LAC has been included. Exclusion criteria: studies on Latin American migrants outside LAC. Content analysis used the system proposed by Guarnaccia and Rogler (1999): epidemiological, ethnographic and socio-demographic data and identification of comorbidities with other psychiatric disorders. Results: Thirty one articles were selected out of 1.090. These CBS were selected out of 1aphic data and identification of comorbidities with other ps proposed by Guarnaccia diagnostic classification and cun panic disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder and presented more psychosocial vulnerability. Discussion: Analysis showed that Nervios, Susto and Ataques de Nervios are important idioms of distress, associated with socio-economically vulnerable populations and comorbidities with other psychiatric conditions, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder. More studies are needed on their relation with stress and in more LAC countries.

AB  - Objective: To consolidate the evidence from the literature to evaluate the role of ketamine in the treatment of bipolar depression.
   Methods: Major databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Scopus, were searched through October 2014, for studies reporting the role of ketamine in the treatment of bipolar depression. Only randomized controlled trials were included in the metaanalysis. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) with SE for each study included in the meta-analysis. A random effect model was used to calculate the pooled SMDs. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I-2 statistic.
   Results: Of the 721 articles that were screened, 5 studies that enrolled a total of 125 subjects with bipolar depression (mean age, 44.6 +/- 4.3 y and 65.6% females) were included in the systematic review; 3 randomized controlled trials (69 subjects) were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed significant improvement in depression among patients receiving a single dose of intravenous ketamine compared with those who received placebo (SMD=-1.01; 95% confidence interval, -1.37, -0.66; P< 0.0001). The maximum improvement was observed 40 minutes after the ketamine infusion. No heterogeneity was observed between the studies (Cochran Q test P= 0.38, I-2= 0%). The 2 studies that were excluded from the meta-analysis also showed significant improvement in depression after ketamine therapy. Individual studies also reported improvement in anhedonia and suicidal ideation after ketamine therapy. None of the subjects had serious side effects, and the side effects were similar between the ketamine and placebo groups.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that ketamine is effective in treatment-resistant bipolar depression and may reduce suicidal ideation and anhedonia.

AB  - To review and synthesize the currently available research on whether early intervention for psychosis programs reduce the use of inpatient services.
   A systematic review was conducted using keywords searches on PubMed, Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (ProQuest), Scopus, CINAHL (EBSCO), Social Work Abstracts (EBSCO), Social Science Citations Index (Web of Science), Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), and Child Development & Adolescent Studies (EBSCO). To be included, studies had to be peer-reviewed publications in English, examining early intervention programs using a variant of assertive community treatment, with a control/comparison group, and reporting inpatient service use outcomes. The primary outcome extracted number hospitalized and total N. Secondary outcome extracted means and standard deviations. Data were pooled using random effects models. Primary outcome was the occurrence of any hospitalization during treatment. A secondary outcome was the average bed-days used during treatment period.
   Fifteen projects were identified and included in the study. Results of meta-analysis supported the occurrence of a positive effect for intervention for both outcome measures (any hospitalization OR: 0.33; 95% CI 0.18-0.63, bed-days usage SMD: -0.38, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.24). There was significant heterogeneity of effect across the studies. This heterogeneity is due to a handful of studies with unusually positive responses.
   These results suggest that early intervention programs are superior to standard of care, with respect to reducing inpatient service usage. Wider use of these programs may prevent the occurrence of admission for patients experiencing the onset of psychotic symptoms.

AB  - Despite its initial treatment as a nuisance variable, the placebo effect is now recognized as a powerful determinant of health across many different diseases and encounters. This is in light of some remarkable findings ranging from demonstrations that the placebo effect significantly modulates the response to active treatments in conditions such as pain, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, and some surgical procedures. Here, we review pioneering studies and recent advances in behavioral, neurobiological, and genetic influences on the placebo effect. Consistent with recent conceptualizations, the placebo effect is presented as the product of a general expectancy learning mechanism in which verbal, conditioned, and social cues are centrally integrated to change behaviors and outcomes. Examples of the integration of verbal and conditioned cues, such as instructed reversal of placebo effects are also incorporated into this model. We discuss neuroimaging studies that have identified key brain regions and modulatory mechanisms underlying placebo effects using well-established behavioral paradigms. Finally, we present a synthesis of recent genetics studies on the placebo effect, highlighting a promising link between genetic variants in the dopamine, opioid, serotonin, and endocannabinoid pathways and placebo responsiveness. Greater understanding of the behavioral, neurobiological, and genetic influences on the placebo effect is critical for evaluating medical interventions and may allow health professionals to tailor and personalize interventions in order to maximize treatment outcomes in clinical settings.

AB  - The research described in the present article was implemented to define the locations of two World War II shipwrecks, the German raider Kormoran, and the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney. The paper describes the long and complex trail that led through inefficient oceanographic prediction to ambiguous historical prediction involving a single report and on to precise cognitive prediction based on nine reports from more than 70 survivors, a process that yielded a single target position or "mean" just 2.7 NM (nautical miles) from the wreck of Kormoran. Prediction for the position of the wreck of Sydney opened with wishful thinking that she had somehow reached the coast more than 100 NM away when cognitive analysis of the survivor's reports actually provided the basis for accurate prediction in a position near to the wreck of Kormoran. In the account provided below, the focus on cognitive procedures emerged from, first, a review of a sample of the shipwreck hunts, and, second, growing awareness of the extraordinarily rich database available for this search, and the extent to which it was open to cognitive analysis. This review touches on both the trans-disciplinary and the cognitive or intra-disciplinary issues that so challenged the political entities responsible for supervising of the search for the wrecks of Kormoran and Sydney. One of the theoretical questions that emerged from these debate concerns the model of expertise advanced by Collins (2013). The decomposability of alleged forms of expertise is revealed as a fundamental problem for research projects that might or might not benefit from trans-disciplinary research. Where expertise can be decomposed for operational purposes, the traditional dividing lines between experts and novices, and fools for that matter, are much harder to discern, and require advanced and scientifically informed review.

AB  - Accumulation of protein aggregates is the leading cause of cellular dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease, Prion disease and motor disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, present with a similar pattern of progressive neuronal death, nervous system deterioration and cognitive impairment. The common characteristic is an unusual misfolding of proteins which is believed to cause protein deposition and trigger degenerative signals in the neurons. A similar clinical presentation seen in many neurodegenerative disorders suggests the possibility of shared neuronal responses in different disorders. Despite the difference in core elements of deposits in each neurodegenerative disorder, the cascade of neuronal reactions such as activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, mitogen-activated protein kinases, cell cycle re-entry and oxidative stress leading to a progressive neurodegeneration are surprisingly similar. This review focuses on protein toxicity in two neurodegenerative diseases, AD and PD. We reviewed the activated mechanisms of neurotoxicity in response to misfolded beta-amyloid and a-synuclein, two major toxic proteins in AD and PD, leading to neuronal apoptosis. The interaction between the proteins in producing an overlapping pathological pattern will be also discussed.

AB  - Objective: To summarise and critically evaluate the evidence informing the provision of standard care practices and psychosocial interventions following stillbirth. Background: Stillbirth is increasingly recognised as a significant bereavement experience with the potential to cause substantial psychological distress for parents. Standard care practices and psychosocial interventions to support parents have undergone dramatic changes, with limited basis in evidence. Methods: A systematic narrative review was conducted of quantitative studies examining interventions designed to reduce psychological distress in parents following the loss of a stillborn baby. Results: Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Substantial methodological weaknesses were identified among reviewed studies, including small and heterogeneous loss samples, weak study designs and lack of clarity in reported methods and outcomes. Inadequate replication of many findings substantially limits the generalisability of the evidence. Conclusion: Tentative evidence was found for the provision of mementoes of the baby and information regarding the cause of the loss, support group attendance, and cognitive behavioural interventions for parents identified with clinical levels of distress. Contradictory findings for the impact of contact with the baby prevent the formation of clear conclusions for this practice. Due to the methodological weaknesses prevalent in the research identified, the current evidence base is not considered sufficiently able to reliably inform care practices and intervention approaches. High-quality research evidence in this field is urgently required.

AB  - Background: Forty percent of the world's suicide deaths occur in low and middle income countries (LAMIC) in Asia. There is a recognition that social factors, such as socioeconomic position (SEP), play an important role in determining suicidal risk in high income countries, but less is known about the association in LAMIC.
   Methods: The objective of this systematic review was to synthesise existing evidence of the association between SEP and attempted suicide/suicide risk in LAMIC countries in South and South East Asia. Web of Science, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and article reference lists/forward citations were searched for eligible studies. Epidemiological studies reporting on the association of individual SEP with suicide and attempted suicide were included. Study quality was assessed using an adapted rating tool and a narrative synthesis was conducted.
   Results: Thirty-one studies from nine countries were identified; 31 different measures of SEP were reported, with education being the most frequently recorded. Most studies suggest that lower levels of SEP are associated with an increased risk of suicide/attempted suicide, though findings are not always consistent between and within countries. Over half of the studies included in this review were of moderate/low quality. The SEP risk factors with the most consistent association across studies were asset based measures (e.g. composite measures); education; measures of financial difficulty and subjective measures of financial circumstance. Several studies show a greater than threefold increased risk in lower SEP groups with the largest and most consistent association with subjective measures of financial circumstance.
   Conclusion: The current evidence suggests that lower SEP increases the likelihood of suicide/attempted suicide in LAMIC in South and South East Asia. However, the findings are severely limited by study quality; larger better quality studies are therefore needed.

AB  - Analysis of data collected from behavioral paradigms has provided important information for understanding the etiology and progression of diseases that involve neural regions mediating abnormal behavior. The trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) paradigm is particularly suited to examine cerebro-cerebellar interactions since the paradigm requires the cerebellum, forebrain, and awareness of the stimulus contingencies. Impairments in acquiring EBC have been noted in several neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Although several species have been used to examine EBC, the rabbit is unique in its tolerance for restraint, which facilitates imaging, its relatively large skull that facilitates chronic neuronal recordings, a genetic sequence for amyloid that is identical to humans which makes it a valuable model to study AD, and in contrast to rodents, it has a striatum that is differentiated into a caudate and a putamen that facilitates analysis of diseases involving the striatum. This review focuses on EBC during schizophrenia and AD since impairments in cerebro-cerebellar connections have been hypothesized to lead to a cognitive dysmetria. We also relate EBC to conditioned avoidance responses that are more often examined for effects of antipsychotic medications, and we propose that an analysis of novel object recognition (NOR) may add to our understanding of how the underlying neural circuitry has changed during disease states. We propose that the EBC and NOR paradigms will help to determine which therapeutics are effective for treating the cognitive aspects of schizophrenia and AD, and that neuroimaging may reveal biomarkers of the diseases and help to evaluate potential therapeutics. The rabbit, thus, provides an important translational system for studying neural mechanisms mediating maladaptive behaviors that underlie some psychiatric diseases, especially cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia and AD, and object recognition provides a simple test of memory that can corroborate the results of EBC.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of this article was to review existing screening instruments that could be used to identify individuals who may be at increased risk for psychosis and to determine the suitability of these instruments.
   Methods: Medline (Ovid) and PubMed were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English, which reported performance evaluation of screening instruments for symptoms of high risk for psychosis. The articles' titles, abstracts and, when necessary, full texts were read to filter them against the selection criteria. Citations within relevant articles were hand searched for other potentially eligible studies.
   Results: This selection strategy resulted in identifying 56 articles (including three articles available only in an abstract format) that reported performance evaluation of 17 screening instruments.
   Conclusions: The sensitivity of these scales ranged from 67% to 100% and the specificity ranged from 39% to 100%. The positive predictive value was less precise with scores ranging from 24% to 100%, and the negative predictive value ranging from 58% to 100%. There were several scales that might be useful for screening for individuals who are at increased risk for developing psychosis; however, the majority of measures are underexplored with poor validation.

AB  - Adolescence is a period in which all the habits and behaviour like high risk behaviour, substance abuse and eating habits develop that have lifelong impact. In India, programmes have been launched to address all the problems faced during adolescent period, still then adolescents are facing problems. In this review the problems faced by Indian adolescents were highlighted from the past 14 years' studies. The studies were searched from 2001 to 2015 from Pub Med, Google scholar and other community medicine and public health related journals. The problems included were sexual health and teenage pregnancy, problems related to menstruation, illicit drugs, tobacco and alcohol use. Anaemia, eating problems, obesity, behavioural problems and oral health among adolescent were also reviewed. Nineteen abstracts and 52 full texts were available. Sexual health knowledge among adolescent varies from 41% to poor. Knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases and sexuality is less. Prevalence of dysmenorrhoea varies from 67.2% to 56.15% among adolescent girls. Prevalence of tobacco use varies from 25.1 to 12%. Prevalence of obesity varies from 3.4% to 0.35% and overweight varies from 5.5% to 5.84%. Prevalence of anaemia varies from 29% to 41.1%. Adolescents are facing depressive problems, physical fights, worry and loneliness. Prevalence of depression varies from 18.4% to 13.3%. Prevalence of dental problems varies from 18.2 to 41%. The review revealed that adolescents in India are facing problems of sexually transmitted infections, dysmenorrhea, tobacco and alcohol use, depression, physical fights, worry, loneliness and oral health problems. This needs a participation of family, community and government to resolve the issue.

AB  - Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) include cognitive deficits and impairment in the recognition of emotions. Recently, a number of studies have investigated theory of mind (TOM) deficits in PD. In this meta-analysis of 18 studies, the ToM performance of 487 non-demented individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) was compared with 459 healthy controls. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between ToM deficits and demographical and clinical features in PD, including medication, stage of the illness and neurocognition. PD was associated with significant ToM impairment (d = 0.83) in both verbal and visual tasks. In individual task analyses, PD patients performed worse than controls in both faux pas recognition (d= 0.55) and reading the mind from the eyes (d = 0.67) tests. Severity of ToM impairment was significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Impairments in social cognitive abilities, including ToM, may be important contributors to the functional impairments observed in PD. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Postpartum women are consuming their placentas encapsulated, cooked, and raw for the prevention of postpartum depression (PPD), pain relief, and other health benefits. Placentophagy is supported by health advocates who assert that the placenta retains hormones and nutrients that are beneficial to the mother. A computerized search was conducted using PubMed, Medline Ovid, and PsychINFO between January 1950 and January 2014. Keywords included placentophagy, placentophagia, maternal placentophagia, maternal placentophagy, human placentophagia, and human placentophagy. A total of 49 articles were identified. Empirical studies of human or animal consumption of human placentas were included. Editorial commentaries were excluded. Animal placentophagy studies were chosen based on their relevance to human practice. Ten articles (four human, six animal) were selected for inclusion. A minority of women in developed countries perceive placentophagy to reduce PPD risk and enhance recovery. Experimental animal research in support of pain reduction has not been applied in humans. Studies investigating placenta consumption for facilitating uterine contraction, resumption of normal cyclic estrogen cycle, and milk production are inconclusive. The health benefits and risks of placentophagy require further investigation of the retained contents of raw, cooked, and encapsulated placenta and its effects on the postpartum woman.

AB  - Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit impaired social cognition, which manifests as difficulties in identifying emotions, feeing connected to others, inferring people's thoughts and reacting emotionally to others. These social cognitive impairments interfere with social connections and are strong determinants of the degree of impaired daily functioning in such individuals. Here, we review recent findings from the fields of social cognition and social neuroscience and identify the social processes that are impaired in schizophrenia. We also consider empathy as an example of a complex social cognitive function that integrates several social processes and is impaired in schizophrenia. This information may guide interventions to improve social cognition in patients with this disorder.

AB  - While non-REM (NREM) sleep has been strongly implicated in the reactivation and consolidation of memory traces, the role of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep remains unclear. A growing body of research on humans and animals provide behavioral evidence for a role of REM sleep in the strengthening and modulation of emotional memories. Theta activity which describes low frequency oscillations in the local field potential within the hippocam pus, amygdala and neocortex is a prominent feature of both wake and REM sleep in humans and rodents. Theta coherence between the hippocampus and amygdala drives large-scale pontine-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves, the density of which predicts increases in plasticity-related gene expression. This could potentially facilitate the processing of emotional memory traces within the hippocampus during REM sleep. Further, the timing of hippocampal activity in relation to theta phase is vital in determining subsequent potentiation of neuronal activity. This could allow the emotionally modulated strengthening of novel and gradual weakening of consolidated hippocampal memory traces during REM sleep. Hippocampal theta activity is also correlated with REM sleep levels of achetylcholine - which is thought to reduce hippocampal inputs in the neocortex. The additional low levels of noradrenaline during REM sleep, which facilitate feedback within the neocortex, could allow the integration of novel memory traces previously consolidated during NREM sleep. We therefore propose that REM sleep mediates the prioritized processing of emotional memories within the hippocampus, the integration of previously consolidated memory traces within the neocortex, as well as the disengagement of consolidated neocortical memory traces from the hippocampus.

KW  - DENTAL CHARACTERISTICS
KW  - ANOREXIA-NERVOSA
KW  - BULIMIA
KW  - MANIFESTATIONS
KW  - EROSION
AB  - Background
   There is a well-established link between oral pathology and eating disorders in the presence of self-induced vomiting. There is less information concerning this relationship in the absence of self-induced vomiting, in spite of risk factors such as psychotropic-induced dry mouth, nutritional deficiency or acidic diet.
   Aims
   To determine the association between eating disorder and poor oral health, including any difference between patients with and without self-induced vomiting.
   Method
   A systematic search was made of Med line, PsycINFO, EMBASE and article bibliographies. Outcomes were dental erosion, salivary gland function and the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth or surfaces (DMFT/S).
   Results
   Ten studies had sufficient data for a random effects meta-analysis (psychiatric patients n=556, controls n=556). Patients with an eating disorder had five times the odds of dental erosion compared with controls (95% Cl 3.31-7.58); odds were highest in those with self-induced vomiting (odds ratio (OR)=7.32). Patients also had significantly higher DMFS scores (mean difference 3.07, 95% Cl 0.66-5.48) and reduced salivary flow (OR=2.24, 95% 01 1.44-3.51).
   Conclusions
   These findings highlight the importance of collaboration between dental and medical practitioners. Dentists may be the first clinicians to suspect an eating disorder given patients' reluctance to present for psychiatric treatment, whereas mental health clinicians should be aware of the oral consequences of inappropriate diet, psychotropic medication and self-induced vomiting.

AB  - Numerous controversies and debates have taken place throughout the history of psychopathology (and its main classification systems) with regards to sexual orientation and gender identity. These are still reflected on present reformulations of gender dysphoria in both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and the International Classification of Diseases, and in more or less subtle micro-aggressions experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans patients in mental health care. The present paper critically reviews this history and current controversies. It reveals that this deeply complex field contributes (i) to the reflection on the very concept of mental illness; (ii) to the focus on subjective distress and person-centered experience of psychopathology; and (iii) to the recognition of stigma and discrimination as significant intervening variables. Finally, it argues that sexual orientation and gender identity have been viewed, in the history of the field of psychopathology, between two poles: gender transgression and gender variance/fluidity.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization, two billion people will be aged 60 years or older by 2050. Aging is a major risk factor for a number of neurodegenerative disorders. These age-related disorders currently represent one of the most important and challenging health problems worldwide. Therefore, much attention has been directed towards the design and development of neuroprotective agents derived from natural sources. These phytochemicals have demonstrated high efficacy and low adverse effects in multiple in vitro and in vivo studies. Among these phytochemicals, dietary flavonoids are an important and common chemical class of bioactive products, found in several fruits and vegetables. Luteolin is an important flavone, which is found in several plant products, including broccoli, pepper, thyme, and celery. Numerous studies have shown that luteolin possesses beneficial neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo. Despite this, an overview of the neuroprotective effects of luteolin has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a review of the available literature regarding the neuroprotective effects of luteolin and its molecular mechanisms of action. Herein, we also review the available literature regarding the chemistry of luteolin, its herbal sources, and bioavailability as a pharmacological agent for the treatment and management of age-related neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorders are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders, with rising incidence but little effective therapeutic intervention available. Currently two main clinical features are described to diagnose ASDs: impaired social interaction and communication, and repetitive behaviors. Much work has focused on understanding underlying causes of ASD by generating animal models of the disease, in the hope of discovering signaling pathways and cellular targets for drug intervention. Here we review how ASD behavioral phenotypes can be modeled in the mouse, the most common animal model currently in use in this field, and discuss examples of genetic mouse models of ASD with behavioral features that recapitulate various symptoms of ASD.

AB  - Substance use disorder is an emerging problem concerning to human health, causing severe side effects, including neurotoxicity. The use of illegal drugs and the misuse of prescription or over-the-counter drugs are growing in this century, being one of the major public health problems. Ethanol and cocaine are one of the most frequently used drugs and, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, their concurrent consumption is one of the major causes for emergency hospital room visits. These molecules act in the brain through different mechanisms, altering the nervous system function. Researchers have focused the attention not just in the mechanism of action of these drugs, but also in the mechanism by which they damage the nervous tissue (neurotoxicity). Therefore, the goal of the present review is to provide a global perspective about the mechanisms of the neurotoxicity of cocaine and ethanol.

   Methods: A selective literature search of the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and ISI databases from inception until March 2014 was performed. Included in this review were articles that a) characterized prodromal and first-episode stages of BD or b) detailed efficacy and safety/tolerability of interventions in patients considered prodromal for BD or those with only one episode of mania/hypomania.
   Results: As research has only recently focused on characterization of the early phase of BD, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of any treatment option in the early phase of BD. Case management; individual, group, and family therapy; supportive therapy; and group psychoeducation programs have been proposed. Most evidence-based treatment guidelines for BD do not address treatment specifically in the context of the early stages of illness. Evidence for pharmacotherapy is usually presented in relation to illness polarity (i.e., manic/mixed or depressed) or treatment phase.
   Conclusions: Although early recognition and treatment are critical to preventing unfavorable outcomes, there is currently little evidence for interventions in these stages of BD.

AB  - Currently, there is great interest in identifying genetic variants that contribute to the risk of developing autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), due in part to recent increases in the frequency of diagnosis of these disorders worldwide. While there is nearly universal agreement that ASDs are complex diseases, with multiple genetic and environmental contributing factors, there is less agreement concerning the relative importance of common vs rare genetic variants in ASD liability. Recent observations that rare mutations and copy number variants (CNVs) are frequently associated with ASDs, combined with reduced fecundity of individuals with these disorders, has led to the hypothesis that ASDs are caused primarily by de novo or rare genetic mutations. Based on this model, large-scale whole-genome DNA sequencing has been proposed as the most appropriate method for discovering ASD liability genes. While this approach will undoubtedly identify many novel candidate genes and produce important new insights concerning the genetic causes of these disorders, a full accounting of the genetics of ASDs will be incomplete absent an understanding of the contributions of common regulatory variants, which are likely to influence ASD liability by modifying the effects of rare variants or, by assuming unfavorable combinations, directly produce these disorders. Because it is not yet possible to identify regulatory genetic variants by examination of DNA sequences alone, their identification will require experimentation. In this essay, I discuss these issues and describe the advantages of measurements of allelic expression imbalance (AEI) of mRNA expression for identifying cis-acting regulatory variants that contribute to ASDs.

AB  - Introduction: Medical-legal partnerships (MLP) are a model in which medical and legal practitioners are co-located and work together to support the health and wellbeing of individuals by identifying and resolving legal issues that impact patients' health and wellbeing. The aim of this article is to analyse the benefits of this model, which has proliferated in the USA, and its applicability in the context of rural and remote Australia.
   Methods: This review was undertaken with three research questions in mind: What is an MLP? Is service provision for individuals with mental health concerns being adequately addressed by current service models particularly in the rural context? Are MLPs a service delivery channel that would benefit individuals experiencing mental health issues?
   Results: The combined searches from all EBSCO Host databases resulted in 462 citations. This search aggregated academic journals, newspapers, book reviews, magazines and trade publications. After several reviews 38 papers were selected for the final review based on their relevance to this review question: How do MLPs support mental health providers and legal service providers in the development of a coordinated approach to supporting mental health clients' legal needs in regional and rural Australia?
   Conclusions: There is considerable merit in pursuing the development of MLPs in rural and remote Australia particularly as individuals living in rural and remote areas have far fewer opportunities to access support services than those people living in regional and metropolitan locations. MLPS are important channels of service delivery to assist in early invention of legal problems that can exacerbate mental health problems.

   Objective: To determine the value of social support interventions for work outcomes.
   Methods: Databases were searched for systematic reviews between 2000 and 2012 to complete a synthesis of systematic reviews guided by the PRISMA statement and the IOM guidelines for systematic reviews. Assessment of articles for inclusion and methodological quality was conducted independently by at least two researchers, with differences resolved by consensus.
   Results: The search resulted in 3363 titles of which 3248 were excluded following title/abstract review, leaving 115 articles that were retrieved and underwent full article review. 10 articles met the set inclusion criteria, with 7 focusing on social support, 2 on supervisory quality and 1 on both. We found moderate and limited evidence, respectively, that social support and supervisory quality interventions positively impact workplace outcomes.
   Conclusion: There is moderate evidence that social support and limited evidence that supervisory quality interventions have a positive effect on work outcomes.

AB  - The study provides a systematic review that explores the current literature on olfactory capacity in abnormal eating behavior. The objective is to present a basis for discussion on whether research in olfaction in eating disorders may offer additional insight with regard to the complex etiopathology of eating disorders (ED) and abnormal eating behaviors. Electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science) were searched using the components in relation to olfaction and combining them with the components related to abnormal eating behavior. Out of 1352 articles, titles were first excluded by title (n = 64) and then by abstract and fulltext resulting in a final selection of 14 articles (820 patients and 385 control participants) for this review. The highest number of existing literature on olfaction in ED were carried out with AN patients (78.6%) followed by BN patients (35.7%) and obese individuals (14.3%). Most studies were only conducted on females. The general findings support that olfaction is altered in AN and in obesity and indicates toward there being little to no difference in olfactory capacity between BN patients and the general population. Due to the limited number of studies and heterogeneity this review stresses on the importance of more research on olfaction and abnormal eating behavior.

AB  - The current study was a systematic review examining probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in first responders following man-made mass violence. A systematic literature search yielded 20 studies that fit the inclusion criteria. The prevalence rates of probable PTSD across all 20 studies ranged from 13% to 22.0%. Fifteen of the 20 articles focused on first responders following the September 11th terrorist attacks and many of the studies used the same participant recruitment pools. Overall, the results of the systematic review described here suggest that our understanding of PTSD in first responders following man-made mass violence is based on a very small set of articles that have focused on a few particular events. This paper is meant to serve as a call for additional research and to encourage more breadth in the specific incidents that are examined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Though previous research repeatedly found that being employed is better for health than having no job at all, evidence suggests that employment is not always beneficial for health. With especially job insecurity reflecting a contemporary health risk for the employed, a systematic review was performed to assess if insecure employment can be as detrimental for health as unemployment, and to determine whether these associations vary according to different health measures and among men and women.
   Methods: The literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, Embase and PsychInfo. In order to allow a more accurate comparison between the two risk factors, studies were included if the data for job insecurity and unemployment was ascertained from the same sample, and contained a quantitative analysis for both exposures towards one (or more) health outcome(s).
   Results: Out of 375 articles, in total, 13 studies were included in the systematic review. In 24 analyses contrasting the health-related associations between job insecurity and unemployment, 16 statistically significant associations were found for each exposure. According to the different health outcomes used, job insecurity and unemployment were strongly related to mental health, whereas job insecurity was more strongly associated with somatic symptoms. Unemployment showed stronger relations with worse general health and mortality. In 4 out of 16 gender-stratified analyses, significant associations between job insecurity/unemployment and health were found for men but not for women. Beyond that, associations were significant or insignificant in both gender groups.
   Conclusions: Though there were moderate differences across the health outcomes, overall, it was found that job insecurity can pose a comparable threat to health than unemployment. Policy interventions should therefore not only consider health risks posed by unemployment, but should also aim at the reduction of insecure employment.

AB  - AIM: To conduct a systematic literature review about the influence of gender on the recognition of facial expressions of six basic emotions.
   METHODS: We made a systematic search with the search terms (face OR facial) AND (processing OR recognition OR perception) AND (emotional OR emotion) AND (gender or sex) in PubMed, PsycINFO, LILACS, and SciELO electronic databases for articles assessing outcomes related to response accuracy and latency and emotional intensity. The articles selection was performed according to parameters set by COCHRANE. The reference lists of the articles found through the database search were checked for additional references of interest.
   RESULTS: In respect to accuracy, women tend to perform better than men when all emotions are considered as a set. Regarding specific emotions, there seems to be no gender-related differences in the recognition of happiness, whereas results are quite heterogeneous in respect to the remaining emotions, especially sadness, anger, and disgust. Fewer articles dealt with the parameters of response latency and emotional intensity, which hinders the generalization of their findings, especially in the face of their methodological differences.
   CONCLUSION: The analysis of the studies conducted to date do not allow for definite conclusions concerning the role of the observer's gender in the recognition of facial emotion, mostly because of the absence of standardized methods of investigation.

AB  - AIM: To review evidence supporting pharmacological treatments for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and to discuss them according to personal clinical experience.
   METHODS: Original studies, clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses addressing pharmacological treatment for TRD in adult patients published from 1990 to 2013 were identified by data base queries (PubMed, Google Scholar e Quertle Searches) using terms: "treat-ment resistant depression", "treatment refractory depression", "partial response depression", "non responder depression", "optimization strategy", "switching strategy", "combination strategy", "augmen-tation strategy", selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors antidepressants (SSRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors antidepressants, mirtazapine, mianserine, bupropione, monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant (MAOI), lithium, thyroid hormones, second generation antipsychotics (SGA), dopamine agonists, lamotrigine, psychostimulants, dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, ketamine, omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosil-L-metionine, methylfolat, pindolol, sex steroids, glucocorticoid agents. Other citations of interest were further identified from references reported in the accessed articles. Selected publications were grouped by treatment strategy: (1) switching from an ineffective antidepressant (AD) to a new AD from a similar or different class; (2) combining the current AD regimen with a second AD from a different class; and (3) augmenting the current AD regimen with a second agent not thought to be an antide-pressant itself.
   RESULTS: Switching from a TCA to another TCA provides only a modest advantage (response rate 9%-27%), while switching from a SSRI to another SSRI is more advantageous (response rate up to 75%). Evidence supports the usefulness of switching from SSRI to ven-la-faxine (5 positive trials out 6), TCA (2 positive trials out 3), and MAOI (2 positive trials out 2) but not from SSRI to bupropione, duloxetine and mirtazapine. Three reviews demonstrated that the benefits of intra-and cross-class switch do not significantly differ. Data on combination strategy are controversial regarding TCA-SSRI combination (positive results in old studies, negative in more recent study) and bupropion-SSRI combination (three open series studies but not three controlled trails support the useful of this combination) and positive regard mirtazapine (or its analogue mianserine) combination with ADs of different classes. As regards the augmentation strategy, available evidences supported the efficacy of TCA augmentation with lithium salts and thyroid hormone (T3), but are conflicting regard the SSRI augmentation with these two drugs (1 positive trial out of 4 for lithium and 3 out of 5 for thyroid hormone). Double-blind controlled studies showed the efficacy of AD augmentation with aripiprazole (5 positive trials out 5), quetiapine (3 positive trials out 3) and, at less extent, of fluoxetine augmentation with olanzapine (3 positive trials out 6), so these drugs received the FDA indication for the acute treatment of TRD. Results on AD augmentation with risperidone are conflicting (2 short term positive trials, 1 short-term and 1 long-term negative trials). Case series and open-label trials showed that AD augmentation with pramipexole or ropinirole, two dopamine agonists, could be an effective treatment for TRD (response rate to pramipexole 48%-74%, to ropinirole 40%-44%) although one recent double-blind placebo-controlled study does not support the superiority of pramipexole over placebo. Evidences do not justify the use of psychostimulants, omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosil-Lmetionine, methylfolate, pindolol, lamotrigine, and sex hormone as AD augmentation for TRD. Combining the available evidences with our experience we suggest treating non-responders to one SSRI bupropion or mirtazapine trial by switching to venlafaxine, and non-responders to one venlafaxine trial by switching to a TCA or, if TCA are not tolerated, combining mirtazapine with SSRI or venlafaxine. In non-responders to two or more ADs (including at least one TCA if tolerated) current AD regimen could be augmented with lithium salts (mainly in patients with bipolar depression or suicidality), SGAs (mostly aripiprazole) or DA-agonists (mostly pramipexole). In patients with severe TRD, i.e., non-responders to combination and augmentation strategies as well as to electroconvulsive therapy if workable, we suggest to try a combination plus augmentation strategy.
   CONCLUSION: Our study identifies alternative effective treatment strategies for TRD. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy of different strategies in more homogeneous subpopulations.

KW  - Depression
KW  - Disruptive Behavior Disorder
KW  - Children

AB  - AIM: To summarize research regarding the motor abilities of children and adolescents who suffer from a common psychiatric condition.
   METHODS: In order to outline the current knowledge regarding the motor abilities of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) and depression, a comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out using PubMed, Medline and ERIC databases. The databases were searched for relevant English language articles published between January 1990 and April 2014. Only studies that conducted a quantitative evaluation of motor ability and concerned individuals aged 0-18 years were included. A separate search was conducted for each disorder (ASD, ADHD, DBD, depression) in conjunction with each of the following keywords: (psycho/perceptuo) motor/movement skill(s), (psycho/perceptuo) motor/movement abilities, (psycho/perceptuo) motor/movement impairment, (psycho/perceptuo) motor/movement problem(s), motor function, motor coordi-nation, motor performance, motor deficit(s). To detect supplementary relevant literature, the reference lists of the retrieved articles were examined.
   RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 51 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. In total, 28 studies were included that examined the motor abilities of children and adolescents with ASD. All studies indicated that they performed below average on various standardized motor assessment instruments. The overall prevalence rate for impairment in motor abilities ranged from 33% to 100%. Twenty-seven studies examined the motor abilities of children and adolescents with ADHD. Depending on the type of motor assessment tool and the cut-off points used by different researchers, prevalence rates of impairment in motor abilities are highly variable and ranged from 8% to 73%. Remarkably, there is a paucity of research addressing the motor abilitiesof individuals with DBD or depression. Furthermore, methodological problems, such as measurement and comorbidity issues, complicate the generalization of the findings.
   CONCLUSION: Research suggests that motor impairment is highly prevalent in some psychiatric conditions, particularly ASD and ADHD. However, future work is necessary to draw sound conclusions.

AB  - In this paper, we argue for a stronger engagement between concepts in affective and social neuroscience on the one hand, and theories from the fields of anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology on the other. Affective and social neuroscience could provide an additional assessment of social theories. We argue that some of the most influential social theories of the last four decades-rational choice theory, behavioral economics, and post-structuralism-contain assumptions that are inconsistent with key findings in affective and social neuroscience. We also show that another approach from the social sciences-plural rationality theory-shows greater compatibility with these findings. We further claim that, in their turn, social theories can strengthen affective and social neuroscience. The former can provide more precise formulations of the social phenomena that neuroscientific models have targeted, can help neuroscientists who build these models become more aware of their social and cultural biases, and can even improve the models themselves. To illustrate, we show how plural rationality theory can be used to further specify and test the somatic marker hypothesis. Thus, we aim to accelerate the much-needed merger of social theories with affective and social neuroscience.

AB  - Apathy, a quantitative reduction in goal-directed behavior, is a prevalent symptom dimension with a negative impact on functional outcome in various neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and depression. The aim of this review is to show that interview-based assessment of apathy in humans and observation of spontaneous rodent behavior in an ecological setting can serve as an important complementary approach to already existing task-based assessment, to study and understand the neurobiological bases of apathy. We first discuss the paucity of current translational approaches regarding animal equivalents of psychopathological assessment of apathy. We then present the existing evaluation scales for the assessment of apathy in humans and propose five sub domains of apathy, namely self care, social interaction, exploration, work/education and recreation. Each of the items in apathy evaluation scales can be assigned to one of these sub-domains. We then show that corresponding, well-validated behavioral readouts exist for rodents and that, indeed, three of the five human apathy sub domains have a rodent equivalent. In conclusion, the translational ecological study of apathy in humans and rodents is possible and will constitute an important approach to increase the understanding of the neurobiological bases of apathy and the development of novel treatments.

AB  - Converging evidence suggests that freshwater systems play an important role in the carbon cycles at both regional and global scales. In addition, there are serious concerns that ongoing and future changes to the environment could alter these dynamics. This is particularly important in the boreal forest biome, which contains a very high density of lakes. In this review, we synthesize the current state of research to provide a critical overview of (i) the role of boreal lakes as emitters versus sinks of carbon, (ii) their contribution to the regional carbon balance, (iii) knowledge gaps that may inhibit an accurate evaluation of the role of boreal lakes in a landscape context, and (iv) impacts of environmental perturbations on carbon dynamics in boreal lakes. Several recent studies indicate that boreal lakes are actively processing, emitting, and storing carbon rather than being passive transport conduits. Yet, generalizing the role of lake ecosystems for the overall carbon balance of the boreal forest biome is challenging because of the scarcity of studies on lake carbon budgets in a landscape context that can capture the potential temporal and spatial variability and uncertainties associated with the available estimates of carbon pools and fluxes. Further, environmental perturbations, such as climate change, acidic deposition, and nutrient enrichment, likely affect both carbon export to lakes and in-lake carbon processing in boreal regions. Predicting their overall impacts on lake carbon budgets is particularly difficult, not only because individual environmental stressors likely affect multiple processes involved in carbon cycling, but also because often multiple stressors act synergistically or antagonistically at the landscape level. Accordingly, long-term, system-wide approaches are required to accurately evaluate the importance of lakes for boreal carbon budgets in a changing environment.

AB  - Psychosis is relatively common in later life and can present in a wide variety of contexts, including early-onset and late-onset schizophrenia, delusional disorder, mood disorders, and various dementias. It can also occur as the result of numerous medical and neurological diseases and from the use of certain medications. Although identifying the cause of psychosis in older patients can be challenging, the unique clinical features associated with the different disorders can help in making the diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis of psychosis in older populations is essential, as its treatment varies depending on the context in which it appears. Despite the safety concerns regarding the use of antipsychotics in older patients, certain pharmacological treatments appear to be both efficacious and reasonably safe in treating psychosis in older populations. Additionally, although research is limited, numerous psychosocial therapies appear promising. This review summarizes the literature on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, neuroimaging, and treatment of psychosis in later life, and serves as an update to past reviews on this topic.

AB  - Background: Randomized trials with antidepressants are often run under double blind placebo-controlled conditions, whereas those with psychotherapies are mostly unblinded. This can introduce bias in favor of psychotherapy when the treatments are directly compared. In this meta-analysis, we examine this potential source of bias.
   Methods: We searched Pubmed, PsycInfo, Embase and the Cochrane database (1966 to January 2014) by combining terms indicative of psychological treatment and depression, and limited to randomized trials. We included 35 trials (with 3721 patients) in which psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for adult depression were directly compared with each other. We calculated effect sizes for each study indicating the difference between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy at post-test. Then, we examined the difference between studies with a placebo condition and those without in moderator analyses.
   Results: We did not find a significant difference between the studies with and those without a placebo condition. The studies in which a placebo condition was included indicated no significant difference between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy (g = -0.07; NNT = 25). Studies in which no placebo condition was included (and patients and clinicians in both conditions were not blinded), resulted in a small, but significant difference between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in favor of pharmacotherapy (g = -0.13; NNT = 14).
   Conclusions: Studies comparing psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in which both groups of patients (and therapists) are not blinded (no placebo condition is included) result in a very small, but significantly higher effect for pharmacotherapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The last decade has witnessed considerable interest in pathological conditions stemming from misuse or overuse of technology, a condition commonly referred to as technopathology. Of the several complaints reported, phantom vibration or phantom ringing is one that has not yet been widely explored. The objective of conducting a systematic review is to provide an understanding of the phenomena and summarize the research conducted so far. Major databases were searched and articles that matched the inclusion criteria were selected for final analysis. According to findings obtained, phantom vibration or phantom ringing was commonly experienced by mobile phone users; however, few found it bothersome and hence took no steps to eliminate it. As of now, literature in the area is limited and many aspects of the phenomena such as its prevalence across populations, causal factors, consequences, and treatment plans are yet to be studied. Also, a clinical criterion for identification of the condition needs to be formulated. With increase in the number of individuals reporting mobile phone-related problem behavior, phantom vibration, or phantom ringing may be expected to become a cause of concern for mental health professionals within some years. Finally, the need for further research is emphasized while presenting directions for future investigations.

AB  - Therapeutic approaches to health and wellbeing have traditionally assumed that meaningful activity or occupation contributes to health and quality of life. Within social psychology, everyday activities and practices that fill our lives are believed to be shaped by structural and systemic factors and in turn these practices can form the basis of social identities. In occupational therapy these everyday activities are called occupations. Occupations can be understood as a contextually bound synthesis of meaningful doing, being, belonging and becoming that influence health and wellbeing. We contend that an integrative review of occupational therapy and social psychology literature will enhance our ability to understand the relationship between social structures, identity and dimensions of occupation by elucidating how they inform one another, and how taken together they augment our understanding of health and wellbeing This review incorporates theoretical and empirical works purposively sampled from databases within EBSCO including CINAHL, psychINFO, psychArticles, and Web of Science. Search terms included: occupation, therapy, social psychology, occupational science, health, wellbeing, identity, structures and combinations of these terms. In presenting this review, we argue that doing, being and belonging may act as an important link to widely acknowledged relationships between social factors and health and wellbeing, and that interventions targeting individual change may be problematic.

AB  - The last several years have seen a number of approaches to robot assistance of motor learning. Experimental studies have produced a range of findings from beneficial effects through null-effects to detrimental effects of robot assistance. In this review we seek an answer to the question under which conditions which outcomes should be expected. For this purpose we derive tentative predictions based on a classification of learning tasks in terms of the products of learning, the mechanisms involved, and the modulation of these mechanisms by robot assistance. Consistent with these predictions, the learning of dynamic features of trajectories is facilitated and the learning of kinematic and dynamic transformations is impeded by robotic guidance, whereas the learning of dynamic transformations can profit from robot assistance with error-amplifying forces. Deviating from the predictions, learning of spatial features of trajectories is impeded by haptic guidance, but can be facilitated by divergent force fields. The deviations point to the existence of additional effects of robot assistance beyond the modulation of learning mechanisms, e.g., the induction of a passive role of the motor system during practice with haptic guidance.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, SCA3), an autosomal dominant neurological disorder, is caused by an abnormal expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the ataxin-3 protein. The length of the expanded polyQstretch correlates positively with the severity of the disease and inversely with the age at onset. To date, we cannot fully explain the mechanism underlying neurobiological abnormalities of this disease. Yet, accumulating reports have demonstrated the functions of ataxin-3 protein in the chaperone system, ubiquitin-proteasome system, and aggregation-autophagy, all of which suggest a role of ataxin-3 in the clearance of misfolded proteins. Notably, the SCA3 pathogenic form of ataxin-3 (ataxin-3(exp)) impairs the misfolded protein clearance via mechanisms that are either dependent or independent of its deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and the progressive loss of neurons in SCA3. Some drugs, which have been used as activators/inducers in the chaperone system, ubiquitin-proteasome system, and aggregation-autophagy, have been demonstrated to be efficacious in the relief of neurodegeneration diseases like Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's (PD), Alzheimer's (AD) as well as SCA3 in animal models and clinical trials, putting misfolded protein clearance on the list of potential therapeutic targets. Here, we undertake a comprehensive review of the progress in understanding the physiological functions of ataxin-3 in misfolded protein clearance and how the polyQ expansion impairs misfolded protein clearance. We then detail the preclinical studies targeting the elimination of misfolded proteins for SCA3 treatment. We close with future considerations for translating these pre-clinical results into therapies for SCA3 patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neurocognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (previously termed Alzheimer's dementia) (AD) is the most common form of cognitive impairment worldwide. Given the anticipated increase in the population aged 65 and over, the prevalence of persons with AD is expected to increase exponentially during the next 30 years. Noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) commonly occur in AD and are associated with adverse outcomes for patients and their caregivers. This review summarizes randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2004 and 2014 with a primary outcome measure of change in symptom severity for NPS in AD. Of the 388 articles initially identified through a literature search, 33 trials met inclusion criteria. Fifteen of these studies had agitation/aggression as a targeted symptom. Twenty-eight evaluated pharmacologic treatments, including psychotropics, cognitive enhancers, stimulants, and nutraceuticals. Nonpharmacologic interventions included bright light, music, exercise, and cognitive-stimulation therapies. Among the pharmacologic interventions, modest efficacy was reported with aripiprazole, citalopram, trazodone, methylphenidate, and scheduled analgesics. Significant reduction in symptom severity was reported with nearly all the nonpharmacologic interventions. Variations in methodology such as inclusion criteria, study setting, and outcome measures limit the generalizability of these results. Barriers to the implementation of nonpharmacologic interventions in clinical settings include resource and training limitations. Electroconvulsive therapy and dronabinol are promising as emerging treatment strategies. Randomized clinical trials are needed in order to validate the utility of electroconvulsive therapy and dronabinol, including where and with whom these interventions will prove most valuable.

KW  - French political science
KW  - public policy
AB  - This article provides a historical overview and critical appraisal of the evolution of policy analysis in France. It presents and discusses the development of policy analysis in France since the 1970s. Although, its origins are clearly rooted in the sociology of organization, it was first institutionalized within the field of political science. Especially since the late 1990s, a number of textbooks have been published, while several journals started to take policy analysis more seriously. Research has developed strongly in this context with a stress on sector-level studies. The field is today internationalised, more than most other subfields of French political science. This may account for the rather difficult relations between policy analysis and 'mainstream' French political science. Finally, French policy analysis maintains a certain number of specificities. There is a strong preference for qualitative methods and 'cognitive' approaches that contrast with research elsewhere. It is also characterised by strong emphasis on the historical dimension of policymaking and the interest in critical theory. These specificities may be only temporary, however, and not survive further international integration of French policy analysis.

AB  - Cognitive impairments are core symptoms of depressive disorders. We assess the systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies published over the last 10 years (2004-2014) that address cognitive performance of depressed patients and taking into account age; clinical and demographic features; symptom severity; number of previous episodes; clinical remission; depressive subtypes and pharmacological treatment. Twelve (12) papers were included after search in international databases. In first episode depression the cognitive domains affected were psychomotor speed, attention, visual learning and memory as well as executive functions. Depressive patients in remission phase improved their performance in attention tasks although they did not achieve similar performance levels as healthy controls. Melancholic patients seem to have a different pattern of cognitive impairment compared with non-melancholic depressive patients. Patients treated with the current antidepressants perform worse in inhibition tasks, verbal fluency, and working memory scores as well as on composite scores of visual and verbal working memory. Future research should study longitudinal outcome and clinical relevance of cognitive symptoms, determine their underlying etiopathogenesis and how they impact on clinical functioning. Specifically, it would be important to analyze the ability of the new antidepressant drugs to improve affective symptoms as well as cognitive dysfunctions.

AB  - Video games are now a ubiquitous form of entertainment that has occasionally attracted negative attention. Video games have also been used to test cognitive function, as therapeutic interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders, and to explore mechanisms of experience-dependent structural brain changes. Here, we review current research on video games published from January 2011 to April 2014 with a focus on studies relating to mental health, cognition, and brain imaging. Overall, there is evidence that specific types of video games can alter brain structure or improve certain aspects of cognitive functioning. Video games can also be useful as neuropsychological assessment tools. While research in this area is still at a very early stage, there are interesting results that encourage further work in this field, and hold promise for utilizing this technology as a powerful therapeutic and experimental tool.

AB  - Many authors have claimed that suprathreshold achromatic stimuli of low and high spatial frequency can be used to separate responses from different entities in the visual system. Most prominently, it has been proposed that such stimuli can differentiate responses from the magnocellular and parvocellular systems. As is reviewed here, investigators who have examined stimulus specificity of neurons in these systems have found little difference between magno- and parvocellular cells. It has also been proposed that spatial frequency can be used to selectively activate the "magnocellular-dorsal stream". The present review indicates that cells in Area MT of the dorsal stream do prefer very low spatial frequencies. However, the review also shows that cells in Area V4 of the ventral stream respond, not only to relatively high spatial frequencies, but also to low frequency stimuli. Thus, low spatial frequencies cannot be relied upon to selectively activate the dorsal stream. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Urgent psychiatric services can provide timely access to ambulatory psychiatric assessment and short-term treatment for patients experiencing a mental health crisis or risk of rapid deterioration requiring hospitalization, yet little is known about how best to organize mental health service delivery for this population. Our scoping review was conducted to identify knowledge gaps and inform program development and quality improvement.
   Method: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and EBM Reviews for English-language articles, published from January 1993 to June 2014, using relevant key words and subject headings. Reverse and forward citations were manually searched using reference lists and Google Scholar. Articles were included if they described programs providing ambulatory psychiatric assessment (with or without treatment) within 2 weeks of referral.
   Results: We identified 10 programs providing urgent psychiatric services. Programs targeted a diagnostically heterogeneous population with acute risks and intensive needs. Most programs included a structured process for triage, strategies to improve accessibility and attendance, interprofessional staffing, short-term treatment, and efforts to improve continuity of care. Despite substantial methodological limitations, studies reported improvements in symptom severity, distress, psychosocial functioning, mental health-related quality of life, subjective well-being, and satisfaction with care, as well as decreased wait times for post-emergency department (ED) ambulatory care, and averted ED visits and admissions.
   Conclusions: Urgent psychiatric services may be an important part of the continuum of mental health services. Further work is needed to clarify the role of urgent psychiatric services, develop standards or best practices, and evaluate outcomes using rigorous methodologies.

AB  - ObjectiveTo perform a meta-analysis on studies reporting prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii (T.gondii) infection in any psychiatric disorder compared with healthy controls. Our secondary objective was to analyze factors possibly moderating heterogeneity.
   MethodA systematic search was performed to identify studies into T.gondii infection for all major psychiatric disorders versus healthy controls. Methodological quality, publication bias, and possible moderators were assessed.
   ResultsA total of 2866 citations were retrieved and 50 studies finally included. Significant odds ratios (ORs) with IgG antibodies were found in schizophrenia (OR 1.81, P<0.00001), bipolar disorder (OR 1.52, P=0.02), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OR 3.4, P<0.001), and addiction (OR 1.91, P<0.00001), but not for major depression (OR 1.21, P=0.28). Exploration of the association between T.gondii and schizophrenia yielded a significant effect of seropositivity before onset and serointensity, but not IgM antibodies or gender. The amplitude of the OR was influenced by region and general seroprevalence. Moderators together accounted for 56% of the observed variance in study effects. After controlling for publication bias, the adjusted OR (1.43) in schizophrenia remained significant.
   ConclusionThese findings suggest that T.gondii infection is associated with several psychiatric disorders and that in schizophrenia reactivation of latent T.gondii infection may occur.

AB  - Background: In recent years, growing interest in the neuropsychology of bipolar disorder has emerged, giving rise to the accumulation of a robust body of evidence on this topic and to several related questions. Objective: To provide a state-of-the-art overview of the neuropsychological profile of bipolar disorder. Method: A thorough literature search was performed. Published research evidence was summarized and organized along three key pathways: findings from cross-sectional studies of cognition in bipolar patients, cognitive heterogeneity among affected subjects, and trajectory of neuropsychological deficits. Results: At least two thirds of bipolar patients display neuropsychological deficits, even in euthymia. Although bipolar disorder was found to be associated with an increased risk of dementia, data from elderly subjects and longitudinal research do not support a worsening of cognitive performance over time. Discussion: Cognitive dysfunctions are part of the clinical conceptualization of bipolar illness. However, they may not be present in all affected subjects and their course appears to be stable in most cases. Available evidence may be highlighting the fact that bipolar disorder is characterized by remarkable heterogeneity regarding cognitive outcomes. Different variables may be related to such heterogeneity and should be the focus of therapeutic approaches and further research.

AB  - Trust is a key aspect of various social interactions. Correspondingly, trust has been heavily studied across different scientific disciplines. However, an integration of the diverse research and literature is still missing. Addressing this issue, we review several hundred articles on interpersonal trust among strangers and integrate them into a coherent framework, explaining trust behavior among unfamiliar agents based on an interaction between situational features and distinct personality characteristics. Understanding trust as a decision under risk, we distill 3 core components of trust behavior from the extant literature: attitudes toward risky prospects (i. e., risk aversion and loss aversion), trustworthiness expectations, and betrayal sensitivity. Each of these refers to a distinct set of causal determinants, including personality characteristics (anxiety/fear, trustworthiness, and forgiveness) which can be localized in the space defined by models of basic personality structure (e. g., the Five-Factor Model and the HEXACO model of personality). In sum, the review contributes to the understanding of trust behavior by linking and integrating the findings from various fields of trust research. Additionally, it provides fruitful directions and implications for future research.

AB  - Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 MRS) allows in vivo quantification of phosphorus metabolites that are considered to be related to membrane turnover and energy metabolism. In schizophrenia (SZ), P-31 MRS studies found several abnormalities in different brain regions suggesting that alterations in these pathways may be contributing to the pathophysiology. In this paper, we systematically reviewed the P-31 MRS studies in SZ published to date by taking patient characteristics, medication status and brain regions into account. Publications written in English were searched on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/, by using the keywords 'phosphomonoester', 'phosphodiester', 'ATP', 'phosphocreatine', 'phosphocholine', 'phosphoethanolamineVglycerophosphocholine', 'glycerophosphoethanolamine', 'pH', 'schizophrenia', and 'MRS'. Studies that measured P-31 metabolites in SZ patients were included. This search identified 52 studies. Reduced PME and elevated PDE reported in earlier studies were not replicated in several subsequent studies. One relatively consistent pattern was a decrease in POE in chronic patients in the subcortical structures. There were no consistent patterns for the comparison of energy related phosphorus metabolites between patients and controls. Also, no consistent pattern emerged in studies seeking relationship between P-31 metabolites and antipsychotic use and other clinical variables. Despite emerging patterns, methodological heterogeneities and shortcomings in this literature likely obscure consistent patterns among studies. We conclude with recommendations to improve study designs and P-31 MRS methods in future studies. We also stress the significance of probing into the dynamic changes in energy metabolism, as this approach reveals abnormalities that are not visible to steady-state measurements.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a stress-related psychiatric disorder that is thought to emerge from complex interactions among traumatic events and multiple genetic factors. Epigenetic regulation lies at the heart of these interactions and mediates the lasting effects of the environment on gene regulation. An increasing body of evidence in human subjects with PTSD supports a role for epigenetic regulation of distinct genes and pathways in the pathogenesis of PTSD. The role of epigenetic regulation is further supported by studies examining fear conditioning in rodent models. Although this line of research offers an exciting outlook for future epigenetic research in PTSD, important limitations include the tissue specificity of epigenetic modifications, the phenomenologic definition of the disorder, and the challenge of translating molecular evidence across species. These limitations call for studies that combine data from postmortem human brain tissue and animal models, assess longitudinal epigenetic changes in living subjects, and examine dimensional phenotypes in addition to diagnoses. Moreover, examining the environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors that promote resilience to trauma may lead to important advances in the field.

AB  - Epigenetics involves functional modifications of genes. The aim of this paper is to explore if an association exists between epigenetics and depression and/or suicide. MedLine/PubMed searches were performed using both Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and Non-MeSH terms. Based on pre-specified terms and inclusion criteria, sixteen studies met inclusion criteria by the 3 independent reviewers. Epigenetic changes seem to be important in both depression and suicide. All of the studies reviewed herein found significant epigenetic changes associated with depression and suicide except for two. Several studies showed that hypermethylation of BDNF is involved in suicide. TrkB hypermethylation was also shown to be associated with suicide by several studies, specifically in Brodmann's Areas (BA) 8 and 9. Future research is needed in a larger sample to further characterize these changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent research suggests a complex role for microglia not only in Parkinson's disease but in other disorders involving alpha-synuclein aggregation, such as multiple system atrophy. In these neurodegenerative processes, the activation of microglia is a common pathological finding, which disturbs the homeostasis of the neuronal environment otherwise maintained, among others, by microglia. The term activation comprises any deviation from what otherwise is considered normal microglia status, including cellular abundance, morphology or protein expression. The microglial response during disease will sustain survival or otherwise promote cell degeneration. The novel concepts of alpha-synuclein being released and uptaken by neighboring cells, and their importance in disease progression, positions microglia as the main cell that can clear and handle alpha-synuclein efficiently. Microglia's behavior will therefore be a determinant on the disease's progression. For this reason we believe that the better understanding of microglia's response to alpha-synuclein pathological accumulation across brain areas and disease stages is essential to develop novel therapeutic tools for Parkinson's disease and other alpha-synucleinopathies. In this review we will revise the most recent findings and developments with regard to alpha-synuclein and microglia in Parkinson's disease. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of physical, psychological, and cognitive impairment, but many current treatments for TBI are ineffective or produce adverse side effects. Non-invasive methods of brain stimulation could help ameliorate some common trauma-induced symptoms.
   Objective: This review summarizes instances in which repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) have been used to treat symptoms following a TBI. A subsequent discussion attempts to determine the value of these methods in light of their potential risks.
   Methods: The research databases of PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO were electronically searched using terms relevant to the use of rTMS and tDCS as a tool to decrease symptoms in the context of rehabilitation post-TBI.
   Results: Eight case-studies and four multi-subject reports using rTMS and six multi-subject studies using tDCS were found. Two instances of seizure are discussed.
   Conclusion: There is evidence that rTMS can be an effective treatment option for some post-TBI symptoms, such as depression, tinnitus, and neglect. Although the safety of this method remains uncertain, the use of rTMS in cases of mild TBI without obvious structural damage may be justified. Evidence on the effectiveness of tDCS is mixed, highlighting the need for additional investigations.

AB  - This review is aimed to highlight the importance of stress and glucocorticoids (GCs) in modulating the inflammatory response of brain microglia and hence its potential involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD). The role of inflammation in PD has been reviewed extensively in the literature and it is supposed to play a key role in the course of the disease. Historically, GCs have been strongly associated as anti-inflammatory hormones. However, accumulating evidence from the peripheral and central nervous system have clearly revealed that, under specific conditions, GCs may promote brain inflammation including pro-inflammatory activation of microglia. We have summarized relevant data linking PD, neuroinflamamation and chronic stress. The timing and duration of stress response may be critical for delineating an immune response in the brain thus probably explain the dual role of GCs and/or chronic stress in different animal models of PD.

AB  - Objective: PTSD is associated with significant morbidity and its prevention could reduce a significant burden of individual and societal suffering. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the prevention of PTSD by using propranolol following exposure to a traumatic event.
   Methods: Authors searched all studies published in the MEDLINE database up to November 2014 and reviewed textbooks and reference lists. Authors of relevant articles were contacted. Clinical trials and observational studies were included if they investigated the effect of propranolol in the acute post-trauma phase to prevent PTSD symptoms for subjects 18 years of age or older. PTSD was diagnosed according to DSM or widely accepted and validated diagnostic tools. A random-effects model was used to perform meta-analysis.
   Results: Five studies were included in the review for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was not significant (tau(2) = 0.0, S.E = 0.247; Cochran's Q((4)) = 1.870, p = 0.760; I-2 = 0%). Relative risk point estimate to the effect of propranolol to prevent PTSD was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.55-1.55). Asymmetry was not significant under the Egger test (z = 134; p = 0.180).
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that propranolol treatment after the traumatic event did not alter the incidence of PTSD, although physiological responses are generally attenuated. The studies included small sample sizes, which can preclude the detection of significant results. Authors believe future studies should achieve larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods.

AB  - The neural basis of face processing has been extensively studied in the past two decades. The current dominant neural model proposed by Haxby et al. (2000); Gobbini and Haxby (2007) suggests a division of labor between the fusiform face area (FFA), which processes invariant facial aspects, such as identity, and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), which processes changeable facial aspects, such as expression. An extension to this model for the processing of dynamic faces proposed by O'Toole et al. (2002) highlights the role of the pSTS in the processing of identity from dynamic familiar faces. To evaluate these models, we reviewed recent neuroimaging studies that examined the processing of identity and expression with static and dynamic faces. Based on accumulated data we propose an updated model, emphasizing the dissociation between form and motion as the primary functional division between a ventral stream that goes through the FFA and a dorsal stream that goes through the STS, respectively. We also encourage future studies to expand their research to the processing of dynamic faces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As post-mitotic cells with great energy demands, neurons depend upon the homeostatic and waste-recycling functions provided by autophagy. In addition, autophagy also promotes survival during periods of harsh stress and targets aggregate-prone proteins associated with neurodegeneration for degradation. Despite this, autophagy has also been controversially described as a mechanism of programmed cell death. Instances of autophagic cell death are typically associated with elevated numbers of cytoplasmic autophagosomes, which have been assumed to lead to excessive degradation of cellular components. Due to the high activity and reliance on autophagy in neurons, these cells may be particularly susceptible to autophagic death. In this review, we summarize and assess current evidence in support of autophagic cell death in neurons, as well as how the dysregulation of autophagy commonly seen in neurodegeneration can contribute to neuron loss. From here, we discuss potential treatment strategies relevant to such cell-death pathways.

AB  - Metacognition, the ability to think about our own thoughts, is a fundamental component of our mental life and is involved in memory, learning, planning and decision-making. Here we focus on one aspect of metacognition, namely confidence in perceptual decisions. We review the literature in psychophysics, neuropsychology and neuroscience. Although still a very new field, several recent studies suggest there are specific brain circuits devoted to monitoring and reporting confidence, whereas others suggest that confidence information is encoded within decision-making circuits. We provide suggestions, based on interdisciplinary research, to disentangle these disparate results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many behaviors necessary for organism survival are learned anew and become organized as complex sequences of actions. Recent studies suggest that cortico-basal ganglia circuits are important for chunking isolated movements into precise and robust action sequences that permit the achievement of particular goals. During sequence learning many neurons in the basal ganglia develop sequence-related activity related to the initiation, execution, and termination of sequences suggesting that action sequences are processed as action units. Corticostriatal plasticity is critical for the crystallization of action sequences, and for the development of sequence-related neural activity. Furthermore, this sequence-related activity is differentially expressed in direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways. These findings have implications for understanding the symptoms associated with movement and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the understanding of emotion recognition deficits in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common form of focal epilepsies. There are conflicting reports about impairments for different emotions in right and left temporal lobe epilepsy patients. A systematic review and a narrative synthesis was conducted for studies investigating emotion recognition (ER) in TLE. Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Pubmed were searched from 1990 to March 2015 and reference lists were reviewed. 996 citations were identified and 43 studies were finally included.
   ER deficits are consistently observed across studies. A fear recognition deficit is always reported, followed by deficits in sadness and disgust recognition. Deficits are observed across visual and auditory domains. Conflicting evidence is present concerning the severity of ER deficits in right and left TLE. Studies on anterior temporal lobectomy report data similar to that observed in pre-surgical patients.
   Current evidence supports the conclusion that recognition of negative emotions is commonly impaired in TLE, particularly for fear, and in the visual domain. Future work should focus on more ecologically valid test, on longitudinal studies to assess the role of anterior temporal lobectomy, and to correlate ER measures to social functioning in everyday life.

AB  - The field of psychology and law, including forensic psychology, is an exciting concentration of research activity and student training and has grown rapidly, but to what extent have teaching and training efforts in the field been systematically catalogued and evaluated? We conducted a historical review and content analysis of the American and Canadian literature on the scholarship of teaching and training in the field. This review catalogs (a) information related to the development of training and teaching, (b) descriptions of programs and courses at various levels, and (c) articles on teaching resources or techniques in this field. We hope it serves as a useful guide to the literature resources for those in the field and a catalyst for future interest in this area of scholarship, especially for future evaluations of teaching and training.

AB  - This paper is one of three synthesis documents produced via an integrated assessment (IA) that aims to increase understanding of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Ghana. Given the complexities surrounding ASGM, an integrated assessment (IA) framework was utilized to analyze socio-economic, health, and environmental data, and co-develop evidence-based responses with stakeholders. This paper focuses on the causes, status, trends, and consequences of ecological issues related to ASGM activity in Ghana. It reviews dozens of studies and thousands of samples to document evidence of heavy metals contamination in ecological media across Ghana. Soil and water mercury concentrations were generally lower than guideline values, but sediment mercury concentrations surpassed guideline values in 64% of samples. Arsenic, cadmium, and lead exceeded guideline values in 67%, 17%, and 24% of water samples, respectively. Other water quality parameters near ASGM sites show impairment, with some samples exceeding guidelines for acidity, turbidity, and nitrates. Additional ASGM-related stressors on environmental quality and ecosystem services include deforestation, land degradation, biodiversity loss, legacy contamination, and potential linkages to climate change. Though more research is needed to further elucidate the long-term impacts of ASGM on the environment, the plausible consequences of ecological damages should guide policies and actions to address the unique challenges posed by ASGM.

AB  - Ecosystem engineering is increasingly recognized as a relevant ecological driver of diversity and community composition. Although engineering impacts on the biota can vary from negative to positive, and from trivial to enormous, patterns and causes of variation in the magnitude of engineering effects across ecosystems and engineer types remain largely unknown. To elucidate the above patterns, we conducted a meta-analysis of 122 studies which explored effects of animal ecosystem engineers on species richness of other organisms in the community. The analysis revealed that the overall effect of ecosystem engineers on diversity is positive and corresponds to a 25% increase in species richness, indicating that ecosystem engineering is a facilitative process globally. Engineering effects were stronger in the tropics than at higher latitudes, likely because new or modified habitats provided by engineers in the tropics may help minimize competition and predation pressures on resident species. Within aquatic environments, engineering impacts were stronger in marine ecosystems (rocky shores) than in streams. In terrestrial ecosystems, engineers displayed stronger positive effects in arid environments (e.g. deserts). Ecosystem engineers that create new habitats or microhabitats had stronger effects than those that modify habitats or cause bioturbation. Invertebrate engineers and those with lower engineering persistence (<1 year) affected species richness more than vertebrate engineers which persisted for >1 year. Invertebrate species richness was particularly responsive to engineering impacts. This study is the first attempt to build an integrative framework of engineering effects on species diversity; it highlights the importance of considering latitude, habitat, engineering functional group, taxon and persistence of their effects in future theoretical and empirical studies.

AB  - There is a replication crisis in science, to which psychological research has not been immune: Many effects have proven uncomfortably difficult to reproduce. Although the reliability of data is a serious concern, we argue that there is a deeper and more insidious problem in the field: the persistent and dramatic misinterpretation of empirical results that replicate easily and consistently. Using a series of four highly studied "textbook" examples from different research domains (eyewitness memory, deductive reasoning, social psychology, and child welfare), we show how simple unrecognized incompatibilities among dependent measures, analysis tools, and the properties of data can lead to fundamental interpretive errors. These errors, which are not reduced by additional data collection, may lead to misguided research efforts and policy recommendations. We conclude with a set of recommended strategies and research tools to reduce the probability of these persistent and largely unrecognized errors. The use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves is highlighted as one such recommendation.

AB  - In the nervous system, neurons contact each other to form neuronal circuits and drive behavior, relying heavily on synaptic connections. The proper development and growth of synapses allows functional transmission of electrical information between neurons or between neurons and muscle fibers. Defects in synapse-formation or development lead to many diseases. Autophagy, a major determinant of protein turnover, is an essential process that takes place in developing synapses. During the induction of autophagy, proteins and cytoplasmic components are encapsulated in autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. The cargoes are subsequently degraded and recycled. However, aberrant autophagic activity may lead to synaptic dysfunction, which is a common pathological characteristic in several disorders. Here, we review the current understanding of autophagy in regulating synaptic development and function. In addition, autophagy-related synaptic dysfunction in human diseases is also summarized.

   MethodSystematic review of electronic databases from inception till November 2014. Articles reporting the prevalence of T2DM in people with schizophrenia and healthy controls (without mental illness) were included. Two independent authors conducted searches and extracteddata. A random effects relative risks (RR) meta-analysis was conducted.
   ResultsTwenty-five studies including 145718 individuals with schizophrenia (22.5-54.4years) and 4343407 controls were included. The prevalence of T2DM in people with schizophrenia was 9.5% (95% CI = 7.0-12.8, n=145718) and 10.75% (95% CI 7.44-14.5%, n=2698) in studies capturing T2DM according to recognized criteria. The pooled RR across all studies was 1.82 (95% CI = 1.56-2.13; = 4489125). Subgroup analyses found a RR of 2.53 (95% CI = 1.68-3.799, n=17727) in studies ascertaining T2DM according to recognized criteria and RR 1.65 (95% CI = 1.34-2.03, n=4243389) in studies relying on T2DM determined through medical records.
   ConclusionPeople with schizophrenia are at least double the risk of developing T2DM according to recognized T2DM criteria. Proactive lifestyle and screening programmes should be given clinical priority.

AB  - The etymology of schizophrenia implies poor functional integration of sensory, cognitive and affective processes. Multisensory integration (MSI) is a spontaneous perceptual-cognitive process by which relevant information from multiple sensory modalities is extracted to generate a holistic experience. Deficits in MSI may hinder prompt and appropriate behavioural responses in a complex and transient environment. Despite extensive investigation of sensory, cognitive and affective processing in patients with schizophrenia, little is known about how MSI is affected in the illness. We systemically searched the PubMed electronic database and reviewed twenty-nine behavioural and neuroimaging studies examining MSI in patients with schizophrenia. The available evidence indicates impaired MSI for non-emotional stimuli in schizophrenia, especially for linguistic information. There is also evidence for altered MSI for emotional stimuli, although findings are inconsistent and may be modality-specific. Brain functional alterations in the superior temporal cortex and inferior frontal cortex appear to underlie the deficits in both non-emotional and emotional MSI. The limitations of the experimental paradigms used and directions for future research are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The selective degradation of damaged or excessive mitochondria by autophagy is termed mitophagy. Mitophagy is crucial for mitochondrial quality control and has been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders as well as in ischemic brain injury. Emerging evidence suggested that the role of mitophagy in cerebral ischemia may depend on different pathological processes. In particular, a neuroprotective role of mitophagy has been proposed, and the regulation of mitophagy seems to be important in cell survival. For these reasons, extensive investigations aimed to profile the mitophagy process and its underlying molecular mechanisms have been executed in recent years. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the mitophagy process and its role in cerebral ischemia, and focus on the pathological events and molecules that regulate mitophagy in ischemic brain injury.

This systematic review aims to provide a current and comprehensive summary of empirical research findings on psychological evaluation practice. Twenty studies published from 1997 to 2013 in North America were included from a systematic literature search and analyzed in detail. Results are presented for a number of evaluation-related parameters, such as the kind of mental health professional evaluating, the assessment methods applied in evaluation practice, evaluator's recommendations, and mental health characteristics of the evaluated families. Results are displayed both for evaluations in cases of child custody and visitation rights and for evaluations in cases of termination of parental rights. Current strengths and weaknesses in evaluation practice and evaluation research are discussed. Recommendations for practice and future research are considered.

AB  - In the last decades, prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has escalated in Nepal. This study reviews existing evidence on the burden of non-communicable diseases in Nepal using the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley for scoping reviews. A total of 110 articles were identified from database searches, and four from additional searches. The titles and abstracts were reviewed using predetermined screening criteria. We limited our search to existing literature in English language and included all studies regardless of year of study. Both observational and interventional studies were included. Studies conducted outside Nepal and studies not reporting prevalence of NCDs were excluded. Additionally, we searched reference lists of included publications. All previous reports of Step Wise Surveillance to NCDs (STEPS Surveys) were included in the review. Finally, a total of 60 articles were included in this review. Limited studies on population-based prevalence of mental illness, chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and road traffic accidents were found. There were limitations in the studies related to generalizability due to small sample sizes, non-random sampling and lack of studies from certain region of country. Nevertheless, high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was found. Similarly, hospital-based studies reported high burden of cardiovascular diseases among outpatient contacts. Population-based cancer registries do not exist in Nepal. However, existing studies report 8,000-10,000 cancer deaths annually in Nepal. The most common cancer site in males was the lung, followed by the oral cavity and gastric, while the first three in females were cervix uteri, breast and lung. Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was also high. Despite alarming burden of NCDs, the country's response is weak. Nepal needs to build non-communicable disease programmes with focus on disease prevention and management as well as awareness activities in urban and rural settings at community level.

AB  - The present review addresses the physiological correlates of planning effects on behavior. Although intentions to act qualify as predictors of behavior, accumulated evidence indicates that there is a substantial gap between even strong intentions and subsequent action. One effective strategy to reduce this intention behavior gap is the formation of implementation intentions that specify when, where, and how to act on a given goal in an if-then format Of I encounter situation Y, then I will initiate action Z!"). It has been proposed that implementation intentions render the mental representation of the situation highly accessible and establish a strong associative link between the mental representations of the situation and the action. These process assumptions have been examined in behavioral research, and in physiological research, a field that has begun to investigate the temporal dynamics of and brain areas involved in implementation intention effects. In the present review, we first summarize studies on the cognitive processes that are central to the strategic automation of action control by implementation intentions. We then examine studies involving critical samples with impaired self-regulation. Lastly, we review studies that have applied physiological measures such as heart rate, cortisol level, and eye movement, as well as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on the neural correlates of implementation intention effects. In support of the assumed processes, implementation intentions increased goal attainment in studies on cognitive processes and in critical samples, modulated brain waves related to perceptual and decision processes, and generated less activity in brain areas associated with effortful action control. In our discussion, we reflect on the status quo of physiological research on implementation intentions, methodological and conceptual issues, related research, and propose future directions.

AB  - The long-term replacement therapy with the dopamine (DA) precursor 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) is a milestone in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although this drug precursor can be metabolized into the active neurotransmitter DA throughout the brain, its therapeutic benefit is due to restoring extracellular DA levels within the dorsal striatum, which lacks endogenous DA as a consequence of the neurodegenerative process induced by the disease. In the early phases of PD, L-DOPA treatment is able to restore both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP), two major forms of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity that are altered by dopaminergic denervation. However, unlike physiological DA transmission, this therapeutic approach in the advanced phase of the disease leads to abnormal peaks of DA, non-synaptically released, which are supposed to trigger behavioural sensitization, namely L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. This condition is characterized by a loss of synaptic depotentiation, an inability to reverse previously induced LTP. In the advanced stages of PD, L-DOPA can also induce non-motor fluctuations with cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as compulsive behaviours and impulse control disorders. Although the mechanisms underlying the role of L-DOPA in both motor and behavioural symptoms are still incompletely understood, recent data from electrophysiological and imaging studies have increased our understanding of the function of the brain areas involved and of the mechanisms implicated in both therapeutic and adverse actions of L-DOPA in PD patients.

AB  - People with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia (SCZ), schizoaffective disorder (SD), or other non-affective psychoses (ONAP), have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) than general population. However, previous meta-analyses failed to explore if people with SD are more likely to suffer from MetS than SCZ and ONAP.
   We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing rates of MetS in SD with those in SCZ or ONAP. We searched main electronic databases for relevant articles published up to January 2015, and for unpublished data, contacting corresponding authors, to minimize selective reporting bias. Odds ratios (ORs) based on random effects models, with 95% confidence intervals (Cis), and heterogeneity (12), were estimated. We performed leave-one-out, quality-based, and subgroups analyses to check findings validity. Testing for publication bias, Egger's test estimates were reported.
   We included 7616 individuals (1632 with SD and 5984 with SCZ/ONAP) from 30 independent samples. SD, as compared with SCZ/ONAP, had a random-effect pooled OR (95%CI) for MetS of 1.41 (1.23-1.61; p < 0.001; 12 = 5%). No risk of publication bias was found (p = 0.85). Leave-one-out, sensitivity, and subgroups analyses confirmed the association.
   To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis comparing MetS comorbidity between individuals with SD and those with SCZ or ONAP. SD subjects are more likely to suffer from MetS, with consistent findings across the studies included. However, the role of explanatory factors of this association, and the relative contribution of MetS subcomponents, deserve further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: The concept of "Abnormal illness behavior (AIB)" has been evolved to a greater extent in the last century. Henry Sigerist introduced the concept of "illness behavior" in 1929. Mechanic & Volkart defined and further conceptualized the impression on illness behavior. Talcott Parson had given the concept of "Sick role," and Issy Pilosky had familiarized the notion of "abnormal illness behavior." The main objective of this article is to review the conceptual evolution on "abnormal illness behavior" and to analyze its current clinical implications. Methods: Extensive search of literature was performed regarding abnormal illness behavior, illness behavior and sick role in online web searching sites like - Google Scholar, PubMed and individual journal sites as well as google books. The literature was critically reviewed with personal inputs from authors. Results: Abnormal illness behavior ranges from denial of illness in one extreme to conscious amplification of symptoms on the other. Abnormal illness behavior is noticed in various clinical conditions like stress-related disorder, stress-related disorders, factitious disorder and malingering. Conclusions: Identifying abnormal illness behavior can prevent unnecessary and excessive utilization of medical aids for the same.

AB  - Oxidative stress has become an exciting area of research on schizophrenia, which is a highly prevalent condition that affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are considered metabolic biomarkers of increased oxidative stress, have a pathogenic role in the development and progression of different oxidative stress-based diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia. AGE formation and accumulation as well as the activation of its receptor (RAGE) can lead to signaling through several inflammatory signaling pathways and further damaging effects. This systematic review is based on a search conducted in July 2014 in which 6 studies were identified that met our criteria. In this work, we describe how recent methodological advances regarding the role of AGEs may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and provide a different approach in the comprehension of the relationship between cardiovascular disease and schizophrenia. These latest findings may lead to new directions for future research on novel diagnostic and treatment strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: As systems care become more complex and comorbid medical and psychiatric illness becomes more evident, it is essential to prepare psychiatric trainees for practice in more integrated models of care. Objective: We sought to identify readings available for residency training in consultation-liaison C-L) psychiatry/psychosomatic medicine with the intent to help educators and trainees identify appropriate and essential learning resources within the field. Methods: We reviewed readings available to the residents (including commonly used textbooks in C-L psychiatry and C-L training programs' required reading lists') and identified areas of consensus regarding the topics germane to the care of patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric illness (namely depression, dementia, and delirium) and the education of trainees. Results: There was considerable variation in the references cited by well-regarded textbooks and by reading lists created for trainees in C-L psychiatry. In the 4 textbooks reviewed, there were 83 shared citations on delirium (including 10 citations that were common to all 4 textbooks and 17 citations shared by 3 textbooks.). Markedly less overlap was noted in the chapters on depression (only 2 references cited in all of the textbooks with relevant content) and dementia (only 7 shared references). Conclusion: Given the paucity of overlap of citations in commonly used textbooks., we recommend that practical topical reviews or textbook chapters be used as core (required) or recommended readings for residents on C-L psychiatry rotations, supplemented by a small number of studies or case series that illustrate key tea lung points on each essential topic.

AB  - Organisms are regularly subjected to abiotic stressors related to increasing anthropogenic activities, including chemicals and climatic changes that induce major stresses. Based on various key taxa involved in ecosystem functioning (photosynthetic microorganisms, plants, invertebrates), we review how organisms respond and adapt to chemical- and temperature-induced stresses from molecular to population level. Using field-realistic studies, our integrative analysis aims to compare i) how molecular and physiological mechanisms related to protection, repair and energy allocation can impact life history traits of stressed organisms, and ii) to what extent trait responses influence individual and population responses. Common response mechanisms are evident at molecular and cellular scales but become rather difficult to define at higher levels due to evolutionary distance and environmental complexity. We provide new insights into the understanding of the impact of molecular and cellular responses on individual and population dynamics and assess the potential related effects on communities and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Objective Parental perception of a child vulnerability (PPCV) to illness, not justified by medically noticeable symptoms, is a situation well known to medical and paramedical staff. It is still disputed whether PPCV is triggered by the child's health problems or by parental emotional status. This review is aimed to clarify the etiology of PPCV in instances of preterm birth. Method PRISMA guidelines were followed. MEDLINE and Scopus indexes were searched. Of the 70 articles yielded by the search, 14 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, of which 10 could be included in the meta-analysis. Results Children's physiological factors and parents' psychological factors were both found to significantly influence PPCV, in different ways, at different ages of the child. Conclusion PPCV etiology appears to mostly depend on parents' psychological factors. A better understanding of PPCV etiology could help protect children from distorted parental interaction and reduce parental demands for unnecessary medical care.

   Aims To provide an accurate overview of the controlled trials that have evaluated the effects of height-adjustable workstation interventions on workplace sitting time in office-based workers.
   Methods A comprehensive search was conducted up until March 2014 in the following databases: Medline, PsychINFO, CENTRAL, EMBASE and PEDro. To identify unpublished studies and grey literature, the reference lists of relevant official or scientific web pages were also checked. Studies assessing the effectiveness of height-adjustable workstations using a randomized or non-randomized controlled design were included.
   Results The initial search yielded a total of 8497 citations. After a thorough selection process, five studies were included with 172 participants. A formal quality assessment indicated that risk of bias was high in all studies and heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes prevented meta-analysis. Nevertheless, all studies reported that height-adjustable workstation interventions reduced occupational sitting time in office workers. There was insufficient evidence to determine effects on other relevant health outcomes (e.g. body composition, musculoskeletal symptoms, mental health).
   Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions regarding the effects of installing height-adjustable workstations on sedentary behaviour and associated health outcomes in office workers. Larger and longer term controlled studies are needed, which include more representative populations.

   Evidence Acquisition: Key words relevant to "prevalence of multiple sclerosis" were searched for with countries in the Middle East.
   Results: A prevalence of 31-55 per 100,000 individuals has been reported for Persian Gulf countries. The reported prevalence per Kuwait (n = 85.05) and United Arab Emirate (n = 54.4) seems to be high. The reported prevalence for Turkey and Jordan were 51 and 20, correspondingly. Within Iran, the highest and lowest prevalence seem to belong to Isfahan (n = 93.06) and Golestan (n = 18.0), respectively. Immunomodulating drugs such as Interferon-beta as a first-line therapy; and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, and azathioprine have been considered as second-line therapies.
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of MS in the Middle East might be pointed toward the adverse effects of low vitamin D, individual daily life, smoking, Epstein-Barr virus infection, hereditary affects, and a history of depression.

AB  - Oxidative stress plays important roles in a wide range of diseases such as cancer, inflammatory disease, neurodegenerative disorders, etc. Tyrosine nitration in a protein is a chemically stable oxidative modification, and a marker of oxidative injuries. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a key technique to identify nitrotyrosine-containing proteins and nitrotyrosine sites in endogenous and synthetic nitroproteins and nitropeptides. However, in vivo nitrotyrosine-containing proteins occur with extreme low-abundance to severely challenge the use of MS to identify in vivo nitroproteins and nitrotyrosine sites. A preferential enrichment of nitroproteins and/or nitropeptides is necessary before MS analysis. Current enrichment methods include immuno-affinity techniques, chemical derivation of the nitro group plus target isolations, followed with tandem mass spectrometry analysis. This article reviews the MS techniques and pertinent before-MS enrichment techniques for the identification of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins. This article reviews future trends in the field of nitroproteomics, including quantitative nitroproteomics, systems biological networks of nitroproteins, and structural biology study of tyrosine nitration to completely clarify the biological functions of tyrosine nitration.

AB  - Positive illusions are associated with unrealistic optimism about the future and an inflated assessment of one's abilities. They are prevalent in normal life and are considered essential for maintaining a healthy mental state, although, there are disagreements to the extent to which people demonstrate these positive illusions and whether they are beneficial or not. But whatever the situation, it is hard to dismiss their existence and their positive and/or negative influence on human behavior and decision making in general. Prominent among illusions is that of control, that is "the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events." This paper describes positive illusions, their potential benefits but also quantifies their costs in five specific fields (gambling, stock and other markets, new firms and startups, preventive medicine and wars). It is organized into three parts. First the psychological reasons giving rise to positive illusions are described and their likely harm and benefits stated. Second, their negative consequences are presented and their costs are quantified in five areas seriously affected with emphasis to those related to the illusion of control that seems to dominate those of unrealistic optimism. The costs involved are huge and serious efforts must be undertaken to understand their enormity and steps taken to avoid them in the future. Finally, there is a concluding section where the challenges related to positive illusions are noted and directions for future research are presented.

AB  - Facial expressions are valuable for conveying and understanding the inner thoughts and feelings of the expressor. However, the adaptive value associated with a specific expression on a male face is different from a female face. The present review uses a functional-evolutionary analysis to elucidate the evolutionary advantage in the expression and perception of angry-male and happy-female faces over angry-female and happy-male faces. For the expressors, it is more advantageous for men to show angry facial expression as it signals dominance, averts aggression and deters mate poaching; it is more advantageous for women to display happy facial expression as it signals their willingness for childcare, tending and befriending. For the perceivers, those sensitive to angry men avoid being physically harmed while those sensitive to happy women gain social support. Extant evidence suggests that facial structure and cognitive mechanisms evolved to express and perceive angry-male and happy-female faces more efficiently compared to angry-female and happy-male faces.

AB  - Antarctic notothenioids dominate the fish fauna of the Southern Ocean. Evolution for millions of years at cold and stable temperatures has led to the acquisition of numerous biochemical traits that allow these fishes to thrive in sub-zero waters. The gain of antifreeze glycoproteins has afforded notothenioids the ability to avert freezing and survive at temperatures often hovering near the freezing point of seawater. Additionally, possession of cold-adapted proteins and membranes permits them to sustain appropriate metabolic rates at exceptionally low body temperatures. The notothenioid genome is also distinguished by the disappearance of traits in some species, losses that might prove costly in a warmer environment. Perhaps the best-illustrated example is the lack of expression of hemoglobin in white-blooded icefishes from the family Channichthyidae. Loss of key elements of the cellular stress response, notably the heat shock response, has also been observed. Along with their attainment of cold tolerance, notothenioids have developed an extreme stenothermy and many species perish at temperatures only a few degrees above their habitat temperatures. Thus, in light of today's rapidly changing climate, it is critical to evaluate how these extreme stenotherms will respond to rising ocean temperatures. It is conceivable that the remarkable cold specialization of notothenioids may ultimately leave them vulnerable to future thermal increases and threaten their fitness and survival. Within this context, our review provides a current summary of the biochemical losses and gains that are known for notothenioids and examines these cold-adapted traits with a focus on processes underlying thermal tolerance and acclimation capacity.

AB  - In resource-limited contexts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a considerable proportion of individuals seeking care for mental disorders consult traditional and religious healers in their pathway to mental health care. Reports from Africa suggest that early involvement of healers may result in delays in the care pathway; a potential barrier to early identification and intervention.
   A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the proportion of patients attending formal health services after making first contact for treatment of mental disorders with traditional or religious healers or other informal and formal care providers within published research in Africa. Electronic databases were searched for the period from January 1990 to February 2014. Quality assessment of included studies was conducted the SAQOR tool.
   Fourteen papers were identified with data on category of first care provider. Utilizing random effects modelling with inverse variance method, the pooled proportion of participants making first contact for treatment of mental disorders with two broadly categorised providers (informal and formal) was 48.1 % (95 % CI 36.4-60.0 %) and 49.2 % (95 % CI 38.0-60.4 %), respectively. The pooled proportion of participants making first contact with specific providers was: traditional healers (17.0 %, 95 % CI 10.9-24.1 %); religious healers (26.2 %, 95 % CI 18.1-35.1 %); general health services (24.3 %, 95 % CI 16.9-32.5 %); and mental health services (13.0 %, 95 % CI 5.1-23.5 %). Substantial regional variation in patterns of first provider choice was evident.
   Conclusions of this review must be qualified in the light of several limitations. Approximately half of individuals seeking formal health care for mental disorders in Africa, choose traditional and religious healers as their first care provider. Previous reports suggest that this choice is associated with delays in accessing formal mental health services. Strategies to improve pathways to mental health care in Africa must include innovative programmes aimed at fostering collaboration between biomedical mental health services and these key community-based providers.

AB  - Brassinosteroids are plant steroidal compounds involved in many functions related with plant development, metabolism, signalling and defense against a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. Plant architecture, which has a major effect on crop yield, is strongly influenced by brassinosteroids action. Brassinosteroids are recognized as key regulators of plant growth and development involved in a broad spectrum of processes at the molecular, cellular, and physiological levels. These roles suggest that many of the constraints of present agricultural production might be alleviated by manipulation of genetic determinants dealing with brassinosteroids, as well as by its exogenous application. Brassinosteroids are natural, nontoxic, non-genotoxic, biosafe, and eco-friendly, and can therefore be used in agriculture and horticulture to improve the growth, yields, quality, and tolerance of various plants to biotic and abiotic stresses. The present paper comprehensively reviews the latest results in the field of brassinosteroids and envisages future impacts in agriculture.

The current review aimed to evaluate evidence of the psychological correlates of sensory processing patterns in individuals with ASD. Primary studies investigating sensory processing patterns in children and adolescents with ASD were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases and evaluated for methodological rigor and reporting quality. In 21 studies, associations between sensory processing patterns and psychological correlates were found. Sensory hyporesponsiveness was correlated with core features of ASD. Social awareness difficulties and affective disorders were associated with hyperresponsiveness. Mixed results were found for repetitive behaviours. Further research is needed to confirm, clarify and extend these findings.

AB  - Salinity represents a critical environmental factor for all aquatic organisms, including fishes. Environments of stable salinity are inhabited by stenohaline fishes having narrow salinity tolerance ranges. Environments of variable salinity are inhabited by euryhaline fishes having wide salinity tolerance ranges. Euryhaline fishes harbor mechanisms that control dynamic changes in osmoregulatory strategy from active salt absorption to salt secretion and from water excretion to water retention. These mechanisms of dynamic control of osmoregulatory strategy include the ability to perceive changes in environmental salinity that perturb body water and salt homeostasis (osmosensing), signaling networks that encode information about the direction and magnitude of salinity change, and epithelial transport and permeability effectors. These mechanisms of euryhalinity likely arose by mosaic evolution involving ancestral and derived protein functions. Most proteins necessary for euryhalinity are also critical for other biological functions and are preserved even in stenohaline fish. Only a few proteins have evolved functions specific to euryhaline fish and they may vary in different fish taxa because of multiple independent phylogenetic origins of euryhalinity in fish. Moreover, proteins involved in combinatorial osmosensing are likely interchangeable. Most euryhaline fishes have an upper salinity tolerance limit of approximately 2x seawater (60 g kg(-1)). However, some species tolerate up to 130 g kg(-1) salinity and they may be able to do so by switching their adaptive strategy when the salinity exceeds 60 g kg(-1). The superior salinity stress tolerance of euryhaline fishes represents an evolutionary advantage favoring their expansion and adaptive radiation in a climate of rapidly changing and pulsatory fluctuating salinity. Because such a climate scenario has been predicted, it is intriguing to mechanistically understand euryhalinity and how this complex physiological phenotype evolves under high selection pressure.

AB  - Ectothermic species like fishes differ greatly in the thermal ranges they tolerate; some eurythermal species may encounter temperature ranges in excess of 25 degrees C, whereas stenothermal species in polar and tropical waters live at essentially constant temperatures. Thermal specialization comes with fitness trade-offs and as temperature increases due to global warming, the physiological basis of specialization and thermal plasticity has become of great interest. Over the past 50 years, comparative physiologists have studied the physiological and molecular differences between stenothermal and eurythermal fishes. It is now well known that many stenothermal fishes have lost an inducible heat shock response (HSR). Recent advances in transcriptomics have now made it possible to examine genome-wide changes in gene expression (GE) in non-model ecologically important fish, broadening our view beyond the HSR to regulation of genes involved in hundreds of other cellular processes. Here, we review the major findings from transcriptomic studies of extreme eurythermal and stenothermal fishes in response to acute and long-term exposure to temperature, both time scales being critically important for predicting climate change responses. We consider possible molecular adaptations that underlie eurythermy and stenothermy in teleosts. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges that still face the field of comparative environmental genomics and suggest fruitful paths of future investigation.

AB  - The serotonin transporter polymorphism has been implicated in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, molecular genetic association studies have yielded inconsistent results. Variation may be due to lack of OCD subtype classification. The goal of this systematic review is to investigate the association of the S-allele of the serotonin transporter polymorphism with OCD and OCD subtypes. A total of 69 studies were initially found through a systematic search of the literature but only 13 with sufficient information to compute odds ratios were suitable for review. A total of 1991 participants with OCD and their 5-HTTLPR allele status were examined. The primary outcome measures were allele frequency and OCD diagnosis. A full meta-analysis was completed comparing the L- and S-alleles using a random effects model in RevMan 5.2.1. Further, a secondary meta-analysis stratified by sex and late-onset was conducted for S- versus L-allele frequency. In the primary meta-analysis, OCD was not associated with the S-allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism (Z = 0.07, p = 0.94). Moreover, late-onset OCD was not associated with the S-allele (Z = 1.45, p = 0.15). However, when stratified by sex, there is an emerging sex-specific relationship. There was a trending association between the S-allele and OCD status in females (Z = 1.62, p = 0.10) but not in males (Z = 0.69, p = 0.49). The findings provide further support for the need of subtype classification of this heterogeneous disorder. Future studies should clearly examine sex differences and OCD age-of-onset. In particular, emphasis should be placed on the effect of female reproductive milestones on OCD onset and symptom exacerbation.

AB  - The aim of this Review is to identify effective interventions and treatment guidelines to manage common types of psychiatric emergencies in non-specialist settings in low-income and middle-income countries. Mental health specialist services in low-income and middle-income countries are scarce. We did a systematic review of interventions for psychiatric emergencies and a literature search for low-income and middle-income-specific treatment guidelines for psychiatric emergencies. A dearth of high-quality guidelines and contextualised primary evidence for management of psychiatric emergencies in low-income and middle-income countries exists. Filling these gaps in present guidelines needs to be an urgent research priority in view of the adverse health and social consequences of such presentations and the present drive to scale up mental health care.

AB  - It has been suggested that physicians are particularly vulnerable to being stalked. Our goal was to examine the prevalence of physicians who have been stalked and the associated consequences for the victims. We conducted multiple searches of PubMed and PsycINFO for articles in English from 1950 to 2013, using the terms stalker, stalking, aggression, assaults, patient, physician, resident, registrar, intern, and trainee. Reference lists of relevant articles were also searched. We developed and used a five-point evaluation tool for critical appraisal of the articles. We found 12 prevalence studies on the stalking of physicians, of which 8 were national surveys and 4 were focused exclusively on stalking. The studies varied in their methodological quality with common limitations including the lack of a national sample, the lack of construct validity of the survey tool and of the provision of a formal definition of stalking, and low response rates. Prevalence rates ranged from 2 to 25 percent, although one study found a prevalence rate of 68.5 percent. Information on the physical and psychological consequences of having been stalked was also limited. Although a substantial minority of physicians reported having been stalked, there remains a dearth of high-quality studies on the topic.

AB  - Background
   De-escalation techniques are a recommended non-physical intervention for the management of violence and aggression in mental health. Although taught as part of mandatory training for all National Health Service (NHS) mental health staff, there remains a lack of clarity around training effectiveness.
   Aims
   To conduct a systematic review of the learning, performance and clinical safety outcomes of de-escalation techniques training.
   Method
   The review process involved a systematic literature search of 20 electronic databases, eligibility screening of results, data extraction, quality appraisal and data synthesis.
   Results
   A total of 38 relevant studies were identified. The strongest impact of training appears to be on de-escalation-related knowledge, confidence to manage aggression and deescalation performance (although limited to artificial training scenarios). No strong conclusions could be drawn about the impact of training on assaults, injuries, containment and organisational outcomes owing to the low quality of evidence and conflicting results.
   Conclusions
   It is assumed that de-escalation techniques training will improve staff's ability to de-escalate violent and aggressive behaviour and improve safety in practice. There is currently limited evidence that this training has these effects. Copyright and usage (C) The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2015.

KW  - ATTITUDES
KW  - NURSES
AB  - Objective: Presentations of self-harm to paramedic and emergency staff are increasing, and despite being the first professionals encountered, patients who self-harm report the quality of care and attitudes from these staff are unsatisfactory. Understanding this care may provide opportunities to improve services. The aim of this study is to enhance knowledge building and theory generation in order to develop practice and policy through a metasynthesis of qualitative research relating to perceptions of paramedic and emergency care for people who self-harm.
   Methods: The metasynthesis draws on Evolved Grounded Theory Methodology (EGTM). A search was undertaken of CINAHL (R), MEDLINE (R), OVID (R) and Psych INFO (R), and grey literature. Subject headings of 'self-harm' were used alongside key words 'suicide', 'paramedic' 'emergency', 'overdose', 'pre-hospital' mental health, ambulance, perceptions of care, emergency.
   Results: A total of 1103 papers were retrieved; 12 were finally included. No papers investigated paramedic care for self-harm. The following metaphors emerged: (a) frustration, futility and legitimacy of care; (b) first contact in the pre-hospital environment: talking, immediate and lasting implications of the moral agent; (c) decision making in self-harm: balancing legislation, risk and autonomy; (d) paramedics' perceptions: harnessing professionalism and opportunities to contribute to the care of self-harm.
   Conclusion: Paramedics are often the first health professional contact following self-harm, yet limited qualitative literature has explored this encounter. Metaphors revealed in this paper highlight challenges in decision making and legislation, also opportunities to improve care through professionalization and tailored education. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Maternal depression increases risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, and recent evidence suggests that body image may play an important role in depression. This systematic review identifies studies of body image and perinatal depression with the goal of elucidating the complex role that body image plays in prenatal and postpartum depression, improving measurement, and informing next steps in research. We conducted a literature search of the PubMed database (1996-2014) for English language studies of (1) depression, (2) body image, and (3) pregnancy or postpartum. In total, 19 studies matched these criteria. Cross-sectional studies consistently found a positive association between body image dissatisfaction and perinatal depression. Prospective cohort studies found that body image dissatisfaction predicted incident prenatal and postpartum depression; findings were consistent across different aspects of body image and various pregnancy and postpartum time periods. Prospective studies that examined the reverse association found that depression influenced the onset of some aspects of body image dissatisfaction during pregnancy, but few evaluated the postpartum onset of body image dissatisfaction. The majority of studies found that body image dissatisfaction is consistently but weakly associated with the onset of prenatal and postpartum depression. Findings were less consistent for the association between perinatal depression and subsequent body image dissatisfaction. While published studies provide a foundation for understanding these issues, methodologically rigorous studies that capture the perinatal variation in depression and body image via instruments validated in pregnant women, consistently adjust for important confounders, and include ethnically diverse populations will further elucidate this association.

AB  - AimTo examine the evidence to support using a staging heuristic for eating disorders, suggesting that the diagnosis of an eating disorder follows a trajectory across the life course. Specifically, to examine whether high-risk markers and prodromal features presenting in childhood and adolescence can later transition to the full manifestation of the illness in early adulthood, and whether over time, the illness can be described as becoming severe and enduring, often resistant to treatment.
   MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive literature search on the MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from using the following terms: staging, duration of illness, early intervention, developmental epidemiology, neurobiological marker, phenotype, partial syndrome, severe enduring, chronic, prospective, longitudinal, cohort, epidemiology, adolescent, adult with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, eating disorder. The evidence was organized according to the staging heuristic defined by McGorry.
   ResultsEvidence from epidemiological studies, neuropsychological findings, treatment responsivity and prognosis, support a specific staging trajectory for anorexia nervosa in that there is a longitudinal trajectory with evidence of neurobiological progression and evidence that interventions matched to stage of illness may optimize the benefit. There is less data at the moment to support such a model for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.
   ConclusionThe staging heuristic is a useful model for anorexia nervosa in terms of providing prognostic information and stage matched interventions. Although the evidence is encouraging, further research is needed before a similar model could be applied for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.

AB  - Organisms experience a wide range of environmental factors such as temperature, salinity and hydrostatic pressure, which pose challenges to biochemical processes. Studies on adaptations to such factors have largely focused on macromolecules, especially intrinsic adaptations in protein structure and function. However, micromolecular cosolutes can act as cytoprotectants in the cellular milieu to affect biochemical function and they are now recognized as important extrinsic adaptations. These solutes, both inorganic and organic, have been best characterized as osmolytes, which accumulate to reduce osmotic water loss. Singly, and in combination, many cosolutes have properties beyond simple osmotic effects, e.g. altering the stability and function of proteins in the face of numerous stressors. A key example is the marine osmolyte trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), which appears to enhance water structure and is excluded from peptide backbones, favoring protein folding and stability and counteracting destabilizers like urea and temperature. Co-evolution of intrinsic and extrinsic adaptations is illustrated with high hydrostatic pressure in deep-living organisms. Cytosolic and membrane proteins and G-protein-coupled signal transduction in fishes under pressure show inhibited function and stability, while revealing a number of intrinsic adaptations in deep species. Yet, intrinsic adaptations are often incomplete, and those fishes accumulate TMAO linearly with depth, suggesting a role for TMAO as an extrinsic 'piezolyte' or pressure cosolute. Indeed, TMAO is able to counteract the inhibitory effects of pressure on the stability and function of many proteins. Other cosolutes are cytoprotective in other ways, such as via antioxidation. Such observations highlight the importance of considering the cellular milieu in biochemical and cellular adaptation.

AB  - Background The developing world accounts for 99% of global maternal deaths. Men in developing countries are the chief decision-makers, determining women's access to maternal health services and influencing their health outcomes. At present, it is unclear whether involving men in maternal health can improve maternal outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the impact of male involvement on maternal health outcomes of women in developing countries.
   Methods Four electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched (up to May 2013), together with reference lists of included studies. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed the quality of studies based on prespecified criteria. Measures of effects were pooled and random effect meta-analysis was conducted, where possible.
   Results Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Male involvement was significantly associated with reduced odds of postpartum depression (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.68 for male involvement during pregnancy; OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.62 for male involvement post partum), and also with improved utilisation of maternal health services (skilled birth attendance and postnatal care). Male involvement during pregnancy and at post partum appeared to have greater benefits than male involvement during delivery.
   Conclusions Male involvement is associated with improved maternal health outcomes in developing countries. Contrary to reports from developed countries, there was little evidence of positive impacts of husbands' presence in delivery rooms. However, more rigorous studies are needed to improve this area's evidence base.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in a range of neurological disorders, such as neurodegenation diseases, cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, sclerosis, and diabetic neuropathy. Protein misfolding and accumulation in the ER lumen initiate unfolded protein response in energy-starved neurons which are relevant to toxic effects. In neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, ER dysfunction is well recognized, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In stroke and ischemia, spinal cord injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic activation of ER stress is considered as main pathogeny which causes neuronal disorders. By targeting components of these ER signaling responses, to explore clinical treatment strategies or new drugs in CNS neurological diseases might become possible and valuable in the future.

AB  - Research is required that can synthesize the experiences of patients with Motor Neuron Disease (MND). One value of being able to do this is to understand the psychological experiences and processes involved in maintaining mental well-being and hope. A qualitative thematic synthesis of studies was undertaken. Studies were electronically searched from inception until June 2014. Twenty-nine studies with 342 (175 male) unique individuals with MND were identified. Five themes were identified: (1)The effects of the disease on interactions, relationships, roles and meaningful activities, (2) Responses that relate to the expression of hope, (3) Factors which disable hope, (4) Factors which enable hope, and (5) Cognitive and Practical adaptation that enabled hope, control and coping. Finally, a model of hope enablement was identified that considers the psychological pathways undertaken by a patient which influence mental well-being and hope. Within this review article evidence is provided which illustrates the central importance of relationships and social support for individuals with MND. Further, it has been identified that periods of coping are possible and are likely associated with greater mental well-being for patients with MND.

AB  - Working memory denotes the ability to retain stimuli in mind that are no longer physically present and to perform mental operations on them. Electro- and magnetoencephalography allow investigating the short-term maintenance of acoustic stimuli at a high temporal resolution. Studies investigating working memory for non-spatial and spatial auditory information have suggested differential roles of regions along the putative auditory ventral and dorsal streams, respectively, in the processing of the different sound properties. Analyses of event-related potentials have shown sustained, memory load-dependent deflections over the retention periods. The topography of these waves suggested an involvement of modality-specific sensory storage regions. Spectral analysis has yielded information about the temporal dynamics of auditory working memory processing of individual stimuli, showing activation peaks during the delay phase whose timing was related to task performance. Coherence at different frequencies was enhanced between frontal and sensory cortex. In summary, auditory working memory seems to rely on the dynamic interplay between frontal executive systems and sensory representation regions.

AB  - Visual category perception is thought to depend on brain areas that respond specifically when certain categories are viewed. These category-sensitive areas are often assumed to be "modules" (with some degree of processing autonomy) and to act predominantly on feedforward visual input. This modular view can be complemented by a view that treats brain areas as elements within more complex networks and as influenced by network properties. This network-oriented viewpoint is emerging from studies using either diffusion tensor imaging to map structural connections or effective connectivity analyses to measure how their functional responses influence each other. This literature motivates several hypotheses that predict category-sensitive activity based on network properties. Large, long-range fiber bundles such as inferior fronto-occipital, arcuate and inferior longitudinal fasciculi are associated with behavioral recognition and could play crucial roles in conveying backward influences on visual cortex from anterior temporal and frontal areas. Such backward influences could support top-down functions such as visual search and emotion-based visual modulation. Within visual cortex itself, areas sensitive to different categories appear well-connected (e.g., face areas connect to object- and motion sensitive areas) and their responses can be predicted by backward modulation. Evidence supporting these propositions remains incomplete and underscores the need for better integration of DTI and functional imaging.

The availability and quality of water will be severely affected, and public health threats from the lack of this valuable resource will be great unless water-scarce nations are able to adapt. Saudi Arabia provides a good example of how the climate and unsustainable human activity go hand in hand in creating stress on and depleting water resources, and an example for adaptation and mitigation.
   M E T H O D A search of the English literature addressing climate change, water scarcity, human health, and related topics was conducted using online resources and databases accessed through the University at Albany, State University of New York library web page.
   R E S U L T S Water scarcity, which encompasses both water availability and water quality, is an important indicator of health. Beyond drinking, water supply is intimately linked to food security, sanitation, and hygiene, which are primary contributors to the global burden of disease. Poor and disadvantaged populations are the ones who will suffer most from the negative effects of climate change on water supply and associated human health issues. Examples of adaptation and mitigation measures that can help reduce the strain on conventional water resources (surface waters and fossil aquifers or groundwater) include desalination, wastewater recycling and reuse, and outsourcing food items or "virtual water trade." These are strategies being used by Saudi Arabia, a country that is water poor primarily due to decades of irresponsible irrigation practices. The human and environmental health risks associated with these adaptation measures are examined. Finally, strategies to protect human health through international collaboration and the importance of these efforts are discussed.
   C O N C L U S I O N International, multidisciplinary cooperation and collaboration will be needed to promote global water security and to protect human health, particularly in low-income countries that do not have the resources necessary to adapt on their own.

AB  - The objective of the current review is to integrate information from a series of studies, employing a paradigm that evaluates local contextual processing using electrophysiological measures. Collectively these studies provide an overview of how utilization of predictive context changes as a function of stimulus modality and across different patient populations, as well as the networks that may be critical for this function. The following aspects of local contextual processing will be discussed and reviewed: (i) the correlates associated with contextual processing that have been identified in healthy adults, (ii) stimulus modality effects, (iii) specific alterations and deficits of local contextual processing in aging and across different neurological and psychiatric patient populations, including patients with prefrontal cortex lesions, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, (iv) the potential for utilizing the correlates of local context as biomarkers for frontal cognitive dysfunction and (v) the role of frontal networks in the processing of contextual information. Overall findings show that behavioral and neural correlates associated with processing of local context are comparable across stimulus modalities, but show specific alterations in aging and across different neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: No published systematic review has ever assessed the efficacy and safety of reboxetine for treating of patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Aim: This systematic review aimed to review the available evidence regarding the efficacy of reboxetine for treating ADHD. Method: The databases of Pubmed/Medline, Google scholar, SCOPUS and Web of Science were searched using the Keywords: "reboxetine", "ADHD" and "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder". The reference lists of the included studies were screened to find any possible other relevant articles. All the non-controlled and controlled clinical trials were included. Results: The current evidence mainly consists of un-controlled studies, such as case series. Only three of 33 studies were controlled clinical trials. They are from single sites and included a sub-sample of patients with ADHD. Conclusion: Non-controlled studies and controlled trials support the promising effect of reboxetine for treating ADHD in a sub-sample of patients that are without co-morbid psychiatric disorder and mental retardation. Reboxetine is tolerated well. However, more controlled trials are needed to reach any firm conclusion.

AB  - The field of formal linguistics was founded on the premise that language is mentally represented as a deterministic symbolic grammar. While this approach has captured many important characteristics of the world's languages, it has also led to a tendency to focus theoretical questions on the correct formalization of grammatical rules while also de-emphasizing the role of learning and statistics in language development and processing. In this review we present a different approach to language research that has emerged from the parallel distributed processing or 'connectionist' enterprise. In the connectionist framework, mental operations are studied by simulating learning and processing within networks of artificial neurons. With that in mind, we discuss recent progress in connectionist models of auditory word recognition, reading, morphology, and syntactic processing. We argue that connectionist models can capture many important characteristics of how language is learned, represented, and processed, as well as providing new insights about the source of these behavioral patterns. Just as importantly, the networks naturally capture irregular (non-rule-like) patterns that are common within languages, something that has been difficult to reconcile with rule-based accounts of language without positing separate mechanisms for rules and exceptions.

AB  - The environmental and health consequences of climate change, which disproportionately affect low-income countries and poor people in high-income countries, profoundly affect human rights and social justice. Environmental consequences include increased temperature, excess precipitation in some areas and droughts in others, extreme weather events, and increased sea level. These consequences adversely affect agricultural production, access to safe water, and worker productivity, and, by inundating land or making land uninhabitable and uncultivatable, will force many people to become environmental refugees. Adverse health effects caused by climate change include heat-related disorders, vector-borne diseases, foodborne and waterborne diseases, respiratory and allergic disorders, malnutrition, collective violence, and mental health problems.
   These environmental and health consequences threaten civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, including rights to life, access to safe food and water, health, security, shelter, and culture. On a national or local level, those people who are most vulnerable to the adverse environmental and health consequences of climate change include poor people, members of minority groups, women, children, older people, people with chronic diseases and disabilities, those residing in areas with a high prevalence of climate-related diseases, and workers exposed to extreme heat or increased weather variability. On a global level, there is much inequity, with low-income countries, which produce the least greenhouse gases (GHGs), being more adversely affected by climate change than high-income countries, which produce substantially higher amounts of GHGs yet are less immediately affected. In addition, low-income countries have far less capability to adapt to climate change than high-income countries.
   Adaptation and mitigation measures to address climate change needed to protect human society must also be planned to protect human rights, promote social justice, and avoid creating new problems or exacerbating existing problems for vulnerable populations.

AB  - Blood analyses have great potential in studies of ecology, ecotoxicology and veterinary science in wild vertebrates based on advances in human and domestic animal medicine. The major caveat for field researchers, however, is that the 'rules' for human or domestic animal haematology do not always apply to wildlife. The present overview shows the strengths and limitations of blood analyses in wild vertebrates, and proposes a standardisation of preanalytical procedures plus some suggestions for a more systematic examination of blood smears to increase the diagnostic value of blood data. By discussing the common problems that field researchers face with blood variables, we also aim to highlight common ground enabling new researchers in the field to accurately collect blood samples and interpret and place their haematological findings into the overall picture of an ecological or eco-toxicological study. Besides showing the practicality and ecological relevance of simple blood variables, this study illustrates the suitability of blood samples for the application of cutting-edge analytical procedures for expanding the current repertoire of diagnostic tools in wildlife monitoring and ecosystem health assessment.

AB  - Compulsivity and impulsivity are cross-disorder traits observed in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Aberrant fronto-striatal glutamatergic signalling is core to the understanding of compulsive and impulsive disorders. In this review, the glutamate (Glu) neurochemistry of fronto-striatal circuits in paediatric and adult ASD, ADHD and OCD, as described in 59 studies, is outlined from the perspective of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS). Despite the methodological inconsistencies between studies, two observations stand out that form possible hypotheses for future studies. Firstly, a possible increase in Glx (combination of Glu, glutamine and GABA) in the striatum across ADHD, OCD and ASD. Secondly, an increased Glx signal in the anterior cingulate cortex in paediatric ASD and ADHD but a lower Glx signal in adult ASD and ADHD. This suggests neurodevelopmental changes in fronto-striatal glutamatergic circuits across the lifespan. Future studies should incorporate more homogeneous samples, perform MRS at field strengths of at least 3 Tesla and provide much more precise and standardized information on methods to improve our understanding of fronto-striatal glutamatergic transmission in compulsive and impulsive syndromes.

TI  - Use of Mindfulness Meditation in the Management of Chronic Pain: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
KW  - chronic pain
KW  - complementary and alternative medicine
KW  - meditation
KW  - randomized controlled trial
AB  - Background. Chronic pain is a major health condition that has significant financial and lifestyle implications. Due to the complex etiologies of pain, it is difficult to find treatment modalities that would be universally applicable to the general population presenting for care. Mindfulness meditation is a complimentary treatment modality that has some preliminary, inconclusive evidence in support of its benefit on patients with chronic pain. Objectives. The purpose of this article is to systematically review the current literature for randomized controlled trials that assess the outcomes of mindfulness as an intervention for individuals with chronic pain. Methods. An electronic database search was performed for studies investigating the efficacy of mindfulness in treatment for chronic pain. The studies included were randomized controlled trials, published in English, from a peer-reviewed journal that identified mindfulness as the primary treatment focus for chronic pain in at least one group, and included participants with at least a 12-week history of symptoms. Results. The database search revealed 283 articles, of which 6 met the inclusion criteria. Conclusion. Mindfulness meditation appears to have minimal or statistically insignificant effects on chronic pain according to the current data. However, the effects of mindfulness on mental health scores are significant and may be an area for future trials to target. Well-conducted research is necessary before the effects of mindfulness on chronic pain can be definitively determined.

AB  - Stress often affects our social lives. When undergoing high-level or persistent stress, individuals frequently retract from social interactions and become irritable and hostile. Predisposition to antisocial behaviours - including social detachment and violence - is also modulated by early life adversity; however, the effects of early life stress depend on the timing of exposure and genetic factors. Research in animals and humans has revealed some of the structural, functional and molecular changes in the brain that underlie the effects of stress on social behaviour. Findings in this emerging field will have implications both for the clinic and for society.

AB  - Background: Although adherence to somatic treatment has been studied extensively, adherence to mental health treatment has not. In this study, the term treatment adherence is used to refer to adherence to medication regimes and other non-pharmacological recommended treatments as part of mental health and psychiatric care. Knowledge of factors connected to adolescents' adherence to such treatment is fairly fragmented. Although treatment staff members are broadly aware of the factors that influence adherence, it would be desirable to develop formalized treatment assessment and planning approaches that specifically take these factors into account.
   Objective: The purpose of this article is to review the available data related to factors that affect adolescents' adherence to both medication and non-pharmacological treatments in mental health and psychiatric care. Methods: A systematic literature search that involved four databases was undertaken. A thematic analysis was conducted on 17 studies to extract relevant information.
   Results: It appears that an adolescent's own positive beliefs toward his or her treatment are the main factor that improves his or her adherence to that treatment. Good cohesion with close supportive people appears to be positively related to adherence, whereas sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., race, gender) were not related.
   Conclusions: By identifying the factors related to the treatment adherence of adolescents, this review article can provide guidance to help improve the quality of care and thus further increase adolescents' satisfaction with their mental health and psychiatric treatment.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Autosomal recessive, early-onset cases of PD are predominantly caused by mutations in the parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 genes. Animal and cellular models have verified a direct link between parkin and PINK1, whereby PINK1 phosphorylates and activates parkin at the outer mitochondrial membrane, resulting in removal of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy. Despite the overwhelming evidence for this interaction, few studies have been able to identify a link for DJ-1 with parkin or PINK1. The aim of this review is to summarise the functions of these three proteins, and to analyse the existing evidence for direct and indirect interactions between them. DJ-1 is able to rescue the phenotype of PINK1-knockout Drosophila models, but not of parkin-knockouts, suggesting that DJ-1 may act in a parallel pathway to that of the PINK1/parkin pathway. To further elucidate a commonality between these three proteins, bioinformatics analysis established that Miro (RHOT1) interacts with parkin and PINK1, and HSPA4 interacts with all three proteins. Furthermore, 30 transcription factors were found to be common amongst all three proteins, with many of them being involved in transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, expression of these proteins and their associated transcription factors are found to be significantly down-regulated in PD patients compared to healthy controls. In summary, this review provides insight into common pathways linking three PD-causing genes and highlights some key questions, the answers to which may provide critical insight into the disease process.

AB  - Background: We conducted a scoping review to define the extent and type of quantitative health status research conducted from 1993 to 2014 with people who have experienced detention or incarceration in correctional facilities in Canada.
   Methods: We searched 15 databases, reviewed reference lists and relevant websites, and consulted with key stakeholders to identify eligible studies. We reviewed records for eligibility and extracted relevant data from eligible articles.
   Results: We identified 194 studies that were eligible for inclusion. Most studies were conducted with males and with persons in federal facilities, and focused on mental health, substance use, and social determinant of health outcomes.
   Conclusions: Health status data are limited for several outcomes, such as chronic disease, injury and sexual and reproductive health, and for persons in provincial facilities and post-release. Efforts should be made to improve data collection and knowledge dissemination, so that relevant data can be used more effectively to improve health and health care in this population.

AB  - The idea that people can experience two oppositely valenced emotions has been controversial ever since early attempts to investigate the construct of mixed emotions. This meta-analysis examined the robustness with which mixed emotions have been elicited experimentally. A systematic literature search identified 63 experimental studies that instigated the experience of mixed emotions. Studies were distinguished according to the structure of the underlying affect model dimensional or discrete as well as according to the type of mixed emotions studied (e.g., happy-sad, fearful-happy, positive-negative). The meta-analysis using a random-effects model revealed a moderate to high effect size for the elicitation of mixed emotions (d(IG+) = 0.77), which remained consistent regardless of the structure of the affect model, and across different types of mixed emotions. Several methodological and design moderators were tested. Studies using the minimum index (i.e., the minimum value between a pair of opposite valenced affects) resulted in smaller effect sizes, whereas subjective measures of mixed emotions increased the effect sizes. The presence of more women in the samples was also associated with larger effect sizes. The current study indicates that mixed emotions are a robust, measurable and non-artifactual experience. The results are discussed in terms of the implications for an affect system that has greater versatility and flexibility than previously thought.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer (AD) and Parkinson (PD) have attracted attention in last decades due to their high incidence worldwide. The etiology of these diseases is still unclear: however the role of the environment as a putative risk factor has gained importance. More worryingly is the evidence that pre- and post natal exposures to environmental factors predispose to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases in later life. Neurotoxic metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, cadmium and arsenic, as well as some pesticides and metal based nanoparticles have been involved in AD due to their ability to increase beta-amyloid (A13) peptide and the phosphorylation of Tau protein (P-Tau), causing senile/amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) characteristic of AD. The exposure to lead, manganese, solvents and some pesticides has been related to hallmarks of PD such as mitochondrial dysfunction, alterations in metal homeostasis and aggregation of proteins such as ti-synuclein (1-syn), which is a key constituent of Lewy bodies (LB), a crucial factor in PD pathogenesis. Common mechanisms of environmental pollutants to increase Af), P-Tau, ot-syn and neuronal death have been reported, including the oxidative stress mainly involved in the increase of Ali and Li-syn. and the reduced activity/protein levels of Ar) degrading enzyme (IDE)s such as neprilysin or insulin IDE. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms by maternal nutrient supplementation and exposure to heavy metals and pesticides have been proposed to lead phenotypic diversity and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses data from epidemiological and experimental studies about the role of environmental factors in the development of idiopathic AD and PD, and their mechanisms of action.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slow insidious neurological disorder characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Although several recent preclinical advances have proposed to treat PD, there is hardly any clinically proved new therapeutic for its cure. Increasing evidence suggests a prominent modulatory function of the cannabinoid signaling system in the basal ganglia. Hence, use of cannabinoids as a new therapeutic target has been recommended as a promising therapy for PD. The elements of the endocannabinoid system are highly expressed in the neural circuit of basal ganglia wherein they bidirectionally interact with dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic signaling systems. As the cannabinoid signaling system undergoes a biphasic pattern of change during progression of PD, it explains the motor inhibition typically observed in patients with PD. Cannabinoid agonists such as WIN-55,212-2 have been demonstrated experimentally as neuroprotective agents in PD, with respect to their ability to suppress excitotoxicity, glial activation, and oxidative injury that causes degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Additional benefits provided by cannabinoid related compounds including CE-178253, oleoylethanolamide, nabilone and HU-210 have been reported to possess efficacy against bradykinesia and levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD. Despite promising preclinical studies for PD, use of cannabinoids has not been studied extensively at the clinical level. In this review, we reassess the existing evidence suggesting involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the cause, symptomatology, and treatment of PD. We will try to identify future threads of research that will help in the understanding of the potential therapeutic benefits of the cannabinoid system for treating PD.

AB  - Background: Crisis Resolution Teams (CRTs) aim to offer an alternative to hospital admission during mental health crises, providing rapid assessment, home treatment, and facilitation of early discharge from hospital. CRTs were implemented nationally in England following the NHS Plan of 2000. Single centre studies suggest CRTs can reduce hospital admissions and increase service users' satisfaction: however, there is also evidence that model implementation and outcomes vary considerably. Evidence on crucial characteristics of effective CRTs is needed to allow team functioning to be optimised. This review aims to establish what evidence, if any, is available regarding the characteristics of effective and acceptable CRTs.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched to November 2013. A further web-based search was conducted for government and expert guidelines on CRTs. We analysed studies separately as: comparing CRTs to Treatment as Usual; comparing two or more CRT models; national or regional surveys of CRT services; qualitative studies of stakeholders' views regarding best practice in CRTs; and guidelines from government and expert organisations regarding CRT service delivery. Quality assessment and narrative synthesis were conducted. Statistical meta-analysis was not feasible due to the variety of design of retrieved studies.
   Results: Sixty-nine studies were included. Studies varied in quality and in the composition and activities of the clinical services studied. Quantitative studies suggested that longer opening hours and the presence of a psychiatrist in the team may increase CRTs' ability to prevent hospital admissions. Stakeholders emphasised communication and integration with other local mental health services; provision of treatment at home; and limiting the number of different staff members visiting a service user. Existing guidelines prioritised 24-hour, seven-day-a-week CRT service provision (including psychiatrist and medical prescriber); and high quality of staff training.
   Conclusions: We cannot draw confident conclusions about the critical components of CRTs from available quantitative evidence. Clearer definition of the CRT model is required, informed by stakeholders' views and guidelines. Future studies examining the relationship of overall CRT model fidelity to outcomes, or evaluating the impact of key aspects of the CRT model, are desirable.

AB  - Cognitive decline and disease progression in different neurodegenerative diseases typically involves synaptic dysfunction preceding the neuronal loss. The synaptic dysfunction is suggested to be caused by imbalanced synaptic plasticity i.e. enhanced induction of long-term depression and concomitantly decreased long-term potentiation accompanied with excess stimulation of extrasynaptic N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors due to various disturbances in pre- and postsynaptic sites. Recent research has identified neurodegenerative disease-related changes in protein accumulation and aggregation, gene expression, and protein functions, which may contribute to imbalanced synaptic function. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating synaptic plasticity in health and disease is still lacking and therefore characterization of new candidates involved in these mechanisms is needed. Septins, a highly conserved group of guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, show high neuronal expression and are implicated in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. In this review, we first summarize the evidence how synaptic dysfunction is related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Then, we discuss different aspects of the potential involvement of the septin family members in the regulation of synaptic function in relation to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - For over a quarter century, a substantial body of literature investigating neuropsychological test performance in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has yielded inconsistent results. Thus, it has been continuously challenging to draw conclusions regarding an OCD-specific neuropsychological profile. In this comprehensive review of the neuropsychological literature in OCD, we critically review neuropsychological test performance by domain, as well as potential moderators of neuropsychological functions, proposed endophenotypes, neuropsychological predictors of treatment response, and contemporary controversies in the field. Previous qualitative/systematic reviews of this body of literature have repeatedly noted its inconsistency, concluding that more research is needed. Unfortunately, the accumulation of neuropsychological research is OCD has not yet promoted our ability to draw conclusions about a distinct neuropsychological profile of OCD. Thus, we conclude this review with novel suggestions for future investigations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc, All rights reserved.

AB  - Existence of conserved domains in dystrophin and its associated complexes provide an opportunity to understand the role of dystrophin associated signalling and its association with neuronal metabolism in a variety of model organisms. We critically reviewed the studies till 2013 through established search engines and databases. Thus, we review the role of dystrophin and its isoforms in different animal models at developmental stages in the neuronal metabolism to enhance the therapeutic strategies. Dystrophin interacts with other proteins in such a way that, when affected, it results in co-morbidities including autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. It is speculated that various signalling molecules may converge to disrupt neuronal metabolism not adequately studied. TGF-beta, RhoGAP and CAM mediated signalling molecules are the chief cause of mortalities due to respiratory and cardiac involvement but remain underevaluated targets for cognitive impairment in DMD/BMD. Manipulation of these signalling pathways could be potent intervention in dystrophin induced cognitive impairment while complementary therapeutic approaches may also be helpful in the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with DMD/BMD.

   Methods: PubMed, SciELO and PsychINFO databases were searched for eligible articles published between 1997 and 2013. After screening 1,249 empirical papers, two independent reviewers identified three articles evaluating the frequency of PDs in patients with bipolar disorders assessed in a state of euthymia.
   Results: The total sample comprised 376 euthymic bipolar patients, of whom 155 (41.2%) had at least one comorbid PD. Among them, we found 87 (23.1%) in cluster B, 55 (14.6%) in cluster C, and 25 (6.6%) in cluster A. The frequencies of PD subtypes were: borderline, 38 (10.1%); histrionic, 29 (7.7%); obsessive-compulsive, 28 (7.4%); dependent, 19 (5%); narcissistic, 17 (4.5%); schizoid, schizotypal, and avoidant, 11 patients each (2.95%); paranoid, five (1.3%); and antisocial, three (0.79%).
   Conclusion: The frequency of comorbid PD was high across the spectrum of euthymic bipolar patients. In this population, the most common PDs were those in cluster B, and the most frequent PD subtype was borderline, followed by histrionic and obsessive-compulsive.

AB  - We use the theory of Cartan connections to analyze the geometrical structures underpinning the gauge-theoretical descriptions of the gravitational interaction. According to the theory of Cartan connections, the spin connection. and the soldering form. that define the fundamental variables of the Palatini formulation of general relativity can be understood as different components of a single field, namely a Cartan connection A = omega + theta. In order to stress both the similarities and the differences between the notions of Ehresmann connection and Cartan connection, we explain in detail how a Cartan geometry (P-H -> M, A) can be obtained from a G-principal bundle P-G -> M endowed with an Ehresmann connection (being the Lorentz group H a subgroup of G) by means of a bundle reduction mechanism. We claim that this reduction must be understood as a partial gauge fixing of the local gauge symmetries of P-G, i.e. as a gauge fixing that leaves "unbroken" the local Lorentz invariance. We then argue that the "broken" part of the symmetry - that is the internal local translational invariance - is implicitly preserved by the invariance under the external diffeomorphisms of M.

AB  - Objective: Public health campaigns encouraging early help seeking have increased rates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis in Western countries, but we know little about how to treat or predict dementia outcomes in persons with the condition.
   Method: The authors searched electronic databases and references for longitudinal studies reporting potentially modifiable risk factors for incident dementia after MCI. Two authors independently evaluated study quality using a checklist. Meta-analyses were conducted of three or more studies.
   Results: There were 76 eligible articles. Diabetes and prediabetes increased risk of conversion from amnestic MCI to Alzheimer's dementia; risk in treated versus untreated diabetes was lower in one study. Diabetes was also associated with increased risk of conversion from any-type or non-amnestic MCI to all-cause dementia. Metabolic syndrome and prediabetes predicted all-cause dementia in people with amnestic and any-type MCI, respectively. Mediterranean diet decreased the risk of conversion to Alzheimer's dementia. The presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms or lower serum folate levels predicted conversion from any-type MCI to all-cause dementia, but less formal education did not. Depressive symptoms predicted conversion from any-type MCI to all-cause dementia in epidemiological but not clinical studies.
   Conclusions: Diabetes increased the risk of conversion to dementia. Other prognostic factors that are potentially manageable are prediabetes and the metabolic syndrome, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and tow dietary folate. Dietary interventions and interventions to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, that increase risk of conversion to dementia may decrease new incidence of dementia.

AB  - In this article I give a brief overview of the field of behavior genetics in past and present. I identify several areas of rapid advance, as well as some that are posing problems. The most serious issue currently in need to be addressed is the definition of phenotypes. All too often, certain behavioral constructs are assumed to be evaluated in behavioral tests, without either the test or the construct having been adequately validated. It is most likely that many of the conflicting results and failures to replicate reported in the literature can be traced back to this problem. Validation of behavioral constructs and the ways to test them is urgently needed in both animal and human behavioral and psychiatric genetics.

AB  - Affect detection is an important pattern recognition problem that has inspired researchers from several areas. The field is in need of a systematic review due to the recent influx of Multimodal (MM) affect detection systems that differ in several respects and sometimes yield incompatible results. This article provides such a survey via a quantitative review and meta-analysis of 90 peer-reviewed MM systems. The review indicated that the state of the art mainly consists of person-dependent models (62.2% of systems) that fuse audio and visual (55.6%) information to detect acted (52.2%) expressions of basic emotions and simple dimensions of arousal and valence (64.5%) with feature-(38.9%) and decision-level (35.6%) fusion techniques. However, there were also person-independent systems that considered additional modalities to detect nonbasic emotions and complex dimensions using model-level fusion techniques. The meta-analysis revealed that MM systems were consistently (85% of systems) more accurate than their best unimodal counterparts, with an average improvement of 9.83% (median of 6.60%). However, improvements were three times lower when systems were trained on natural (4.59%) versus acted data (12.7%). Importantly, MM accuracy could be accurately predicted (cross-validated R-2 of 0.803) from unimodal accuracies and two system-level factors. Theoretical and applied implications and recommendations are discussed.

AB  - The loss of a loved one can affect family dynamics by changing the family system and creating the need for family members to reorganize. Good family functioning, which is characterized by open communication, expression of feelings and thoughts and cohesion among family members, facilitates adaptive adjustment to the loss. This study conducted a systematic review of the literature on family dynamics during the grieving process. A search was conducted in the EBSCO, Web of Knowledge and Bireme databases for scientific articles published from January 1980 to June 2013. Of the 389 articles found, only 15 met all the inclusion criteria. The selected studies provided evidence that dysfunctional families exhibit more psychopathological symptoms, more psychosocial morbidity, poorer social functioning, greater difficulty accessing community resources, lower functional capacity at work, and a more complicated grieving process. Family conflicts were also emphasized as contributing to the development of a complicated grieving process, while cohesion, expression of affection and good communication in families are believed to mitigate grief symptoms.

AB  - Plants are sessile beings, so the need of mechanisms to flee from unfavorable circumstances has provided the development of unique and sophisticated responses to environmental stresses. Depending on the degree of plasticity, many morphological, cellular, anatomical, and physiological changes occur in plants in response to abiotic stress. Phytohormones are small molecules that play critical roles in regulating plant growth and development, as well as stress tolerance to promote survival and acclimatize to varying environments. To congregate the challenges of salinity, temperature extremes, and osmotic stress, plants use their genetic mechanism and different adaptive and biological approaches for survival and high production. In the present attempt, we review the potential role of different phytohormones and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in abiotic stresses and summarize the research progress in plant responses to abiotic stresses at physiological and molecular levels. We emphasized the regulatory circuits of abscisic acid, indole acetic acid, cytokinins, gibberellic acid, salicylic acid, brassinosteroids, jasmonates, ethylene, and triazole on exposure to abiotic stresses. Current progress is exemplified by the identification and validation of several significant genes that enhanced crop tolerance to stress in the field. These findings will make the modification of hormone biosynthetic pathways for the transgenic plant generation with augmented abiotic stress tolerance and boosting crop productivity in the coming decades possible.

AB  - With Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud attempted to describe and to account for the facts of daily observation in our field of study' (1920, p. 7), in particular concerning destructive clinical phenomena that confront us in the analytic situation: traumatic neuroses, melancholic states, negative-therapeutic reactions, masochism, repetition compulsion and so on. The author demonstrates in the first section how Freud's own resistance - later self-diagnosed - to recognizing these unwelcome facts was expressed in the terminological and conceptual ambiguities of the death drive hypothesis then introduced, ambiguities that to some extent continue to impede the reception of its clinical usefulness to this day. As soon as Freud had demonstrated the connection with clinical practice more directly in The Ego and the Id (1923), some contemporaries adopted it as a helpful clinical concept, while others believed that they could (and must) refute it. The second part outlines its reception in the 1920s and 1930s, which was part of an international discussion that was, of course, initially conducted mainly in German. The beginnings of an important further development of the death drive hypothesis are described in a separate section because it originated from Melanie Klein's earliest experiences in analysing children in Berlin in the early to mid-1920s. She referred at that time to an evil principle', and in 1932 published her view of the death drive hypothesis, which was further developed in subsequent decades by her and her followers in London. In this period, conditions changed dramatically: in Germany Freud's books (among others) were burnt, crimes against humanity were instigated and psychoanalysis ceased to exist in this country. Almost all the analysts who published on the death drive had to emigrate. From then on, entirely different discourses took place in the various regions. In Germany, the death drive hypothesis was (largely) disregarded or rejected for decades after the Holocaust. Frank demonstrates how the uncritical recourse in relevant works to this day to an article by Brun in 1953 that considered the death drive to have been comprehensively refuted on the basis of (apparently) comprehensive literature research can be understood as a symptom. Pursuing some reflections by Beland (1988) and Cycon (1995), the author expounds her thesis that in Germany the clinical usefulness of the death drive hypothesis could not be considered as long as destructive impulses were still an immediate social reality. According to the author's observations, in stating that there had been a definite reaction formation against death drive hypotheses', Brun had unintentionally made an accurate diagnosis. It was not until the realization of inevitable perpetrator identifications (Hitler in us') in this country became (more widely) possible that a concern with the death drive hypothesis could also resume. In the final section, the author takes up one line of this development and traces how some German analysts in the 1980s came into contact with Kleinian developments that had since occurred and how these found and find their way into their analytic working. She closes by asking whether it might be appropriate to consider Melanie Klein's concept of an evil principle - along with the pleasure and reality principles - as a less ambiguous one for the phenomena under consideration.

Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the work that has been done to identify the different components of CBT and their varying effectiveness for young people with depression.
   MethodsNarrative overview of English language reviews/meta-analyses and primary intervention studies retrieved from searches of computerized databases as well as ancestry searches.
   ResultsReviews of intervention studies of adults as well as young people with depression have shown that behavioural approaches are equally as effective as cognitive approaches in reducing depression symptoms. Post-hoc analyses of large studies in youth depression have also shown that behavioural approaches might be more suitable for young people.
   ConclusionsBehaviourally based approaches appear promising in treating youth depression; however, further research is required. This research will represent an essential step towards refining interventions for youth depression, and enabling interventions to be targeted to particular subgroups, to optimize their effectiveness.

   Most studies involved only men or a majority of men (70/83 studies in which gender was specified); only 16 studies focused on adolescents. Most studies were conducted in the United States (n = 57). The risk of bias for outcomes in almost all studies was unclear or high (n = 91). In 59 studies, interventions led to improved mental health, substance use, infectious diseases, or health service utilization outcomes; in 42 of these studies, outcomes were measured in the community after release.
   Improving the health of people who experience imprisonment requires knowledge generation and knowledge translation, including implementation of effective interventions.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex is involved in a multitude of cognitive, emotional, motivational, and social processes, so exploring its specific functions is crucial for understanding human experience and behavior. Functional imaging approaches have largely contributed to the enhancement of our understanding, but might have limitations in establishing causal relationships between physiology and the related psychological and behavioral processes. Non-invasive electrical stimulation with direct or alternating currents can help to enhance our understanding with regard to specific processes, and might provide future protocols able to improve them in case of malfunctions. We review the current state of the field, and provide an outlook for future developments.

AB  - Individuals exposed to fibrogenic mineral dust may exhibit an impaired antioxidant system and produce high levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species through immune cells, contributing to the perturbation of immune cell function, inflammation, fibrosis and lung cancer. The lung diseases which are caused by inhalation of fibrogenic mineral dust, known as pneumoconioses, develop progressively and irreversibly over decades. At the moment there is no known cure. The Mace element selenium has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties mediated mainly through selenoproteins. Research has demonstrated that selenium has the ability to protect against cardiovascular diseases; to kill cancer cells in vitro and reduce cancer incidence; and to immunomodulate various cellular signaling pathways. For these reasons, selenium has been proposed as a promising therapeutic agent in oxidative stress associated pathology that in theory would be beneficial for the prevention or treatment of pneumoconioses such as silicosis, asbestosis, and coal worker's pneumoconiosis. However, studies regarding selenium and occupational lung diseases are rare. The purpose of this study is to conduct a mini-review regarding the relationship between selenium and exposure to fibrogenic mineral dust with emphasis on epidemiological studies. We carried out a systematic literature search of English published studies on selenium and exposure to fibrogenic mineral dust. We found four epidemiological studies. Reviewed studies show that selenium is lower in individuals exposed to fibrogenic mineral dust. However, three out of the four reviewed studies could not confirm cause-and-effect relationships between low selenium status and exposure to fibrogenic mineral dust. This mini-review underscores the need for large follow-up and mechanistic studies for selenium to further elucidate its therapeutic effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper focuses on the biology of stress and resilience and their biomarkers in humans from the system science perspective. A stressor pushes the physiological system away from its baseline state toward a lower utility state. The physiological system may return toward the original state in one attractor basin but may be shifted to a state in another, lower utility attractor basin. While some physiological changes induced by stressors may benefit health, there is often a chronic wear and tear cost due to implementing changes to enable the return of the system to its baseline state and maintain itself in the high utility baseline attractor basin following repeated perturbations. This cost, also called allostatic load, is the utility reduction associated with both a change in state and with alterations in the attractor basin that affect system responses following future perturbations. This added cost can increase the time course of the return to baseline or the likelihood of moving into a different attractor basin following a perturbation. Opposite to this is the system's resilience which influences its ability to return to the high utility attractor basin following a perturbation by increasing the likelihood and/or speed of returning to the baseline state following a stressor. This review paper is a qualitative systematic review; it covers areas most relevant for moving the stress and resilience field forward from a more quantitative and neuroscientific perspective.

AB  - We examined the risk-benefit profile of sertraline treatment during breastfeeding, summarized the available literature on sertraline use, presented previously unpublished data, and performed a correlation-based meta-analysis of sertraline serum levels in mother-infant pairs. We conducted a search of PubMed and the National Library of Medicine LactMed database. We performed a meta-analysis to examine correlations between maternal and infant serum sertraline levels in the existing literature and in previously unpublished data. Of 167 available infant sertraline levels, 146 (87.4 %) were below the limit of detection, and the meta-analysis found no significant relationship between maternal and infant sertraline concentrations. Of 150 infant desmethylsertraline levels, 105 (70.0 %) were below the limit of detection. The correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between maternal and infant desmethylsertraline concentrations, but this metabolite has only a fraction of the activity of sertraline. A significant relationship was also found for the sum of sertraline and desmethylsertraline, which stems primarily from the contribution of desmethylsertraline. Sertraline is a first-line drug for breastfeeding women due to documented low levels of exposure in breastfeeding infants and very few adverse events described in case reports. Based on the current literature, neither routine serum sampling nor genotyping is warranted for breastfeeding mothers taking sertraline and/or their infants. Routine pediatric care is appropriate monitoring for breastfed infants of women who take sertraline monotherapy.

AB  - Postnatal depression (PND) affects approximately 10-20 % of new mothers in developed countries, with accumulating research documenting its adverse impact on not only the mother but also the wider family. Longitudinal studies assessing potential effects of maternal PND on offspring are mounting, and it is therefore timely to investigate the long-term psychological outcomes for adolescent offspring who were exposed to PND in infancy. PsycINFO, Medline, and Embase databases were searched with key terms for English language abstracts. Papers of 16 were identified that examined associations between PND and internalising problems, externalising problems, psychopathology, psychosocial, and cognitive outcomes of adolescent offspring. Impaired offspring cognitive outcomes reflected some of the most consistent findings. Conflicting evidence was found for an effect of PND on adolescent offspring internalising and externalising problems and overall psychopathology. Psychosocial outcomes in offspring adolescents indicated a specific adverse effect, although based on only two studies. Significant gender differences across outcomes were found. It was concluded that PND possibly increases risk vulnerability in the presence of recurrent, concurrent, and antenatal maternal depression but that these latter factors alone may be the stronger specific predictors. Limitations of the review are discussed as well as implications for future research and clinical practice.

AB  - Hand preference - which is related to cerebral dominance - is thought to be associated with cognitive skills; however, findings on this association are inconsistent and there is no consensus whether left- or right-handers have an advantage in either spatial or verbal abilities. In addition, it is not clear whether an interaction between sex and hand preference exists in relation to these cognitive abilities. As these matters are relevant from a neurodevelopmental perspective we performed a meta-analysis of the available literature. We searched PubMed and Embase, and included 14 studies (359,890 subjects) in the verbal ability meta-analysis and 16 studies (218,351 subjects) in the spatial ability meta-analysis. There was no difference between the full sample of left and right-handers for verbal ability, nor was there a hand preference-by-sex interaction. Subgroup analysis of children showed a small right-hand benefit. Our results further revealed a modest but significant effect favouring right-handedness for overall spatial ability, which was more pronounced when analysis was restricted to studies applying the mental rotation test. We could not identify a specific interaction with sex. Our results indicate that there is a small but significant cognitive advantage of right-handedness on spatial ability. In the verbal domain, this advantage is only significant in children. An interaction effect with sex is not confirmed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We tried to review and update clinical and preclinical studies evaluating vilazodone's role as an antidepressant for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In terms of its mechanism of actions, we sought to elaborate them mainly through predinical animal studies. A data search was conducted in November 1,2013, using the key terms "vilazodone" or "Viibryd," in PubMed and Medline databases. All published and unpublished studies are included and citations from publications were also reviewed for additional references. Five unpublished, phase-II and two pivotal published phase-III clinical trials with nearly identical design (8-week, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled) investigated efficacy of vilazodone, were found for the treatment of patients with MDD. Two post-hoc studies and one long-term open study were also included. Data were thoroughly reviewed to incorporate the pharmacology, action mechanism, efficacy and safety for the vilazodone in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Vilazodone is an antidepressant with novel mechanism of action because its chemical structure is unrelated to conventional antidepressant, and it has a selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist profile. Vilazodone is an effective and safe treatment option with its novel action mechanisms for patients with depression. Its putative benefits compared with other antidepressants must be thoroughly studied in adequately-powered and well-designed future clinical trials.

AB  - Background: Physical and psychological job demands in combination with the degree of control a worker has over task completion, play an important role in reducing stress. Occupational stress is an important, modifiable factor affecting work disability. However, the effectiveness of reducing job demands or increasing job control remains unclear, particularly for outcomes of interest to employers, such as absenteeism or productivity.
   Objective: This systematic review reports on job demand and control interventions that impact absenteeism, productivity and financial outcomes.
   Methods: A stakeholder-centered best-evidence synthesis was conducted with researcher and stakeholder collaboration throughout. Databases and grey literature were searched for systematic reviews between 2000 and 2012: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, TRIP, health-evidence. ca, Rehab+, National Rehabilitation Information Center (NARIC), and Institute for Work and Health. Articles were assessed independently by two researchers for inclusion criteria and methodological quality. Differences were resolved through consensus.
   Results: The search resulted in 3363 unique titles. After review of abstracts, 115 articles were retained for full-text review. 11 articles finally met the inclusion criteria and are summarized in this synthesis. The best level of evidence we found indicates that multimodal job demand reductions for either at-work or off-work workers will reduce disability-related absenteeism.
   Conclusion: In general, the impacts of interventions that aim to reduce job demands or increase job control can be positive for the organization in terms of reducing absenteeism, increasing productivity and cost-effectiveness. However, more high quality research is needed to further assess the relationships and quantify effect sizes for the interventions and outcomes reviewed in this study.

AB  - In the field of social neuroscience, major branches of research have been instrumental in describing independent components of typical and aberrant social information processing, but the field as a whole lacks a comprehensive model that integrates different branches. We review existing research related to the neural basis of three key neural systems underlying social information processing: social perception, action observation, and theory of mind. We propose an integrative model that unites these three processes and highlights the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), which plays a central role in all three systems. Furthermore, we integrate these neural systems with the dual system account of implicit and explicit social information processing. Large-scale meta-analyses based on Neurosynth confirmed that the pSTS is at the intersection of the three neural systems. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis with 1000 subjects confirmed that the pSTS is connected to all other regions in these systems. The findings presented in this review are specifically relevant for psychiatric research especially disorders characterized by social deficits such as autism spectrum disorder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Prisoners experience significantly worse health than the general population. This review examines the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of peer interventions in prison settings.
   Methods: A mixed methods systematic review of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies, including qualitative and quantitative synthesis was conducted. In addition to grey literature identified and searches of websites, nineteen electronic databases were searched from 1985 to 2012.
   Study selection criteria were:
   Population: Prisoners resident in adult prisons and children resident in Young Offender Institutions (YOIs).
   Intervention: Peer-based interventions.
   Comparators: Review questions 3 and 4 compared peer and professionally led approaches.
   Outcomes: Prisoner health or determinants of health; organisational/process outcomes; views of prison populations.
   Study designs: Quantitative, qualitative and mixed method evaluations.
   Results: Fifty-seven studies were included in the effectiveness review and one study in the cost-effectiveness review; most were of poor methodological quality. Evidence suggested that peer education interventions are effective at reducing risky behaviours, and that peer support services are acceptable within the prison environment and have a positive effect on recipients, practically or emotionally. Consistent evidence from many, predominantly qualitative, studies, suggested that being a peer deliverer was associated with positive effects. There was little evidence on cost-effectiveness of peer-based interventions.
   Conclusions: There is consistent evidence from a large number of studies that being a peer worker is associated with positive health; peer support services are also an acceptable source of help within the prison environment and can have a positive effect on recipients. Research into cost-effectiveness is sparse.

AB  - The interest in non-invasive brain stimulation techniques is increasing in recent years. Among these techniques, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been the subject of great interest among researchers because of its easiness to use, low cost, benign profile of side effects and encouraging results of research in the field. This interest has generated several studies and randomized clinical trials, particularly in psychiatry. In this review, we provide a summary of the development of the technique and its mechanism of action as well as a review of the methodological aspects of randomized clinical trials in psychiatry, including studies in affective disorders, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, child psychiatry and substance use disorder. Finally, we provide an overview of tDCS use in cognitive enhancement as well as a discussion regarding its clinical use and regulatory and ethical issues. Although many promising results regarding tDCS efficacy were described, the total number of studies is still low, highlighting the need of further studies aiming to replicate these findings in larger samples as to provide a definite picture regarding tDCS efficacy in psychiatry.

AB  - Hippocampal theta has been related to locomotor speed, attention, anxiety, sensorimotor integration and memory among other emergent phenomena. One difficulty in understanding the function of theta is that the hippocampus (HPC) modulates voluntary behavior at the same time that it processes sensory input. Both functions are correlated with characteristic changes in theta indices. The current review highlights a series of studies examining theta local field potential (LFP) signals across the septotemporal or longitudinal axis of the HPC. While the theta signal is coherent throughout the entirety of the HPC, the amplitude, but not the frequency, of theta varies significantly across its three-dimensional expanse. We suggest that the theta signal offers a rich vein of information about how distributed neuronal ensembles support emergent function. Further, we speculate that emergent function across the long axis varies with respect to spatiotemporal scale. Thus, septal HPC processes details of the proximal spatiotemporal environment while more temporal aspects process larger spaces and wider time-scales. The degree to which emergent functions are supported by the synchronization of theta across the septotemporal axis is an open question. Our working model is that theta synchrony serves to bind ensembles representing varying resolutions of spatiotemporal information at interdependent septotemporal areas of the HPC. Such synchrony and cooperative interactions along the septotemporal axis likely support memory formation and subsequent consolidation and retrieval.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is involved in learning, memory, and stress, and plays a significant role in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. As an age-dependent process, AHN is largely influenced by changes that occur during the pre- and postnatal stages of brain development, and constitutes an important field of research. This review examines the current knowledge regarding the regulators of AHN and the influence of prenatal and postnatal stress on later AHN. In addition, a hypothesis is presented suggesting that each kind of stress influences a specific neurogenic pool, developmental or postnatal, that later becomes a precursor with important repercussions for AHN. This hypothesis is referred to as "the double neurogenic niche hypothesis." Discovering what receptors, transcription factors, or genes are specifically activated by different stressors is proposed as an essential line of future research in the field. Such knowledge shall constitute an important starting point toward the goal of modifying AHN in neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anhedonia, the lack of pleasure, has been shown to be a critical feature of a range of psychiatric disorders. Yet, it is currently measured primarily through subjective self-reports and as such has been difficult to submit to rigorous scientific analysis. New insights from affective neuroscience hold considerable promise in improving our understanding of anhedonia and for providing useful objective behavioral measures to complement traditional self report measures, potentially leading to better diagnoses and novel treatments. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of hedonia research and specifically the established mechanisms of wanting, liking, and learning. Based on this framework we propose to conceptualize anhedonia as impairments in some or all of these processes, thereby departing from the longstanding view of anhedonia as solely reduced subjective experience of pleasure. We discuss how deficits in each of the reward components can lead to different expressions, or subtypes, of anhedonia affording novel ways of measurement. Specifically, we review evidence suggesting that patients suffering from depression and schizophrenia show impairments in wanting and learning, while some aspects of conscious liking seem surprisingly intact. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that anhedonia is heterogeneous across psychiatric disorders, depending on which parts of the pleasure networks are most affected. This in turn has implications for diagnosis and treatment of anhedonia.

AB  - Alpha-synuclein is a presynaptic protein expressed throughout the central nervous system, and it is the main component of Lewy bodies, one of the histopathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) which is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder. The conformational flexibility of alpha-synuclein allows it to adopt different conformations, i.e., bound to membranes or form aggregates, the oligomers are believed to be the more toxic species. In this review, we will focus on two major features of alpha-synuclein, transmission and toxicity, that could help to understand the pathological characteristics of PD. One important feature of alpha-synuclein is its ability to be transmitted from neuron to neuron using mechanisms such as endocytosis, plasma membrane penetration or through exosomes, thus propagating the Lewy body pathology to different brain regions thereby contributing to the progressiveness of PD. The second feature of alpha-synuclein is that it confers cytotoxicity to recipient cells, principally when it is in an oligomeric state. This form causes mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, proteasome impairment, disruption of plasma membrane and pore formation that lead to apoptosis pathway activation and consequent cell death. The complexity of alpha-synuclein oligomerization and formation of toxic species could be a major factor for the irreversibility of PD and could also explain the lack of successful therapies to halt the disease.

AB  - Purpose To perform a systematic review on the epidemiology, the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and economic burden of binge eating disorder (BED).
   Methods A systematic literature search of English-language articles was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus, Business Source Premier and Cochrane Library. Literature search on epidemiology was limited to studies published between 2009 and 2013. Cost data were inflated and converted to 2012 US$ purchasing power parities. All of the included studies were assessed for quality.
   Results Forty-nine articles were included. Data on epidemiology were reported in 31, HRQoL burden in 16, and economic burden in 7 studies. Diagnosis of BED was made using 4th Edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria in 46 studies. Lifetime prevalence of BED was 1.1-1.9 % in the general population (DSM-IV). BED was associated with significant impairment in aspects of HRQoL relating to both physical and mental health; the Short Form 36 Physical and Mental Component Summary mean scores varied between 31.1 to 47.3 and 32.0 to 49.8, respectively. Compared to individuals without eating disorder, BED was related to increased healthcare utilization and costs. Annual direct healthcare costs per BED patient ranged between $2,372 and $3,731.
   Conclusions BED is a serious eating disorder that impairs HRQoL and is related to increased healthcare utilization and healthcare costs. The limited literature warrants further research, especially to better understand the long-term HRQoL and economic burden of BED.

AB  - Objective: Most of the research into suicide and self-harm has been conducted in the United States and Europe, yet the volume of research does not reflect the distribution of suicide globally, with Asia accounting for up to 60% of all suicides. The present study systematically reviews the literature to assess the prevalence and correlates of suicidal acts in Malaysia in Southeast Asia.
   Methods: Five relevant databases were searched from inception up to February 2014, and a narrative synthesis of the results from the included studies was performed. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were correlational survey research and archival/observational research describing self-harm and suicide. Outcomes included completed suicides and self-harm including suicide attempts and self-poisoning, suicide plans and suicidal ideation.
   Results: In total, 39 studies met the inclusion criteria. The principal findings were that the prevalence of suicide in Malaysia is approximately 6-8 per 100,000 population per year and that there is an excess of suicide among men, people younger than 40 years and the Indian minority group. The past-month prevalence rates of suicidal ideation, plans and attempts are 1.7, 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively, whereas the past-year prevalence rates of suicidal ideation range between 6% and 8%.
   Conclusions: The present research marks a first step towards understanding the prevalence and correlates of suicide and self-harm in Malaysia. However, the heterogeneity of the included studies was high. Further research into the antecedents, consequences and interventions for suicide and self-harm in the Malaysian context is required.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this paper was to systematically review the literature investigating the relationship between perceived racism/discrimination and health among black American women.
   Methods Searches for empirical studies published from January 2003 to December 2013 were conducted using PubMed and PsycInfo. Articles were assessed for possible inclusion using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 framework. In addition, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) system for rating the strength of scientific evidence was used to assess the quality of studies included in the review.
   Results Nineteen studies met criteria for review. There was mixed evidence for general relationships between perceived racism/discrimination and health. Consistent evidence was found for the relationship between adverse birth outcomes, illness incidence, and cancer or tumor risk and perceived racism/discrimination. Inconsistent findings were found for the relationship between perceived racism/discrimination and heart disease risk factors. There was no evidence to support the relationship between perceived racism/discrimination and high blood pressure.
   Conclusions There is mixed evidence to support the association between perceived racism/discrimination and overall objective health outcomes among black American women. The strongest relationship was seen between perceived racism/discrimination and adverse birth outcomes. Better understanding of the relationship between health and racism/discrimination can aid in identifying race-based risk factors developing primary prevention strategies. Future studies should aim to investigate the role of perceived racism/discrimination as a specific chronic stressor within discrete pathogenesis models.

AB  - Background: People living with HIV infection are disproportionately burdened by trauma and the resultant negative health consequences, making the combiin of HIV infection and trauma a syndemic illness. Despite the high co-occurrence and negative influence on health, trauma and posttrattmatic sequelae in people living with HIV infection often go unrecognized and untreated because of the current gaps in medical training and lack at practice guidelines, Objective: We set out to review the current literature on HIV infection and trauma and propose a trauma-informed model of care to target this,syndemic illness. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane review databases for articles that contained the following search terms: HIV AND either trauma (specifically violent trauma), PTSD intimate partner violence (IPV) abuse, or trauma-informed care. Articles were limited to primary clinical research or metanalyses published in English, Articles were excluded if they referred to HIV-associated posttraumatic stress disorder or HIV-associated posttraumatic growth. Results: We confirm high, but variable, rates of trauma in people living with HIV infection demonstrated in multiple studies, ranging from 10%-90%. Trauma is associated with (1) increased HIV-risk behavior, contributing to transmission and acquisition of the virus; (2) negative internal and external mediators also associated with poor health and high-risk HIV behavior; (3) poor adherence to treatment; (4) poor HI V-related and other health outcomes; and (5) particularly vulnerable special populations. Conclusions: Clinicians should consider using a model of trauma-informed care in the treatment of people living with HIV infection. Its adoption in different settings needs to be matched to available resources.

AB  - Background: Evidence suggests that most adults with intellectual disability do not participate in sufficient amounts of physical activity (PA). A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies that reported an intervention aiming to improve PA levels of adults with intellectual disability was conducted. Methods: Keywords related to intellectual disability and physical activity were used to search relevant databases. Studies were excluded if they did not measure PA as an outcome for adults with intellectual disability, were non-English, and were not peer-reviewed. All relevant studies were included in the review regardless of methodological quality and design. Results: Six articles met the inclusion criteria. These included health education or health promotion programs with PA, nutrition, and weight loss components. The quality of studies included in this review was generally poor. Most studies used a prepost design, sample sizes were small, and measurement tools were used that are not valid and reliable for the population assessed. Conclusions: PA interventions have the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of people with intellectual disability, a vulnerable group who require attention from public health practitioners and researchers. Given the health inequities that exist, public health researchers should target efforts to improve PA levels among this group.

AB  - A large body of data from human and animal studies using psychological, recording, imaging, and lesion techniques indicates that recognition memory involves at least two separable processes: familiarity discrimination and recollection. Familiarity discrimination for individual visual stimuli seems to be effected by a system centred on the perirhinal cortex of the temporal lobe. The fundamental change that encodes prior occurrence within the perirhinal cortex is a reduction in the responses of neurones when a stimulus is repeated. Neuronal network modelling indicates that a system based on such a change in responsiveness is potentially highly efficient in information theoretic terms. A review is given of findings indicating that perirhinal cortex acts as a storage site for recognition memory of objects and that such storage depends upon processes producing synaptic weakening.

AB  - Background: The perception of old age differs in different societies and cultures: in the Western societies, the loss of youth, multiple losses of functions and independence resulting in inability produce a social stigma. Dementia is common among the elderly, regardless of their ethnic background. In countries dominated by Western philosophical thought, the cognitive domain has been privileged over other mental domains. Knowledge of cultural factors is essential to an understanding of aging and dementia; studies are currently dominated by biomedical models that consider dementing disorders solely as a pathological entity caused by neuronal and neurotrasmitters loss, and focus on the individual without regard to sociocultural context.
   Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore how the phenomenon of dementia is perceived in ethnically diverse groups and cultures.
   Methods: Medline and Google Scholar searches were conducted for relevant articles, chapters and books published before 2014. Search terms used included anthropology, culture, ethnic elderly and dementia. Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed for further relevant references.
   Results: The experience of dementia is not universal, but is profoundly shaped by culture in which the demented person lives. Sociocultural conceptualization of the symptoms of dementing diseases remains obscure in many countries.
   Conclusion: Sociocultural conceptualization of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is of growing interest in shaping the interpretation of the symptoms of dementing diseases. To explore the intersection of culture with the expression of dementia may optimize the management of these complex and chronic conditions.

AB  - Brands are marketing tools that create mental representations in the minds of consumers about products, services, and organizations. Brands create schema that help consumers decide whether to initiate or continue use of a product or service. Health branding determines behavioral choice by building consumer relationships and identification with health behaviors and their benefits. Health branding can be measured by the associations individuals form with health behaviors. In 2008, Evans and colleagues systematically reviewed the literature on health brands, reported on branded health messages and campaigns worldwide, and examined specific branding strategies in multiple subject areas. This paper extends that review. We replicated the comprehensive online literature search strategy from 2008. We screened a total of 311 articles and included 130 for full-text review. This included both articles from the 2008 review and new articles. After excluding those new articles that did not meet full-text inclusion criteria, we reviewed 69 in total. Of these, 32 were new articles since the 2008 review. Branded health campaigns cover most major domains of public health and appear worldwide. Since 2008, we observed improvement in evaluation, application of theory, and description of campaign strategies in published work. We recommend enhanced education of public health practitioners and researchers on the use and evaluation of branding.

AB  - Polymer nanofibers are being increasingly used for a wide range of applications owing to their high specific surface area. The electrospinning process, as a novel and effective method for producing nanofibers from various materials, has been utilized to fabricate nanofibrous membranes. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a number of outstanding mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, which make them attractive as reinforcement in a polymer matrix. The incorporation of CNT into polymer nanofibers can improve the properties of electrospun nanofibrous composites. This paper provides a comprehensive review of current research and development in the field of electrospun CNT-polymer composite nanofiber with emphasis on the processing, properties, and application of composite nanofiber, as well as the theoretical approaches to predicting the mechanical behavior of CNT-polymer composites. The current limitations, research challenges, and future trends in modeling and simulation of electrospun polymer composite nanofibers are also discussed.

AB  - Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-Is) enhance cAMP and/or cGMP signaling via reducing the degradation of these cyclic nucleotides. Both cAMP and cGMP signaling are essential for a variety of cellular functions and exert their effects both pre- and post-synaptically. Either of these second messengers relays and amplifies incoming signals at receptors on the cell surface making them important elements in signal transduction cascades and essential in cellular signaling in a variety of cell functions including neurotransmitter release and neuroprotection. Consequently, these processes can be influenced by PDE-Is as they increase cAMP and/or cGMP concentrations. PDE-Is have been considered as possible therapeutic agents to treat impaired memory function linked to several brain disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review will, however, focus on the possible role of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in cognitive decline beyond the memory domain. Here we will discuss the involvement of PDEs on three related domains: attention, information filtering (sensory- and sensorimotor gating) and response inhibition (drug-induced hyperlocomotion). Currently, these are emerging cognitive domains in the field of PDE research. Here we discuss experimental studies and the potential beneficial effects of PDE-I drugs on these cognitive domains, as effects of PDE-Is on these domains could potentially influence effects on memory performance. Overall, PDE4 seems to be the most promising target for all domains discussed in this review. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Given the significant disability, morbidity and mortality associated with depression, the promising recent trials of ketamine highlight a novel intervention. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of ketamine in comparison with placebo for the reduction of depressive symptoms in patients who meet criteria for a major depressive episode.
   Method: Two electronic databases were searched in September 2013 for English-language studies that were randomized placebo-controlled trials of ketamine treatment for patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar depression and utilized a standardized rating scale. Studies including participants receiving electroconvulsive therapy and adolescent/child participants were excluded. Five studies were included in the quantitative meta-analysis.
   Results: The quantitative meta-analysis showed that ketamine significantly reduced depressive symptoms. The overall effect size at day 1 was large and statistically significant with an overall standardized mean difference of 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.69-1.34) (P<.001), with the effects sustained at 7 days postinfusion. The heterogeneity of the studies was low and not statistically significant, and the funnel plot showed no publication bias.
   Conclusions: The large and statistically significant effect of ketamine on depressive symptoms supports a promising, new and effective pharmacotherapy with rapid onset, high efficacy and good tolerability. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains one of the most effective tools in the psychiatric treatment armamentarium, particularly for refractory depression. Yet, there remains a subset of patients who do not respond to ECT or for whom clinically adequate seizures cannot be elicited, for whom ketamine has emerged as a putative augmentation agent.
   Methods: We searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and MEDLINE from 1962 to April 2014 to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating ketamine in ECT (PROSPERO #CRD42014009035). Clinical remission, response, and change in depressive symptom scores were extracted by two independent raters. Adverse events were recorded. Drop-outs were assessed as a proxy for acceptability. Meta-analyses employed a random effects model.
   Results: Data were synthesized from 5 RCTs, representing a total of 182 patients with major depressive episodes (n = 165 Major Depressive Disorder, n = 17 Bipolar Disorder). ECT with ketamine augmentation was not associated with higher rates of clinical remission (Risk Difference (RD) = 0.00; 95%CI = -0.08 to 0.10), response (RD = -0.01; 95%CI = -0.11 to 0.08), or improvements in depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.38; 95%CI = 0.41 to 1.17). Ketamine augmentation was associated with higher rates of confusion/disorientation/prolonged delirium (OR = 6.59, 95%CI: 1.28-33.82, NNH = 3), but not agitation, hypertension or affective switches.
   Conclusion: Our meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of ketamine augmentation in the ECT setting suggests a lack of clinical efficacy, and an increased likelihood of confusion. Individuals for whom adequate seizures or therapeutic response cannot be obtained have not been studied using randomized controlled designs. Additional research is required to address the role of ketamine in this population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Even during moments when we fail to be fully aware of our environment, our brains never go silent. Instead, it appears that the brain can also operate in an alternate, unconscious mode. Delineating unconscious from conscious neural processes is a promising first step toward investigating how awareness emerges from brain activity. Here we focus on recent insights into the neuronal processes that contribute to visual function in the absence of a conscious visual percept. Drawing on insights from findings on the phenomenon of blindsight that results from injury to primary visual cortex and the results of experimentally induced perceptual suppression, we describe what kind of visual information the visual system analyzes unconsciously and we discuss the neuronal routing and responses that accompany this process. We conclude that unconscious processing of certain visual stimulus attributes, such as the presence of visual motion or the emotional expression of a face can occur in a geniculo-cortical circuit that runs independent from and in parallel to the predominant route through primary visual cortex. We speculate that in contrast, bidirectional neuronal interactions between cortex and the thalamic pulvinar nucleus that support large-scale neuronal integration and visual awareness are impeded during blindsight and perceptual suppression.

AB  - Histaminergic neurons are exclusively located in the hypothalamic tuberomamillary nucleus, from where they project to many brain areas. The histaminergic system is involved in basic physiological functions, such as the sleep-wake cycle, energy and endocrine homeostasis, sensory and motor functions, cognition, and attention, which are all severely affected in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present recent postmortem findings on the alterations in this system in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), depression, and narcolepsy. In addition, we highlight the need to validate animal models for these diseases and also for burette's syndrome (TS) in relation to alterations in the histaminergic system. Moreover, we discuss the potential for, and concerns over, the use of novel histamine 3 receptor (H3R) antagonists/inverse agonists as treatment for such disorders.

AB  - Limited options are available for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia and intolerable side effects of clozapine. We conducted a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RU's) to determine the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole augmentation of clozapine for schizophrenia. Electronic databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. This review synthesized the data of four short-term (8-24 weeks), placebo-controlled trials (N = 347). The overall relative risk (RR, 95% confidence interval) of discontinuation rates was not significantly different between groups (RR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.78 to 2.56). The pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs, 95% CIs) (Z-test; number of study; I-2-index) suggested trends of aripiprazole augmentation benefits on overall psychotic [-0.40 (-0.87 to 0.07) (n = 3; Z = 1.68, p = 0.09; I-2 = 68%)], positive [-1.05 (-2.39 to 029) (n = 3; Z = 1.54, p = 0.12; I-2 = 94%)], and negative [-0.36 (-0.77 to 0.05) (n = 3; Z = 1.74, p = 0.08; I-2 = 54%)] symptoms. Despite of no benefit on three cardiometabolic indices (i.e., fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein), aripiprazole augmentation was superior for weight change with a mean difference (95% CI) of -1.36 kg (-2.35 to -0.36) (n = 3; Z = 2.67, p = 0.008; I-2 = 39%) and LDL-cholesterol with a mean difference of -11.06 mg/dL (-18.25 to -3.87) (n = 3; Z = 3.02, p = 0.003; I-2 = 31%). Aripiprazole augmentation was not correlated with headache and insomnia but significantly associated with agitation/akathesia (RR = 7.59, 95% CI = 1.43 to 40.18) (n = 3; Z = 238, p = 0.02; I-2 = 0%) and anxiety (RR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.02 to 7.15) (n = 1; Z = 2.00, p = 0.05). The limited short-term data suggested that aripiprazole augmentation of clozapine can minimize the cardiometabolic risk, causes agitation/akathesia, and may be effective in attenuating psychotic symptoms.

AB  - Background: People with schizophrenia experience increased rates of osteoporosis and may be at heightened risk of fractures. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate fractures among people with schizophrenia compared to people without mental illness.
   Method: We systematically searched major electronic databases from inception until October 2014. Articles were included that reported the number of fractures in people with schizophrenia and a control group. Two independent authors conducted searches, completed methodological assessment and extracted data. Data were narratively synthesized, and a random-effects incidence rate ratio (IRR) meta-analysis was performed.
   Results: Eight studies were included encompassing 48,384 people with schizophrenia (49.9-75.2 years, 41%100% female) and 3,945,783 controls. The pooled adjusted rate of fractures per 1000 person-years was 5.54 [95% confidence interval (CI)=4.92-5.57] in people with schizophrenia and 3.48 (95% CI=3.39-3.64) in control participants. The comparative meta-analysis showed that people with schizophrenia experience an increased rate of fractures compared to control participants (IRR 1.72, 95% CI=1.24-2.39, I-2=49%; n=168,914). There were insufficient data to conduct moderation analysis, but the narrative review consistently highlighted that antipsychotic medication was an important risk factor for fractures.
   Conclusion: People with schizophrenia are at significantly increased risk of fractures. Future research is required to understand the mechanisms and should seek to validate fracture prediction algorithms used in the general population. Importantly, there is a need to develop preventative strategies to improve bone health and reduce fracture risk involving the wider multidisciplinary team and incorporating falls-prevention strategies.

AB  - Background: Children are routinely identified as a vulnerable population in environmental health risk assessments, experiencing adverse health outcomes due to exposure to a suite of atmospheric constituents.
   Objective: To provide a substantive overview of the research literature pertaining to biometeorological effects on children. Key information areas within urban environmental health research related to atmospheric variables (heat, air pollution, radiation) are assessed and integrated to better understand health outcomes and vulnerabilities in children. Critical avenues for improvement and understanding of children's health related to such biophysical parameters are also identified.
   Methods: This comprehensive review assesses past and current primary studies, organizational reports, educational books, and review articles. Emphasis is placed on the differential ambient exposures to temperature, air pollution, and radiation within urban microclimates commonly used by children (e.g., schoolyards, urban parks), and the resulting health impacts.
   Discussion: Exposure to heat, air pollution, and radiation are often enhanced in urban areas, specifically under the current design of the majority of outdoor child play places. Many heat indices, energy budget models, and health outcome studies fail to adequately parameterize children, yet those that do find enhanced vulnerability to ambient stressors, particularly heat and air pollution. Such environmental exposures relate strongly to behavior, activity, asthma, obesity, and overall child well-being. Current research indicates that a changing climate, growing urban population, and unsustainable design are projected to pose increasing complications.
   Conclusions: Evidence-based research to link children's health, physiology, and behavior to atmospheric extremes is an important future research avenue, underscoring the fact that children are among the population groups disproportionately affected by ambient extremes. However, current methods and population-based models lack child-specific inputs and outputs, as well as designated thresholds for accurate predictions of child health impacts. More substantive evidence is needed for applicable child-specific policies and guidelines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review highlights the significance of protein tyrosine nitration (PTN) in signal transduction pathways, the progress achieved in analytical methods, and the implication of nitration in the cellular pathophysiology of aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Although mass spectrometry of nitrated peptides has become a powerful tool for the characterization of nitrated peptides, the low stoichiometry of this modification clearly necessitates the use of affinity chromatography to enrich modified peptides. Analysis of nitropeptides involves identification of endogenous, intact modification as well as chemical conversion of the nitro group to a chemically reactive amine group and further modifications that enable affinity capture and enhance detectability by altering molecular properties. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in chemical derivatization of nitropeptides for enrichment and mass analysis, and for detection and quantification using various analytical tools. PTN participates in physiological processes, such as aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Accumulation of 3-nitrotyrosine has been found to occur during the aging process; this was identified through mass spectrometry. Further, there are several studies implicating the presence of nitrated tyrosine in age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - A remarkable challenge our brain must face constantly when interacting with the environment is represented by ambiguous and, at times, even missing sensory information. This is particularly compelling for visual information, being the main sensory system we rely upon to gather cues about the external world. It is not uncommon, for example, that objects catching our attention may disappear temporarily from view, occluded by visual obstacles in the foreground. Nevertheless, we are often able to keep our gaze on them throughout the occlusion or even catch them on the fly in the face of the transient lack of visual motion information. This implies that the brain can fill the gaps of missing sensory information by extrapolating the object motion through the occlusion. In recent years, much experimental evidence has been accumulated that both perceptual and motor processes exploit visual motion extrapolation mechanisms. Moreover, neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions potentially involved in the predictive representation of the occluded target motion. Within this framework, ocular pursuit and manual interceptive behavior have proven to be useful experimental models for investigating visual extrapolation mechanisms. Studies in these fields have pointed out that visual motion extrapolation processes depend on manifold information related to short-term memory representations of the target motion before the occlusion, as well as to longer term representations derived from previous experience with the environment. We will review recent oculomotor and manual interception literature to provide up-to-date views on the neurophysiological underpinnings of visual motion extrapolation.

AB  - Background: Healthy children achieve better educational outcomes which, in turn, are associated with improved health later in life. The World Health Organization's Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework is a holistic approach to promoting health and educational attainment in school. The effectiveness of this approach has not yet been rigorously reviewed.
   Methods: We searched 20 health, education and social science databases, and trials registries and relevant websites in 2011 and 2013.
   We included cluster randomised controlled trials. Participants were children and young people aged four to 18 years attending schools/colleges. HPS interventions had to include the following three elements: input into the curriculum; changes to the school's ethos or environment; and engagement with families and/or local communities.
   Two reviewers identified relevant trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We grouped studies according to the health topic(s) targeted. Where data permitted, we performed random-effects meta-analyses.
   Results: We identified 67 eligible trials tackling a range of health issues. Few studies included any academic/attendance outcomes. We found positive average intervention effects for: body mass index (BMI), physical activity, physical fitness, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, and being bullied. Intervention effects were generally small. On average across studies, we found little evidence of effectiveness for zBMI (BMI, standardized for age and gender), and no evidence for fat intake, alcohol use, drug use, mental health, violence and bullying others. It was not possible to meta-analyse data on other health outcomes due to lack of data. Methodological limitations were identified including reliance on self-reported data, lack of long-term follow-up, and high attrition rates.
   Conclusion: This Cochrane review has found the WHO HPS framework is effective at improving some aspects of student health. The effects are small but potentially important at a population level.

AB  - Measuring neuronal activity with electrophysiological methods may be useful in detecting neurological dysfunctions, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This approach may be particularly valuable for rapid detection in at-risk populations including military service members and athletes. Electrophysiological methods, such as quantitative electroencephalography (gEEG) and recording event-related potentials (ERPs) may be promising; however, the field is nascent and significant controversy exists on the efficacy and accuracy of the approaches as diagnostic tools. For example, the specific measures derived from an electroencephalogram (EEG) that are most suitable as markers of dysfunction have not been clearly established. A study was conducted to summarize and evaluate the statistical rigor of evidence on the overall utility of gEEG as an mTBI detection tool. The analysis evaluated gEEG measures/parameters that may be most suitable as fieldable diagnostic tools, identified other types of EEG measures and analysis methods of promise, recommended specific measures and analysis methods for further development as mTBI detection tools, identified research gaps in the field, and recommended future research and development thrust areas. The gEEG study group formed the following conclusions: (1) Individual gEEG measures provide limited diagnostic utility for mTBI. However, many measures can be important features of gEEG discriminant functions, which do show significant promise as mTBI detection tools. (2) ERPs offer utility in mTBI detection. In fact, evidence indicates that ERPs can identify abnormalities in cases where EEGs alone are non-disclosing. (3)The standard mathematical procedures used in the characterization of mTBI EEGs should be expanded to incorporate newer methods of analysis including non-linear dynamical analysis, complexity measures, analysis of causal interactions, graph theory, and information dynamics. (4) Reports of high specificity in gEEG evaluations of TBI must be interpreted with care. High specificities have been reported in carefully constructed clinical studies in which healthy controls were compared against a carefully selected TBI population. The published literature indicates, however, that similar abnormalities in gEEG measures are observed in other neuropsychiatric disorders. While it may be possible to distinguish a clinical patient from a healthy control participant with this technology, these measures are unlikely to discriminate between, for example, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or TBI. The specificities observed in these clinical studies may well be lost in real world clinical practice. (5)The absence of specificity does not preclude clinical utility. The possibility of use as a longitudinal measure of treatment response remains. However, efficacy as a longitudinal clinical measure does require acceptable test-retest reliability. To date, very few test retest reliability studies have been published with gEEG data obtained from TBI patients or from healthy controls. This is a particular concern because high variability is a known characteristic of the injured central nervous system.

AB  - Coherent beta-oscillations are a dominant feature of the sensorimotor system yet their function remains enigmatic. We propose that, in addition to cell intrinsic and/or local network interactions, they are supported by activity propagating recurrently around closed neural 'loops' between primary motor cortex (M1), muscles, and back to M1 via somatosensory pathways. Individual loops reciprocally connect individual muscle synergies ('motor primitives') with their representations in M1, and the conduction time around each loop resonates with the periodic spiking of its constituent neurons/muscles. During beta-oscillations, this resonance strengthens within-loop connectivity (via long-term potentiation, LTP), whereas non-resonance between different loops weakens connectivity (via long-term depression, LTD) between M1 representations of different muscle synergies. In this way, beta-oscillations help maintain accurate and discrete representations of muscle synergies in M1.

We systematically searched 5 databases for published studies (1980-2014) that included hypertension or diabetes prevalence for US homeless adults, pooled disease prevalence, and explored heterogeneity sources. We used the National Health Interview Survey for comparison.
   We included data from 97 366 homeless adults. The pooled prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 27.0% (95% confidence interval = 23.8%, 29.9%; n = 43 studies) and of diabetes was 8.0% (95% confidence interval = 6.8%, 9.2%; n = 39 studies). We found no difference in hypertension or diabetes prevalence between the homeless and general population.
   Additional health care and housing resources are needed to meet the significant, growing burden of chronic disease in the homeless population.

AB  - The chronic health effects associated with sustained exposures to high concentrations of air pollutants are an important issue for millions of megacity residents and millions more living in smaller urban and rural areas. Particulate matter (PM) and ozone (O-3) concentrations close or above their respective air quality standards during the last 20 years affect 24 million people living in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). Herein we discuss PM and O-3 trends in MCMA and their possible association with the observed central nervous system (CNS) effects in clinically healthy children. We argue that prenatal and postnatal sustained exposures to a natural environmental exposure chamber contribute to detrimental neural responses. The emerging picture for MCMA children shows systemic inflammation, immunodysregulation at both systemic and brain levels, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, small blood vessel pathology, and an intrathecal inflammatory process, along with the early neuropathological hallmarks for Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases. Exposed brains are briskly responding to their harmful environment and setting the bases for structural and volumetric changes, cognitive, olfactory, auditory and vestibular deficits and long term neurodegenerative consequences. We need to improve our understanding of the PM pediatric short and long term CNS impact through multidisciplinary research. Public health benefit can be achieved by integrating interventions that reduce fine PM levels and pediatric exposures and establishing preventative screening programs targeting pediatric populations that are most at risk. We fully expect that the health of 24 million residents is important and blocking pediatric air pollution research and hiding critical information that ought to be available to our population, health, education and social workers is not in the best interest of our children.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex and heterogeneous mental disorder that affects about 1% of global population. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in genetic studies of SCZ. A number of common variants with small effects and rare variants with relatively larger effects have been identified. These variants include risk loci identified by genome-wide association studies, rare copy-number variants identified by comparative genomic analyses, and de novo mutations identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Collectively, they contribute to the heterogeneity of the disease. In this review, we update recent discoveries in the field of SCZ genetics, and outline the perspectives of future directions.

AB  - Mounting evidence indicates that schizophrenia is associated with adverse intrauterine experiences. An adverse or suboptimal fetal environment can cause irreversible changes in brain that can subsequently exert long-lasting effects through resetting a diverse array of biological systems including endocrine, immune and nervous. It is evident from animal and imaging studies that subtle variations in the intrauterine environment can cause recognizable differences in brain structure and cognitive functions in the offspring. A wide variety of environmental factors may play a role in precipitating the emergent developmental dysregulation and the consequent evolution of psychiatric traits in early adulthood by inducing inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and epigenetic dysregulation. However, the precise mechanisms behind such relationships and the specificity of the risk factors for schizophrenia remain exploratory. Considering the paucity of knowledge on fetal programming of schizophrenia, it is timely to consolidate the recent advances in the field and put forward an integrated overview of the mechanisms associated with fetal origin of schizophrenia.

AB  - Modulating neuronal activity by electrical stimulation has expanded from the realm of motor indications. into the field of psychiatric disorders in the past 10 years. The medial forebrain bundle (MFB), with a seminal role in motor, reward orientated and affect regulation behaviors, and its afferent and efferent loci, have been targeted in several DBS trials in patients with psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the consequences of modulating the MFB in affective disorders. The paper reviews the relevant preclinical literature investigating electrical stimulation of regions associated with the MFB in the context of several models of psychiatric disorders, in particular depression. The clinical data is promising but limited, and pre-clinical studies are essential for improved understanding of the anatomy, the connectivity, and the consequences of stimulation of the MFB and regions associated with the neurocircuitry of psychiatric disorders. Current data suggests that the MFB is at a "privileged" position on this circuitry and its stimulation can simultaneously modulate activity at other key sites, such as the nucleus accumbens, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or the ventral tegmental area. Future experimental work will need to shed light on the anti-depressive mechanisms of MFB stimulation in order to optimize clinical interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by the progressive and massive loss of dopaminergic neurons by neuronal apoptosis in the substantia nigra pars compacta and depletion of dopamine in the striatum, which lead to pathological and clinical abnormalities. A numerous of cellular processes including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates are considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. A further understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of PD is crucial for developing effective diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies to cure this devastating disorder. Preconditioning (PC) is assumed as a natural adaptive process whereby a subthreshold stimulus can promote protection against a subsequent lethal stimulus in the brain as well as in other tissues that affords robust brain tolerance facing neurodegenerative insults. Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that preconditioning as a possible neuroprotective technique may reduce the neural deficits associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. Throughout the last few decades, a lot of efforts have been made to discover the molecular determinants involved in preconditioning-induced protective responses; although, the accurate mechanisms underlying this "tolerance" phenomenon are not fully understood in PD. In this review, we will summarize pathophysiology and current therapeutic approaches in PD and discuss about preconditioning in PD as a potential neuroprotective strategy. Also the role of gene reprogramming and mitochondrial biogenesis involved in the preconditioning-mediated neuroprotective events will be highlighted. Preconditioning may represent a promising therapeutic weapon to combat neurodegeneration.

AB  - Background: Childhood trauma and recent life-events have been related to psychotic disorders. The aim of the present studywas to examine whether childhood trauma and recent life-events are significantly more prevalent in patients at Ultra High Risk (UHR) of developing a psychotic disorder compared to healthy controls.
   Method: A search of PsychInfo and Embase was conducted, relevant papers were reviewed, and three random-effects meta-analyses were performed. One meta-analysis assessed the prevalence rate of childhood trauma in UHR subjects and two meta-analyses were conducted to compare UHR subjects and healthy control subjects on the experience of childhood trauma and recent life-events.
   Results: We found 12 studies on the prevalence of (childhood) trauma in UHR populations and 4 studies on recent life-events in UHR populations. We performed a meta-analysis on 6 studies (of which trauma prevalence rates were available) on childhood trauma in UHR populations, yielding a mean prevalence rate of 86.8% (95% CI 77%-93%). Childhood trauma was significantly more prevalent in UHR subjects compared to healthy control groups (Random effects Hedges' g = 1.09; Z = 4.60, p < .001). In contrast to our hypothesis, life-event rates were significantly lower in UHR subjects compared to healthy controls (Random effects Hedges' g = -0.53; Z = -2.36, p<.02).
   Conclusions: Our meta-analytic results illustrate that childhood trauma is highly prevalent among UHR subjects and that childhood trauma is related to UHR status. These results are in line with studies on childhood trauma in psychotic populations. In contrast to studies on recent life-events in psychotic populations, our results show that recent life-events are not associated with UHR status. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers great promise for elucidating the neuropathology associated with a single or repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The current review discusses the physiological underpinnings of the blood-oxygen level dependent response and how trauma affects the signal. Methodological challenges associated with fMRI data analyses are considered next, followed by a review of current mTBI findings. The majority of evoked studies have examined working memory and attentional functioning, with results suggesting a complex relationship between cognitive load/attentional demand and neuronal activation. Researchers have more recently investigated how brain trauma affects functional connectivity, and the benefits/drawbacks of evoked and functional connectivity studies are also discussed. The review concludes by discussing the major clinical challenges associated with fMRI studies of brain-injured patients, including patient heterogeneity and variations in scan-time post-injury. We conclude that the fMRI signal represents a complex filter through which researchers can measure the physiological correlates of concussive symptoms, an important goal for the burgeoning field of mTBI research.

AB  - Background: A central question for the organisation of mental health care is whether the same clinicians should be responsible for a patient's care across inpatient and outpatient settings (continuity of care) or if there should be separate teams (specialisation). Current reforms in Europe are inconsistent on which to favour, and are based on little research evidence. This review is the first systematic appraisal of the existing evidence comparing continuity of care and specialisation across inpatient and outpatient mental health care.
   Method: A systematic search for studies of any design comparing mental health care systems based on continuity or specialisation of care was performed. Differences in clinical, social and cost-effective outcomes, and the views and experiences of patients and staff were assessed using narrative synthesis.
   Results: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies had methodological shortcomings, but findings point towards reduced length and number of hospitalisations, and faster or more flexible transitions between services in continuity systems. Survey and qualitative findings suggest advantages of both systems, whilst patients and staff appear to prefer a continuity system.
   Conclusion: The evidence base suggests better outcomes and stakeholder preferences for continuity of care systems, but the quality of existing studies is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. Higher quality comparative studies across various settings and population groups are urgently needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim was to describe current reports in the scientific literature on sleep in the intensive care environment and sleep deprivation associated with painful experiences in premature infant. A systematic search was conducted for studies on sleep, pain, premature birth and care of the newborn. Web of Knowledge, MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, VHL and SciELO databases were consulted. The association between sleep deprivation and pain generates effects that are observed in the brain and the behavioral and physiological activity of preterm infants. Polysomnography in intensive care units and pain management in neonates allow comparison with the first year of life and term infants. We have found few references and evidence that neonatal care programs can influence sleep development and reduce the negative impact of the environment. This evidence is discussed from the perspective of how hospital intervention can improve the development of premature infants.

AB  - This article systematically reviews studies of prevalence of childhood experience of physical and sexual abuse in adult people who are homeless in Western countries.
   Medline, PsychInfo, and the Cochrane Library were searched using the keywords: homeless*, child* abuse, child* trauma, and child* adversity and the bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed. Sources of heterogeneity in the prevalence rates were explored by meta-regression analysis.
   Twenty-four reports published between January 1990 and August 2013 in three countries provided estimates obtained from up to 9,730 adult individuals who were homeless. Prevalence of reported childhood physical abuse ranged from 6 to 94 % with average prevalence of 37 %, 95 % CI [25, 51]. Reported sexual abuse ranged from 4 to 62 %, with average prevalence estimated as 32 %, 95 % CI [23, 44] for female and 10 % for male, 95 % CI [6, 17]. Substantial heterogeneity was observed among the studies (I (2) a parts per thousand yen 98 %). Including moderators greatly reduced but did not eliminate this heterogeneity. Moderator analyses suggested that reported physical abuse tended to be higher for predominately white samples and tended to be lower for younger samples. Sexual abuse was far more prevalent in predominately female samples and slightly higher in non-US samples and convenience samples.
   The findings of this study suggest that childhood physical and sexual abuse is more prevalent among the homeless in Western countries than in the global population. Physical abuse appears to be particularly prevalent in younger samples and sexual abuse rates are higher in predominately female samples. Further investigation is needed to advance our understanding of how trauma informed treatment and care for the homeless effectively can take into account the service user's experiences of childhood abuse.

AB  - The term "triangle of death" was used for the first time by Senior and Mazza in the journal The Lancet Oncology referring to the eastern area of the Campania Region (Southern Italy) which has one of the worst records of illegal waste dumping practices. In the past decades, many studies have focused on the potential of illegal waste disposal to cause adverse effects on human health in this area. The great heterogeneity in the findings, and the bias in media communication has generated great healthcare doubts, anxieties and alarm. This paper addresses a review of the up-to-date literature on the "triangle of death", bringing together the available information on the occurrence and severity of health effects related to illegal waste disposal. The Scopus database was searched using the search terms "waste", "Campania", "Naples", "triangle of death" and "human biomonitoring". Despite the methodological and sampling heterogeneity between the studies, this review examines the evidence from published data concerning cancer incidence, childhood mortality and birth defects, so that the current situation, knowledge gaps and research priorities can be established. The review aims to provide a contribution to the scientific community, and to respond to the concerns of the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lithium was the first clinically effective mood stabilizer marketed worldwide. However, the medical literature suggests that lithium may have an indication as a neuroprotective agent.
   METHODS: This review discusses the pharmacologic activity and potential effectiveness of lithium in the context of Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the 2 most prominent neurodegenerative disorders in the United States. The toxicities of lithium, including lithium, induced extrapyramidal symptoms (LI-EPS) and cognitive impairments at therapeutic blood levels, are discussed. Cases that are thought to illustrate LI-BPS and cognitive impairments are critiqued.
   RESULTS: Animal studies have shown positive results regarding the neuroprotective and antioxidant properties of lithium. Human studies indicate a potential benefit of lithium for improving cognition. Ongoing replicative studies are attempting to confirm the effectiveness and efficacy of lithium for treating patients diagnosed with AD or PD.
   CONCLUSIONS: The available medical literature supports the conclusion that lithium should be considered as a research candidate medication for the treatment of neurologic diseases of dementias and PD.

AB  - Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases are neurodegenerative diseases presently without effective drug treatments. AD is characterized by general cognitive impairment, difficulties with memory consolidation and retrieval, and with advanced stages episodes of agitation and anger. AD is increasing in frequency as life expectancy increases. Present FDA approved medications do little to slow disease progression and none address the underlying progressive loss of synaptic connections and neurons. New drug design approaches are needed beyond cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. Patients with PD experience the symptomatic triad of bradykinesis, tremor-at-rest, and rigidity with the possibility of additional non-motor symptoms including sleep disturbances, depression, dementia, and autonomic nervous system failure. This review summarizes available information regarding the role of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in learning and memory and motor functions, with particular emphasis on research results suggesting a link between angiotensin IV (AngIV) interacting with the AT(4) receptor subtype. Currently there is controversy over the identity of this AT(4) receptor protein. Albiston and colleagues have offered convincing evidence that it is the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). Recently members of our laboratory have presented evidence that the brain AngIV/AT(4) receptor system coincides with the brain hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met receptor system. In an effort to resolve this issue we have synthesized a number of small molecule AngIV-based compounds that are metabolically stable, penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and facilitate compromised memory and motor systems. These research efforts are described along with details concerning a recently synthesized molecule, Dihexa that shows promise in overcoming memory and motor dysfunctions by augmenting synaptic connectivity via the formation of new functional synapses.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorder. Genetic studies over the past two decades have greatly advanced our understanding of the etiological basis of PD and elucidated pathways leading to neuronal degeneration. Recent studies have suggested that abnormal autophagy, a well conserved homeostatic process for protein and organelle turnover, may contribute to neurodegeneration in PD. Moreover, many of the proteins related to both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive PD, such as alpha-synuclein, PINK1, Parkin, LRRK2, DJ-1, GBA, and ATPA13A2, are also involved in the regulation of autophagy. We propose that reduced autophagy enhances the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, other pathogenic proteins, and dysfunctional mitochondria in PD, leading to oxidative stress and neuronal death.

AB  - Neurons in the mammalian retina expressing the photopigment melanopsin have been identified as a class of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). This discovery more than a decade ago has opened up an exciting new field of retinal research, and following the initial identification of photosensitive ganglion cells, several subtypes have been described. A number of studies have shown that ipRGCs subserve photoentrainment of circadian rhythms. They also influence other non-image forming functions of the visual system, such as the pupillary light reflex, sleep, cognition, mood, light aversion and development of the retina. These novel photosensitive neurons also influence form vision by contributing to contrast detection. Furthermore, studies have shown that ipRGCs are more injury-resistant following optic nerve injury, in animal models of glaucoma, and in patients with mitochondrial optic neuropathies, i.e., Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and dominant optic atrophy. There is also an indication that these cells may be resistant to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Herein we provide an overview of ipRGCs and discuss the injury-resistant character of these neurons under certain pathological and experimental conditions. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The field of neurobionics offers hope to patients with sensory and motor impairment. Blindness is a common cause of major sensory loss, with an estimated 39 million people worldwide suffering from total blindness in 2010. Potential treatment options include bionic devices employing electrical stimulation of the visual pathways. Retinal stimulation can restore limited visual perception to patients with retinitis pigmentosa, however loss of retinal ganglion cells precludes this approach. The optic nerve, lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex provide alternative stimulation targets,, with several research groups actively pursuing a cortically-based device capable of driving several hundred stimulating electrodes. While great progress has been made since the earliest works of Brindley and Dobelle in the 1960s and 1970s, significant clinical, surgical, psychophysical, neurophysiological, and engineering challenges remain to be overcome before a commercially-available cortical implant will be realized. Selection of candidate implant recipients will require assessment of their general, psychological and mental health, and likely responses to visual cortex stimulation. Implant functionality, longevity and safety may be enhanced by careful electrode insertion, optimization of electrical stimulation parameters and modification of immune responses to minimize or prevent the host response to the implanted electrodes. Psychophysical assessment will include mapping the positions of potentially several hundred phosphenes, which may require repetition if electrode performance deteriorates over time. Therefore, techniques for rapid psychophysical assessment are required, as are methods for objectively assessing the quality of life improvements obtained from the implant. These measures must take into account individual differences in image processing, phosphene distribution and rehabilitation programs that may be required to optimize implant functionality. In this review, we detail these and other challenges facing developers of cortical visual prostheses in addition to briefly outlining the epidemiology of blindness, and the history of cortical electrical stimulation in the context of visual prosthetics.

AB  - Understanding the function of genes mutated in hereditary forms of Parkinson's disease yields insight into disease etiology and reveals new pathways in cell biology. Although mutations or variants in many genes increase the susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, only a handful of monogenic causes of parkinsonism have been identified. Biochemical and genetic studies reveal that the products of two genes that are mutated in autosomal recessive parkinsonism, PINK1 and Parkin, normally work together in the same pathway to govern mitochondrial quality control, bolstering previous evidence that mitochondrial damage is involved in Parkinson's disease. PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of damaged mitochondria, activates Parkin's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and recruits Parkin to the dysfunctional mitochondrion. Then, Parkin ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins to trigger selective autophagy. This review covers the normal functions that PINK1 and Parkin play within cells, their molecular mechanisms of action, and the pathophysiological consequences of their loss.

AB  - Ginseng is one of the most widely used herbal medicines in the world. It has been used in the treatment of various ailments and to boost immunity for centuries; especially in Asian countries. The most common ginseng variant in traditional herbal medicine is ginseng, which is made from the peeled and dried root of Panax Ginseng. Ginseng has been suggested as an effective treatment for a vast array of neurological disorders, including stroke and other acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Ginsengs neuroprotective effects are focused on the maintenance of homeostasis. This review involves a comprehensive literature search that highlights aspects of ginsengs putative neuroprotective effectiveness, focusing on stroke. Attenuation of inflammation through inhibition of various proinflammatory mediators, along with suppression of oxidative stress by various mechanisms, including activation of the cytoprotective transcriptional factor Nrf2, which results in decrease in reactive oxygen species, could account for its neuroprotective efficacy. It can also prevent neuronal death as a result of stroke, thus decreasing anatomical and functional stroke damage. Although there are diverse studies that have investigated the mechanisms involved in the efficacy of ginseng in treating disorders, there is still much that needs to be clarified. Both in vitro and in vivo studies including randomized controlled clinical trials are necessary to develop in-depth knowledge of ginseng and its practical applications.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the motor symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity and postural instability. However, non-motor symptoms such as chronic fatigue, depression, dementia and sleep disturbances are also frequent and play a significant role with negative consequences in the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease. Although the progressive dopaminergic denervation is the cardinal pathology in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, others systems such as the serotonergic are affected as well. Over the last decade, several lines of evidence suggest that a progressive and non-linear loss of serotonergic terminals takes place in Parkinson's disease, though this is at a slower pace compared to the dopaminergic loss. Several studies have indicated that serotonergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor and non-motor symptoms and complications. Here, we aim to review the current evidence with regards to the serotonergic pathology in Parkinson's disease and its relevance to the development of clinical symptoms. We are primarily revising in vivo human studies from research with positron emission tomography molecular imaging. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In his first description of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Kanner emphasized emotional impairments by characterizing children with ASD as indifferent to other people, self-absorbed, emotionally cold, distanced, and retracted. Thereafter, emotional impairments became regarded as part of the social impairments of ASD, and research mostly focused on understanding how individuals with ASD recognize visual expressions of emotions from faces and body postures. However, it still remains unclear how emotions are processed outside of the visual domain. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by focusing on impairments of emotional language processing in ASD. We systematically searched PubMed for papers published between 1990 and 2013 using standardized search terms. Studies show that people with ASD are able to correctly classify emotional language stimuli as emotionally positive or negative. However, processing of emotional language stimuli in ASD is associated with atypical patterns of attention and memory performance, as well as abnormal physiological and neural activity. Particularly, younger children with ASD have difficulties in acquiring and developing emotional concepts, and avoid using these in discourse. These emotional language impairments were not consistently associated with age, IQ, or level of development of language skills. We discuss how emotional language impairments fit with existing cognitive theories of ASD, such as central coherence, executive dysfunction, and weak Theory of Mind. We conclude that emotional impairments in ASD may be broader than just a mere consequence of social impairments, and should receive more attention in future research.

AB  - Understanding marine regime shifts is important not only for ecology but also for developing marine management that assures the provision of ecosystem services to humanity. While regime shift theory is well developed, there is still no common understanding on drivers, mechanisms and characteristic of abrupt changes in real marine ecosystems. Based on contributions to the present theme issue, we highlight some general issues that need to be overcome for developing a more comprehensive understanding of marine ecosystem regime shifts. We find a great divide between benthic reef and pelagic ocean systems in how regime shift theory is linked to observed abrupt changes. Furthermore, we suggest that the long-lasting discussion on the prevalence of top-down trophic or bottom-up physical drivers in inducing regime shifts may be overcome by taking into consideration the synergistic interactions of multiple stressors, and the special characteristics of different ecosystem types. We present a framework for the holistic investigation of marine regime shifts that considers multiple exogenous drivers that interact with endogenous mechanisms to cause abrupt, catastrophic change. This framework takes into account the time-delayed synergies of these stressors, which erode the resilience of the ecosystem and eventually enable the crossing of ecological thresholds. Finally, considering that increased pressures in the marine environment are predicted by the current climate change assessments, in order to avoid major losses of ecosystem services, we suggest that marine management approaches should incorporate knowledge on environmental thresholds and develop tools that consider regime shift dynamics and characteristics. This grand challenge can only be achieved through a holistic view of marine ecosystem dynamics as evidenced by this theme issue.

AB  - Glaucoma, the first cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells. There are different subtypes of glaucoma, all expression of a common optic neuropathy; primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most diffuse subtype in western countries. To date, unfortunately, several questions still remain unsolved in the glaucoma management, such as the availability of powerful methods for screening high-risk populations, early diagnosis, timely detection of damage progression, and prediction of response to therapy. Over the last years, biomarkers have gained immense scientific and clinical interest to solve these issues, with countless molecules that have been candidate as potential biomarkers. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge about the most robust molecular biomarkers proposed in POAG, distinguishing noninvasive from minimally invasive, and invasive biomarkers, according to the procedure adopted to collect fluid samples.

AB  - Background: Research shows that there is a high prevalence of suicide among nurses. Despite this, it has been 15 years since the last literature review on the subject was published. Aim: The aim of this article is to review the knowledge currently available on the risk of suicide among nurses and on contributory risk factors. Method: A search was conducted in electronic databases using keywords related to prevalence and risk factors of suicide among nurses. The abstracts were analyzed by reviewers according to selection criteria. Selected articles were submitted to a full-text review and their key elements were summarized. Results: Only nine articles were eligible for inclusion in this review. The results of this literature review highlight both the troubling high prevalence of suicide among nurses as well as the persistent lack of studies that examine this issue. Conclusion: Considering that the effects of several factors related to nurses work and work settings are associated with high stress, distress, or psychiatric problems, we highlight the relevance of investigating work-related factors associated with nurses' risk of suicide. Several avenues for future studies are discussed as well as possible research methods.

AB  - Methadone is one of the most popular synthetic opioids in the world with some favorable properties making it useful both in the treatment of moderate to severe pain and for opioid addiction. Increased use of methadone has resulted in an increased prevalence of its toxicity, one aspect of which is cardiotoxicity. In this paper, we review the effects of methadone on the heart as well as cardiac concerns in some special situations such as pregnancy and childhood. Methods: We searched for the terms methadone, toxicity, poisoning, cardiotoxicity, heart, dysrhythmia, arrhythmia, QT interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, and Electrocardiogram (ECG) in bibliographical databases including TUMS digital library, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. This review includes relevant articles published between 2000 and 2013. The main cardiac effects of methadone include prolongation of QT interval and torsade de pointes. Other effects include changes in QT dispersion, pathological U waves, Taku-Tsubo syndrome (stress cardiomyopathy), Brugada-like syndrome, and coronary artery diseases. The aim of this paper is to inform physicians and health care staff about these adverse effects. Effectiveness of methadone in the treatment of pain and addiction should be weighed against these adverse effects and physicians should consider the ways to lessen such undesirable effects. This article presents some recommendations to prevent heart toxicity in methadone users.

AB  - Background: There are growing concern globally regarding the alarming trend of fast food consumption and its related cardiometabolic outcomes including overweight and obesity. This study aimed to review the current evidences available in relation to adverse effects of fast food pattern on cardiometabolic risk factors.
   Methods: Relevant articles including epidemiological and clinical studies with appropriate design and good quality were obtained through searches of the Medline, PubMed, Scopus databases and Google scholar with related key words including "fast foods", "processed foods", "obesity", "overweight", "insulin resistance", "diabetes", "cardiovascular disease", "metabolic syndrome", "dyslipidemia" and "hypertension".
   Results: Fast food consumption and out-of-home eating behavior is a main risk factor for lower diet quality, higher calorie and fat intake and lower micronutrients density of diet. Frequent consumption of fast foods was accompanied with overweight and abdominal fat gain, impaired insulin and glucose homeostasis, lipid and lipoprotein disorders, induction of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Higher fast food consumption also increases the risk of developmental diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.
   Conclusion: This review provides further evidence warning us against the irreparable effects of fast food consumption on public health especially the increasing global burden of obesity and cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Epigenetic studies of both intragenerational and transgenerational epigenetic phenotypic modifications have proliferated in the last few decades. However, the strong reductionist focus on mechanism that prevails in many epigenetic studies to date has diverted attention away what might be called the 'dynamics' of epigenetics and its role in comparative biology. Epigenetic dynamics describes how both transgenerational and intragenerational epigenetic phenotypic modifications change in non-linear patterns over time. Importantly, a dynamic perspective suggests that epigenetic phenomena should not be regarded as 'digital' (on-off), in which a modified trait necessarily suddenly disappears between one generation and the next. Rather, dynamic epigenetic phenomena may be better depicted by graded, time-related changes that can potentially involve the 'washout' of modified phenotype both within and across generations. Conceivably, an epigenetic effect might also 'wash-in' over multiple generations, and there may be unexplored additive effects resulting from the pressures of environmental stressors that wax, wane and then wax again across multiple generations. Recognition of epigenetic dynamics is also highly dependent on the threshold for detection of the phenotypic modification of interest, especially when phenotypes wash out or wash in. Thus, studies of transgenerational epigenetic effects (and intragenerational effects, for that matter) that search for persistence of the phenomenon are best conducted with highly sensitive, precise quantitative methods. All of the scenarios in this review representing epigenetic dynamics are possible and some even likely. Focused investigations that concentrate on the time course will reveal much about both the impact and mechanisms of epigenetic phenomena.

AB  - Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that are currently the focus of intense research. The many cell functions performed by mitochondria include ATP production, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis. One of the unique properties of mitochondria is the existence of a separate mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA) found in varying copy numbers and containing 37 genes, 13 of them encoding proteins. All 13 mitochondrially encoded proteins form part of oxidative phosphorylation complexes through combination with approximately 100 nuclear DNA-encoded proteins. Coregulation of nDNA and mtDNA is therefore essential for mitochondrial function, and this coregulation contributes to the heterogeneity and complexity observed in mitochondrial disorders. In recent times, significant advances have been made in our understanding of mtDNA-related disorders. A comprehensive review of these studies will benefit both current and new researchers and clinicians involved in the field. This review examines the major types of mtDNA-related defects and their pathogenic mechanisms, with a special emphasis on the heterogeneity of mitochondrial disorders. Potential treatment strategies specialized for each of the disorders, including the hormone melatonin and the recent advances in gene therapy, related to their potential applications for the management of the primary mtDNA disorders are also discussed.

Experimental evidence emphasizes its importance as a stabilizer of the mitochondrial bioenergetics, which could be related to the prevention of development of aging and several diseases. In the next years, conscientious investigation about this topic should be undertaken by scientists of different research areas to achieve a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms implied. This will ultimately allow the development and clinical application of efficacious treatments.

AB  - The amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles found in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain arise as a result of self-assembly into fibrillar material of amyloid-beta protein (A beta) and hyperphosphorylated tau, respectively, through a pathological process starting with the appearance of aggregation nuclei and neurotoxic oligomers. Accordingly, the search of inhibitors of oligomer nucleation and growth is considered a promising target to prevent amyloid toxicity. In recent years, a number of dietary factors including antioxidants, vitamins, and polyphenols have been characterized for their ability to protect cells stressed by several factors including the presence of amyloid deposits as well as to inhibit amyloid self-assembly and cytotoxicity and some of them are currently in clinical trial. The present review summarizes the findings on the beneficial effects against neurodegeneration and other peripheral inflammatory and degenerative diseases of oleuropein aglycone (OLE), a natural phenol abundant in the extra virgin olive oil. The data presently available suggest that OLE could provide a protective and therapeutic effect against a number of pathologies, including AD as well as obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic hepatitis, and other natural or experimentally-induced pathological conditions. Such a protection could result, at least in part, in a remarkable improvement of the pathological signs arising from stress conditions including oxidative stress, an excessive inflammatory response, and the presence of cytotoxic aggregated material. In particular, the recent data on the cellular and molecular correlates of OLE neuroprotection suggest it could also play a therapeutic role against AD.

AB  - Supported decision making (SDM) refers to the process of supporting people, whose decision making ability may be impaired, to make decisions and so promote autonomy and prevent the need for substitute decision making. There have been developments in SDM but mainly in the areas of intellectual disabilities and end-of-life care rather than in mental health. The main aim of this review was to provide an overview of the available evidence relevant to SDM and so facilitate discussion of how this aspect of law, policy and practice may be further developed in mental health services. The method used for this review was a Rapid Evidence Assessment which involved: developing appropriate search strategies; searching relevant databases and grey literature; then assessing, including and reviewing relevant studies. Included studies were grouped into four main themes: studies reporting stakeholders' views on SDM; studies identifying barriers to the implementation of SDM; studies highlighting ways to improve implementation; and studies on the impact of SDM. The available evidence on implementation and impact, identified by this review, is limited but there are important rights-based, effectiveness and pragmatic arguments for further developing and researching SDM for people with mental health problems.

AB  - Background and Aim: Psychopathy is associated with cognitive and affective deficits causing disruptive, harmful and selfish behaviour. These have considerable societal costs due to recurrent crime and property damage. A better understanding of the neurobiological bases of psychopathy could improve therapeutic interventions, reducing the related social costs. To analyse the major functional neural correlates of psychopathy, we reviewed functional neuroimaging studies conducted on persons with this condition. Methods: We searched the PubMed database for papers dealing with functional neuroimaging and psychopathy, with a specific focus on how neural functional changes may correlate with task performances and human behaviour. Results: Psychopathy-related behavioural disorders consistently correlated with dysfunctions in brain areas of the orbitofrontallimbic (emotional processing and somatic reaction to emo-tions; behavioural planning and responsibility taking), anterior cingulate-orbitofrontal (correct assignment of emotional valence to social stimuli; violent/aggressive behaviour and challenging attitude) and prefrontal-temporal-limbic (emotional stimuli processing/response) networks. Dysfunctional areas more consistently included the inferior frontal, orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, ventromedial prefrontal, temporal (mainly the superior temporal sulcus) and cingulated cortices, the insula, amygdala, ventral striatum and other basal ganglia. Conclusions: Emotional processing and learning, and several social and affective decision-making functions are impaired in psychopathy, which correlates with specific changes in neural functions.

AB  - Background It is increasingly recognised that intersectoral linkages between mental health and other health and support sectors are essential for providing effective care for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness. The extent to which intersectoral collaboration and approaches to achieve it are detailed in mental health policy has not yet been systematically examined.
   Methods Thirty-eight mental health policy documents from 22 jurisdictions in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada were identified via a web search. Information was extracted and synthesised on: the extent to which intersectoral collaboration was an objective or guiding principle of policy; the sectors acknowledged as targets for collaboration; and the characteristics of detailed intersectoral collaboration efforts.
   Results Recurring themes in objectives/guiding principles included a whole of government approach, coordination and integration of services, and increased social and economic participation. All jurisdictions acknowledged the importance of intersectoral collaboration, particularly with employment, education, housing, community, criminal justice, drug and alcohol, physical health, Indigenous, disability, emergency and aged care services. However, the level of detail provided varied widely. Where detailed strategies were described, the most common linkage mechanisms were joint service planning through intersectoral coordinating committees or liaison workers, interagency agreements, staff training and joint service provision.
   Conclusions Sectors and mechanisms identified for collaboration were largely consistent across jurisdictions. Little information was provided about strategies for accountability, resourcing, monitoring and evaluation of intersectoral collaboration initiatives, highlighting an area for further improvement. Examples of collaboration detailed in the policies provide a useful resource for other countries.

AB  - Schizophrenia is associated with by severe disruptions in thought, cognition, emotion, and behavior. Patients show a marked increase in rates of smoking and nicotine dependence relative to nonaffected individuals, a finding commonly ascribed to the potential ameliorative effects of nicotine on symptom severity and cognitive impairment. Indeed, many studies have demonstrated improvement in patients following the administration of nicotine. Such findings have led to an increased emphasis on the development of therapeutic agents to target the nicotinic system as well as increasing the impetus to understand the genetic basis for nicotinic dysfunction in schizophrenia. The goal of this review article is to provide a critical summary of evidence for the role of the nicotinic system in schizophrenia. The first part will review the role of nicotine in normalization of primary dysfunctions and endophenotypical changes found in schizophrenia. The second part will provide a summary of genetic evidence linking polymorphisms in nicotinic receptor genes to smoking and schizophrenia. The third part will summarize attempts to treat schizophrenia using agents specifically targeting nicotinic and nicotinic receptor subtypes. Although currently available antipsychotic treatments are generally able to manage some aspects of schizophrenia (e.g., positive symptoms) they fail to address several other critically effected aspects of the disease. As such, the search for novel mechanisms to treat this disease is necessary.

AB  - Neurological disorders (NDs) are one of the leading causes of death especially in the developed countries. Among those NDs, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) are heading the table. There have been several reports in the scientific literatures which suggest the linkage between cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) and NDs. In the present communication, we have tried to compile NDs (AD and PD) association with CVDs reported in the literature. Based on the available scientific literature, we believe that further comprehensive study needs to be done to elucidate the molecular linking points associated with the above mentioned disorders.

This report from the World Psychiatric Association Section on Pharmacopsychiatry examines the possible relationship of antiepileptic drugs with suicide-related clinical features and behaviors in patients with epilepsy. Materials and methods. A systematic review of the MEDLINE search returned 1039 papers, of which only 8 were considered relevant. A critical analysis of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report on the increase risk for patients under antiepileptics to manifest suicidality is also included in this report. Results. The analysis of these studies revealed that the data are not supportive of the presence of a "class effect" on suicide-related behavior; on the contrary, there are some data suggesting such an effect concerning treatment with topiramate, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam for which further research is needed. Discussion. For the majority of people with epilepsy, anticonvulsant treatment is necessary and its failure for any reason is expected to have deleterious consequences. Therefore, clinicians should inform patients and their families of this increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, but should not overemphasize the issue. Specific subgroups of patients with epilepsy might be at a higher risk, and deserve closer monitoring and follow-up. Future research with antiepileptics should specifically focus on depression and suicidal thoughts.

AB  - Analysing wastewater samples is an innovative approach that overcomes many limitations of traditional surveys to identify and measure a range of chemicals that were consumed by or exposed to people living in a sewer. catchment area. First conceptualised in 2001, much progress has been made to make wastewater analysis (WWA) a reliable and robust tool for measuring chemical consumption and/or exposure. At the moment, the most popular application of WWA, sometimes referred as sewage epidemiology, is to monitor the consumption of illicit drugs in communities around the globe, including China. The approach has been largely adopted bylaw enforcement agencies as a device to monitor the temporal and geographical patterns of drug consumption. In the future, the methodology can be extended to other chemicals including biomarkers of population health (e.g. environmental or oxidative stress biomarkers, lifestyle indicators or medications that are taken by different demographic groups) and pollutants that people are exposed to (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated chemicals, and toxic pesticides). The extension of WWA to a huge range of chemicals may give rise to a field called sewage chemical-information mining (SCIM) with unexplored potentials. China has many densely populated cities with thousands of sewage treatment plants which are favourable for applying WWA/SCIM in order to help relevant authorities gather information about illicit drug consumption and population health status. However, there are some prerequisites and uncertainties of the methodology that should be addressed for SCIM to reach its full potential in China.

AB  - Stress can have lasting effects on the brain and behavior. Delineating the impact of stress on the developing brain is fundamental for understanding mechanisms through which stress induces persistent effects on behavior that can lead to psychopathology. The growing field of translational developmental neuroscience has revealed a significant role of the timing of stress on risk, resilience, and neuroplasticity. Studies of stress across species have provided essential insight into the mechanisms by which the brain changes and the timing of those changes on outcome. In this article, we review the neurobiological effects of stress and propose a model by which sensitive periods of neural development interact with stressful life events to affect plasticity and the effects of stress on functional outcomes. We then highlight how early-life stress can alter the course of brain development. Finally, we examine mechanisms of buffering against early-life stress that may promote resilience and positive outcomes. The findings are discussed in the context of implications for early identification of risk and resilience factors and development of novel interventions that target the biological state of the developing brain to ultimately ameliorate the adverse consequences of stress during childhood and adolescence.

AB  - Numerous researches have been carried out on plants of the Rhodiola species, especially Rhodiola kirilowii (Regel) Maxim. and Rhodiola rosea. Various compounds have been reported to be isolated from R. kirilowii and R. rosea, including cyanogenic glycosides, monoterpene alcohols and their glycosides, aryl glycosides, phenylethanoids, phenylpropanoids and their glycosides (salidroside and rosavins respectively), as well as flavonoids, flavonlignans, proanthocyanidins and gallic acid derivatives and the latter have free radical scavenging capacity. The benefits claimed for Rhodiola include adapogenic, neuroprotective, anti-depresive anti-tumour and cardioprotective activities. Currently, the adaptogenic activity of Rhodiola compounds are properties evaluated mainly in human clinical trials. The mechanism of the action of Rhodiola extracts include affecting the levels of cortisol and NO by interactions with glucocorticoid receptors directly or via the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway. However, the natural populations of R. rosea in Poland are threatened; therefore, the cultivation of R. rosea and alternative species R. kirilowii might be a possible solution for producing these kinds of plants in Poland in sufficient quantities and quality for pharmaceutical purposes. Lack of proven interaction with other drugs and no confirmed adverse effects during clinical trials encourages further investigation. These herb preparations ought to be studied extensively to establish their position as potential drugs for a variety of diseases.

AB  - Phytoplankton are the main primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Their biomass production and CO2 sequestration equals that of all terrestrial plants taken together. Phytoplankton productivity is controlled by a number of environmental factors, many of which currently undergo substantial changes due to anthropogenic global climate change. Most of these factors interact either additively or synergistically. Light availability is an absolute requirement for photosynthesis, but excessive visible and UV radiation impair productivity. Increasing temperatures enhance stratification and decrease the depth of the upper mixing layer exposing the cells to higher solar radiation and reduce nutrient upward transport from upwelling deeper water. At the same time, stratospheric ozone depletion exposes phytoplankton to higher solar UV-B radiation especially in polar and mid-latitudes. Terrestrial runoff carrying sediments and dissolved organic matter into coastal waters leads to eutrophication while reducing UV penetration. All these environmental forcings are known to affect physiological and ecological processes. Ocean acidification due to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations changes the seawater chemistry; it reduces calcification in phytoplankton, macroalgae and many zoological taxa. Ocean warming results in changing species composition and favors blooms of toxic prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton. Increasing pollution from crude oil spills, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metal as well as industrial and household wastewaters affect phytoplankton which is augmented by solar UV radiation. Extensive analyses of the impacts of multiple stressors are scarce. Here, we review reported findings on the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on phytoplankton with an emphasis on their interactive effects and make an effort to provide a prospect for future studies.

AB  - Objective: Depression has been shown to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and in older adults may provide a marker for the beginning of the prodromal phase of AD. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the relationship between amyloid- (A), a key biomarker of AD, and depression in older adults.
   Method: The literature search was limited to studies conducted from 2006 to 2014 that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Studies were selected if they included a group of older adults who either met established criteria for Major Depressive Disorder or Dysthymia; or were assessed for depressive symptoms on a standardised measure. Studies were also required to include an outcome variable that was a direct measure of A levels in either blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, or via neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET).
   Results: Nineteen studies were identified, 15 of which found significant differences in A levels between depressed and non-depressed older adults. However, studies were limited by their cross-sectional design, reliance on blood-based measures of A, and potential sample bias.
   Conclusions: Future investigations should consider prospective longitudinal design using neuroimaging and CSF measures of A.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a synthesis of the literature on the topic of developmental framework and health comorbidities of children and adults with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) and neurodevelopmental disorders.
   Design/methodology/approach - A rapid review of the literature and hand searching of relevant papers from 1999 to 2015 was carried out. Totally, 21 papers were identified covering a range of perspectives from neurodevelopmental trajectories to prevalence, treatment and service use.
   Findings - All papers were utilised and complemented a previous review which, however, had not covered the aspect of treatment approaches for this population. As a group they appear to have distinctly different profiles from people with mild intellectual disability and of peers with average intelligence.
   Practical implications - The evidence summary indicates an ongoing interest by the international scientific community in the topic of BIF. This group are often lost in the health system and may not receive appropriate care given their unique clinical profile. More should be done to increase clinicians' awareness of their health needs.
   Originality/value - The paper adds substantially to a previous review of the topic. An international collaboration may help to increase the profile of this work and lead to further changes in the care these individuals receive across the diagnostic and treatment spectrum.

AB  - Metabolomics is gaining an important role in the investigation of neurological pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which are characterized by the absence of reliable diagnostic markers. The magnitude of emotional, physical, and financial burden related to these three devastating pathologies can be deduced considering that nearly 20 million people worldwide suffer from these three pathologies.
   In this chapter, an overview of the recent advances and applications of metabolomics to investigate these major neurodegenerative diseases will be presented. Metabolomics strategies are now being developed to map potential perturbations in biochemical pathways linked to neurodegeneration. Going further, there is more and more evidence supporting the concept that these pathologies can begin years or even decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, and thus, metabolomics is also increasingly being used to discover preclinical biomarkers of these neurological diseases.

AB  - Sleep has a critical role in promoting health. Research over the past decade has documented that sleep disturbance has a powerful influence on the risk of infectious disease, the occurrence and progression of several major medical illnesses including cardiovascular disease and cancer, and the incidence of depression. Increasingly, the field has focused on identifying the biological mechanisms underlying these effects. This review highlights the impact of sleep on adaptive and innate immunity, with consideration of the dynamics of sleep disturbance, sleep restriction, and insomnia on (a) antiviral immune responses with consequences for vaccine responses and infectious disease risk and (b) proinflammatory immune responses with implications for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and depression. This review also discusses the neuroendocrine and autonomic neural underpinnings linking sleep disturbance and immunity and the reciprocal links between sleep and inflammatory biology. Finally, interventions are discussed as effective strategies to improve sleep, and potential opportunities are identified to promote sleep health for therapeutic control of chronic infectious, inflammatory, and neuropsychiatric diseases.

AB  - In this review, it is argued that greatly improved understanding of domestication may be gained from extending the field of behaviour genetics to also include epigenetics. Domestication offers an interesting framework of rapid evolutionary changes caused by well-defined selection pressures. Behaviour is an important phenotype in this context, as it represents the primary means of response to environmental challenges. An overview is provided of the evidence for genetic involvement in behavioural control and the presently used methods for finding so-called behaviour genes. This shows that evolutionary changes in behaviour are to a large extent correlated to changes in patterns of gene expression, which brings epigenetics into the focus. This area is concerned with the mechanisms controlling the timing and extent of gene expression, and a lot of focus has been placed on methylation of cytosine in promoter regions, usually associated with genetic downregulation. The review considers the available evidence that environmental input, for example stress, can modify methylation and other epigenetic marks and subsequently affect behaviour. Furthermore, several studies are reviewed, demonstrating that acquired epigenetic modifications can be inherited and cause trans-generational behaviour changes. In conclusion, epigenetics may signify a new paradigm in this respect, as it shows that genomic modifications can be caused by environmental signals, and random mutations in DNA sequence are therefore not the only sources of heritable genetic variation.

AB  - Background: The consequences of fatigue for the health and safety of seafarers has caused concern in the industry and among academics, and indicates the importance of further research into risk factors and preventive interventions at sea. This review gives an overview of the key issues relating to seafarer fatigue.
   Materials and methods: A literature study was conducted aiming to collect publications that address risk factors for fatigue, short-term and long-term consequences for health and safety, and options for fatigue mitigation at sea. Due to the limited number of publications that deals with seafarers, experiences from other populations sharing the same exposures (e.g. shift work) were also included when appropriate.
   Results: Work at sea involves multiple risk factors for fatigue, which in addition to acute effects (e.g., impaired cognition, accidents) contributes through autonomic, immunologic and metabolic pathways to the development of chronic diseases that are particularly prevalent in seafarers.
   Conclusions: Taking into account the frequency of seafarer fatigue and the severity of its consequences, one should look into the efficacy of the current legislative framework and the industry's compliance, the manning of the international merchant fleet, and optimised working, living and sleeping conditions at sea. Considering circumstances at sea, e.g. working in shifts and crossing time zones, that cannot be altered, further assessment of the potentials of preventive interventions including fatigue prediction tools and individual fatigue mitigation management systems is recommended.

KW  - GSK239512
AB  - Background: No comprehensive meta-analysis has been performed concerning the efficacy and tolerability of histamine H3 receptor antagonists (H3R-ANTs) in Alzheimer's disease patients.
   Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of H3R-ANTs for Alzheimer's disease.
   Methods: Relevant studies were identified through searches of PubMed (R), databases of the Cochrane Library (c), and PsycINFO citations up to June 19, 2015. The primary outcome was a change in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Secondary outcomes were Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scores, discontinuation rate, and individual adverse events/side effects. Risk ratios, numbers-needed-to-treat/harm, and standardized mean differences were calculated based on a random effects model.
   Results: The computerized search initially yielded 33 studies after excluding duplicates. We excluded 29 of these articles following a review of titles and abstracts and one RCT including healthy subjects after full-text review. We identified three RCTs (two on GSK239512 and one on ABT-288) including 402 patients. Pooled H3R-ANTs were not superior to placebo for improvement in MMSE and NPI scores. Discontinuation rate and individual adverse events/side effects did not differ among the pooled groups.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that H3R-ANTs are not effective in treating cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. However, further studies with larger samples are required for definitive conclusions regarding responsive subpopulations.

AB  - Context: Information processing requires a series of mental operations from encoding to storage and retrieval. A large number of studies have examined the retrieval process, but less attention has been paid to the encoding process.
   Evidence Acquisition: The aims of this paper were to provide an overview of perceptual and semantic encoding processes as well as identify and compare the structural and functional changes in the memory encoding process of young and old adults. A review of encoding was conducted based on findings from two recent memory encoding studies and a literature search on memory encoding. It included studies published from January 1980 to December 2013 and appeared in the databases of CINAHL, MEDLINE, AMED, Journals@ Ovid and the ISI Web of Science.
   Results: Five stages of encoding were identified. They were: 1) early perceptual processing; 2) prelexical feature detection and early lexical processing; 3) initial selection of information from competing information for processing in the working memory; 4) semantic, syntactic, or lexical processing; and 5) updating of working memory with the newly created item representation and elaborate processing. Perceptual encoding appears to be modulated by sensory cortices, in which stimuli are initially perceived and processed, whereas semantic encoding involves the left prefrontal cortex temporal regions by both verbal and nonverbal stimuli.
   Conclusions: Early perceptual processing and the selection of information processes associated with memory encoding are comparable between young and old adults. However, they showed differences in semantic processing, updating of working memory, and elaborate processing. These differences might be due to reduced volume and functional capacity of the hippocampus and frontal lobes, shrinkage in the white matter and its associated tracts, as well as inability of the aging brain to produce levels of dopamine comparable to its previous levels.

AB  - Background: Despite the benefits of medications and surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD), these treatments are not without complications and neuroprotective strategies are still lacking. Therefore, there is a need for effective alternative approaches to treat motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. During the last decade, several studies have investigated endurance exercise training as a potential treatment for individuals with PD.
   Objective: This paper reviews the therapeutically beneficial effects of endurance exercise training on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD.
   Methods: First, we performed a systematic review of the literature on the effects of endurance exercise training on motor and non-motor signs of parkinsonism, functional outcomes including gait, balance and mobility, depression and fatigue, quality of life and perceived patient improvement, cardiorespiratory function, neurophysiological measures, and motor control measures in PD. Second we performed a meta-analysis on the motor section of the UPDRS. Then, we focused on several important factors to consider when prescribing endurance exercise training in PD such as intensity, duration, frequency, specificity and type of exercise. In addition, we identified current knowledge gaps regarding endurance exercise training in PD and made suggestions for future research.
   Results: A total of eight randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. This systematic review synthesizes evidence that endurance exercise training at a sufficiently high level enhances cardiorespiratory capacity and endurance by improving VO2 max and gait in moderately to mildly affected individuals with PD. However, there is not yet a proven effect of endurance exercise training on specific features of PD such as motor signs of parkinsonism.
   Conclusion: Endurance exercise training improves physical conditioning in PD patients; however, to date, there is insufficient evidence to include endurance exercise training as a specific treatment for PD. There is a need for well-designed large-scale randomized controlled trials to confirm benefits and safety of endurance exercise training in PD and to explore potential benefits on the motor and non-motor signs of PD.

AB  - Modeling innate immunity in Drosophila melanogaster has a rich history that includes ground-breaking discoveries in pathogen detection and signaling. These studies revealed the evolutionary conservation of innate immune pathways and mechanisms of pathogen detection, resulting in an explosion of findings in the innate immunity field. In D. melanogaster, studies have focused primarily on responses driven by the larval fat body and hemocytes, analogs to vertebrate liver and macrophages, respectively. Aside from pathogen detection, many recent mammalian studies associate innate immune pathways with development and disease pathogenesis. Importantly, these studies stress that the innate immune response is integral to maintain central nervous system (CNS) health. Microglia, which are the vertebrate CNS mononuclear phagocytes, drive vertebrate cerebral innate immunity. The invertebrate CNS contains microglial-like cells - ensheathing glia and reticular glia - that could be used to answer basic questions regarding the evolutionarily conserved innate immune processes in CNS development and health. A deeper understanding of the relationship between D. melanogaster phagocytic microglial-like cells and vertebrate microglia will be key to answering basic and translational questions related to cerebral innate immunity.

AB  - Though much evidence indicates that work stress increases the risk of incident of coronary heart disease (CHD), little is known about the role of work stress in the development of recurrent CHD events. The objective of this study was to review and synthesize the existing epidemiological evidence on whether work stress increases the risk of recurrent CHD events in patients with the first CHD. A systematic literature search in the PubMed database (January 1990 December 2013) for prospective studies was performed. Inclusion criteria included: peer-reviewed English papers with original data, studies with substantial follow-up (> 3 years), end points defined as cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, as well as work stress assessed with reliable and valid instruments. Meta-analysis using random-effects modeling was conducted in order to synthesize the observed effects across the studies. Five papers derived from 4 prospective studies conducted in Sweden and Canada were included in this systematic review. The measurement of work stress was based on the Demand-Control model (4 papers) or the Effort-Reward Imbalance model (1 paper). According to the estimation by meta-analysis based on 4 papers, a significant effect of work stress on the risk of recurrent CHD events (hazard ratio: 1.65, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-2.22) was observed. Our findings suggest that, in patients with the first CHD, work stress is associated with an increased relative risk of recurrent CHD events by 65%. Due to the limited literature, more well-designed prospective research is needed to examine this association, in particular, from other than western regions of the world.

AB  - Background. Information is needed for development of mental health (MH) services; and particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LAMICs), where the MH systems are relatively weak. World Health Organization (WHO) has worked intensively during the last 15 years for developing a strategy in the field of MH information.
   Methods. The paper analyzes WHO instruments developed in this area [ MH Atlas series and WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS)].
   Results. Data from Atlas series and WHO-AIMS demonstrated that the role of information is often neglected at all the steps: from data collection and processing to analysis, dissemination and utilization, particularly in LAMIC. By implementing several sets of feasible MH indicators WHO has technically supported the improvement of the MH information systems in LAMICs.
   Conclusions. In the last few years the importance of information in MH has increased and has been successfully highlighted; but a lot of work still needs to be done for achieving a minimum set of MH indicators and reliable data that can be used by both high-income countries and LAMIC.

AB  - Traditionally, it has been assumed that sperm are a vehicle for genes and nothing more. As such, the only source of variance in offspring phenotype via the paternal line has been genetic effects. More recently, however, it has been shown that the phenotype or environment of fathers can affect the phenotype of offspring, challenging traditional theory with implications for evolution, ecology and human in vitro fertilisation. Here, I review sources of non-genetic variation in the sperm phenotype and evidence for co-variation between sperm and offspring phenotypes. I distinguish between two environmental sources of variation in sperm phenotype: the pre-release environment and the post-release environment. Pre-release, sperm phenotypes can vary within species according to male phenotype (e.g. body size) and according to local conditions such as the threat of sperm competition. Post-release, the physicochemical conditions that sperm experience, either when freely spawned or when released into the female reproductive tract, can further filter or modify sperm phenotypes. I find evidence that both pre- and post-release sperm environments can affect offspring phenotype; fertilisation is not a new beginning - rather, the experiences of sperm with the father and upon release can drive variation in the phenotype of the offspring. Interestingly, there was some evidence for co-variation between the stress resistance of sperm and the stress resistance of offspring, though more studies are needed to determine whether such effects are widespread. Overall, it appears that environmentally induced covariation between sperm and offspring phenotypes is non-negligible and further work is needed to determine their prevalence and strength.

AB  - Normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) is a multifactorial disease where mechanical stresses and vascular alterations to the optic nerve head probably represent the key pathogenic moments. Although intraocular pressure (IOP) plays a crucial role in the retinal ganglion cell loss, the IOP reduction does not necessarily reduces the disease progression. Therefore, several IOP-independent factors such as glutamate toxicity, oxidative stress, autoimmunity, and vascular dysregulation have been considered in the pathogenesis of NTG. Numerous evidences documented an impairment of the ocular blood flow, involved both in the onset and progression of the disease. The IOP reduction remains the main strategy to reduce the damage progression in NTG. Recently, new treatment strategies have been proposed to improve the control of the disease. Neuroprotection is a rapidly expanding area of research, which represents a promising tool. In the present review, we summarize the recent scientific advancements in the pathogenesis and treatment of NTG.

AB  - Background: Prevalence rates of smoking in people with mental illness are high, and premature mortality attributed to tobacco related physical comorbidity is a major concern. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing rates of receipt of smoking cessation advice among people with and without mental illness.
   Method: Major electronic databases were searched from inception till August 2014 for studies comparing rates of receipt of smoking cessation advice of people with and without a mental illness. Two independent authors completed methodological appraisal and extracted data. A random-effects meta-analysis was utilized.
   Results: Seven studies of satisfactory methodological quality (n mental illness=68,811, n control=652,847) were included. Overall there was no significant difference in smoking cessation advice rates between those with and without a mental illness [relative risk (RR)=1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.94-1.11, n=721,658, Q=1421, Pb<.001]. Subgroup analyses demonstrated people with severe mental illness (SMI) received comparable rates of smoking cessation advice to those without SMI (RR=1.09, 95% CI=0.98-1.2, n=559,122). This remained true for people with schizophrenia (RR=1.09, 95% CI=0.68-1.70) and bipolar disorder (RR=1.14, 95% CI=0.85-1.5). People with non-SMIs were slightly more likely to receive smoking cessation advice (RR=1.16, 95% CI=1.04-1.30, Q=1364, Pb<.001, n=580,206).
   Conclusions: People with SMI receive similar smoking cessation advice rates to people without mental illness, while those with non-SMI are slightly more likely to receive smoking cessation advice. While progress has been made, offering smoking cessation advice should receive a higher priority in everyday clinical practice for patients with a mental health diagnosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Neonicotinoids, broad-spectrum systemic insecticides, are the fastest growing class of insecticides worldwide and are now registered for use on hundreds of field crops in over 120 different countries. The environmental profile of this class of pesticides indicate that they are persistent, have high leaching and runoff potential, and are highly toxic to a wide range of invertebrates. Therefore, neonicotinoids represent a significant risk to surface waters and the diverse aquatic and terrestrial fauna that these ecosystems support. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on the reported concentrations of neonicotinoids in surface waters from 29 studies in 9 countries world-wide in tandem with published data on their acute and chronic toxicity to 49 species of aquatic insects and crustaceans spanning 12 invertebrate orders. Strong evidence exists that water-borne neonicotinoid exposures are frequent, long-term and at levels (geometric means = 0.13 mu g/L (averages) and 0.63 mu g/L (maxima)) which commonly exceed several existing water quality guidelines. Imidacloprid is by far the most widely studied neonicotinoid (66% of the 214 toxicity tests reviewed) with differences in sensitivity among aquatic invertebrate species ranging several orders of magnitude; other neonicotinoids display analogous modes of action and similar toxicities, although comparative data are limited. Of the species evaluated, insects belonging to the orders Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Diptera appear to be the most sensitive, while those of Crustacea (although not universally so) are less sensitive. In particular, the standard test species Daphnia magna appears to be very tolerant, with 24-96 hour LC50 values exceeding 100,000 mu g/L (geometric mean > 44,000 mu g/L), which is at least 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the geometric mean of all other invertebrate species tested. Overall, neonicotinoids can exert adverse effects on survival, growth, emergence, mobility, and behavior of many sensitive aquatic invertebrate taxa at concentrations at or below 1 mu g/L under acute exposure and 0.1 mu g/L for chronic exposure. Using probabilistic approaches (species sensitivity distributions), we recommend here that ecological thresholds for neonicotinoid water concentrations need to be below 0.2 mu g/L (short-term acute) or 0.035 mu g/L (long-term chronic) to avoid lasting effects on aquatic invertebrate communities. The application of safety factors may still be warranted considering potential issues of slow recovery, additive or synergistic effects and multiple stressors that can occur in the field. Our analysis revealed that 81% (22/27) and 74% (14/19) of global surface water studies reporting maximum and average individual neonicotinoid concentrations respectively, exceeded these thresholds of 0.2 and 0.035 mu g/L. Therefore, it appears that environmentally relevant concentrations of neonicotinoids in surface waters worldwide are well within the range where both short- and long-term impacts on aquatic invertebrate species are possible over broad spatial scales.

AB  - Objective To assess the association between the employment status of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART).
   Methods We searched the Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for studies reporting ART adherence and employment status published between January 1980 and September 2014. Information from a wide range of other sources, including the grey literature, was also analysed. Two independent reviewers extracted data on treatment adherence and study characteristics. Study data on the association between being employed and adhering to ART were pooled using a random-effects model. Between-study heterogeneity and sources of bias were evaluated.
   Findings The meta-analysis included 28 studies published between 1996 and 201 4 that together involved 8743 HIV-infected individuals from 1.4 countries. The overall pooled odds ratio (OR) for the association between being employed and adhering to ART was 1.27(95% confidence interval, Cl: 1.04-1.55). The association was significant for studies' from low-income countries (OR:1.85, 95% CI: 1.58-2.18) and high-income countries (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.02-1.74) but not middle-income countries (OR:0.94, 95% CI: 0.62-1.42). In addition, studies published after 2011 and larger studies showed less association between employment and adherence than earlier and small studies, respectively.
   Conclusion Employed HIV-infected individuals, particularly those in low- and high-income countries, were more likely to adhere to ART than unemployed individuals. Further research is needed on the mechanisms which employment and ART adherence affect each other and on whether employment-creation interventions can positively influence ART adherence, HIV disease progression and quality of life.

AB  - Background: Neuroinflammation and white matter pathology have each been independently associated with schizophrenia, and experimental studies have revealed mechanisms by which the two can interact in vitro, but whether these abnormalities simultaneously co-occur in people with schizophrenia remains unclear.
   Method: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science from inception through 12 January 2014 for studies reporting human data on the relationship between microglial or astroglial activation, or cytokines and white matter pathology in schizophrenia.
   Results: Fifteen studies totaling 792 subjects (350 with schizophrenia, 346 controls, 49 with bipolar disorder, 37 with major depressive disorder and 10 with Alzheimer's disease) met all eligibility criteria. Five neuropathological and two neuroimaging studies collectively yielded consistent evidence of an association between schizophrenia and microglial activation, particularly in white rather than gray matter regions. Ultrastructural analysis revealed activated microglia near dystrophic and apoptotic oligodendroglia, demyelinating and dysmyelinating axons and swollen and vacuolated astroglia in subjects with schizophrenia but not controls. Two neuroimaging studies found an association between carrier status for a functional single nucleotide polymorphism in the interleukin-1 beta gene and abnormal white as well as gray matter volumes in schizophrenia but not controls. A neuropathological study found that orbitofrontal white matter neuronal density was increased in schizophrenia cases exhibiting high transcription levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines relative to those exhibiting low transcription levels and to controls. Schizophrenia was associated with decreased astroglial density specifically in subgenual cingulate white matter and anterior corpus callosum, but not other gray or white matter areas. Astrogliosis was consistently absent. Data on astroglial gene expression, mRNA expression and protein concentration were inconsistent.
   Conclusion: Neuroinflammation is associated with white matter pathology in people with schizophrenia, and may contribute to structural and functional disconnectivity, even at the first episode of psychosis.

AB  - Air pollution is a widespread environmental concern. Considerable epidemiological evidence indicates air pollution, particularly particulate matter (PM), as a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the developed countries. The main objective of our review is to assess the levels and sources of PM across the Middle East area and to search evidence for the relationship between PM exposure and CVD. An extensive review of the published literature pertaining to the subject (2000-2013) was conducted using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar databases. We reveal that low utilization of public transport, ageing vehicle fleet and the increasing number of personal cars in the developing countries all contribute to the traffic congestion and aggravate the pollution problem. The annual average values of PM pollutants in the Middle East region are much higher than the World Health Organization 2006 guidelines (PM2.5 = 10 mu g/m(3), PM10 = 20 mu g/m(3)). We uncover evidence on the association between PM and CVD in 4 Middle East countries: Iran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The findings are in light of the international figures. Ambient PM pollution is considered a potential risk factor for platelet activation and atherosclerosis and has been found to be linked with an increased risk for mortality and hospital admissions due to CVD. This review highlights the importance of developing a strategy to improve air quality and reduce outdoor air pollution in the developing countries, particularly in the Middle East. Future studies should weigh the potential impact of PM on the overall burden of cardiac diseases.

AB  - Objective: Global tobacco control efforts in both prevention and treatment have advanced to levels never imagined 20 years ago. This review examines the relationship between mental illness and tobacco use, with particular focus on the role of psychiatrists in the treatment of tobacco dependence. Methods: The literature search utilised MEDLINE, Embase and PsychINFO databases using the terms psychiatry, psychiatrist, smoking cessation, tobacco use disorder and tobacco dependence treatment. A manual search of all references from relevant scientific articles obtained was also conducted. Finally, further material sourced included all major guidelines for smoking cessation or tobacco dependence treatment from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Results: Psychiatry has ignored tobacco dependence and its treatment resulting in multiple missed opportunities in improving the health and well-being of smokers with mental illness. Improvement in the training and knowledge of psychiatrists and those in the mental health sector will be the most effective activity to rectify this situation. Conclusion: Psychiatry must recognise tobacco dependence as equally important as the primary mental illness and to treat accordingly. A significant change in the training of future psychiatrists, introducing or implementing smoke free mental health services, changes in the management of caring for the mentally ill, and the introduction of tobacco treatment specialists within the mental health system is needed if psychiatry is serious about confronting this problem.

AB  - Lifestyle factors are important in the development of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, respiratory disease, and diabetes, and chronic disease risk can be reduced by changes in lifestyle behaviors linked to these conditions. The use of mass media and community-wide strategies targeting these behaviors has been extensively evaluated since the 1970s. This review summarizes some examples of interventions and their use of media conducted within the old communications landscape of the 1970s and 1980s and the key lessons learned from their design, implementation, and evaluation. We then consider the potential and evidence base for using contemporary technology applications and platforms-within the new communications landscape-to improve the prevention and management of lifestyle-related chronic diseases in the future. We discuss the implications and adaptation of lessons derived from the ways in which new technologies are being used in commercial and political contexts and their relevance for public health. Finally, we consider some recent examples of applying new technologies to public health issues and consider some of the challenges in this rapidly developing field.

AB  - Objective Mindfulness training has been incorporated increasingly into weight loss programs to facilitate dietary and physical activity changes. This systematic review of studies using mindfulness-based programs for weight loss evaluated study methodologies with the goal of determining the current evidence in support of mindfulness interventions for weight loss.
   Methods Published studies of mindfulness-based interventions for weight loss were identified through systematic review including a comprehensive search of online databases. Studies were reviewed and graded according to methodological strengths and weaknesses.
   Results A total of 19 studies, including 13 randomized controlled trials and 6 observational studies, evaluated the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on weight among individuals attempting weight loss. Twelve of the studies were published in peer-reviewed journals and seven were unpublished dissertations. Among the eight randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals, six documented significant weight loss among participants in the mindfulness condition, one reported no significant change, and one failed to report body mass index at program completion. None of the studies documented a relationship between changes in mindfulness and weight loss.
   Conclusion Significant weight loss was documented among participants in mindfulness interventions for 13 of the 19 studies identified for review. However, studies do not clarify the degree to which changes in mindfulness are a mechanism responsible for weight loss in mindfulness interventions. Methodological weaknesses and variability across studies limit the strength of the evidence. Further research is needed to document and evaluate the psychological, behavioral, and biological mechanisms involved in the relationship between mindfulness and weight loss.

AB  - Childhood psychiatric disorders are associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes including poor academic attainment. For some children these difficulties are recognised through school Special Educational Need procedures (SEN) but many others may remain unidentified and/or unsupported. In Britain, government data suggests disproportionate representation of children with a SEN among children permanently excluded from school. This review asks whether school-aged children with impairing psychopathology were more likely to be excluded from school than those without. Databases covering education, social sciences, psychology and medicine were searched, experts were contacted and bibliographies of key papers were hand-searched. Studies were included if the population covered school-aged children, and if validated diagnostic measures had been used to assess psychopathology. Children with impairing psychopathology had greater odds of exclusion compared to the rest of the school-age population: odds ratios range from 1.13 (95% CI: 0.55-2.33) to 45.6 (95% CI: 3.8-21.3). These findings however need to be considered in light of the paucity of the literature and methodological weaknesses discussed.

AB  - Background: Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Neuropsychiatric disorders are often associated with stroke and, among them, depression is the most prevalent. Post-stroke Depression (PSD) is related to disability, failure in returning to work, impairment in interpersonal functioning and mortality. Its etiopathogenesis is still uncertain, as well as its treatment. In Brazil, there are few data on the impact of PSD. Objective: This work is dedicated to conduct a comprehensive review of the concept of PSD, its pathophysiology, morbidity and treatment. Methods: PubMed, Medline and Lilacs searches of relevant terms yielded 3,265 papers in the last 10 years. We selected original studies and reviews that addressed the aspects mentioned above. Results: We present the history of the notion of PSD and describe its epidemiology, looking to highlight Brazilian studies. Diagnostic criteria and clinical presentation were detailed, with emphasis on cognitive aspects. The four main pathophysiological theories proposed to PSD are presented and we discuss the various treatment strategies, involving psychopharmacologic options, brain stimulation techniques and psychotherapy. Discussion: This work provides comprehensive information on PSD, of great utility for clinical practice and research in this topic.

AB  - Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has been proposed as diagnostic entity and was added to the section 3 of the DSM 5. Nevertheless, little is known about the long-term course of this disorder and many studies have pointed to the fact that NSSI seems to be volatile over time. We aimed to assemble studies providing longitudinal data about NSSI and furthermore included studies using the definition of deliberate self-harm (DSH) to broaden the epidemiological picture. Using a systematic search strategy, we were able to retrieve 32 studies reporting longitudinal data about NSSI and DSH. We furthermore aimed to describe predictors for the occurrence of NSSI and DSH that were identified in these longitudinal studies. Taken together, there is evidence for an increase in rates of NSSI and DSH in adolescence with a decline in young adulthood. With regards to predictors, rates of depressive symptoms and female gender were often reported as predictor for both NSSI and DSH.

AB  - Maternal active and passive smoking and low or moderate alcohol drinking during pregnancy, taking into account the level of exposure and developmental or behavioral outcomes, are recognized as a significant issue from both a clinical and a public health perspective. The article aims at evaluating the impact of prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke constituents and low or moderate alcohol drinking during pregnancy on children neurodevelopment by reviewing the most recently published literature. Relevant studies were identified by searching the Pubmed, Medline and Ebsco literature databases. This review is restricted to 29 human studies published in English in peer reviewed journals since 2006. The studies published recently continued to show some relationship between tobacco smoke exposure, from active and passive maternal smoking during pregnancy, and children's psychomotor development independent of other variables, but this relationship is not straightforward. The association is mostly consistent for measures of academic achievements and behavioral problems which require further attention. The results of the studies on low or moderate exposure to alcohol are not fully conclusive, but some of them suggest that consumption of alcohol during pregnancy may adversely affect children's intelligence quotient (IQ), mental health, memory and verbal or visual performance. As the reviewed studies indicate, maternal lifestyle during pregnancy like alcohol drinking or smoking may affect children neurodevelopment. All effort should be taken to eliminate such exposure to ensure appropriate children's development.

AB  - Objectives: This paper aims to systematically review observational studies that have analysed whether depressive symptoms in the community are associated with higher general hospital admissions, longer hospital stays and increased risk of re-admission.
   Methods: We identified prospective studies that looked at depressive symptoms in the community as a risk factor for non-psychiatric general hospital admissions, length of stay or risk of re-admission. The search was carried out on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library Database, and followed up with contact with authors and scanning of reference lists.
   Results: Eleven studies fulfilled our inclusion and exclusion criteria, and all were deemed to be of moderate to high quality. Meta-analysis of seven studies with relevant data suggested that depressive symptoms may be a predictor of subsequent admission to a general hospital in unadjusted analyses (RR = 1.36,95% Cl: 1.28-1.44), but findings after adjustment for confounding variables were inconsistent. The narrative synthesis also reported depressive symptoms to be independently associated with longer length of stay, and higher re-admission risk.
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation, longer length of stay and a higher re-admission risk. Some of these associations may be mediated by other factors, and should be explored in more details. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, as well as nonmotor symptoms including autonomic impairments, olfactory dysfunction, sleep disturbances, depression, and dementia. Although the major neurological deficit is a loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, multiple neurotransmitters systems are compromised in Parkinson's disease. Consistent with this observation, dopamine replacement therapy dramatically improves Parkinson's disease motor symptoms. Additionally, drugs targeting the serotonergic, glutamatergic, adenosine, and other neurotransmitter systems may be beneficial. Recent evidence also indicates that nicotinic cholinergic drugs may be useful for the management of Parkinson's disease. This possibility initially arose from the results of epidemiological studies, which showed that smoking was associated with a decreased incidence of Parkinson's disease, an effect mediated in part by the nicotine in smoke. Further evidence for this idea stemmed from preclinical studies which showed that nicotine administration reduced nigrostriatal damage in parkinsonian rodents and monkeys. In addition to a potential neuroprotective role, emerging work indicates that nicotinic receptor drugs improve the abnormal involuntary movements or dyskinesias that arise as a side effect of L-dopa treatment, the gold standard therapy for Parkinson's disease. Both nicotine and nicotinic receptor drugs reduced L-dopa-induced dyskinesias by over 50% in parkinsonian rodent and monkey models. Notably, nicotine also attenuated the abnormal involuntary movements or tardive dyskinesias that arise with antipsychotic treatment. These observations, coupled with reports that nicotinic receptor drugs have procognitive and antidepressant effects, suggest that central nervous system (CNS) nicotinic receptors may represent useful targets for the treatment of movement disorders.

AB  - Effective management of depression is predicated upon reliable assessment. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) is a depression severity scale with both self-rated (QIDS-SR16) and clinician-rated (QIDS-C-16) versions. Although widely used in research, the psychometric properties of the QIDS(16) have not been systematically reviewed. We performed a systematic review of studies of the psychometric properties (factor structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, discriminant validity, test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change) of the QIDS-SR16 or QIDS-C-16. Six databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CinAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Findings were summarised, bias assessed and correlations with reference standards were pooled. 37 studies (17,118 participants) were included in the review. Both versions of the QIDS(16) were unidimensional. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.69 to 0.89 for the QIDS-SR16 and 0.65 to 0.87 for the QIDS-C-16. The QIDS-SR16 correlated moderately to highly with several depression severity scales. Seven studies were pooled where QIDS-SR16 was correlated with the HRSD-17 (r = 0.76, Cl 0.69, 0.81) in patients diagnosed with depression. Four studies examined convergent validity with the QIDS-C-16. Four studies examined discriminant validity, for the QIDS-SR16 alone. Eighteen studies had at least one author who was a co-author of the original QIDS(16) study. Most studies were conducted in the USA (n = 26). The QIDS-SR16 and the QIDS-C-16 are unidimensional rating scales with acceptable internal consistency. To justify the use of the QIDS(16) scale in clinical practice, more research is needed on convergent and discriminant validity, and in populations outside the USA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Logic of sensations in physical activity: a review of Brazilian gyms' discourses and their projection in contemporary society
KW  - Physical Activity
KW  - Sensation
KW  - Contemporary Society
AB  - For the German philosopher Christoph Turcke, in "Excited Society" (2010), it is possible to identify a new standard of behavior, the "logic of sensations". In this logic, human beings search incessantly for sensorial stimuli and sensationalize the everyday. Our review questioned if it would be possible to identify such logic in discourses on health and physical activities. For this, we analyzed the discourse from a hundred Brazilian gyms, through their web sites. In our methodology we used a coding process in which we grouped recording units into context units. We found five representative context units of the gyms' discourse on physical activities and health, involved with the logic of sensations: promises of behavior, suggestion of emotions, proposals of sensorial stimulus, holistic concepts and esthetic projections. With that, we were able to make a lot of inferences, many of them around the premise that physical activity and health have been converging, in the gyms' discourse, into an opportunity for to experience stimulating sensations and produce a sensationalized life style, for which the gym space itself would be onstage. Thus, we corroborate the initial hypothesis that Turcke's thoughts probably apply pertinently to the harvest of physical activity in contemporary society, that this is present in the Brazilian gym discourse and that a specific sector of reflection is emergent in the context of the relation between health, physical activities and society: the philosophy of sensation.

AB  - Stress can negatively impact one's health and well-being, however, despite the recent evolution in stress assessment research methodologies, there is still little agreement about stress conceptualization and assessment. In an attempt to summarize and reflect on this evolution, this paper aims to systematically review research evidence of ecological approaches on psychophysiological stress assessment. Thus, a literature search of electronic databases was conducted spanning 22 years (1990-2012) and 55 studies were reviewed. Studies were considered for inclusion if they contemplated both psychological and physiological measures of stress under ecological settings. This review focuses on five themes: methodology terminology, research population, study design, measurement, and technology. Findings support the need to use a common methodology terminology in order to increase scientific rigor. Additionally, there seems to be an increasing tendency for the use of these methods by multidisciplinary teams among both clinical and nonclinical populations aiming to understand the relationship between stress and disease. Most of the studies reviewed contemplated a time-based protocol and different conceptualizations of stress were found, resulting in the use of different subjective measures. Findings reinforce the importance of combining subjective and objective measures while also controlling for possible time-or situation-dependent confounders'. Advances in technology were evident and different assessment techniques were found. The benefits and challenges of ecological protocols to assess stress are discussed and recommendations for future research are provided, aiming to overcome previous limitations and advance scientific knowledge in the area.

AB  - Aspects of activation, selection and control have been related to attention from early to more recent theoretical models. In this review paper, we present information about different levels of analysis of all three aspects involved in this central function of cognition. Studies in the field of Cognitive Psychology have provided information about the cognitive operations associated with each function as well as experimental tasks to measure them. Using these methods, neuroimaging studies have revealed the circuitry and chronometry of brain reactions while individuals perform marker tasks, aside from neuromodulators involved in each network. Information on the anatomy and circuitry of attention is key to research approaching the neural mechanisms involved in individual differences in efficiency, and how they relate to maturational and genetic/environmental influences. Also, understanding the neural mechanisms related to attention networks provides a way to examine the impact of interventions designed to improve attention skills. In the last section of the paper, we emphasize the importance of the neuroscience approach in order to connect cognition and behavior to underpinning biological and molecular mechanisms providing a framework that is informative to many central aspects of cognition, such as development, psychopathology and intervention.

AB  - A screening measure of capacity to consent can provide an efficient method of determining the appropriateness of including individuals from vulnerable patient populations in research, particularly in circumstances in which no caregiver is available to provide surrogate consent. Seaman et al. (2015) cross-validate a measure of capacity to consent to research developed by Jeste et al. (2007). They provide data on controls, caregivers, and patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The study demonstrates the importance of validating measures across disorders with different domains of incapacity, as well as the need for timely and appropriate follow-up with potential participants who yield positive screens. Ultimately clinical measures need to adapt to the dimensional diagnostic approaches put forward in DSM 5. Integrative models of constructs, such as capacity to consent, will make this process more efficient by avoiding the need to test measures in each disorder. Until then, cross-validation studies, such as the work by Seaman et al. (2015) are critical.

AB  - Background: Each year, 5000-6000 individuals undergo orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the United States, and of these, nearly 18N have alcoholic liver disease. Relapse to alcohol occurs in more than 40% of patients with OLT for alcoholic liver disease. Objectives: We sought to identify factors that predict relapse to alcohol or medication nonadherence following OLT in patients with alcoholic liver disease and to review what randomized clinical interventions have addressed these factors following OLT Our hypothesis was that there would be factors before and after OLT that predict relapse to alcohol following OLT, and that these, if targeted, might improve sobriety and associated outcomes of adherence with medications and appointments. Methods: We performed a review (focusing on articles published since 2004) with Pub Med and MEDLINE searches using the following search terms: liver transplantation, recidivism, alcohol relapse, and predictors of alcohol relapse. We supplemented the online searches with manual reviews' of article reference lists and selected relevant articles far farther review by author consensus. Results: In largely white populations, prospective studies document that shorter length of pretransplantation sobriety is a significant predictor of time to first drink and time to binge use. Presence of psychiatric comorbidity, high score on standardized High-risk Alcoholism Relapse Scale, and diagnosis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) alcohol dependence are predictive of posttran,splantation alcohol relapse, Pretransplantation alcohol use history variables (e.g., family history of alcoholism) reliably discriminate between complete abstainers' and those who drink, while medical and psychosocial characteristics at early post liver transplantation period (e.g., More bodily pain) maximally discriminate patterns of alcohol use Alcoholic individuals with early-onset, rapidly accelerating moderate use and early-onset, continuously increasing heavy use have more than double the prevalence of steatohepatitis or rejection on biopsy and graft failure and more,frequent mortality resulting from recurrent alcoholic liver disease than late-onset (i.e., peak of heaviest drinking at 6 y posttransplantation) alcohol users do. Fortunately, pretransplantation screening combined with a structured pretransplantation management program and a 12-step program attendance reduced recidivism. No randomized clinical trials have been performed that target pretransplantation risk factors in individuals with alcoholic liver disease before or after OLT to improve post-OLT outcomes. Conclusions: Recent research findings suggest that screening can reveal individuals who are vulnerable to alcohol relapse and targeted intervention can prevent their relapse to alcohol. Based on existing addiction treatments (e.g., relapse prevention plan construction), randomized clinical trials tailored to post-OLT patients should be conducted to improve their survival and quality of life.

AB  - Evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid system has been conserved in the animal kingdom for 500 million years, and this system influences many critical behavioral processes including associative learning, reward signaling, goal-directed behavior, motor skill learning, and action-habit transformation. Additionally, the neurotransmitter dopamine has long been recognized to play a critical role in the processing of natural rewards, as well as of motivation that regulates approach and avoidance behavior. This motivational role of dopamine neurons is also based upon the evidence provided by several studies investigating disorders of dopamine pathways such as drug addiction and Parkinson's disease. From an evolutionary point of view, individuals engage in behaviors aimed at maximizing and minimizing positive and aversive consequences, respectively. Accordingly, those with the greatest fitness have a better potential to survival. Hence, deviations from fitness can be viewed as a part of the evolutionary process by means of natural selection. Given the long evolutionary history of both the endocannabinoid and dopaminergic systems, it is plausible that they must serve as fundamental and basic modulators of physiological functions and needs. Notably, endocannabinoids regulate dopamine neuronal activity and its influence on behavioral output. The goal of this chapter is to examine the endocannabinoid influence on dopamine signaling specifically related to (i) those behavioral processes that allow us to successfully adapt to ever-changing environments (i.e., reward signaling and motivational processes) and (ii) derangements from behavioral flexibility that underpin drug addiction.

AB  - Objective: Psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses are heterogeneous in disease course and functional outcomes. We review evidence from investigations in clinical psychiatry, neuroimaging, neurocognition, and blood biomarker research suggesting that distinct bio-psycho-social patterns exist at the onset and during the early phase of a First Episode Psychosis (FEP), which can describe the risk of individual illness progression and functional trajectories.
   Method: A selective literature review was performed on articles drawn from Medline searches for relevant key words. A simulation model was constructed from data derived from two recent publications, selected as examples of studies that investigated multivariate predictors of long-term outcome following FEP.
   Results: We illustrate how illness trajectories following FEP could be described based on multimodal sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, and neurobiological information. A clinical modeling simulation shows thatrisk trajectories for achieving long-term favorable or unfavorable outcomes can differ significantly depending on baseline characteristics in combination with MRI and functional measurements within 6 months of disease onset.
   Conclusions: Multimodal trajectory modeling may be useful to describe longitudinal outcomes following FEP. Richlongitudinal data on predictors and outcomes, and better integration of multimodal (sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, biological) data, are required to operationalize this approach. This technique may improve our understanding of course of illness and help to provide a more personalized approach to the assessment and treatment of people presenting with FEP.

AB  - Background: Issues related to the field of mental health and justice require a multifactorial understanding of the possible causes of such issues. Objective: To conduct an integrative literature review of controlled studies describing forensic neuropsychological assessment. Methods: The articles were compiled and analyzed in two phases: 1) first, we retrieved all papers in PubMed by the keywords "Forensic Neuropsychology" and generated a growth curve for the subject and a cluster-based thematic distribution of publications. 2) We then conducted a curated analysis of all relevant papers indexed in Medline, PubMed and ISI, between 2000 and 2012. Results: The evolution of the field during the last 15 years reveals an unstable growth pattern and three main thematic clusters. In terms of our curated analysis, a total of 390 articles were pre-selected, resulting in the selection of 44 fully-relevant studies, which comprise four main categories: cognitive damage in forensic psychiatric patients; imitation of cognitive damage; civil capacity, penal liability and violence risk; and validation of neuropsychological assessment tools. Discussion: Two aspects appeared as the most relevant in this study: growth in the use of neuropsychological assessment as a diagnostic tool in the forensic context; and the necessity to enhance conformity in assessments.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a disabling illness associated with significant functional and psychosocial impairment. Although many psychopharmacological agents are currently available for its treatment, many MDD patients suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: A systematic review of the current literature (Pubmed/Medline, Scopus and ScienceDirect search) has been conducted with the primary aim to investigate the role of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in improving neurocognition in patients with TRD. Studies were included according to the following criteria: (a) being an original paper in a peer-reviewed journal and (b) having analyzed the effect of rTMS on neurocognitive functioning in TRD. Results: The combined search strategy yielded a total of 91 articles, of which, after a complete analysis, 22 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Based on the main findings, most of the selected studies suggested the existence of a trend towards improvements in the neurocognitive profile using rTMS. Negative findings have also been reported. However, most studies were limited by their small sample size or included mixed samples, or the adopted single-blind designs potentially biased the blinding of the study design. Conclusion: rTMS is a noninvasive brain stimulation that may be considered a valuable and promising technique for cognitive enhancement in TRD. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

In addition, bibliographic databases of published articles were searched fir additional cases. Results: A total of 18 case reports of citalopram use resulting in QTc prolongation were identified. of these, 10 cases were also associated with the development of torsades de pointes. A total of 14 cases occurred ill women and 4 in men. There were 7 cases involving an overdose with citalopram. Of the 18 cases, 12 occurred in individuals who were aged <60 years and 6 were in individuals aged >60 years. In 8 qf the 18 cases, the individuals were taking a dose between 20 and 60 mg of citalopram in a day. Hypertension was the most common comorbid medical condition, as seen in 5 of the cases. Conclusions: QTc prolongation or torsades de pointes are infrequently reported adverse effects associated with citalopram use.

AB  - Pharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are likely to be more efficacious if administered early in the course of the disease, foregoing the spread of irreversible changes in the brain. Research findings underline an early vulnerability of the isodendritic core (IC) network to AD neurofibrillary lesions. The IC constitutes a phylogenetically conserved subcortical system including the locus coeruleus in pons, dorsal raphe nucleus, and substantia nigra in the midbrain, and nucleus basalis of Meynert in basal forebrain. Through their ascending projections to the cortex, the IC neurons regulate homeostasis and behavior by synthesizing aminergic and cholinergic neurotransmitters. Here we reviewed the evidence demonstrating that neurons of the IC system show neurofibrillary tangles in the earliest stages of AD, prior to cortical pathology, and how this involvement may explain pre-amnestic symptoms, including depression, agitation, and sleep disturbances in AD patients. In fact, clinical and animal studies show a significant reduction of AD cognitive and behavioral symptoms following replenishment of neurotransmitters associated with the IC network. Therefore, the IC network represents a unique candidate for viable therapeutic intervention and should become a high priority for research in AD.

AB  - Although it is well known that metals pollution can cause neurotoxic effects, scientists are currently divided about the neurodegeneration hypothesis. That is, some scientists accept, while others fail to accept, the hypothesis that metals/metalloids, at exposure levels below those capable of causing neurotoxicity, can cause neurodegeneration-progressive or worsening neurological disease. Partly because of controversy over the neurodegeneration hypothesis, the US and other governments do not require cleanup of smelter-site metals, to the level (that many scientists say is) necessary to prevent site-caused neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this review article is to help clarify and resolve conflict over the neurodegeneration hypothesis. This analysis (1) surveys the global problem of smelter-related metals pollution; (2) quickly gives an overview of metals pollution at one of the worst US Superfund or hazardous-waste sites, a former smelter in DePue, Illinois; (3) outlines the debate over the neurodegeneration hypothesis; and (4) assesses the current science on both sides of the neurodegeneration hypothesis by means of three classic methods of causal assessment: the mechanism, unification-coherence, and experimental-counterfactual methods. Using these classic methods, the authors (5) show that available scientific evidence argues for accepting the neurodegeneration hypothesis. This finding is significant because it suggests that much current science about smelters and metals' risks may be incomplete or flawed. It also shows that, as a result, there may be sound scientific reasons for strengthening environmental-metals standards.

AB  - The first World Health Organization's global action plan for mental health recognizes the importance of mental health promotion and prevention of mental disorders, through the inclusion of one of four objectives focused on this crucial area of research and practice. This paper aims to provide an 'aerial view' of the field of mental health promotion and prevention of mental disorders with a focus on low-and middle-income countries. Starting with reasons why promotion and prevention need to take center stage in global mental health efforts, the paper provides a framework and four general principles to guide such efforts: a socio-ecological perspective (place); an inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary approach (collaboration), a developmental perspective (timing), and a participatory and empowerment approach (strengths), or PaCTS. Evidencebased examples of mental health promotion, universal, selective, and indicated prevention are described.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease which affects almost 1% of the population above the age of 60. It is is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra, coupled with the formation of intracellular Lewy bodies in degenerating neurons. Recent evidence suggests endoplasmic reticulum stress as a common and prominent occurrence in the progression of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis in the affected human brain. One of the cellular defense mechanism to combat endoplasmic reticulum stress due to excessive protein accumulation is through activation of the unfolded protein response pathway. In this review we focus on the impact and role of this unfolded protein response as a causative factor of Parkinson's disease leading to neurodegeneration.

AB  - Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease [PD] is a process that occurs alongside the loss of dopaminergic neurons, and is associated with alterations to many cell types, most notably microglia. This review examines the key evidence contributing to our understanding of the role of inflammation-mediated degeneration of the dopaminergic (DA) nigrostriatal pathway in PD. It will consider the potential role inflammation plays in tissue repair within the brain, inflammation linked gene products that are associated with sporadic Parkinsonian phenotypes (alpha-synuclein, Parkin and Nurr 1), and developing anti-inflammatory drug treatments in PD. With growing evidence supporting the key role of neuroinflammation in PD pathogenesis, new molecular targets are being found that could potentially prevent or delay nigrostriatal DA neuron loss. Hence, this creates the opportunity for disease modifying treatment, to currently what is an incurable disease.

AB  - Neurostimulation as a therapeutic tool has been developed and used for a range of different diseases such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and migraine. However, it is not known why the efficacy of the stimulation varies dramatically across patients or why some patients suffer from severe side effects. This is largely due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of neurostimulation. Hence, theoretical computational approaches to address this issue are in demand.
   This chapter provides a review of mechanistic computational modeling of brain stimulation. In particular, we will focus on brain diseases, where mechanistic models (e.g., neural population models or detailed neuronal models) have been used to bridge the gap between cellular-level processes of affected neural circuits and the symptomatic expression of disease dynamics. We show how such models have been, and can be, used to investigate the effects of neurostimulation in the diseased brain. We argue that these models are crucial for the mechanistic understanding of the effect of stimulation, allowing for a rational design of stimulation protocols. Based on mechanistic models, we argue that the development of closed-loop stimulation is essential in order to avoid inference with healthy ongoing brain activity. Furthermore, patient-specific data, such as neuroanatomic information and connectivity profiles obtainable from neuroimaging, can be readily incorporated to address the clinical issue of variability in efficacy between subjects.
   We conclude that mechanistic computational models can and should play a key role in the rational design of effective, fully integrated, patient-specific therapeutic brain stimulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Workplace stakeholders report the identification and translation of relevant high quality research to inform workplace disability policy and practice is a challenge. The present study engaged academic and community stakeholders in conducting a best evidence-synthesis to identify non-modifiable risk and protective worker and workplace factors impacting work-related absence across a variety of health conditions.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify non-modifiable worker and workplace disability risk and protective factors impacting work-related absence across common health conditions.
   METHODS: The research team searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, BusinessSource-Complete, and ABI/Inform from 2000 to 2011. Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods systematic reviews of work-focused population were considered for inclusion. Two or more reviewers independently reviewed articles for inclusion and methodological screening.
   RESULTS: The search strategy, including expert input and grey literature, led to the identification of 2,467 unique records. From this initial search, 2325 were eliminated by title or abstract review, 142 articles underwent comprehensive review to assess for inclusion, 26 systematic reviews met eligibility criteria for this synthesis. For non-modifiable worker and workplace factors we found consistent evidence across two or more health conditions for increased risk of disability in situations where workers experience lower education, older age, emotional distress, poor personal functioning, decreased physical functioning, psychological symptoms, overweight status, and greater sick leave history.
   LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity of existing literature due to differences in outcome measures, definitions and research designs limited ability to assess effect size and results reflect findings limited to English-language papers.

AB  - The objective of the present paper is to review the current status of exercise as a tool to promote cognitive rehabilitation after acquired brain injury (ABI) in animal model-based research. Searches were conducted on the PubMed, Scopus, and psycINFO databases in February 2014. Search strings used were: exercise (and) animal model (or) rodent (or) rat (and) traumatic brain injury (or) cerebral ischemia (or) brain irradiation. Studies were selected if they were (1) in English, (2) used adult animals subjected to acquired brain injury, (3) used exercise as an intervention tool after inflicted injury, (4) used exercise paradigms demanding movement of all extremities, (5) had exercise intervention effects that could be distinguished from other potential intervention effects, and (6) contained at least one measure of cognitive and/or emotional function. Out of 2308 hits, 22 publications fulfilled the criteria. The studies were examined relative to cognitive effects associated with three themes: exercise type (forced or voluntary), timing of exercise (early or late), and dose-related factors (intensity, duration, etc.). The studies indicate that exercise in many cases can promote cognitive recovery after brain injury. However, the optimal parameters to ensure cognitive rehabilitation efficacy still elude us, due to considerable methodological variations between studies.

AB  - Unintended pregnancy is among the most troubling public health problems and a major reporductive health issue worldwide imposing apprecialble socioeconomic burden on individuals and society. Governments generally plan to control growth of births (especially wanted births as well as orphans and illegitimatc births) imposing extra burden on public funding of the governments which inevitably affects economic efficiency and leads to economic slowdown, too. The present narrative review focuses on socioeconomic impacts of unintended pregnancy from the hhealth system perspective. Follow of Computerized searches of Academic. 53 scienctific journals were found in various databases including PubMed, EMBASE, ISI, Iranaian databases, IPPE, UNFPA (1985-2013). Original articles, review articles, published books about the purpose of the paper were used. During this search. 20 studies were found which met the inclusion criteria. Unintended pregnancy is one of the most critical challenges facing the public health system that imposes substantial financial and social costs on society. On the other hand, affecting fertility indicators. it causes reduced quality of life and workforce efficiency. Therefore lowering the incidence of intended pregnancies correlated with elevating economic growth, socio-economic development and promoting public health. Regarding recent policy changes in Iran on family planning programs and adopting a new approach in increasing population may place the country at a higher risk of increasing the rate of unintended pregnancy. Hence, all governmental plans and initiatives of public policy must be regulated intelligently and logically aiming to make saving in public spending and reduce healthcare cost inflation.

AB  - Climate change can result in significant impacts on regional and global surface water and groundwater resources. Using groundwater as a complimentary source of water has provided an effective means to satisfy the ever-increasing water demands and deal with surface water shortages problems due to robust capability of groundwater in responding to climate change. Conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is crucial for integrated water resources management. It is helpful to reduce vulnerabilities of water supply systems and mitigate the water supply stress in responding to climate change. Some critical challenges and perspectives are discussed to help decision/policy makers develop more effective management and adaptation strategies for conjunctive water resources use in facing climate change under complex uncertainties.

AB  - Cytokines are key regulatory mediators involved in the host response to immunological challenges, but also play a critical role in the communication between the immune and the central nervous system. For this, their expression in both systems is under a tight regulatory control. However, pathological conditions may lead to an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may have a detrimental impact on central nervous system. In particular, they may damage neuronal structure and function leading to deficits of neuroplasticity, the ability of nervous system to perceive, respond and adapt to external or internal stimuli. In search of the mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory cytokines may affect this crucial brain capability, we will discuss one of the most interesting hypotheses: the involvement of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which represents one of the major mediators of neuroplasticity.

AB  - Dementia is a clinical syndrome with features of neurocognitive decline. Subtypes of dementia include Alzheimer's, frontotemporal, Parkinson's, Lewy body disease, and vascular type. Dementia is associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms that may include agitation, psychosis, depression, and apathy. These symptoms can lead to dangerousness to self or others and are the main source for caregiver burnout. Treatment of these symptoms consists of nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions. However, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Pharmacological interventions are used off-label. This article reviews the current evidence supporting or negating the use of psychotropic medications along with safety concerns, monitoring, regulations, and recommendations.

AB  - Background: Almost all studies on the effect on health from unemployment have concluded that unemployment is bad for your health. However, only a few review articles have dealt with this relation in recent years, and none of them have focused on the analysis of subgroups such as age, gender, and marital status. The objective of our article is to review how unemployment relates to self-assessed health with a focus on its effect on subgroups.
   Methods: A search was performed in Web of Science to find articles that measured the effect on health from unemployment. The selection of articles was limited to those written in English, consisting of original data, and published in 2003 or later. Our definition of health was restricted to self-assessed health. Mortality-and morbidity-related measurements were therefore not included in our analysis. For the 41 articles included, information about health measurements, employment status definitions, other factors included in the statistical analysis, study design (including study population), and statistical method were collected with the aim of analysing the results on both the population and factor level.
   Results: Most of the studies in our review showed a negative effect on health from unemployment on a population basis. Results at the factor levels were most common for gender (25 articles), age (11 articles), geographic location (8 articles), and education level (5 articles). The analysis showed that there was a health effect for gender, age, education level, household income, and geographic location. However, this effect differed between studies and no clear pattern on who benefits or suffers more among these groups could be determined. The result instead seemed to depend on the study context. The only clear patterns of association found were for socioeconomic status (manual workers suffer more), reason for unemployment (being unemployed due to health reasons is worse), and social network (a strong network is beneficial).
   Conclusions: Unemployment affects groups of individuals differently. We believe that a greater effort should be spent on specific groups of individuals, such as men or women, instead of the population as a whole when analysing the effect of unemployment on health.

AB  - Social mammals engage in affiliative interactions both when seeking relief from negative affect and when searching for pleasure and joy. These two motivational states are both modulated by mu-opioid transmission. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system in the brain mediates pain relief and reward behaviors, and is implicated in social reward processing and affiliative bonding across mammalian species. However, pharmacological manipulation of the mu-opioid system has yielded opposite effects on rodents and primates: in rodents, social motivation is generally increased by MOR agonists and reduced by antagonists, whereas the opposite pattern has been shown in primates. Here, we address this paradox by taking into account differences in motivational state. We first review evidence for mu-opioid mediation of reward processing, emotion regulation, and affiliation in humans, non-human primates, rodents and other species. Based on the consistent cross-species similarities in opioid functioning, we propose a unified, state-dependent model for mu-opioid modulation of affiliation across the mammalian species. Finally, we show that this state-dependent model is supported by evidence from both rodent and primate studies, when species and age differences in social separation response are taken into account.

AB  - This review covers the intrinsic organization and afferent and efferent connections of the midbrain dopaminergic complex, comprising the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and retrorubral field, which house, respectively, the A9, A10 and A8 groups of nigrostriatal, mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic neurons. In addition, A10dc (dorsal, caudal) and A10rv (rostroventral) extensions into, respectively, the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and supramammillary nucleus are discussed. Associated intrinsic and extrinsic connections of the midbrain dopaminergic complex that utilize gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and neuropeptides and various co-expressed combinations of these compounds are considered in conjunction with the dopamine-containing systems. A framework is provided for understanding the organization of massive afferent systems descending and ascending to the midbrain dopaminergic complex from the telencephalon and brainstem, respectively. Within the context of this framework, the basal ganglia direct and indirect output pathways are treated in some detail. Findings from rodent brain are briefly compared with those from primates, including humans. Recent literature is emphasized, including traditional experimental neuroanatomical and modern gene transfer and optogenetic studies. An attempt was made to provide sufficient background and cite a representative sampling of earlier primary papers and reviews so that people new to the field may find this to be a relatively comprehensive treatment of the subject.

KW  - review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing service user and carer involvement in mental health care planning is a key healthcare priority but one that is difficult to achieve in practice. To better understand and measure user and carer involvement, it is crucial to have measurement questionnaires that are both psychometrically robust and acceptable to the end user.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the terms "care plan$," "mental health," "user perspective$," and "user participation" and their linguistic variants as search terms. Databases were searched from inception to November 2012, with an update search at the end of September 2014. We included any articles that described the development, validation or use of a user and/or carer-reported outcome measures of involvement in mental health care planning. We assessed the psychometric quality of each instrument using the "Evaluating the Measurement of Patient-Reported Outcomes" (EMPRO) criteria. Acceptability of each instrument was assessed using novel criteria developed in consultation with a mental health service user and carer consultation group.
   RESULTS: We identified eleven papers describing the use, development, and/or validation of nine user/carer-reported outcome measures. Psychometric properties were sparsely reported and the questionnaires met few service user/carer-nominated attributes for acceptability. Where reported, basic psychometric statistics were of good quality, indicating that some measures may perform well if subjected to more rigorous psychometric tests. The majority were deemed to be too long for use in practice.
   DISCUSSION: Multiple instruments are available to measure user/carer involvement in mental health care planning but are either of poor quality or poorly described. Existing measures cannot be considered psychometrically robust by modern standards, and cannot currently be recommended for use. Our review has identified an important knowledge gap, and an urgent need to develop new user and carer measures of care-planning involvement.

AB  - Context: The relationship between benzodiazepine consumption and subsequent increases in aggressive behaviour in humans is not well understood.
   Objectives: The current study aimed to identify, via a systematic review, whether there is an association between benzodiazepine consumption and aggressive responding in adults.
   Method: A systematic review was conducted and reported in line with the PRISMA statement. English articles within MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, and Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection databases were searched. Additional studies were identified by searching reference lists of reviewed articles. Only articles that explicitly investigated the relationship between benzodiazepine consumption and subsequent aggressive behaviour, or a lack thereof, in human adults were included.
   Results: Forty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. It was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of study design and benzodiazepine type and dose. An association between benzodiazepine use and subsequent aggressive behaviour was found in the majority of the more rigorous studies, although there is a paucity of high-quality research with clinical or forensic populations. Diazepam and alprazolam have received the most attention. Dose-related findings are inconsistent: therapeutic doses may be more likely to be associated with aggressive responding when administered as a once-off, whereas higher doses may be more risky following repeated administration. Trait levels of anxiety and hostility may indicate a vulnerability to the experience of benzodiazepine-related aggression.
   Conclusions: There appears to be a moderate association between some benzodiazepines and subsequent aggressive behaviour in humans. The circumstances under which aggressive responding may be more likely to follow benzodiazepine use remain unclear, although some evidence suggests dose and/or personality factors may influence this effect.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Several studies have reported antidepressant effects of anti-inflammatory treatment; however, the results have been conflicting and detrimental adverse effects may contraindicate the use of anti-inflammatory agents.
   OBJECTIVE To systematically review the antidepressant and possible adverse effects of anti-inflammatory interventions.
   DATA SOURCES Trials published prior to December, 31, 2013, were identified searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Clinicaltrials.gov, and relevant review articles.
   STUDY SELECTION Randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy and adverse effects of pharmacologic anti-inflammatory treatment in adults with depressive symptoms, including those who fulfilled the criteria for depression.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression scores after treatment and adverse effects.
   RESULTS Ten publications reporting on 14 trials (6262 participants) were included: 10 trials evaluated the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (n = 4258) and 4 investigated cytokine inhibitors (n = 2004). The pooled effect estimate suggested that anti-inflammatory treatment reduced depressive symptoms (SMD, -0.34; 95% CI, -0.57 to -0.11; I-2 = 90%) compared with placebo. This effect was observed in studies including patients with depression (SMD, -0.54; 95% CI, -1.08 to -0.01; I-2 = 68%) and depressive symptoms (SMD, -0.27; 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.01; I-2 = 68%). The heterogeneity of the studies was not explained by differences in inclusion of clinical depression vs depressive symptoms or use of NSAIDs vs cytokine inhibitors. Subanalyses emphasized the antidepressant properties of the selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor celecoxib (SMD, -0.29; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.08; I-2 = 73%) on remission (OR, 7.89; 95% CI, 2.94 to 21.17; I-2 = 0%) and response (OR, 6.59; 95% CI, 2.24 to 19.42; I-2 = 0%). Among the 6 studies reporting on adverse effects, we found no evidence of an increased number of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events after 6weeks or infections after 12weeks of anti-inflammatory treatment compared with placebo. All trials were associated with a high risk of bias owing to potentially compromised internal validity.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our analysis suggests that anti-inflammatory treatment, in particular celecoxib, decreases depressive symptoms without increased risks of adverse effects. However, a high risk of bias and high heterogeneity made the mean estimate uncertain. This study supports a proof-of-concept concerning the use of anti-inflammatory treatment in depression. Identification of subgroups that could benefit from such treatment might be warranted.

AB  - This article reviews the available literature on group-based social skills interventions for adolescents with autism. Forty-four studies were identified that were published in peer-reviewed journals. While each identified treatment utilized a group format, there was significant heterogeneity among the implemented procedures and evaluative methods. Studies were compared on a number of dimensions, and trends in the field were identified. The findings suggest that there is significant evidence for the usefulness of social skills groups as an intervention for adolescents with autism, and the evidence base is rapidly growing. In addition to a summary of the existing literature, recommendations for areas of future research are identified.

AB  - Control conditions are the primary methodology used to reduce threats to internal validity in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This meta-analysis examined the effects of control arm design and implementation on outcomes in RCTs examining psychological treatments for depression. A search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE identified all RCTs evaluating psychological treatments for depression published through June 2009. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models. One hundred twenty-five trials were identified yielding 188 comparisons. Outcomes varied significantly depending control condition design (p<0.0001). Significantly smaller effect sizes were seen when control arms used manualization (p=0.006), therapist training (p=0.002), therapist supervision (p=0.009), and treatment fidelity monitoring (p=0.003). There were no significant effects for differences in therapist experience, level of expertise in the treatment delivered, or nesting vs. crossing therapists in treatment arms. These findings demonstrate the substantial effect that decisions regarding control arm definition and implementation can have on RCT outcomes.

AB  - It has been proposed in the literature that there exists a dissociation between the cognitive and the affective components of empathy among individuals with autism spectrum disorders, among them, Asperger syndrome (AS). The existing results, however, show mixed results. This literature review aims to shed some light on this field by reviewing studies on empathy and theory ofmind (ToM; which is a basic requirement towards cognitive empathy) in adolescents with AS. Whereas it seems clear that ToM is impaired, but not absent in this population, the deficit in empathy appears as either specific or global to the cognitive component of empathy, depending on whether the measures used are performance or self-report measures, respectively. This literature review is the first of its kind because it is focused on quantitative data obtained using measures of both empathy and ToM. Limitations of the current evidence and future recommendations are discussed.

AB  - Giant clams, the largest living bivalves, live in close association with coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific. These iconic invertebrates perform numerous important ecological roles as well as serve as flagship species-drawing attention to the ongoing destruction of coral reefs and their associated biodiversity. To date, no review of giant clams has focussed on their behaviour, yet this component of their autecology is critical to their life history and hence conservation. Almost 100 articles published between 1865 and 2014 include behavioural observations, and these have been collated and synthesised into five sections: spawning, locomotion, feeding, anti-predation, and stress responses. Even though the exact cues for spawning in the wild have yet to be elucidated, giant clams appear to display diel and lunar periodicities in reproduction, and for some species, peak breeding seasons have been established. Perhaps surprisingly, giant clams have considerable mobility, ranging from swimming and gliding as larvae to crawling in juveniles and adults. Chemotaxis and geotaxis have been established, but giant clams are not phototactic. At least one species exhibits clumping behaviour, which may enhance physical stabilisation, facilitate reproduction, or provide protection from predators. Giant clams undergo several shifts in their mode of acquiring nutrition; starting with a lecithotrophic and planktotrophic diet as larvae, switching to pedal feeding after metamorphosis followed by the transition to a dual mode of filter feeding and phototrophy once symbiosis with zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.) is established. Because of their shell weight and/or byssal attachment, adult giant clams are unable to escape rapidly from threats using locomotion. Instead, they exhibit a suite of visually mediated anti-predation behaviours that include sudden contraction of the mantle, valve adduction, and squirting of water. Knowledge on the behaviour of giant clams will benefit conservation and restocking efforts and help fine-tune mariculture techniques. Understanding the repertoire of giant clam behaviours will also facilitate the prediction of threshold levels for sustainable exploitation as well as recovery rates of depleted clam populations.

AB  - Background: People with schizophrenia frequently have physical comorbidities that can cause pain. Experimental studies report reduced pain sensitivity among schizophrenia patients, but it remains unclear if clinically relevant pain is less prevalent in schizophrenia.
   Method: We systematically searched major electronic databases from inception till 03/2014. Articles were included that reported the prevalence of clinical pain in people with schizophrenia. Two independent authors conducted searches, completed methodological quality assessment and extracted data. A random effects relative risks (RR) meta-analysis was conducted to determine the prevalence of all-cause and specific pain in schizophrenia, and the relative prevalence compared to the general population, and to assess moderators.
   Results: Altogether, 14 studies were included encompassing 242,703 individuals with schizophrenia (30.2-55.8 years) and 4,259,221 controls. Different types of pain were considered. The overall pooled prevalence of clinical pain in people with schizophrenia was 34.7% (95% CI = 23.6-46.6). In the comparative analysis involving 7 studies with controls, the RR was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.83-1.19). The pooled prevalence of headache among 94,043 individuals with schizophrenia was 29.9% (95% CI = 3-69%) and the RR compared to 4,248,284 controls was 1.32 (95% CI = 0.85-2.07). In moderator analyses, neither age, sex, study quality or pain assessment method influenced pain prevalence.
   Conclusion: Clinical pain affects a third of people with schizophrenia and levels are similar with age-and sex-comparable controls. Future research is needed to determine if similar clinical pain prevalences in schizophrenia occur despite having more painful conditions, resulting from under-reporting, higher pain thresholds or lower help seeking behaviours.

AB  - Aims: In the last 5 years a deluge of articles on the topic of Internet addiction (IA) has proposed many candidate symptoms as evidence of this proposed disease. We critically reviewed the current approach to the measurement and identification of this new excessive behavior syndrome. Methods: Three popular models of IA were discussed: Griffith's components model; Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT); and the criteria by Tao et al. (2010). We selected these models because they are widely cited and propose specific criteria for IA disorder. Our approach is not meant to provide an exhaustive review, but to discuss and critique the most salient trends in the field. Results: The models of Internet addiction share some criteria, including feeling a loss of control over Internet use; ensuing psychological, social, or professional conflict or problems; and preoccupation when not using the Internet. Other criteria inconsistently mentioned include: mood management, tolerance, withdrawal, and craving/anticipation. The models studied here share the assumption that the Internet can produce a qualitative shift to a diseased state in humans. Conclusions: We critically discussed the above criteria and concluded that the evidence base is currently not strong enough to provide support for an Internet addiction disorder. Future research areas are suggested: (1) Focusing on common impaired dimensions, (2) exploring neuroimaging as a model building tool, and (3) identifying shifts in the rewarding aspects of Internet use. Given the lack of consensus on the subject of Internet addiction, a focus on problem behaviors appears warranted.

AB  - IntroductionPrevious studies have shown that varying acute-phase treatment periods of fluoxetine and paroxetine can result in varying antidepressive effects. We therefore did a meta-analysis to ascertain the efficacy of fluoxetine versus paroxetine for depression by varying acute-phase treatment periods.
   MethodsPubMed, CCTR, Web of Science, Embase, CBM-disc, and CNKI were searched up to March 2013. The key search terms were depression, paroxetine, and fluoxetine. No language restriction was imposed.
   ResultsWe included 17 studies with 3,110 patients. Three treatment period subgroups were created: 6, 8/10, and 12 weeks. In the 6-week subgroup, paroxetine was more efficacious than fluoxetine (odds ratio [OR]: 0.74; P<0.05). In the 8/10-week subgroup, two drugs displayed comparative efficacy (OR, 0.85; P>0.05). In the 12-week subgroup, fluoxetine was more efficacious than paroxetine (OR: 1.25; P<0.05). There were no significant differences in acceptability. Significant heterogeneity and potential publication bias did not exist.
   ConclusionsPatients' economic conditions, individual preference, and side effects of fluoxetine and paroxetine can be obstacles of successful treatment. Inappropriate acute-phase treatment, such as inadequate treatment periods, may result in pseudoresistance. Clinicians should take these information into consideration when prescribe fluoxetine or paroxetine for patients. Our results can aid clinicians in making an optimal treatment plan to increase odds of response.

AB  - Emotion regulation (ER) difficulties are a potential common factor underlying the presentation of multiple emotional and behavioral problems in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To provide an overview of how ER has been studied in individuals with ASD, we conducted a systematic review of the past 20 years of ER research in the ASD population, using established keywords from the most comprehensive ER literature review of the typically developing population to date. Out of an initial sampling of 305 studies, 32 were eligible for review. We examined the types of methods (self-report, informant report, naturalistic observation/ behavior coding, physiological, and open-ended) and the ER constructs based on Gross and Thompson's modal model (situation selection, situation modification, attention deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation). Studies most often assessed ER using one type of method and from a unidimensional perspective. Across the 32 studies, we documented the types of measures used and found that 38% of studies used self-report, 44% included an informant report measure, 31% included at least one naturalistic observation/behavior coding measure, 13% included at least one physiological measure, and 13% included at least one open-ended measure. Only 25% of studies used more than one method of measurement. The findings of the current review provide the field with an in-depth analysis of various ER measures and how each measure taps into an ER framework. Future research can use this model to examine ER in a multicomponent way and through multiple methods. (c) 2014 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Current guidelines for treatment-resistant depression in adolescents remain inadequate. This study aimed to systematically review the management of treatment-resistant depression in adolescent patients.
   Methods: We conducted an electronic database search of PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science and PsycINFO for studies with adolescent treatment-resistant depression published up to January 2014. Treatment-resistant depression was defined as failure to respond to at least one course of psychological or pharmacological treatment for depression with an adequate dosage, duration, and appropriate compliance during the current illness episode. The Cochrane risk-of-bias method was used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis of all active treatments was conducted.
   Results: Eight studies with 411 depressed adolescents that fit predetermined criteria investigated pharmacological treatments and psychotherapies. Six were open-label studies, and two were randomized controlled trials. The overall response rate for all active treatments investigated was 46% (95% CI 33 to 59; N = 411) with a moderately high degree of heterogeneity (I-2 = 76.1%, 95% CI = 47%-86%). When only the two randomized trials were included, the overall response rate of active treatment was 53% (95% CI = 38-67; N = 347). In these randomized trials, SSRI therapy plus CBT was significantly more effective than SSRI therapy alone, while amitriptyline was not more effective than placebo.
   Conclusions: Approximately half of the adolescents who presented with treatment-refractory depression responded to active treatment, which suggests that practitioners should remain persistent in managing these challenging cases. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should be recommended for adolescents who present with treatment-resistant depression.

AB  - Background: The experiences of women with severe mental illness warrant particular consideration to identify the strategies they use to facilitate recovery. This review systematically examined women's experiences of psychosis and bipolar disorder.
   Methods: Following an extensive database search, 13 studies met inclusion criteria. Noblit and Hare's metasynthesis approach was used to synthesise these qualitative studies exploring the experiences of 250 women, of which 78 (31.2%) were also mothers.
   Results: Twelve sub-ordinate themes were identified and categorised into three overarching themes: 1) women's beliefs about illness, 2) perceived consequences of illness, and 3) strategies used to cope with illness. Contextual factors and spiritual beliefs were found to be important in these women's illness appraisals. Women incorporated diagnosis-related information into illness models if it was concordant with their existing beliefs.
   Conclusions: Women reported negative illness consequences relating to stigma, loss of self-determination and changes to relationships. They employed various strategies in order to cope with illness. Barriers to strategy use and clinical recommendations are presented.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD), like many common age-related conditions, has been recognized to have a substantial genetic component. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a crucial factor to understanding the etiology of PD. LRRK2 is a large, widely expressed, multi-domain and multifunctional protein. LRRK2 mutations are the major cause to inherited and sporadic PD. In this review, we discuss the pathology and clinical features which show diversity and variability of LRRK2-associated PD. In addition, we do a thorough literature review and provide theoretical data for gene counseling. Further, we present the evidence linking LRRK2 to various possible pathogenic mechanism of PD such as a-synuclein, tau, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic dysfunction as well as autophagy-lysosomal system. Based on the above work, we investigate activities both within GTPase and outside enzymatic regions in order to obtain a potential therapeutic approach to solve the LRRK2 problem.

AB  - There is an urgent need to identify lifestyle activities that reduce functional decline and dementia associated with population aging. The goals of this article are to review critically the evidence on the benefits associated with formal volunteering among older adults, propose a theoretical model of how volunteering may reduce functional limitations and dementia risk, and offer recommendations for future research. Database searches identified 113 papers on volunteering benefits in older adults, of which 73 were included. Data from descriptive, cross-sectional, and prospective cohort studies, along with 1 randomized controlled trial, most consistently reveal that volunteering is associated with reduced symptoms of depression, better self-reported health, fewer functional limitations, and lower mortality. The extant evidence provides the basis for a model proposing that volunteering increases social, physical, and cognitive activity (to varying degrees depending on characteristics of the volunteer placement) which, through biological and psychological mechanisms, leads to improved functioning; we further propose that these volunteering-related functional improvements should be associated with reduced dementia risk. Recommendations for future research are that studies (a) include more objective measures of psychosocial, physical, and cognitive functioning; (b) integrate qualitative and quantitative methods in prospective study designs; (c) explore further individual differences in the benefits associated with volunteering; (d) include occupational analyses of volunteers' specific jobs in order to identify their social, physical, and cognitive complexity; (e) investigate the independent versus interactive health benefits associated with volunteering relative to engagement in other forms of activity; and (f) examine the relationship between volunteering and dementia risk.

AB  - Lower Central America (LCA) provides a geologically complex and dynamic, richly biodiverse model for studying the recent assembly and diversification of a Neotropical biota. Here, we review the growing literature of LCA phylogeography studies and their contribution to understanding the origins, assembly, and diversification of the LCA biota against the backdrop of regional geologic and climatic history, and previous biogeographical inquiry. Studies to date reveal that phylogeographical signal within taxa of differing distributions reflects a diversity of patterns and processes rivalling the complexities of LCA landscapes themselves. Even so, phylogeography is providing novel insights into regional diversification (e.g. cryptic lineage divergences), and general evolutionary patterns are emerging. Congruent multi-taxon phylogeographic breaks are found across the Nicaraguan depression, Chorotega volcanic front, western and central Panama, and the Darien isthmus, indicating that a potentially shared history of responses to regional-scale (e.g. geological) processes has shaped the genetic diversity of LCA communities. By contrast, other species show unique demographic histories in response to overriding historical events, including no phylogeographic structure at all. These low-structure or incongruent patterns provide some evidence for a role of local, ecological factors (e.g. long-distance dispersal and gene flow in plants and bats) in shaping LCA communities. Temporally, comparative phylogeographical structuring reflects Pliocene-Pleistocene dispersal and vicariance events consistent with the timeline of emergence of the LCA isthmus and its major physiographic features, e.g. cordilleras. We emphasise the need to improve biogeographic inferences in LCA through in-depth comparative phylogeography projects capitalising on the latest statistical phylogeographical methods. While meeting the challenges of reconstructing the biogeographical history of this complex region, phylogeographers should also take up the critical service to society of applying their work to the conservation of its fascinating biodiversity.

AB  - Major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive and bipolar disorders are severe, chronic and debilitating, and are associated with high disease burden and healthcare costs. Currently, diagnoses of these disorders rely on interview-based assessments of subjective self-reported symptoms. Early diagnosis is difficult, misdiagnosis is a frequent occurrence and there are no objective tests that aid in the prediction of individual responses to treatment. Consequently, validated biomarkers are urgently needed to help address these unmet clinical needs. Historically, psychiatric disorders are viewed as brain disorders and consequently only a few researchers have as yet evaluated systemic changes in psychiatric patients. However, promising research has begun to challenge this concept and there is an increasing awareness that disease-related changes can be traced in the peripheral system which may even be involved in the precipitation of disease onset and course. Converging evidence from molecular profiling analysis of blood serum/plasma have revealed robust molecular changes in psychiatric patients, suggesting that these disorders may be detectable in other systems of the body such as the circulating blood. In this review, we discuss the current clinical needs in psychiatry, highlight the importance of biomarkers in the field, and review a representative selection of biomarker studies to highlight opportunities for the implementation of personalized medicine approaches in the field of psychiatry. It is anticipated that the implementation of validated biomarker tests will not only improve the diagnosis and more effective treatment of psychiatric patients, but also improve prognosis and disease outcome.

AB  - Background: Transition to psychotic disorder has been the traditional outcome of interest for research in the at-risk mental state (ARMS). However, there is growing recognition that individuals with ARMS may function poorly regardless of whether they develop psychosis. We aimed to review the literature to determine whether there are specific factors associated with, or predictive of, functional impairment in the ARMS population.
   Method: An electronic database search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase from inception until May 2014 was conducted using keyword search terms synonymous with the at-risk mental state and functioning. Eligible studies were original peer-reviewed English language research articles with populations that met validated at-risk diagnostic criteria and examined the cross-sectional or longitudinal association between any variable and a measure of functioning.
   Results: Seventy-two eligible studies were identified. Negative symptoms and neurocognitive impairment were associated with poor functioning in cross-sectional studies. Negative and disorganised symptoms, neurocognitive deficits and poor functioning at baseline were predictive of poor functional outcome in longitudinal studies. Positive symptoms were unrelated to functioning in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Functional disability was persistent and resistant to current treatments.
   Conclusions: Negative and disorganised symptoms and cognitive deficits pre-date frank psychotic symptoms and are risk factors for poor functioning. This is consistent with a subgroup of ARMS individuals potentially having neurodevelopmental schizophrenia. Treatments aimed at improving functioning must be considered a priority on par with preventing transition to psychosis in the development of future interventions in the ARMS group.

   There is no consensus on the effects that low birth weight, premature birth and intrauterine growth have on later depression.
   Aims
   To review systematically the evidence on the relationship of low birth weight, smallness for gestational age (SGA) and premature birth with adult depression.
   Method
   We searched the literature for original studies assessing the effect of low birth weight, premature birth and SGA on adult depression. Separate meta-analyses were carried out for each exposure using random and fixed effects models. We evaluated the contribution of methodological covariates to heterogeneity using meta-regression.
   Results
   We identified 14 studies evaluating low birth weight, 9 premature birth and 4 SGA. Low birth weight increased the odds of depression (OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.21-1.60). Premature birth and SGA were not associated with depression, but publication bias might have underestimated the effect of the former and only four studies evaluated SGA.
   Conclusions
   Low birth weight was associated with depression. Future studies evaluating premature birth and SGA are needed.

AB  - Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a large, ubiquitous protein of unknown function. Mutations in the gene encoding LRRK2 have been linked to familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) cases. The LRRK2 protein is a single polypeptide that displays GTPase and kinase activity. Kinase and GTPase domains are involved in different cellular signaling pathways. Despite several experimental studies associating LRRK2 protein with various intracellular membranes and vesicular structures such as endosomal/lysosomal compartments, the mitochondrial outer membrane, lipid rafts, microtubule-associated vesicles, the golgi complex, and the endoplasmic reticulum its broader physiologic function(s) remain unidentified. Additionally, the cellular distribution of LRRK2 may indicate its role in several different pathways, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, intracellular trafficking, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review discusses potential mechanisms through which LRRK2 may mediate neurodegeneration and cause PD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Disasters are associated with a substantial psychosocial burden for affected individuals (including first responders) and communities. Knowledge about how to address these risks and problems is valuable for societies worldwide. Decades of research into post-disaster psychosocial care has resulted in various recommendations and general guidelines. However, as CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear) events form a distinctive theme in emergency planning and disaster preparedness, it is important to systematically explore their implications for psychosocial care. The aim of this study is to answer two questions: 1). To what extent does psychosocial care in the case of CBRN events differ from other types of events? 2). How strong is the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial care interventions in the context of a CBRN event? A systematic literature review was conducted. Searches were performed in Medline, PsychINFO, Embase and PILOTS. Studies since January 2000 were included and evaluated by independent reviewers. The 39 included studies contain recommendations, primarily based on unsystematic literature reviews, qualitative research and expert opinions. Recommendations address: 1) public risk- and crisis communication, 2) training, education and exercise of responders, 3) support, and 4) psychosocial counselling and care to citizens and responders. Although none of the studies meet the design criteria for effectiveness research, a substantial amount of consensus exists on aspects relevant to CBRN related psychosocial care. Recommendations are similar or complementary to general post-disaster psychosocial care guidelines. Notable differences are the emphasis on risk communication and specific preparation needs. Relevant recurring topics are uncertainty about contamination and health effects, how people will overwhelm health care systems, and the possibility that professionals are less likely to respond. However, the lack of evidence on effectiveness makes it necessary to be careful with recommendations. More evaluation research is absolutely needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a potential therapeutic intervention for the treatment of addiction. This critical review aims to summarise the recent developments with respect to the efficacy of rTMS for all types of addiction and related disorders (including eating disorders), and concentrates on the associated methodological and technical issues.
   Methods: The bibliographic search consisted of a computerised screening of the Medline and ScienceDirect databases up to December 2013. Criteria for inclusion were the target problem was an addiction, a related disorder, or craving; the intervention was performed using rTMS; and the study was a clinical trial.
   Results: Of the potential 638 articles, 18 met the criteria for inclusion. Most of these (11 of the 18) supported the efficacy of rTMS, especially in the short term. In most cases, the main assessment criterion was the measurement of craving using a Visual Analogue Scale.
   Discussion: The results are discussed with respect to the study limitations and, in particular, the many methodological and technical discrepancies that were identified. Key recommendations are provided. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Historically, the human brain has been conceptually segregated from the periphery and further dichotomized into gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) based on the whitish appearance of the exceptionally high lipid content of the myelin sheaths encasing neuronal axons. These simplistic dichotomies were unfortunately extended to conceptually segregate neurons from glia, cognition from behavior, and have been codified in the separation of clinical and scientific fields into medicine, psychiatry, neurology, pathology, etc. The discrete classifications have helped obscure the importance of continual dynamic communication between all brain cell types (neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and precursor (NG2) cells) as well as between brain and periphery through multiple signaling systems. The signaling systems range from neurotransmitters to insulin, angiotensin, and multiple kinases such a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) that together help integrate metabolism, inflammation, and myelination processes and orchestrate the development, plasticity, maintenance, and repair that continually optimize function of neural networks. A more comprehensive, evolution-based, systems biology approach that integrates brain, body, and environmental interactions may ultimately prove more fruitful in elucidating the complexities of human brain function. The historic focus on neurons/GM is rebalanced herein by highlighting the importance of a systems-level understanding of the interdependent age-related shifts in both central and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms that can lead to remarkably prevalent and devastating neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein we highlight the role of glia, especially the most recently evolved oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce, in achieving and maintaining optimal brain function. The human brain undergoes exceptionally protracted and pervasive myelination (even throughout its GM) and can thus achieve and maintain the rapid conduction and synchronous timing of neural networks on which optimal function depends. The continuum of increasing myelin vulnerability resulting from the human brain's protracted myelination underlies underappreciated communalities between different disease phenotypes ranging from developmental ones such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) to degenerative ones such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These shared vulnerabilities also expose significant yet underexplored opportunities for novel treatment and prevention approaches that have the potential to considerably reduce the tremendous burden of neuropsychiatric disease.

AB  - This paper provides a systemic review of the available literature on people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the criminal justice system (CJS). The review considers two main types of study: those that examined the prevalence of people with ASD in the CJS and those that examined the prevalence of offending in populations with ASD. In addition, types of offences in people with ASD, co-morbid psychiatric diagnoses, and characteristics of people with ASD who commit offences (including predisposing factors) are considered. A combination of search terms was used in a variety of databases in order to find all of the available literature on this topic, and research studies were included based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. It was found that whilst there is an emerging literature base on this topic, there are a wide variety of methodologies used, making direct comparison difficult. Nevertheless it can be concluded so far that people with ASD do not seem to be disproportionately over-represented in the CJS, though they commit a range of crimes and seem to have a number of predisposing features. There is poor evidence of the presence of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (except in mental health settings) amongst offenders with ASD, and little evidence of the oft-asserted over-representation of certain kinds of crimes. It is recommended that further research of good quality is required in this area, rather than studies that examine populations that are not representative of all those with ASD.

AB  - Due to technological advances in antenatal diagnosis of fetal abnormalities, more women face the prospect of terminating pregnancies on these grounds. Much existing research focuses on women's psychological adaptation to this event. However, there is a lack of holistic understanding of women's experiences. This article reports a systematic review of qualitative studies into women's experiences of pregnancy termination for fetal abnormality. Eight databases were searched up to April 2014 for peer-reviewed studies, written in English, that reported primary or secondary data, used identifiable and interpretative qualitative methods, and offered a valuable contribution to the synthesis. Altogether, 4,281 records were screened; 14 met the inclusion criteria. The data were synthesised using meta-ethnography. Four themes were identified: a shattered world, losing and regaining control, the role of health professionals and the power of cultures. Pregnancy termination for fetal abnormality can be considered as a traumatic event that women experience as individuals, in their contact with the health professional community, and in the context of their politico-socio-legal environment. The range of emotions and experiences that pregnancy termination for fetal abnormality generates goes beyond the abortion paradigm and encompasses a bereavement model. Coordinated care pathways are needed that enable women to make their own decisions and receive supportive care. (C) 2014 Reproductive Health Matters

AB  - Internet gaming addiction was included in the latest version of the DSM-V as a possible disorder recently, while debate is still on-going as to whether the condition called "Internet Addiction" (IA) could be fully recognised as an established disorder. The major contention is how well IA could fulfil the validation criteria as a psychiatric disorder as in other well-established behavioural addictions. In addition to various proposed validation criteria, evidence of risk and protective factors as well as development of outcomes from longitudinal and prospective studies are suggested as important. A systematic review of available longitudinal and prospective studies was conducted to gather epidemiological evidence on risk and protective factors of IA and the health effect of IA on adolescents. Nine articles were identified after an extensive search of the literature in accordance to the PRISMA guidelines. Of these, eight provided data on risk or protective factors of IA and one focused solely on the effects of IA on mental health. Information was extracted and analysed systematically from each study and tabulated. Many exposure variables were studied and could be broadly classified into three main categories: psychopathologies of the participants, family and parenting factors, and others such as Internet usage, motivation, and academic performance. Some were found to be potential risk or protective factors of IA. It was also found that exposure to IA had a detrimental effect on the mental health of young people. These results were discussed in light of their implications to the fulfilment of the validation criteria.

AB  - ObjectiveRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an approved treatment for depression. The clinical relevance of its efficacy is unclear. The clinical relevance of findings in the rTMS literature was assessed by translating Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) data into Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) scores.
   MethodWe performed electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs and non-RCT trials on rTMS using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Articles were included if published in English before January 2014. We translated HAMD scores into nominal CGI-I scores for rTMS for depression and for treatment-resistant depression (TRD).
   ResultsAbout 960 abstracts were retrieved. Sixty-three studies were included, yielding 130 study arms. For depression, the mean percentage change in HAMD scores in all sham-controlled rTMS treatment arms was 35.63 (SD 16.35) and for sham-rTMS 23.33 (SD 16.51). For TRD, active rTMS in sham-controlled studies showed a mean HAMD percentage reduction of 45.21 (SD 10.94) versus 25.04 (SD 17.55) for sham-rTMS. When aggregated scores were translated into notional CGI-I scores, for the treatment of depression, the notional CGI-I score difference between rTMS and sham-rTMS was 0.5 in favour of rTMS; for TRD, it was 0.75 in favour of rTMS. Differences between rTMS and sham-rTMS were bigger when all study arms were combined.
   ConclusionWhilst rTMS appears to be efficacious for both non-refractory and treatment-resistant depression, the clinical relevance of its efficacy is doubtful.

AB  - A fundamental goal of cognitive neuroscience is to understand how brain activity generates complex mental states and behaviors. While neuronal activity may predict or correlate with behavioral responses in a cognitive task, the use of electrical microstimulation presents the possibility to augment such correlational findings with direct evidence for causal relationships. Although microstimulation has been used for many years as a tool for mapping sensory and motor function, its role in learning, memory and decision-making has emerged only recently. Focal microstimulation of higher cortical areas can produce complex mental states and sequences of action. However, the relationship between the locus of stimulation and the percepts or actions evoked is often stereotyped and inflexible. The challenge is to develop stimulation systems that do not have fixed output but can flexibly contribute to complex cognitive and behavioral tasks. We discuss how microstimulation has been instrumental in manipulating a wide spectrum of cognitive functions including working memory, perceptual decisions and executive control by enhancing attention, re-ordering temporal sequence of saccades, improving associative learning or cognitive performance. For example, stimulation in prefrontal, parietal and sensory cortices may establish causal effects on decision-making, while microstimulation of inferotemporal cortex or caudate nucleus enhances associative learning. Building cognitive prosthetics based on the insights gleaned from such studies may depend on the development of multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) devices that allow subjects to control stimulation with their own thoughts in a closed-loop system.

AB  - Both obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasing health concerns. The objective of this study is to review systematically the effects of OSA on the development of AD. The search was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane CENTRAL and followed by a manual search of references of published studies. Cross-sectional, cohorts, and randomized clinical trials were reviewed. Besides clinical studies, we also discuss neuroimaging data, experimental animal evidence, and molecular mechanisms. Although a causal relationship between OSA and AD is not yet established, OSA induces neurodegenerative changes as a result of two major contributing processes: sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxia. As such, inflammation and cellular stress are sufficient to impair cell-cell interactions, synaptic function, and neural circuitry, leading to a decline of cognitive behavior. Sustained OSA could promote cognitive dysfunction, overlapping with that in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Early treatment by positive airway pressure and other current standards of care should have a positive impact to alleviate structural and functional deterioration. With better understanding of the cellular and neurophysiological mechanisms by which OSA contributes to AD, we may identify novel molecular targets for intervention. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Neurologic deterioration occurring days to weeks after a cerebral hypoxic event accompanied by diffuse white matter demyelination is called delayed posthypoxic leukoenaphalopathy (DPHL). Manifestations of DPHL are diverse and include dementia, gait disturbance, incontinence, pyramidal tract signs, parkinsonism, chorea, mood and thought disorders, akinetic mutism, and rarely catatonia. Methods: We report a case of malignant catatonia in a patient diagnosed with DPHL that was refractory to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and review the literature on catatonia in DPHL. Results: The patient was a 56-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who was admitted with catatonia 2 weeks after hospitalization for drug overdose and respiratory failure. Her catatonic symptoms did not respond to treatment of lorazepam, amantadine, methylphenidate, or 10 sessions of bilateral ECT at maximum energy. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive periventricular white matter lesions not present on admission scans, and she was diagnosed with DPHL. Discussion: NO treatment for DPHL has been proven to be widely effective. Hyperbaric oxygen treatments may reduce the rate of development, and symptom improvement has been reported with stimulants and other psycho tropic agents. Review of literature reveals rare success with GABAergic agents for catatonia after cerebral hypoxia and no cases successfully treated with ECT There are 7 case reports of neurologic decompensation during ECT treatment after a cerebral hypoxic event. Conclusion: Caution is advised when considering ECT for catatonia when delayed sequelae of cerebral hypoxia are on the differential diagnosis, as there is a dearth of evidence to support this treatment approach.

AB  - Histamine, which is synthesized by histidine decarboxylase (HDC), does not only modulate the immune system, but is also acting as a neurotransmitter. Histaminergic neurons project from the tuberomamillary nucleus to numerous brain regions. Activation of presynaptic H3R inhibits the release of histamine and of non-histaminergic neurotransmitters. The phenotypes of Hdc(-/-) and Hrh3(-1-) mice comprise behaviors related to locomotor activity, memory, cognition, anxiety, circadian rhythm, pain perception, food intake and addiction. We critically discuss these phenotypes that are probably caused by global changes of the histaminergic tone rather than by an altered stimulation of a single histamine receptor subtype. Constitutive H3R activity may add another layer of complexity by causing "histamine-independent histaminergic" processes, e.g. in Hdc(-/-) mice. We also discuss the clinical relevance of H3R- and HDC-deficient mice, e.g. the role of HDC in Tourette's syndrome. Finally, this review summarizes current knowledge on possible central H4R functions. Neuronal expression of H4R, however, is discussed controversially and a systematic behavioral characterization of Hrh4(-1-) mice is still missing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past decade, a growing area of research has focused on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and their impacts on neural and developmental outcomes. Work in the field to-date has generally conceptualized ACEs in terms of exposure to stress while overlooking the underlying dimensions of environmental experience that may distinctly impact neural development. Here, we propose a novel framework that differentiates between deprivation (absence of expected cognitive and social input) and threat (presence of a threat to one's physical integrity). We draw support for the neural basis of this distinction from studies on fear learning and sensory deprivation in animals to highlight potential mechanisms through which experiences of threat and deprivation could affect neural structure and function in humans.

AB  - Background: Non-adherence is widespread problem. Adherence is a crucial point for the success and the safe use of therapies. The objective of this overview (review of reviews) was to identify factors that influence adherence in chronic physical conditions.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in Medline and Embase (1990 to July 2013). Publications were screened according to predefined inclusion criteria. The study quality was assessed using AMSTAR. Both process steps were carried out independently by two reviewers. Relevant data on study characteristics and results were extracted in piloted standardized tables by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were synthesized using a standardized quantitative approach by two reviewers.
   Results: Seven systematic reviews were included. Higher education and employment seem to have a positive effect on adherence. Ethnic minorities seem to be less adherent. Co-payments and higher medication cost seems to have negative effect on adherence. In contrast financial status/income and marital status seem to have no influence on adherence. The effect of therapy related factors was mostly unclear or had no effect. Only the number of different medications in heart failure patients showed the tendency of an effect. Indicators of regime complexity showed consistently a negative effect direction. Duration of disease seems to have no effect on adherence. There is the tendency that higher or middle age is associated with higher adherence. But in more than half of the reviews the effect was unclear. There is no clear effect of physical as well as mental comorbidity. Only one review showed the tendency of an effect for mental comorbidity. Also for gender the effect is not clear because the effect direction was heterogenic between and within the systematic reviews.
   Conclusion: The presented overview shows factors than can potentially have influence on adherence. Only for a few factors the influence on adherence was consistent. Most factors showed heterogeneous results regarding statistical significance and/or effect direction. However, belonging to an ethnic minority, unemployment and cost for the patient for their medications showed consistently a negative effect on adherence which indicates that there is a social gradient.

AB  - For over a century, psychologists have investigated the mental processes of expert performers people who display exceptional knowledge and/or skills in specific fields of human achievement. Since the 1960s, expertise researchers have made considerable progress in understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie such exceptional performance. Whereas the first modern studies of expertise were conducted in relatively formal knowledge domains such as chess, more recent investigations have explored elite performance in dynamic perceptual-motor activities such as sport. Unfortunately, although these studies have led to the identification of certain domain-free generalizations about expert-novice differences, they shed little light on an important issue: namely, experts' metacognitive activities or their insights into, and regulation of, their own mental processes. In an effort to rectify this oversight, the present paper argues that metacognitive processes and inferences play an important if neglected role in expertise. In particular, we suggest that metacognition (including such processes as "meta-attention," "metaimagery" and "meta-memory," as well as social aspects of this construct) provides a window on the genesis of expert performance. Following a critique of the standard empirical approach to expertise, we explore some research on "metacognition" and "metacognitive inference" among experts in sport. After that, we provide a brief evaluation of the relationship between psychological skills training and metacognition and comment on the measurement of metacognitive processes. Finally, we summarize our conclusions and outline some potentially new directions for research on metacognition in action.

AB  - High-functioning autism (HFA) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which is characterized by life-long socio-communicative impairments on the one hand and preserved verbal and general learning and memory abilities on the other. One of the areas where particular difficulties are observable is the understanding of non-verbal communication cues. Thus, investigating the underlying psychological processes and neural mechanisms of non-verbal communication in HFA allows a better understanding of this disorder, and potentially enables the development of more efficient forms of psychotherapy and trainings. However, the research on non-verbal information processing in H FA faces several methodological challenges. The use of virtual characters (VCs) helps to overcome such challenges by enabling an ecologically valid experience of social presence, and by providing an experimental platform that can be systematically and fully controlled. To make this field of research accessible to a broader audience, we elaborate in the first part of the review the validity of using VCs in non-verbal behavior research on HFA, and we review current relevant paradigms and findings from social-cognitive neuroscience. In the second part, we argue for the use of VCs as either agents or avatars in the context of "transformed social interactions." This allows for the implementation of real-time social interaction in virtual experimental settings, which represents a more sensitive measure of socio-communicative impairments in HFA. Finally, we argue that VCs and environments are a valuable assistive, educational and therapeutic tool for HFA.

AB  - In contemporary human brain mapping, it is commonly assumed that the "mind is what the brain does". Based on that assumption, task-based imaging studies of the last three decades measured differences in brain activity that are thought to reflect the exercise of human mental capacities (e g., perception, attention, memory). With the advancement of resting state studies, tractography and graph theory in the last decade, however, it became possible to study human brain connectivity without relying on cognitive tasks or constructs. It therefore is currently an open question whether the assumption that "the mind is what the brain does" is an indispensable working hypothesis in human brain mapping. This paper argues that the hypothesis is, in fact, dispensable. If it is dropped, researchers can "meet the brain on its own terms" by searching for new, more adequate concepts to describe human brain organization. Neuroscientists can establish such concepts by conducting exploratory experiments that do not test particular cognitive hypotheses. The paper provides a systematic account of exploratory neuroscientific research that would allow researchers to form new concepts and formulate general principles of brain connectivity, and to combine connectivity studies with manipulation methods to identify neural entities in the brain. These research strategies would be most fruitful if applied to the mesoscopic scale of neuronal assemblies, since the organizational principles at this scale are currently largely unknown. This could help researchers to link microscopic and macroscopic evidence to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the human brain. The paper concludes by comparing this account of exploratory neuroscientific experiments to recent proposals for large-scale, discovery based studies of human brain connectivity.

AB  - The recent decade testified a tremendous increase in our knowledge on how cell-type-specific microcircuits process sensory information in the neocortex and on how such circuitry reacts to manipulations of the sensory environment. Experience-dependent plasticity has now been investigated with techniques endowed with cell resolution during both postnatal development and in adult animals. This review recapitulates the main recent findings in the field using mainly the primary visual cortex as a model system to highlight the more important questions and physiological principles (such as the role of non-competitive mechanisms, the role of inhibition in excitatory cell plasticity, the functional importance of spine and axonal plasticity on a microscale level). I will also discuss on which scientific problems the debate and controversies are more pronounced. New technologies that allow to perturbate cell-type-specific subcircuits will certainly shine new light in the years to come at least on some of the still open questions. (C) 2014 The Author.

AB  - Mechanistic target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates essential processes directed to preserve cellular homeostasis, such as cell growth, proliferation, survival, protein synthesis and autophagy. Importantly, mTOR pathway deregulation has been related to many diseases. Indeed, it has become a hallmark in neurodegenerative disorders, since a fine-tuned regulation of mTOR activities is crucial for neuron function and survival. RTP801/REDD1/Dig2 has become one of the most puzzling regulators of mTOR. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, RTP801 inactivates mTOR and Akt via the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) in many cellular contexts. Intriguingly, RTP801 protects dividing cells from hypoxia or H2O2 induced apoptosis, while it sensitizes differentiated cells to stress. Based on experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), it has been proposed that at early stages of the disease, stress-induced RTP801 upregulation contributes to mTOR repression, in an attempt to maintain cell function and viability. However, if RTP801 elevation is sustained, it leads to neuron cell death by a sequential inhibition of mTOR and Akt. Here, we will review RTP801 deregulation of mTOR in a context of PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Aerobic exercise (AE) enhances neuroplasticity and improves functional outcome in animal models of stroke, however the optimal parameters (days post-stroke, intensity, mode, and duration) to influence brain repair processes are not known. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, the Cochrane Library, and the Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, using predefined criteria, including all years up to July 2013 (English language only). Clinical studies were included if participants had experienced an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. We included animal studies that utilized any method of global or focal ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage. Any intervention utilizing AE-based activity with the intention of improving cardiorespiratory fitness was included. Of the 4250 titles returned, 47 studies (all in animal models) met criteria and measured the effects of exercise on brain repair parameters (lesion volume, oxidative damage, inflammation and cell death, neurogenesis, angiogenesis and markers of stress). Our synthesized findings show that early-initiated (24-48 h post-stroke) moderate forced exercise (10 m/min, 5-7 days per week for about 30 min) reduced lesion volume and protected perilesional tissue against oxidative damage and inflammation at least for the short term (4 weeks). The applicability and translation of experimental exercise paradigms to clinical trials are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent results from laboratory investigations and clinical trials indicate important roles for estrogen receptor (ER) agonists in protecting the central nervous system (CNS) from noxious consequences of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Neurodegenerative processes in several CNS disorders including spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with activation of microglia and astrocytes, which drive the resident neuroinflammatory response. During neurodegenerative processes, activated microglia and astrocytes cause deleterious effects on surrounding neurons. The inhibitory activity of ER agonists on microglia activation might be a beneficial therapeutic option for delaying the onset or progression of neurodegenerative injuries and diseases. Recent studies suggest that ER agonists can provide neuroprotection by modulation of cell survival mechanisms, synaptic reorganization, regenerative responses to axonal injury, and neurogenesis process. The anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions of ER agonists are mediated mainly via two ERs known as ER alpha and ER beta. Although some studies have suggested that ER agonists may be deleterious to some neuronal populations, the potential clinical benefits of ER agonists for augmenting cognitive function may triumph over the associated side effects. Also, understanding the modulatory activities of ER agonists on inflammatory pathways will possibly lead to the development of selective anti-inflammatory molecules with neuroprotective roles in different CNS disorders such as SCI, MS, PD, and AD in humans. Future studies should be concentrated on finding the most plausible molecular pathways for enhancing protective functions of ER agonists in treating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative injuries and diseases in the CNS.

AB  - Lanthanides are a chemically uniform group of metals (La-Lu) that, together with yttrium (Y) and scandium (Sc), form the group of rare earth elements (REEs). Because of their many applications (e.g., agriculture, medicine, motor industry), their global production has increased exponentially in the last decades and their biogeochemical cycles are being disrupted by human uses (e.g., gadolinium anomalies in freshwater and tap water, REEs enrichment of soils as a consequence of agricultural practices). However, ecotoxicological effects and mechanism of action of these elements are still poorly understood. In particular, there is no consensus as to lanthanides showing a coherent and predictable pattern of (eco)toxicity in the same way as their atomic properties. For aquatic organisms, contradictory conclusions on this issue can be found in the bibliography. This review shows that the variable composition of culture media used in ecotoxicology, and the associated differences in lanthanide's speciation, are the most likely cause for such discrepancies. In particular, the formation of insoluble species in some highly complexing media likely leads to changes in the soluble concentration of lanthanide during some tests; with the potential for a generalized underestimation of their toxicity at the present state of knowledge. For terrestrial organisms, suitable studies to establish trends in lanthanides' toxicity are practically nonexistent; with most research focusing on the effects of REE mixtures. Molecular level studies to elucidate the mechanisms of action of lanthanides are essentially limited to La, pointing to the need for further research to identify common mechanisms of action or modes of action across lanthanides. Overall, agreement on the correct procedures to follow to obtain reliable and comparable data for individual lanthanide is the first action to take in order to arrive at a reliable risk assessment for this group of elements in both aquatic and terrestrial systems.

AB  - Long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje neuron synapses has been regarded as a primary cellular mechanism for motor learning. However, this hypothesis has been challenged. Demonstration of normal motor learning under LTD-suppressed conditions suggested that motor learning can occur without LTD. Synaptic plasticity mechanisms other than LTD have been found at various synapses in the cerebellum. Animals may achieve motor learning using several types of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum including LTD.

AB  - Interactive activation and competition models (IAMs) cannot only account for behavioral data from implicit memory tasks, but also for brain data. We start by a discussion of standards for developing and evaluating cognitive models, followed by example demonstrations. In doing so, we relate IAM representations to word length, sequence, frequency, repetition, and orthographic neighborhood effects in behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies along the ventral visual stream. We then examine to what extent lexical competition can account for anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation and the N2/N400 complex. The subsequent section presents the Associative Read-Out Model (AROM), which extends the scope of IAMs by introducing explicit memory and semantic representations. Thereby, it can account for false memories, and familiarity and recollection - explaining why memory signal variances are greater for studied than non-studied items. Since the AROM captures associative spreading across semantic long-term memory, it can also account for different temporal lobe functions, and allows for item-level predictions of the left inferior frontal gyrus' BOLD response. Finally, we use the AROM to examine whether semantic cohesiveness can account for effects previously ascribed to affective word features, i.e. emotional valence, and show that this is the case for positive, but not for negative valence.

AB  - The main objective was to find association between basal cortisol and neighborhood-level stress. Systematic searches, including electronic and hand searches, were conducted. The most recent date of the search was July 26, 2013. Primary observational studies included if they considered stress related outcomes in the neighborhood context. Using the EndNote X7 advanced search option; the authors examined the abstracts and titles of the 18,092 articles to exclude obviously irrelevant studies, gray literature, discussion papers, reviews and, studies with no complete data. Two authors independently extracted data from the original reports into pre-designed data extraction forms based on the Data Extraction Template of the Cochrane Consumer and Communication Review Group (CCCRG). Ten studies with a total of 2,134 participants were synthesized and analyzed. Two studies out of ten received expanded meta-analysis. The overall effect size (95% CI) for cortisol level for residents in neighborhoods with lower stress compared to inhabitants from higher was 0.12 (0.01, 0.23). This review is demonstrating a link between psychosocial or physical stress and cortisol obtained from saliva. However, living in high disorder neighborhoods results in higher level of cortisol. This represents a biological indicator of psychosocial/physical stress exposure (i.e., neighborhood disorder) that reflects variances in stress exposure levels.

AB  - The awareness of the global trends in neuroscience study, especially in the cognitive neuroscience field, should be increased. One notable approach is the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) not only as a research tool but also as a choice for treatment and rehabilitation in neurological disorders, such as post-stroke hemiplegia, visuospatial neglect syndrome, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and psychiatric conditions such as major depression and schizophrenia. All of these occur in significant numbers in highly populated regions. This paper briefly discusses the basic protocols and potential benefits of using TMS with the aim of providing insight that is useful in the design of future public health strategies in highly populated regions with a large neurocognitive burden of disease where this technique is currently underemployed.

AB  - Objective The present study is to provide whether open-label studies (OLS) may properly foresee the efficacy of randomized, placebocontrolled trials (RCTs) using OLSs and RCTs data for aripiprazole in the treatment of MDD, with the use of meta-analysis approach.
   Methods A search of the studies used the key terms "depression and aripiprazole' from the databases of PubMed/PsychInfo from Jan 2005 through July 2013. The data were selected and verified for publication in English-based peer-reviewed journals based on rigorous inclusion criteria. Extracted data were delivered into and run by the Comprehensive Meta Analysis program v2.
   Results The pooled SMDs for the primary efficacy measure was statistically significant, pointing out the significant reduction of depressive symptoms after aripiprazole augmentation (AA) to current antidepressant treatment in OLSs (pooled SMD=-2.114, z=-9.625, p<0.001); similar results were also found in RCTs (pooled SMD=-2.202, z=-6.862, p<0.001). The meta-regression analysis revealed no influence of the study design for treatment outcome.
   Conclusion There was no difference in the treatment effects of aripiprazole as an augmentation therapy in both OLSs and RCTs, indicating that open-label design may be a potentially useful predictor for treatment outcomes of controlled-clinical trials. The proper conduction of OLSs may provide informative, useful and preliminary clinical data and factors to be involved in controlled-clinical trials, by which we may have better understanding on the role of AA (e.g., dosing issues, proper duration of treatment, specific population for AA) implicated in the treatment of MDD in clinical practice.

AB  - Background: It is necessary to identify unidentified or less-concentrated issues in women's health dimension through an extended study. This study is done to identify different dimensions of women's health among qualitative research.
   Method: The present meta-synthesis study is done through a systematic review. The main criteria were to use qualitative studies issued in the same language and researches in which their participants were women. All the published and indexed articles related to women's health in Iran at SID, Magiran and Iranmedex databases from 2001 to 2013 were scrutinized. Search in these databases was done using key words "health" and "women". Finally, 29 qualitative articles were chosen. Data analysis was performed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Generally, concepts extracted from women's health dimension are classified in three main categories including personal, familial and social dimensions. Each category includes some subcategories, too. Personal factors consist of physical, psychological -emotional and spiritual; familial factors consist of fertility, husband's support and women's fundamental roles, and social factors consist of cultural, socioeconomically support, and women's management issues.
   Conclusion: In this meta-synthesis study, there was an effort to present a new interpretation of the previous studies. This study helped attain a more comprehensive and deeper knowledge about women's health concept and reveal its different aspects, which are not assessed in the country.

   Methods: A systematic review of English and non-English articles, from inception to March 2014, was performed using database PubMed, British Nursing Index and Archive, Ovid Medline (R), PsychINFO, Books@Ovid, PsycARTICLES Full Text, EMBASE Classic + Embase, DARE (Database of Abstract of Reviews of Effectiveness) and the Cochrane Library electronic database. Search term included depression, collaborative care, physician family and allied health professional. RCTs comparing collaborative care to usual care for depression in primary care were included. Titles and abstracts were independently examined by two reviewers, who extracted from the included trials information on participants' characteristics, type of intervention, features of collaborative care and type of outcome measure.
   Results: The 17 papers included, regarding 15 RCTs, involved 3240 participants. Primary analyses showed that collaborative care models were associated with greater improvement in depression outcomes in the short term, within 3 months (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI = -0.33; -0.05; p = 0.006), medium term, between 4 and 11 months (SMD -0.24, 95% CI = -0.39; -0.09; p = 0.001) and medium-long term, from 12 months and over (SMD -0.21, 95% CI = -0.37; -0.04; p = 0.01), compared to usual care.
   Conclusions: The present review, specifically focusing on European countries, shows that collaborative care is more effective than treatment as usual in improving depression outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Malondialdehyde (MDA) is widely used as a biomarker for assessing oxidative stress in biomedical fields. Lipid peroxidation is a chain phenomenon resulting in the formation of various active compounds that result in cellular damage. Biomonitoring of MDA has been used in both in-vivo and in-vitro studies as a key biomarker for various disease patterns including hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, heart failure and cancer. Higher levels of MDA are reported in patients of various categories including lung cancer patients, complex regional pain syndrome patients and glaucoma patients. The findings suggest the validity of the MDA assay as a reliable tool in finding out the oxidative stress in different disease pathologies. The present review emphasizes on the reliability and efficacy of MDA estimation in various health disorders.

AB  - The number of genes known to cause human monogenic diseases is increasing rapidly. For the extremely large, genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of intellectual disability (ID) disorders, more than 600 causative genes have been identified to date. However, knowledge about the molecular mechanisms and networks disrupted by these genetic aberrations is lagging behind. The fruit fly Drosophila has emerged as a powerful model organism to close this knowledge gap. This review summarizes recent achievements that have been made in this model and envisions its future contribution to our understanding of ID genetics and neuropathology. The available resources and efficiency of Drosophila place it in a position to tackle the main challenges in the field: mapping functional modules of ID genes to provide conceptually novel insights into the genetic control of cognition, tailored functional studies to improve 'next-generation' diagnostics, and identification of reversible ID phenotypes and medication. Drosophila's behavioral repertoire and powerful genetics also open up perspectives for modeling genetically complex forms of ID and neuropsychiatric disorders, which overlap in their genetic etiologies. In conclusion, Drosophila provides many opportunities to advance future medical genomics of early onset cognitive disorders. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Naturalistic interventions with refugee populations examine outcomes following mental health interventions in existing refugee service organisations. The current review aimed to examine outcomes of naturalistic interventions and quality of the naturalistic intervention literature in refugee populations with the view to highlight the strengths and limitations of naturalistic intervention studies. Database search was conducted using the search terms 'refugee', 'asylum seeker', 'treatment', 'therapy' and 'intervention. No date limitations were applied, but searches were limited to articles written in English. Seven studies were identified that assessed the outcome of naturalistic interventions on adult refugees or asylum seekers in a country of resettlement using quantitative outcome measures. Results showed significant variation in the outcomes of naturalistic intervention studies, with a trend towards showing decreased symptomatology at post-intervention. However, conclusions are limited by methodological problems of the studies reviewed, particularly poor documentation of intervention methods and lack of control in the design of naturalistic intervention studies. Further examination of outcomes following naturalistic interventions is needed with studies which focus on increasing the rigour of the outcome assessment process.

AB  - Objectives: Concerns about fragmented mental health service delivery persist, particularly for people with severe and persistent mental illness. The objective was to review evidence regarding outcomes attributed to system-level intersectoral linkages involving mental health services and non-clinical support services, and to identify barriers and facilitators to the intersectoral linkage process.
   Methods: A systematic, qualitative review of studies describing attempts to coordinate the activities of multiple service agencies at the policy, program or organisational level was conducted. Electronic databases Medline, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched via OVID from inception to July 2012.
   Results: Of 1593 studies identified, 40 were included in the review - 26 in adult and 14 in vulnerable youth populations. Identified mechanisms to promote positive system-level outcomes included: interagency coordinating committees or intersectoral/interface workers engaged in joint service planning; formalised interagency collaborative agreements; a single care plan in which the responsibilities of all agencies are described; cross-training of staff to ensure staff culture, attitudes, knowledge and skills are complementary; service co-location; and blended funding initiatives to ensure funding aligns with program integration. Identified barriers included: adequacy of funding and technology; ensuring realistic workloads; overcoming turf issues' between service providers and disagreements regarding areas of responsibility; ensuring integration strategies are implemented as planned; and maintaining stakeholder enthusiasm.
   Conclusions: System-level intersectoral linkages can be achieved in various ways and are associated with positive clinical and non-clinical outcomes for services and clients. Some linkage mechanisms present greater implementation challenges than others (e.g. major technology upgrades or co-location in geographically remote areas). In some instances (e.g. co-location) alternative options may achieve equivalent benefits. Publication bias could not be discounted, and studies using high-quality research designs are scarce. The limited information base applicable to system-level integration argues strongly for the evaluation of the models that evolve in the rollout of the national Partners in Recovery initiative.

AB  - Simultaneously presented signals may be processed in serial or in parallel. One potentially valuable indicator of a system's characteristics may be the appearance of multimodality in the response time (RT) distributions. It is known that standard serial models can predict multimodal RT distributions, but it is unknown whether multimodality is diagnostic of serial systems, or whether alternative architectures, such as parallel ones, can also make such predictions. We demonstrate via simulations that a multimodal RT distribution is not sufficient by itself to rule out parallel self-terminating processing, even with limited trial numbers. These predictions are discussed within the context of recent data indicating the existence of multimodal distributions in visual search.

AB  - The vast majority of mental illnesses can be conceptualized as developmental disorders of neural interactions within the connectome, or developmental miswiring. The recent maturation of pediatric in vivo brain imaging is bringing the identification of clinically meaningful brain-based biomarkers of developmental disorders within reach. Even more auspicious is the ability to study the evolving connectome throughout life, beginning in utero, which promises to move the field from topological phenomenology to etiological nosology. Here, we scope advances in pediatric imaging of the brain connectome as the field faces the challenge of unraveling developmental miswiring. We highlight promises while also providing a pragmatic review of the many obstacles ahead that must be overcome to significantly impact public health.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the cellular compartment where secreted and integral membrane proteins are folded and matured. The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins triggers a stress that is physiologically controlled by an adaptative protective response called Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). UPR is primordial to induce a quality control response and to restore ER homeostasis. When this adaptative response is defective, protein aggregates overwhelm cells and affect, among other mechanisms, synaptic function, signaling transduction and cell survival. Such dysfunction likely contributes to several neurodegenerative diseases that are indeed characterized by exacerbated protein aggregation, protein folding impairment, increased ER stress and UPR activation. This review briefly documents various aspects of the biology of the transcription factor XBP-1 (X-box Binding Protein-1) and summarizes recent findings concerning its putative contribution to the altered UPR response observed in various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.

AB  - Most of the maternal and newborn deaths occur at birth or within 24 hours of birth. Therefore, essential lifesaving interventions need to be delivered at basic or comprehensive emergency obstetric care facilities. Facilities provide complex interventions including advice on referrals, post discharge care, long-term management of chronic conditions along with staff training, managerial and administrative support to other facilities. This paper reviews the effectiveness of facility level inputs for improving maternal and newborn health outcomes. We considered all available systematic reviews published before May 2013 on the pre-defined facility level interventions and included 32 systematic reviews.
   Findings suggest that additional social support during pregnancy and labour significantly decreased the risk of antenatal hospital admission, intrapartum analgesia, dissatisfaction, labour duration, cesarean delivery and instrumental vaginal birth. However, it did not have any impact on pregnancy outcomes. Continued midwifery care from early pregnancy to postpartum period was associated with reduced medical procedures during labour and shorter length of stay. Facility based stress training and management interventions to maintain well performing and motivated workforce, significantly reduced job stress and improved job satisfaction while the interventions tailored to address identified barriers to change improved the desired practice. We found limited and inconclusive evidence for the impacts of physical environment, exit interviews and organizational culture modifications. At the facility level, specialized midwifery teams and social support during pregnancy and labour have demonstrated conclusive benefits in improving maternal newborn health outcomes. However, the generalizability of these findings is limited to high income countries. Future programs in resource limited settings should utilize these findings to implement relevant interventions tailored to their needs.

AB  - Several unresolved issues, paradoxes, and information voids characterize the field of evolution of aging. The recent discovery of aging-like phenomenon in Escherichia coli, marked by asymmetric segregation of damaged components, particularly protein aggregates, has created a number of new possibilities that remain underexplored. Bacterial systems can potentially throw light on issues such as: whether evolution of aging and evolution of death are different phenomena; whether aging is inevitable for life or is an evolved strategy; whether there could be selection for aging or aging is a pleiotropic effect of some other selection; what are the possible mechanisms of antagonistic pleiotropy, if any; and whether there are mechanisms of aging that are conserved throughout the hierarchy of life. Bacterial aging itself is underexplored and least understood as of now, but even scratching the surface appears to reveal things that may compel us to revise some of the classical concepts about evolution of aging. This warrants more focused and innovative inquiry into aging-like processes in bacteria.

AB  - When speaking and reasoning about time, people around the world tend to do so with vocabulary and concepts borrowed from the domain of space. This raises the question of whether the cross-linguistic variability found for spatial representations, and the principles on which these are based, may also carry over to the domain of time. Real progress in addressing this question presupposes a taxonomy for the possible conceptualizations in one domain and its consistent and comprehensive mapping onto the other a challenge that has been taken up only recently and is far from reaching consensus. This article aims at systematizing the theoretical and empirical advances in this field, with a focus on accounts that deal with frames of reference (FoRs). It reviews eight such accounts by identifying their conceptual ingredients and principles for space-time mapping, and it explores the potential for their integration. To evaluate their feasibility, data from some thirty empirical studies, conducted with speakers of sixteen different languages, are then scrutinized. This includes a critical assessment of the methods employed, a summary of the findings for each language group, and a (re-)analysis of the data in view of the theoretical questions. The discussion relates these findings to research on the mental time line, and explores the psychological reality of temporal FoRs, the degree of cross-domain consistency in FoR adoption, the role of deixis, and the sources and extent of space-time mapping more generally.

AB  - Epidemiological data demonstrate that while women report lower rates of drug use than men, the number of current drug users and abusers who are women continues to increase. In addition women progress through the phases of addiction differently than men; women transition from casual drug use to addiction faster, are more reactive to stimuli that trigger relapse, and have higher rates of relapse then men. Sex differences in physiological and psychological responses to drugs of abuse are well documented and it is well established that estrogen effects on dopamine (DA) systems are largely responsible for these sex differences. However, the downstream mechanisms that result from interactions between estrogen and the effects of drugs of abuse on the DA system are just beginning to be explored. Here we review the basic neurocircuity which underlies reward and addiction: highlighting the neuroadaptive changes that occur in the mesolimbic dopamine reward and anti-reward/stress pathways. We propose that sex differences in addiction are due to sex differences in the neural systems which mediate positive and negative reinforcement and that these differences are modulated by ovarian hormones. This forms a neurobehavioral basis for the search for the molecular and cellular underpinnings that uniquely guide motivational behaviors and make women more vulnerable to developing and sustaining addiction than men.

AB  - Despite the accumulating evidence suggesting that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) plays a role in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by social dysfunction, the influence of OT on the nonsocial aspects of learning and memory have been less investigated. To foster research in this area, we review the effects of OT on learning and memory in animal models and humans. In healthy animal models, OT improves memory consolidation and extinction, but only if given at a low dose immediately after the acquisition phase. On the contrary, OT effects in healthy humans have been inconsistent; although, in this case, OT was always given before the acquisition phase and no dose-response curves have ever been drawn up. Interestingly, a specific impairment in the reversal of learning has been found in mice devoid of OT receptors and OT has been demonstrated to enhance fear extinction in rodents. All together, these data suggest that OT plays a role in elementary forms of behavioral flexibility and adaptive responses and support its therapeutic potential in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive inflexibility and/or impairment (autism, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, stroke, posttraumatic stress disorder). Accordingly, OT has been shown to improve cognitive flexibility in OT receptor-deficient mice, and scattered findings indicate that intranasal OT has positive effects on the memory of patients with schizophrenia or posttraumatic stress disorders. Further studies of the therapeutic potential of OT as an enhancer of learning and memory are warranted.

AB  - Although long-term treatment is a core aspect of the management of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD), most clinical recommendations are based on results from short-term studies or adult data. In order to guide clinical practice, we review the efficacy and safety profile of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and other pharmacological strategies for the long-term treatment of BD in pediatric patients. Methods: A MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and PsycInfo search (inception through November 2013) was performed to identify prospective studies longer than 12 weeks assessing the use of pharmacological strategies for the long-term treatment of BD in pediatric patients (0-18 years of age). Results: Four randomized controlled trials (RCT) [three placebo-controlled (assessing aripiprazole (2) and flax oil), and one head-to-head comparison of lithium vs. divalproex], and thirteen noncontrolled studies (six open-label studies assessing lithium or anticonvulsants, five assessing second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and four assessing combination strategies) were included in the review. Aripiprazole has shown efficacy for relapse prevention in children with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) 4-9 years of age in one placebo-controlled RCT. Positive results have been reported in noncontrolled studies with quetiapine and lithium for relapse prevention, as well as with lithium, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and the combination of risperidone and divalproex or lithium for long-term symptom reduction in PBD. The most frequently reported adverse events in children and adolescents treated with lithium and anticonvulsants are gastrointestinal and neurological, whereas use of SGAs is mainly related to weight gain and sedation. Conclusion: According to the limited empirical evidence, aripiprazole can be useful for relapse prevention in children with PBD. Given the lack of consistent efficacy data, clinical decision making should be based on individual clinical aspects and safety concerns.

AB  - Oxidative stress is known to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuronal redox status is maintained by glucose metabolism via the pentose-phosphate pathway and it is known that disruption of glucose metabolism is damaging to neurons. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that glucose metabolism is altered in PD and dysregulation of the pentose-phosphate pathway in this disease has recently been shown. In this review, we present an overview of the literature regarding neuronal glucose metabolism and PD, and discuss the implications of these findings for PD pathogenesis and possible future therapeutic avenues.

AB  - The term Big Data' has spread rapidly in the framework of Data Mining and Business Intelligence. This new scenario can be defined by means of those problems that cannot be effectively or efficiently addressed using the standard computing resources that we currently have. We must emphasize that Big Data does not just imply large volumes of data but also the necessity for scalability, i.e., to ensure a response in an acceptable elapsed time. When the scalability term is considered, usually traditional parallel-type solutions are contemplated, such as the Message Passing Interface or high performance and distributed Database Management Systems. Nowadays there is a new paradigm that has gained popularity over the latter due to the number of benefits it offers. This model is Cloud Computing, and among its main features we has to stress its elasticity in the use of computing resources and space, less management effort, and flexible costs. In this article, we provide an overview on the topic of Big Data, and how the current problem can be addressed from the perspective of Cloud Computing and its programming frameworks. In particular, we focus on those systems for large-scale analytics based on the MapReduce scheme and Hadoop, its open-source implementation. We identify several libraries and software projects that have been developed for aiding practitioners to address this new programming model. We also analyze the advantages and disadvantages of MapReduce, in contrast to the classical solutions in this field. Finally, we present a number of programming frameworks that have been proposed as an alternative to MapReduce, developed under the premise of solving the shortcomings of this model in certain scenarios and platforms.

AB  - In human research, studies of return of fear (ROF) phenomena, and reinstatement in particular, began only a decade ago and recently are more widely used, e. g., as outcome measures for fear/extinction memory manipulations (e. g., reconsolidation). As reinstatement research in humans is still in its infancy, providing an overview of its stability and boundary conditions and summarizing methodological challenges is timely to foster fruitful future research. As a translational endeavor, clarifying the circumstances under which (experimental) reinstatement occurs may offer a first step toward understanding relapse as a clinical phenomenon and pave the way for the development of new pharmacological or behavioral ways to prevent ROF. The current state of research does not yet allow pinpointing these circumstances in detail and we hope this review will aid the research field to advance in this direction. As an introduction, we begin with a synopsis of rodent work on reinstatement and theories that have been proposed to explain the findings. The review however mainly focuses on reinstatement in humans. We first describe details and variations of the experimental setup in reinstatement studies in humans and give a general overview of results. We continue with a compilation of possible experimental boundary conditions and end with the role of individual differences and behavioral and/or pharmacological manipulations. Furthermore, we compile important methodological and design details on the published studies in humans and end with open research questions and some important methodological and design recommendations as a guide for future research.

The extant embodied theories that support either a strong or a moderate embodied view are then presented, as are the perspectives that define how the researchers discuss the role of sensory-motor grounding in language processing. The article concludes by discussing several lines of research that might help distinguish between various theoretical approaches and resolve some of the fundamental issues that fuel much of the debate in the field.

Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to April 2013. 37 randomized controlled trials were included. Quality of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE criteria. Data were extracted on parent, family, and child outcomes. Results Pooled psychological therapies had a positive effect on parent behavior at posttreatment and follow-up; no significant improvement was observed for other outcome domains. Problem-solving therapy (PST) improved parent mental health and parent behavior at posttreatment and follow-up. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate cognitive-behavioral and systems therapies for many outcome domains. Conclusions Parent-and family-based psychological therapies can improve parent outcomes, with PST emerging as particularly promising. Future research should incorporate consensus statements for outcomes assessment, multisite recruitment, and active comparator conditions.

AB  - Nanosized objects are increasingly present in everyday life and in specialized technological applications. In recent years, as a consequence of concern about their potential adverse effects, intense research effort has led to a better understanding of the physicochemical properties that underlie their biocompatibility or potential toxicity, setting the basis for a rational approach to their use in the different fields of application. Among the functional parameters that can be perturbed by interaction between nanoparticles (NPs) and living structures, calcium homeostasis is one of the key players and has been actively investigated. One of the most relevant biological targets is represented by the nervous system (NS), since it has been shown that these objects can access the NS through several pathways; moreover, engineered nanoparticles are increasingly developed to be used for imaging and drug delivery in the NS. In neurons, calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated through a complex set of mechanisms controlling both calcium increases and recovery to the basal levels, and even minor perturbations can have severe consequences on neuronal viability and function, such as excitability and synaptic transmission. In this review, we will focus on the available knowledge about the effects of NPs on the mechanisms controlling calcium signalling and homeostasis in neurons. We have taken into account the data related to environmental NPs, and, in more detail, studies employing engineered NPs, since their more strictly controlled chemical and physical properties allow a better understanding of the relevant parameters that determine the biological responses they elicit. The literature on this specific subject is all quite recent, and we have based the review on the data present in papers dealing strictly with nanoparticles and calcium signals in neuronal cells; while they presently amount to about 20 papers, and no related review is available, the field is rapidly growing and some relevant information is already available. A few general findings can be summarized: most NPs interfere with neuronal calcium homeostasis by interactions at the plasmamembrane, and not following their internalization; influx from the extracellular medium is the main mechanism involved; the effects are dependent in a complex way from concentration, size and surface properties.

Methods A search was conducted to identify studies using psychological interventions for pediatric feeding problems published between 1998 and 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies that examined aggregated outcome data were included. Primary outcomes were child mealtime behavior, nutritional status, and caregiver stress. A risk of bias assessment was conducted and the quality of the evidence rated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Results 13 studies were identified and a narrative synthesis framework was used to report findings. Conclusions The preponderance of evidence suggests positive effects of psychological intervention for the treatment of feeding problems. However, limited data and the paucity of studies using RCT methodologies limit conclusions that can be drawn regarding the efficacy of these interventions. Future studies using more rigorous research methods are needed to enhance understanding of these interventions.

AB  - Depression and Alzheimer's disease are two common and closely intertwined diseases in the elderly. Bio-markers for their early diagnosis would be helpful for clinicians. The brain areas involved in depression, Alzheimer's disease and in olfactory processing overlap, leading to suggestions that olfaction could constitute a potential marker of these diseases. Here, we review the literature in the relevant clinical and olfactory fields, and consider which olfactory measures and factors could serve as markers of these diseases. It has been reported repeatedly that there is an alteration of odor identification in Alzheimer's disease but not in depression. These observations provide strong arguments that this olfactory marker may serve as a complementary tool for the early screening of patients. Odor threshold detection and odor hedonic aspect may constitute complementary markers of the efficacy of depression therapy. However, there are numerous contradictory data and innovative methods are required to investigate whether investigations of olfaction can usefully contribute to routine clinical practice.

AB  - The medical, research and general community is unable to effect significantly decreased rates of central obesity and related type II diabetes mellitus (TIIDM), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. All conditions seem to be linked by the concept of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), but the underlying causes are not known. MetS markers may have been mistaken for causes, thus many treatments are destined to be suboptimal.
   The current paper aims to critique current paradigms, give explanations for their persistence, and to return to first principles in an attempt to determine and clarify likely causes of MetS and obesity related comorbidities. A wide literature has been mined, study concepts analysed and the basics of human evolution and new biochemistry reviewed. A plausible, multifaceted composite unifying theory is formulated.
   The basis of the theory is that the proportionately large, energy-demanding human brain may have driven co-adaptive mechanisms to provide, or conserve, energy for the brain. A 'dual system' is proposed. 1) The enlarged, complex cortico-limbic-striatal system increases dietary energy by developing strong neural self-reward/motivation pathways for the acquisition of energy dense food, and (2) the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) cellular protection system amplifies antioxidant, antitoxicant and repair activity by employing plant chemicals, becoming highly energy efficient in humans.
   The still-evolving, complex human cortico-limbic-striatal system generates strong behavioural drives for energy dense food procurement, including motivating agricultural technologies and social system development. Addiction to such foods, leading to neglect of nutritious but less appetizing 'common or garden' food, appears to have occurred. Insufficient consumption of food micronutrients prevents optimal human NRF2 function. Inefficient oxidation of excess energy forces central and non-adipose cells to store excess toxic lipid. Oxidative stress and metabolic inflammation, or metaflammation, allow susceptibility to infectious, degenerative atherosclerotic cardiovascular, autoimmune, neurodegenerative and dysplastic diseases.
   Other relevant human-specific co-adaptations are examined, and encompass the unusual ability to store fat, certain vitamin pathways, the generalised but flexible intestine and microbiota, and slow development and longevity. This theory has significant past and future corollaries, which are explored in a separate article by McGill, A-T, in Archives of Public Health, 72: 31.
   One line summary: Metabolic syndrome and obesity-related co-morbidities are largely explained by co-adaptations to the energy use of the large human brain in the cortico-limbic-striatal and NRF2 systems.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Sexual medicine is a branch often neglected by professionals from different specialties associated with it. However, research in this field has picked up in recent years, owing to recently renewed interest in upholding the sexual rights of the population in general and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups in particular. The recently released Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition, by the American Psychiatric Association in May 2013 has stirred up the supporters and critics (of Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition) alike.
   Recent findings
   Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition, has updated diagnostic criteria for some of the sexual disorders to improve understanding and diagnostic validity. Certain sexual dysfunctions have been regrouped and sexual response cycle-based classification has been partially withdrawn. Research in the area of behavioral management of sexual dysfunctions has given some novel concepts, particularly for women.
   Summary
   Although improvements in behavioral management (of sexual dysfunctions) and classification/diagnostic criteria in Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition, is a step forward in the field of sexual medicine, we need to further improve our understanding in many of the lacunae, still bearing on the field of sexual medicine, lest we may fall at the first hurdle.

AB  - We sought to determine if an association exists between overall, deep, and periventricular white matter hyperintensities and depression. We searched PubMed (Medline) and Scopus (Embase) from April October 2012 using the MeSH terms: "White matter lesions" OR "white matter disease" OR "Cerebrovascular Disease" OR "Leukoencephalopathies" AND "Depressive Disorder" AND "magnetic resonance imaging," and "Depression" AND "leukoaraiosis." No language limits were implemented. Hand searching was performed of all included studies and relevant review articles. 913 PubMed and 188 Scopus citations were identified. Relevant, human, non-overlapping magnetic resonance imaging studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported generic data. We extracted the most adjusted odds ratios reported generated from comparing depression across severe (determined either volumetrically or visually) and mild/no white matter lesion groups. 19 reports were included. Cross-sectional subgroup analyses showed that deep white matter hyperintensities significantly associated with depression (N = 2261, odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.04, p = 0.02), whereas periventricular (N = 3813, odds ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.99-1.17, p = 0.07) and overall did not (N = 5876, odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.96-130, p = 0.14). Overall longitudinal analysis revealed a pooled odds ratio of 1.12 (N = 2015; 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.29; p = 0.13; Q = 7.19, p = 0.07; 12 = 58.3%). Longitudinal subgroup analyses revealed that overall white matter hyperintensities (N = 1882, odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.4, p < 0.01) significantly associated with depression but deep did not (N = 660, odds ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval, 0.56-7.22, p = 0.281). No significant heterogeneity was present in subgroup analyses. In conclusion, we found a significant, but weak association between white matter hyperintensities and depression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While neuropsychological dysfunction is a contributor to major depressive disorder (MDD) in adult MDD, little is known about neuropsychological function in MDD during adolescence and early adulthood. The aim of this review is to evaluate literature on neuropsychological function in this young age group. A database search of Medline, the Cochrane database and PsycInfo was conducted. Inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded seven case-control studies on neuropsychological functioning in MDD (12-25 years of age) published since 1995. Effect sizes were calculated. Results show a broader range of statistically significant neuropsychological deficits in MDD compared to controls in the cognitive domains of executive function (EF), working memory (WM), psychomotor and processing speed (PPS), verbal fluency (VF) and visual (-spatial) memory (VM). Most convincingly, three out of four studies investigating WM and three out of four studies investigating PPS found statistically significant impairments in MDD with varying effect sizes. EF deficits were reported only in three out of seven studies with small, medium and large effect sizes. While some evidence was found for impaired VM and VF, no evidence was observed for attention and verbal learning and memory; however, these domains have been less extensively studied. Further research is required to broaden the study base. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neuroimaging (NI) technologies are having increasing impact in the study of complex cognitive and social processes. In this emerging field of social cognitive neuroscience, a central goal should be to increase the understanding of the interaction between the neurobiology of the individual and the environment in which humans develop and function. The study of sex/gender is often a focus for NI research, and may be motivated by a desire to better understand general developmental principles, mental health problems that show female male disparities, and gendered differences in society. In order to ensure the maximum possible contribution of NI research to these goals, we draw attention to four key principles overlap, mosaicism, contingency and entanglement that have emerged from sex/gender research and that should inform NI research design, analysis and interpretation. We discuss the implications of these principles in the form of constructive guidelines and suggestions for researchers, editors, reviewers and science communicators.

AB  - Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become the most frequently used antidepressants in China in recent decades. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs in Chinese studies and the quality of Chinese randomized controlled trials.
   Methods: Major Western and Chinese electronic databases were searched for double-blind, parallel group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SSRIs (fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, or sertraline) with other antidepressants such as SSRI, Selective Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and/or placebo. Response, remission, and dropout rates due to side effects were defined as primary outcomes. Mean total Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HAMD) scores at endpoint, overall dropout rates and total Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) scores were defined as secondary outcomes. Data were combined with random effects models. Risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane evaluation tool. Quality of reports was assessed by the fulfilment of Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trial (CONSORT) items.
   Results: A total of 71 studies were included. Only one study was listed in both Chinese and Western databases. SSRIs were found to be more effective than TCAs. No significant differences were observed regarding dropout rates due to side effects. Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, adequate methods of sequence generation were described in 16 (23%) studies. All authors failed to report trial registration. Informed consent, sources of funding, email address, protocol, and limitations were also not mentioned in most studies. However, reporting quality improved steadily between 1996 and 2013.
   Conclusions: In light of the low trial quality, the findings of a significant advantage of SSRI over TCA in terms of response rate and remission rate should be replicated by large high-quality Chinese studies.

AB  - We begin by placing our discussion in the context of the chronic crisis in medical care, noting key features, including economic, safety and conceptual challenges. Then we review the most promising elements of a broadened conceptual approach to health and wellbeing, which include an expanded role for psychological, social, cultural, spiritual and environmental variables. The contributions of positive and evolutionary psychology, complex adaptive systems theory, genomics and neuroscience are described and the rapidly developing synthetic field of resilience as a catalytic unifying development is traced in some detail, including analysis of the rapidly growing empirical literature on resilience and its constituents, particularly heart rate variability. Finally, a review of the use of miniaturized ambulatory data collection, analysis and self-management and health management systems points out an exemplar, the Extensive Care System (ECS), which takes advantage of the continuing advances in biosensor technology, computing power, networking dynamics and social media to facilitate not only personalized health and wellbeing, but higher quality evidence-based preventive, treatment and epidemiological outcomes. This development will challenge the acute care episode model typified by the ER or ICU stay and replace it with an ECS capable of facilitating not only healthy autonomic functioning, but both ipsative/individual and normative/population health.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a tightly regulated interface in the Central Nervous System (CNS) that regulates the exchange of molecules in and out from the brain thus maintaining the CNS homeostasis. It is mainly composed of endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes and astrocytes that create a neurovascular unit (NVU) with the adjacent neurons. Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of the BBB by providing secreted factors that lead to the adequate association between the cells of the BBB and the formation of strong tight junctions. Under neurological disorders, such as chronic cerebral ischemia, brain trauma, Epilepsy, Alzheimer and Parkinson's Diseases, a disruption of the BBB takes place, involving a lost in the permeability of the barrier and phenotypical changes in both the ECs and astrocytes. In this aspect, it has been established that the process of reactive gliosis is a common feature of astrocytes during BBB disruption, which has a detrimental effect on the barrier function and a subsequent damage in neuronal survival. In this review we discuss the implications of astrocyte functions in the protection of the BBB, and in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. Additionally, we highlight the current and future strategies in astrocyte protection aimed at the development of the current and future stategies in astrocyte protection aimed at the development of restorative therapies for the BBB in pathological conditions.

AB  - The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei controlling voluntary actions and have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). The prevailing model of basal ganglia function states that two circuits, the direct and indirect pathways, originate from distinct populations of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and project to different output structures. These circuits are believed to have opposite effects on movement. Specifically, the activity of direct pathway MSNs is postulated to promote movement, whereas the activation of indirect pathway MSNs is hypothesized to inhibit it. Recent findings have revealed that this model might not fully account for the concurrent activation of both pathways during movement. Accordingly, we propose a model in which intrastriatal connections are critical and the two pathways are structurally and functionally intertwined. Thus, all MSNs might either facilitate or inhibit movement depending on the form of synaptic plasticity expressed at a certain moment. In PD, alterations of dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity could alter this coordinated activity.

AB  - Objectives. Anxiety disorders are among the most frequently encountered psychiatric disorders. Recommended treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and/or medication. In recent years, beneficial effects of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy have been shown, making this technique a promising addition to CBT. However, the ability of VR to mimic threatening stimuli in a way comparable to in vivo cues has been discussed. In particular, it has been questioned whether VR is capable of provoking psychophysiological symptoms of anxiety. Since psychophysiological arousal is considered a prerequisite for effective exposure treatment, this systematic review aims to evaluate the evidence for the potential of VR exposure to evoke and modulate psychophysiological fear reactions. Methods. PubMed and PsycINFO/Academic Search Premier databases were searched. Thirty-eight studies investigating challenge or habituation effects were included. Results. VR exposure does provoke psychophysiological arousal, especially in terms of electrodermal activity. Results on psychophysiological habituation in VR are inconclusive. Study design and methodological rigour vary widely. Conclusions. Despite several limitations, this review provides evidence that VR exposure elicits psychophysiological fear reactions in patients and healthy subjects, rendering VR a promising treatment for anxiety disorders, and a potent research tool for future investigations of psychophysiological processes and their significance during exposure treatment.

AB  - This paper critically reviews the published evidence pertaining to Project Towards No Drug Abuse (Project TND). Publications from seven evaluation studies of Project TND are reviewed, and the results from these are discussed as related to the following outcomes: main effects on the use of cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana; main effects on the use of "hard drugs," defined in the evaluations as cocaine, hallucinogens, stimulants, inhalants, ecstasy and other drugs (e.g., depressants, PCP, steroids and heroin); subgroup and interaction analyses of drug use; and violence-related behaviors. Very few main effects have been found for cigarette, alcohol and marijuana use in the Project TND evaluations. While studies do report main effects for hard drug use, these findings are subject to numerous threats to validity and may be attributable to the data analyses employed. Similarly, while isolated subgroup and interaction effects were found for alcohol use among baseline nonusers and some violence-related behaviors in the early Project TND evaluations, these findings have not been replicated in more recent studies and may result from multiple comparisons between study conditions. In conclusion, there is little evidence to support the assertion that Project TND is an effective drug or violence prevention program. The broader implications of these findings for prevention science are discussed and suggestions are made as to how the quality of research in the field might be improved.

AB  - More than 15 million non-nationals are currently living and working in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. The majority are blue-collar or domestic workers coming from the Indian Subcontinent or South East Asia. They often work under very harsh conditions. There are reports of a high rate of psychosis and suicide among these people but no reliable data are available. To address this issue we conducted a literature search both in English and in Arabic to review the available articles on the psychological wellbeing of this population. Very few articles were found. We hereby review the available literature and contribute by presenting several brief vignettes to illustrate the various clinical aspects of this at risk population. We also discuss possible reasons for underreporting and underscore the need for more research in this area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Motion sickness is a complex syndrome that includes many features besides nausea and vomiting. This review describes some of these factors and points out that under normal circumstances, many cases of motion sickness go unrecognized. Motion sickness can occur during exposure to physical motion, visual motion, and virtual motion, and only those without a functioning vestibular system are fully immune. The range of vulnerability in the normal population varies about 10,000 to 1. Sleep deprivation can also enhance susceptibility. Systematic studies conducted in parabolic flight have identified velocity storage of semicircular canal signals-velocity integration-as being a key factor in both space motion sickness and terrestrial motion sickness. Adaptation procedures that have been developed to increase resistance to motion sickness reduce this time constant. A fully adequate theory of motion sickness is not presently available. Limitations of two popular theories, the evolutionary and the ecological, are described. A sensory conflict theory can explain many but not all aspects of motion sickness elicitation. However, extending the theory to include conflicts related to visceral afferent feedback elicited by voluntary and passive body motion greatly expands its explanatory range. Future goals should include determining why some conflicts are provocative and others are not but instead lead to perceptual reinterpretations of ongoing body motion. The contribution of visceral afferents in relation to vestibular and cerebellar signals in evoking sickness also deserves further exploration. Substantial progress is being made in identifying the physiological mechanisms underlying the evocation of nausea, vomiting, and anxiety, and a comprehensive understanding of motion sickness may soon be attainable. Adequate anti-motion sickness drugs without adverse side effects are not yet available.

AB  - Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a dynamically informed and present-focused psychotherapy originally conceived for patients with unipolar depression and subsequently modified for other disorders, including postpartum depression (PPD). The aim of this paper is to review the evidence on the efficacy of IPT for PPD. We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 1995 and April 2013 assessing the efficacy of IPT for PPD using PubMed and PsycINFO. We included the following: (i) articles that presented a combination of at least two of the established terms in the abstract, namely, interpersonal [all fields] and ("psychotherapy" [MeSH terms] or psychotherapy [all fields]) and (perinatal [all fields] or postpartum [all fields]) and ("depressive disorder" [MeSH terms] or ("depressive" [all fields] and "disorder" [all fields]) or depressive disorder [all fields] or "depression" [all fields] or depression [MeSH terms]); (ii) manuscripts in English; (iii) original articles; and (iv) prospective or retrospective observational studies (analytical or descriptive), experimental, or quasi-experimental. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) other study designs, such as case reports, case series, and reviews; (ii) non-original studies including editorials, book reviews, and letters to the editor; and (iii) studies not specifically designed and focused on IPT. We identified 11 clinical primary trials assessing the efficacy of IPT for PPD, including 3 trials with group interventions (G-IPT) and one that required the presence of the partner (PA-IPT). We also identified six studies interpersonal-psychotherapy-oriented preventive interventions for use in pregnancy. IPT studies showed overall clinical improvement in the most commonly used depression measures in postpartum depressed women (EPDS, HDRS, BDI) and often-full recovery in several cases of treated patients. Evidence from clinical trials indicates that, when administered in monotherapy (or in combination with antidepressants), IPT may shorten the time to recovery from PPD and prolong the time spent in clinical remission.

AB  - Background: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies have been documented in the serum of individuals with primary psychiatric disorders from several independent cohorts, but these findings have not been systematically assessed in aggregate or in relation to methodological covariates.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for studies in any language that provided data on NMDAR antibody seropositivity or absolute serum titers in schizophrenia or schizoaffective, bipolar, or major depressive disorders. We used a random effects model to pool estimates across studies.
   Results: Nine studies met the eligibility criteria. Five studies (3387 participants) provided data on NMDAR antibody seropositivity in psychiatric versus control groups based on high-specificity seropositivity thresholds (cell-based assays [CBAs]: 1: 320 dilution, 1: 200 dilution, visual score > 1; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]: 90th percentile of control titers). Meta-analysis showed significantly higher odds of NMDAR antibody seropositivity among those with schizophrenia or schizoaffective, bipolar, or major depressive disorders compared with healthy controls (odds ratio [OR], 3.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-9.27; P = .043; I-2 = 68%). Four studies (3194 participants) provided outcome data for these groups based on low-specificity seropositivity thresholds (CBAs 1: 10 dilution; ELISA: 75th percentile of control titers). Meta-analysis showed greater heterogeneity and no significant between-group difference (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 0.55-9.73; P = .25; I-2 = 90%). Seropositive participants in psychiatric groups had various combinations of IgG, IgM, and IgA class antibodies against NR1, NR1/NR2B, and NR2A/NR2B subunits. Subgroup analysis revealed significantly higher odds of seropositivity among all participants based on 1: 10 versus 1: 320 dilution seropositivity thresholds (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 2.41-8.62; P < .001; I-2 = 0%; studies = 2, n = 2920), but no apparent difference between first-episode and chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.19-7.24; P = .88, I-2 = 43%, studies = 2, n = 1108). Average NR2A/NR2B antibody titers determined by ELISA were significantly higher among participants with first-episode schizophrenia (P < .0001) and acute mania (P < .01) compared with healthy controls. Levels decreased by 58% at 8 weeks in first-episode schizophrenia, and by about 13% at 4 days in acute mania.
   Conclusions: Individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective, bipolar, or major depressive disorders are collectively about three times more likely to have elevated NMDAR antibody titers compared with healthy controls based on high-specificity, but not low-specificity, seropositivity thresholds, though considerable methodological and statistical heterogeneity exists. Evidence concerning the effect of disease state and time of serum acquisition is varied and consistent, respectively. Adequately powered longitudinal studies employing standardized assay methods and seropositivity threshold definitions, and quantifying NMDAR antibodies in both sera and cerebrospinal fluid are needed to further elucidate the clinical and pathophysiological implications of this association.

AB  - Introduction: High noise exposure during critical periods in gestation is a potential stressor that may result in increased risk of implantation failure, dysregulation of placentation or decrease of uterine blood flow. This paper systematically reviews published evidence on associations between reproductive outcomes and occupational and environmental noise exposure. Methods: The Web of Science, PubMed and Embase electronic databases were searched for papers published between 1970 to June 2014 and via colleagues. We included 14 epidemiological studies related to occupational noise exposure and nine epidemiological studies related to environmental noise exposure. There was some evidence for associations between occupational noise exposure and low birthweight, preterm birth and small for gestational age, either independently or together with other occupational risk factors. Five of six epidemiologic studies, including the two largest studies, found significant associations between lower birthweight and higher noise exposure. There were few studies on other outcomes and study design issues may have led to bias in assessments in some studies. Conclusions: There is evidence for associations between noise exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes from animal studies. Few studies in have been conducted in humans but there is some suggestive evidence of adverse associations with environmental noise from both occupational and epidemiological studies, especially for low birthweight.

AB  - Arsenic (As) is a metalloid that may represent a serious environmental threat, due to its wide abundance and the high toxicity particularly of its inorganic forms. The use of arsenic-contaminated groundwater for irrigation purposes in crop fields elevates the arsenic concentration in topsoil and its phytoavailability for crops. The transfer of arsenic through the crops-soil-water system is one of the more important pathways of human exposure. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, maize (Zea mays L) is the most cultivated cereal in the world. This cereal constitutes a staple food for humans in the most of the developing countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Thus, this review summarizes the existing literature concerning the conditions involved in agricultural soil that leads to As influx into maize crops and the uptake mechanisms, metabolism and phytotoxicity of As in corn plants. Additionally, the studies of the As accumulation in raw corn grain and corn food are summarized, and the As biotransfer into the human diet is highlighted. Due to high As levels found in editable plant part for livestock and humans, the As uptake by corn crop through water-soil-maize system may represent an important pathway of As exposure in countries with high maize consumption.

AB  - Various types of lipids and their metabolic products associated with the biological membrane play a crucial role in signal transduction, modulation, and activation of receptors and as precursors of bioactive lipid mediators. Dysfunction in the lipid homeostasis in the brain could be a risk factor for the many types of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurodegenerative disorders are marked by extensive neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and alteration in the differentiation, proliferation, and development of neurons. Sphingomyelin, a constituent of plasma membrane, as well as its primary metabolite ceramide acts as a potential lipid second messenger molecule linked with the modulation of various cellular signaling pathways. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced oxidative stress has been implicated with these molecules and involved in the regulation of a variety of different neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies have shown that alterations in the levels of plasma lipid/cholesterol concentration may result to neurodegenerative diseases. Alteration in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the brain has also been found to be implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Although several mechanisms involved in neuronal apoptosis have been described, the molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation between lipid metabolism and the neurological deficits are not clearly understood. In the present review, an attempt has been made to provide detailed information about the association of lipids in neurodegeneration especially in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - An extended duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is associated with poor outcome in first-episode psychosis (FEP). Some have suggested that minority ethnic groups have longer treatment delays, and this could lead to worse outcomes. We systematically reviewed the literature on racial and ethnic differences in DUP in patients with FEP.
   We searched electronic databases and conducted forward and backward tracking to identify studies that had compared DUP for people with FEP from different racial or ethnic groups.
   We identified ten papers that reported on the association between race or ethnicity and DUP. Overall, these studies did not find evidence of differences between groups; however, three of ten studies suggested that Black patients generally, and Black-African patients specifically, may have a shorter DUP relative to White patients. There were methodological limitations in most studies with respect to ethnicity classification, sample size, and adjustment for potential confounders.
   Racial and ethnic differences in DUP were rarely found. This could reflect that DUP does not differ between groups, or may reflect the methodological limitations of prior research. Studies that are designed and powered to examine these differences in treatment delay are needed to determine whether there are differences in DUP for minority groups.

AB  - Animal models are widely used to study antidepressant-like effect in rodents. However, it should be mentioned that pharmacological models do not always take into account the complexity of the disease process. In the present paper, we demonstrated that repeated but not acute treatment with a low dose of reserpine (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) led to a pharmacological model of depression which was based on its inhibitory effect on the vesicular monoamine transporter 2, and monoamines depleting action in the brain. In fact, we observed that chronic treatment with a low dose of reserpine induced a distinct depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST), and additionally, it produced a significant decrease in the level of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin in the brain structures. 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) and its close methyl derivative, 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1MeTIQ) are exo/endogenous amines present naturally in the mammalian brain which demonstrated a significant antidepressant-like effect in the FST and the reserpine model of depression in the rat. Both compounds, TIQ and 1MeTIQ, administered chronically in a dose of 25 mg/kg (i.p.) together with reserpine completely antagonized reserpine-produced depression as assessed by the immobility time and swimming time. Biochemical data were in agreement with behavioral experiments and demonstrated that chronic treatment with a low dose of reserpine in contrast to acute administration produced a significant depression of monoamines in the brain structures and impaired their metabolism. These neurochemical effects obtained after repeated reserpine (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) in the brain structures were completely antagonized by joint TIQ or 1MeTIQ (25 mg/kg i.p.) administration with chronic reserpine. A possible molecular mechanism of action of TIQ and 1MeTIQ responsible for their antidepressant action is discussed. On the basis of the presented behavioral and biochemical studies, we suggest that both compounds may be effective for the therapy of depression in clinic as new antidepressants which, when administered peripherally easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and as endogenous compounds may not have adverse side effects.

AB  - The paper aims to discuss social roles performed by the mentally ill as well as the changes that have occurred within this area in the last few decades. Review: We have presented the sources of social scientific interest in the area of health and sickness, along with the basic theoretical assumptions behind various concepts, such as Parson's social roles, Freidson's secondary deviance, and Goffman's stigma theory as well Akers and Krohn's social learning theory. Changes that have taken place in the last few years in the type of social roles that are played by the mentally ill have also been discussed, with an evaluation of the contribution made by community psychiatry. A number of public opinion surveys have been referred to, the recent ones including CBOS 2005, 2007, 2008, 2012 and also the OBOP 1975. Conclusion: Each individual performs many social roles yet people who suffer from mental disorders face serious limitations in this area. A few decades ago, ubiquitously our society hardly allowed any roles to be played by the mentally ill, who were often isolated and excluded from the social sphere. This situation has improved considerably with the arrival of community-based psychiatry and the creation of such facilities as day wards, patient's clubs, training apartments and protected employment. Patients have now more opportunities to play more roles related to their recovery process, social interactions and professional life. However, there is still an urgent need to break through common stereotypes and raise the level of knowledge about mental disorders in Poland. Public opinion polls reveal that there is still much to be done in this field. (C) 2014 Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o. o. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives. We reviewed the treatment of bipolar mixed states using efficacy data of licensed and non-licensed physical or pharmacological treatments. Methods. We conducted a literature search to identify published studies reporting data on mixed states. Grading was done using an in-house level of evidence and we compared the efficacy with treatment recommendations of mixed states in current bipolar disorder guidelines. Results. A total of 133 studies reported data on mixed states, and seven guidelines differentiate the acute treatment of mixed states from pure states. The strongest evidence in treating co-occurring manic and depressive symptoms was for monotherapy with aripiprazole, asenapine, extended release carbamazepine, valproate, olanzapine, and ziprasidone. Aripiprazole was recommended in three guidelines, asenapine in one, and carbamazepine and ziprasidone in two. As adjunctive treatment, the strongest evidence of efficacy was for olanzapine plus lithium or valproate. For maintenance, there is evidence for the efficacy of monotherapy with valproate, olanzapine, and quetiapine. In the six guidelines valproate or olanzapine are first line monotherapy options; one recommends quetiapine. Recommended add-on treatments are lithium or valproate plus quetiapine. Conclusions. There is a lack of studies designed to address the efficacy of medications in mixed affective symptoms. Guidelines do not fully reflect the current evidences.

Controlled studies with healthy and elderly participants, which have increased exponentially, are reviewed including protocols from the clinic: sensory-motor rhythm, betal and alpha/theta ratios, down-training theta maxima, and from neuroscience: upper-alpha, theta, gamma, alpha desynchronisation. Outcome gains include sustained attention, orienting and executive attention, the P300b, memory, spatial rotation, RI, complex psychomotor skills, implicit procedural memory, recognition memory, perceptual binding, intelligence, mood and well-being. Twenty-three of the controlled studies report neurofeedback learning indices along with beneficial outcomes, of which eight report correlations in support of a meditation link, results which will be supplemented by further creativity and the performing arts evidence in Part II. Validity evidence from optimal performance studies represents an advance for the neurofeedback field demonstrating that cross fertilisation between clinical and optimal performance domains will be fruitful.

AB  - Objective: Psychiatric disorders are common among medical inpatient settings and management of psychiatric disorders can be challenging in this setting. Integrated models of care (IMCs) combining psychiatric and medical specialties within a single service may improve psychiatric and medical outcomes, although evidence for IMCs in medical inpatient settings has not been well described Method: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Google scholar for relevant articles. We included all randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies in English that evaluated IMCs for medical inpatients with psychiatric disorders when compared with usual care. We defined IMCs as models of care where psychiatric and medical providers had joint responsibility for all patients within a given service. We extracted information on the characteristics of IMCs and on the effects of IMCs on psychiatric, medical, and health service outcomes. Results: Four studies met the inclusion criteria, thereby including 716 participants overall. All studies differed in the study design, models of IMCs, and outcomes reported. In 2 studies, IMCs improved psychiatric symptoms compared with those admitted to a general medical service. Two studies demonstrated reductions in length of stay with IMCs compared with usual care. One study reported an improvement in functional outcomes and a decreased likelihood of long-term care admission associated with IMCs when compared with usual care. Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence that IMCs may improve a number of outcomes for medical inpatients with psychiatric disorders. Additional well-designed studies of IMCs are required to further evaluate the effect of IMCs on patient outcomes and costs of care.

AB  - The current meta-analytic review examined the effectiveness of job search interventions in facilitating job search success (i.e., obtaining employment). Major theoretical perspectives on job search interventions, including behavioral learning theory, theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, and coping theory, were reviewed and integrated to derive a taxonomy of critical job search intervention components. Summarizing the data from 47 experimentally or quasi-experimentally evaluated job search interventions, we found that the odds of obtaining employment were 2.67 times higher for job seekers participating in job search interventions compared to job seekers in the control group, who did not participate in such intervention programs. Our moderator analysis also suggested that job search interventions that contained certain components, including teaching job search skills, improving self-presentation, boosting self-efficacy, encouraging proactivity, promoting goal setting, and enlisting social support, were more effective than interventions that did not include such components. More important, job search interventions effectively promoted employment only when both skill development and motivation enhancement were included. In addition, we found that job search interventions were more effective in helping younger and older (vs. middle-aged) job seekers, short-term (vs. long-term) unemployed job seekers, and job seekers with special needs and conditions (vs. job seekers in general) to find employment. Furthermore, meta-analytic path analysis revealed that increased job search skills, job search self-efficacy, and job search behaviors partially mediated the positive effect of job search interventions on obtaining employment. Theoretical and practical implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Purpose of review
   There are complexities in communicating diagnostic information relating to schizophrenia spectrum disorders. There is a current dearth of research in understanding how clinicians effectively communicate with service users about such diagnostic news. In this review, we aim to synthesize the latest research throughout 2012 and 2013 that presented data relating to the communication of a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including individuals who had experienced first-episode psychosis or were in at-risk mental states. Comprehensive database and manual searches were conducted which obtained data from both service users and health professional groups.
   Recent findings
   Fourteen quantitative and qualitative studies were found. The majority of studies were descriptive and heterogeneous in content. Key themes included service user preferences towards disclosure and diagnostic terminology, health professional training, stigma-related issues and the use of diagnostic communication models.
   Summary
   Overall, communication models that foster therapeutic relationships and actively encourage the health professional to reduce stigma may be a key to initial diagnostic discussions in clinical practice. Such communication models and intervention require further more rigorous evaluation, as none have been tested through randomized controlled protocols in clinical settings.

AB  - In the last two decades, there has been widespread acknowledgment of the pivotal role played by astrocytes in diverse aspects of central nervous system functioning. Astrocytes are crucial for the homeostasis of the copper in the central nervous system as evident by its proficiency in acquisition, trafficking, and export of copper. Moreover, the imbalance in copper homeostasis and impairment in astrocyte functioning are increasingly being recognized as an important contributing factor in the development of neurodegeneration and cognitive waning. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in the field of copper homeostasis in astrocytes along with briefly outlining the copper dyshomeostasis associated hepatocerebral and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The orchestration of gene-expression programs is essential for cellular homeostasis. Epigenetic processes provide to the cell a key mechanism that allows the regulation of gene-expression networks in response to environmental stimuli. Recently epigenetic mechanisms such as histone-modifications have been implicated with cognitive function and altered epigenome plasticity has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Thus, key regulators of epigenetic gene-expression have emerged as novel drug targets for brain diseases. Numerous recent review articles discuss in detail the current findings of epigenetic processes in brain diseases. The aim of this article is not to give yet another comprehensive overview of the field but to specifically address the question why the same epigenetic therapies that target histone-acetylation may be suitable to treat seemingly different diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Executive control (EC) generally refers to the regulation of mental activity. It plays a crucial role in complex cognition, and EC skills predict high-level abilities including language processing, memory, and problem solving, as well as practically relevant outcomes such as scholastic achievement. EC develops relatively late in ontogeny, and many sub-groups of developmental populations demonstrate an exaggeratedly poor ability to control cognition even alongside the normal protracted growth of EC skills. Given the value of EC to human performance, researchers have sought means to improve it through targeted training; indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that regulatory processes are malleable through experience and practice. Nonetheless, there is a need to understand both whether specific populations might particularly benefit from training, and what cortical mechanisms engage during performance of the tasks used in the training protocols. This contribution has two parts: in Part I, we review EC development and intervention work in select populations. Although promising, the mixed results in this early field make it difficult to draw strong conclusions. To guide future studies, in Part II, we discuss training studies that have included a neuroimaging component a relatively new enterprise that also has not yet yielded a consistent pattern of results post-training, preventing broad conclusions. We therefore suggest that recent developments in neuroimaging (e.g., multivariate and connectivity approaches) may be useful to advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the malleability of EC and brain plasticity. In conjunction with behavioral data, these methods may further inform our understanding of the brain behavior relationship and the extent to which EC is dynamic and malleable, guiding the development of future, targeted interventions to promote executive functioning in both healthy and atypical populations.

AB  - Jean Piaget underestimated the cognitive capabilities of infants, preschoolers, and elementary schoolchildren, and overestimated the capabilities of adolescents and even adults which are often biased by illogical intuitions and overlearned strategies (i.e., "fast thinking" in Daniel Kahneman's words). The crucial question is now to understand why, despite rich precocious knowledge about physical and mathematical principles observed over the last three decades in infants and young children, older children, adolescents and even adults are nevertheless so often bad reasoners. We propose that inhibition of less sophisticated solutions (or heuristics) by the prefrontal cortex is a domain-general executive ability that supports children's conceptual insights associated with more advanced Piagetian stages, such as number-conservation and class inclusion. Moreover, this executive ability remains critical throughout the whole life and even adults may sometimes need "prefrontal pedagogy" in order to learn inhibiting intuitive heuristics (or biases) in deductive reasoning tasks. Here we highlight some of the discoveries from our lab in the field of cognitive development relying on two methodologies used for measuring inhibitory control: brain imaging and mental chronometry (i.e., the negative priming paradigm). We also show that this new approach opens an avenue for re-examining persistent errors in standard classroom-learning tasks.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major health problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that altered Ca2+ homeostasis may underlie disease pathomechanism and be an inherent feature of all vulnerable neurons. The downstream effects of altered Ca2+ handling in the distinct subcellular organelles for proper cellular function are beginning to be elucidated. Here, we summarize the evidence that vulnerable neurons may be exposed to homeostatic Ca2+ stress which may determine their selective vulnerability, and suggest how abnormal Ca2+ handling in the distinct intracellular compartments may compromise neuronal health in the context of aging, environmental, and genetic stress. Gaining a better understanding of the varied effects of Ca2+ dyshomeostasis may allow novel combinatorial therapeutic strategies to slow PD progression.

AB  - Oligodendrocytes (OLGs) are generated late in development and myelination is thus a tardive event in the brain developmental process. It is however maintained whole life long at lower rate, and myelin sheath is crucial for proper signal transmission and neuronal survival. Unfortunately, OLGs present a high susceptibility to oxidative stress, thus demyelination often takes place secondary to diverse brain lesions or pathologies. OLGs can also be the target of immune attacks, leading to primary demyelination lesions. Following oligodendrocytic death, spontaneous remyelination may occur to a certain extent. In this review, we will mainly focus on the adult brain and on the two main sources of progenitor cells that contribute to oligodendrogenesis: parenchymal oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived progenitors. We will shortly come back on the main steps of oligodendrogenesis in the postnatal and adult brain, and summarize the key factors involved in the determination of oligodendrocytic fate. We will then shed light on the main causes of demyelination in the adult brain and present the animal models that have been developed to get insight on the demyelination/remyelination process. Finally, we will synthetize the results of studies searching for factors able to modulate spontaneous myelin repair.

The so-called dual diagnosis phenomenon remains underestimated in Brazil but is the object of research and specific public policy internationally. This phenomenon alerts us to the prevalence of mental health problems in those with intellectual disabilities, limiting their social inclusion. The findings reinforce the importance of this theme and indicate possible diagnostic invisibility of the development of mental illness in those with intellectual disabilities in Brazil, which may contribute to sustaining psychiatric institutionalization of this population.

AB  - Computer-assisted learning is an approach which has been used widely to support people with autism spectrum disorders. Commercial and research-driven technologies continue to be produced at a rapid rate, particularly mobile device applications. However, the field lacks a consistent, evidence-based methodology for design, implementation and evaluation of these technologies. This review collates published evidence for the value of CAL in autism education and therapy, with a specific view to identifying best practice in design, implementation and evaluation. The future of research in CAL for autism is considered including the need for relevant theoretical underpinnings, and appropriate responses from researchers and practitioners to novel technologies.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative movement disorder; however, its etiology remains elusive. Nevertheless, in vivo observations have concluded that oxidative stress is one of the most common causes in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. It is known that mitochondria play a crucial role in reactive oxygen species-mediated pathways, and several gene products that associate with mitochondrial function are the subject of Parkinson's disease research. The PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) protects cells from mitochondrial dysfunction and is linked to the autosomal recessive familial form of the disease. PINK1 is a key player in many signaling pathways engaged in mitophagy, apoptosis, or microglial inflammatory response and is induced by oxidative stress. Several proteins participate in mitochondrial networks, and they are associated with PINK1. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, the protease presenilin-associated rhomboid-like serine protease, the tyrosine kinase c-Abl, the protein kinase MARK2, the protease HtrA2, and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) provide different steps of control in protection against oxidative stress. Furthermore, environmental toxins, such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, have been identified as contributors to parkinsonism by increasing oxidative stress in dopaminergic neurons. The present review discusses the mechanisms and effects of oxidative stress, the emerging concept of the impact of environmental toxins, and a possible neuroprotective role of the antioxidant astaxanthin in various neurodegenerative disorders with particular emphasis in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective and fast-acting treatment option for several psychiatric conditions, including treatment-resistant depression. Although ECT has been in use for 75 years, the mechanism of action is unknown. There is emerging evidence that modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may mediate, in part, the therapeutic action of ECT. A growing body of evidence points to links between disturbances in the immune system and depression. However, the impact of ECT on immune functioning and the possible role of alterations in the immune system as a mechanism of action of ECT remain elusive.
   Objectives: To provide a literature overview on the effects of ECT on the immune system.
   Methods: Relevant articles and abstracts in English were retrieved from PubMed/Medline using search terms related to ECT, inflammation, and immune system. The results of studies examining ECT-induced changes in immune functioning as well as the degree to which these represent possible mechanisms mediating the therapeutic action of ECT were summarized.
   Results: Our search identified only a limited number of studies. The findings suggest that a single session of ECT induces an acute, transient immune activation, whereas repetitive ECT treatment results in long-term down-regulation of immune activation. However, inconsistency in findings and methodological issues, including sample size and lack of consideration of confounding factors affecting cytokine concentrations, precludes definitive conclusion.
   Conclusions: To elucidate the possible role of immunological changes mediating the effect of ECT, more prospective controlled studies with larger sample sizes are required.

AB  - Advances in genome sequencing technologies have begun to revolutionize neurogenetics, allowing the full spectrum of genetic variation to be better understood in relation to disease. Exome sequencing of hundreds to thousands of samples from patients with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, epilepsy and schizophrenia provides strong evidence of the importance of de novo and gene-disruptive events. There are now several hundred new candidate genes and targeted resequencing technologies that allow screening of dozens of genes in tens of thousands of individuals with high specificity and sensitivity. The decision of which genes to pursue depends on many factors, including recurrence, previous evidence of overlap with pathogenic copy number variants, the position of the mutation in the protein, the mutational burden among healthy individuals and membership of the candidate gene in disease-implicated protein networks. We discuss these emerging criteria for gene prioritization and the potential impact on the field of neuroscience.

AB  - This paper aims at presenting programs targeted at the prevention of adolescent depression applied with Spanish-speaking populations that have been developed in Spanish-speaking countries and are mostly published in Spanish. These programs have been developed under different cultural contexts in Spain and Latin-America. The main goal of this paper is to make the studies and movements of the Spanish-speaking literature in this field accessible to the non-Spanish-speaking part of the research community. Therefore, after an introduction referring to possible cultural differences regarding depression in general and epidemiological basics, several programs are introduced. In total 11 programs will be shortly presented and discussed. After revising the programs it can be concluded that in the Spanish-speaking world many programs have been developed and conducted following current state of the art-approaches for adolescent depression prevention. Further research is needed especially targeting possible cultural and contextual aspects of prevention measures and their efficacy and efficiency.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is meanwhile not only recognised as a disorder affecting the extrapyramidal motor system but apparently patients frequently experience non-motor symptoms, such as dementia, depression, sleep disorders, pain, autonomic and sensory dysfunction. New studies suggest that cognitive impairment or dementia would develop in each PD patient if lifetime is long enough. As these symptoms often have a greater impact on patients' quality of life than motor symptoms, worsen the prognosis and increase the personal and socioeconomic burden of PD, a major focus of prevention, recognition and treatment is mandatory and might directly improve patients' health related quality of life. Dementia associated with PD (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are likely to be part of the same disease entity and it has been shown that the cholinergic deficits are even greater than in Alzheimer's disease. Rivastigmine as a cholinesterase inhibitor provided significant benefits on cognition in comparison to placebo without worsening of parkinsonian symptoms in patients suffering from PDD and DLB.

AB  - Background: Compulsive and addictive forms of consumption and buying behaviour have been researched in both business and medical literature. Shopping enabled via the Internet now introduces new features to the shopping experience that translate to positive benefits for the shopper. Evidence now suggests that this new shopping experience may lead to problematic online shopping behaviour. This paper provides a theoretical review of the literature relevant to online shopping addiction (OSA). Based on this selective review, a conceptual model of OSA is presented. Method: The selective review of the literature draws on searches within databases relevant to both clinical and consumer behaviour literature including EBSCO, ABI Pro-Quest, Web of Science - Social Citations Index, Medline, PsycINFO and Pubmed. The article reviews current thinking on problematic, and specifically addictive, behaviour in relation to online shopping. Results: The review of the literature enables the extension of existing knowledge into the Internet-context. A conceptual model of OSA is developed with theoretical support provided for the inclusion of 7 predictor variables: low self-esteem, low self-regulation; negative emotional state; enjoyment; female gender; social anonymity and cognitive overload. The construct of OSA is defined and six component criteria of OSA are proposed based on established technological addiction criteria. Conclusions: Current Internet-based shopping experiences may trigger problematic behaviours which can be classified on a spectrum which at the extreme end incorporates OSA. The development of a conceptual model provides a basis for the future measurement and testing of proposed predictor variables and the outcome variable OSA.

AB  - Objective: Clinical practice guidelines disagree on whether health care professionals should screen women for depression during pregnancy or postpartum. The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether depression screening improves depression outcomes among women during pregnancy or the postpartum period.
   Methods: Searches included the CINAHL, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases through April 1,2013; manual journal searches; reference list reviews; citation tracking of included articles; and trial registry reviews. RCTs in any language that compared depression outcomes between women during pregnancy or postpartum randomized to undergo depression screening versus women not screened were eligible.
   Results: There were 9,242 unique titles/abstracts and 15 full-text articles reviewed. Only 1 RCT of screening postpartum was included, but none during pregnancy. The eligible postpartum study evaluated screening in mothers in Hong Kong with 2-month-old babies (N = 462) and reported a standardized mean difference for symptoms of depression at 6 months postpartum of 0.34 (95% confidence interval = 0.15 to 0.52, P < 0.001). Standardized mean difference per 44 additional women treated in the intervention trial arm compared to the non-screening arm was approximately 1.8. Risk of bias was high, however, because the status of outcome measures was changed post-hoc and because the reported effect size per woman treated was 6-7 times the effect sizes reported in comparable depression care interventions.
   Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from any well-designed and conducted RCT that screening for depression would benefit women in pregnancy or postpartum. Existing guidelines that recommend depression screening during pregnancy or postpartum should be re-considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - ObjectiveTo develop an understanding of the stability of mental health during imprisonment through review of existing research evidence relating physical prison environment to mental state changes in prisoners.
   MethodA systematic literature search was conducted looking at changes in mental state and how this related to various aspects of imprisonment and the prison environment.
   ResultsFifteen longitudinal studies were found, and from these, three broad themes were delineated: being imprisoned and aspects of the prison regime; stage of imprisonment and duration of sentence; and social density. Reception into prison results in higher levels of psychiatric symptoms that seem to improve over time; otherwise, duration of imprisonment appears to have no significant impact on mental health. Regardless of social density, larger prisons are associated with poorer mental state, as are extremes of social density.
   ConclusionThere are large gaps in the literature relating prison environments to changes in mental state; in particular, high-quality longitudinal studies are needed. Existing research suggests that although entry to prison may be associated with deterioration in mental state, it tends to improve with time. Furthermore, overcrowding, ever more likely as prison populations rise, is likely to place a particular burden on mental health services.

AB  - Background: The increasing number of people living with HIV aged 50 years and older has been recognised around the world yet non-pharmacologic HIV behavioural and cognitive interventions specifically targeted to older adults are limited. Evidence is needed to guide the response to this affected group.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the available published literature in MEDLINE, Embase and the Education Resources Information Center. A search strategy was defined with high sensitivity but low specificity to identify behavioural interventions with outcomes in the areas of treatment adherence, HIV testing uptake, increased HIV knowledge and uptake of prevention measures. Data from relevant articles were extracted into excel.
   Results: Twelve articles were identified all of which originated from the Americas. Eight of the interventions were conducted among older adults living with HIV and four for HIV-negative older adults. Five studies included control groups. Of the included studies, four focused on general knowledge of HIV, three emphasised mental health and coping, two focused on reduced sexual risk behaviour, two on physical status and one on referral for care. Only four of the studies were randomised controlled trials and seven - including all of the studies among HIV-negative older adults - did not include controls at all. A few of the studies conducted statistical testing on small samples of 16 or 11 older adults making inference based on the results difficult. The most relevant study demonstrated that using telephone-based interventions can reduce risky sexual behaviour among older adults with control reporting 3.24 times (95% CI 1.79-5.85) as many occasions of unprotected sex at follow-up as participants. Overall however, few of the articles are sufficiently rigorous to suggest broad replication or to be considered representative and applicable in other settings.
   Conclusions: More evidence is needed on what interventions work among older adults to support prevention, adherence and testing. More methodological rigourised needed in the studies targeting older adults. Specifically, including control groups in all studies is needed as well as sufficient sample size to allow for statistical testing. Addition of specific bio-marker or validated behavioural or cognitive outcomes would also strengthen the studies.

AB  - Despite efforts to reduce mortality caused by stroke and perinatal asphyxia, these are still the 2nd largest cause of death worldwide in the age groups they affect. Furthermore, survivors of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia often suffer neurological morbidities. A better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms in focal and global brain ischemia will contribute to the development of tailored therapeutic strategies. Similarly, insight into molecular pathways involved in preconditioning-induced brain protection will provide possibilities for future treatment. Microarray technology is a great tool for investigating large scale gene expression, and has been used in many experimental studies of cerebral ischemia and preconditioning to unravel molecular (patho-) physiology. However, the amount of data across microarray studies can be daunting and hard to interpret which is why we aim to provide a clear overview of available data in experimental rodent models. Findings for both injurious ischemia and preconditioning are reviewed under separate subtopics such as cellular stress, inflammation, cytoskeleton and cell signaling. Finally, we investigated the transcriptome signature of brain protection across preconditioning studies in search of transcripts that were expressed similarly across studies. Strikingly, when comparing genes discovered by single-gene analysis we observed only 15 genes present in two studies or more. We subjected these 15 transcripts to DAVID Annotation Clustering analysis to derive their shared biological meaning. Interestingly, the MAPK signaling pathway and more specifically the ERK1/2 pathway geared toward cell survival/proliferation was significantly enriched. To conclude, we advocate incorporating pathway analysis into all microarray data analysis in order to improve the detection of similarities between independently derived datasets.

AB  - We introduce the field of Hamiltonian medicine, which centres on the roles of genetic relatedness in human health and disease. Hamiltonian medicine represents the application of basic social-evolution theory, for interactions involving kinship, to core issues in medicine such as pathogens, cancer, optimal growth and mental illness. It encompasses three domains, which involve conflict and cooperation between: (i) microbes or cancer cells, within humans, (ii) genes expressed in humans, (iii) human individuals. A set of six core principles, based on these domains and their interfaces, serves to conceptually organize the field, and contextualize illustrative examples. The primary usefulness of Hamiltonian medicine is that, like Darwinian medicine more generally, it provides novel insights into what data will be productive to collect, to address important clinical and public health problems. Our synthesis of this nascent field is intended predominantly for evolutionary and behavioural biologists who aspire to address questions directly relevant to human health and disease.

AB  - Background: Recently Bolivia has implemented a universal health system, but their mental health policy is still emerging.
   Objectives: To investigate the current state of the mental health care system in Bolivia and discuss challenges for structuring a coordinated network of services that can effectively meet the needs of the Bolivian population.
   Methods: This review was conducted by searching for scholarly articles through the databases Lilacs, Medline OPS, HISA and IBECS REPIDISCA via the search portal in the Virtual Health Library - NLM (www.bireme.br).
   Results: Bolivia has a National Mental Health Plan that is intended to guide mental health promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of mental illness, but the resources for this area of health are limited. There are 1.06 psychiatrists and 0.46 psychologists per 100, 000 inhabitants. Information on psychiatric morbidity in Bolivia and the impact of mental disorders on the global burden of disease is scarce. Admission statistics reported by psychiatric hospitals in the country show that the main cause of hospitalization is substance abuse (30%). Alcohol consumption is responsible for 90% of these admissions, in addition to being a major cause of deaths in traffic and one of the main risk factors for domestic violence. Almost one in two women in Bolivia (47%) experienced some form of violence from their partner in the last year. Nineteen percent of women living with a partner reported being physically abused, while 7% were sexually abused by their partners. Isolated studies report that suicide rates are disproportionately high in Bolivia.
   Conclusions: Although there is a shortage of epidemiological data in Bolivia, it is clear the impact of alcohol addiction in psychiatric admissions, domestic violence and traffic accidents. Violence against women and suicides are important issues to be tackled. Among the proposed strategies to afford human resources for mental health in Bolivia, "task shifting", the delegation of tasks to non-specialists should be extensively adopted in the country to improve mental health care.

AB  - Obesity, which has developed into a global epidemic, is a risk factor in most chronic diseases and some forms of malignancy. The discovery of leptin in 1994 has opened a new field in obesity research. Currently, we know that leptin is the primary signal from energy stores and exerts negative feedback effects on energy intake. However, most individuals with diet-induced obesity (DIO) develop leptin resistance, which is characterized by elevated circulating leptin levels and decreased leptin sensitivity. To date, though various mechanisms have been proposed to explain leptin resistance, the exact mechanisms of leptin resistance in obesity are poorly understood. Consequently, it's an important issue worth discussing regarding what the exact interrelations between leptin resistance and obesity are. Here, we review the latest advancements in the molecular mechanisms of leptin resistance and the exact interrelations between leptin resistance, obesity, and obesity-related diseases, in order to supply new ideas for the study of obesity.

AB  - Background: Self-harm is a major public health issue in young people worldwide and there are many challenges to its management and prevention. Numerous studies have indicated that ADHD is associated with completed suicides and other suicidal behaviours (i.e., suicidal attempt and ideation). However, significantly less is known about the association between ADHD and self-harm.
   Method: This is the first review of the association between ADHD and self-harm. A systematic PRISMA review was conducted. Two internet-based bibliographic databases (Medline and CINAHL) were searched to access studies which examined to any degree the association between, specifically, ADHD and self-harm.
   Results: Only 15 studies were identified which investigated the association between ADHD and self-harm and found evidence to support that ADHD is a potential risk factor for self-harm.
   Conclusion: This association raises the need for more awareness of self-harm in individuals with symptoms of ADHD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental disorder that is difficult to treat. Possible targets for pharmacotherapy include affective symptoms, cognitive disturbances, and impulsive, self-injurious behaviors. Although many of the medications tested for treatment of BPD have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear pharmacologic treatment has emerged. Clozapine is one of the medications that has been evaluated for the treatment of severe BPD. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence examining the effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of BPD.
   METHODS: A comprehensive search of the health science databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar was performed for studies describing the use of clozapine in the treatment of BPD.
   RESULTS: After the initial search, no randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of clozapine in BPD were identified. Therefore, case reports and case series were reviewed, with 12 articles selected for final review.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that clozapine may be a beneficial treatment option for BPD especially in controlling symptom severity, psychotic symptoms, impulsivity, self-mutilation, number of days on enhanced observation, use of restraint, and overall functioning.

AB  - Bathymetric biodiversity patterns of marine benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes have been identified in the extant fauna of the deep continental margins. Depth zonation is widespread and evident through a transition between shelf and slope fauna from the shelf break to 1000m, and a transition between slope and abyssal fauna from 2000 to 3000m; these transitions are characterised by high species turnover. A unimodal pattern of diversity with depth peaks between 1000 and 3000m, despite the relatively low area represented by these depths. Zonation is thought to result from the colonisation of the deep sea by shallow-water organisms following multiple mass extinction events throughout the Phanerozoic. The effects of low temperature and high pressure act across hierarchical levels of biological organisation and appear sufficient to limit the distributions of such shallow-water species. Hydrostatic pressures of bathyal depths have consistently been identified experimentally as the maximum tolerated by shallow-water and upper bathyal benthic invertebrates at in situ temperatures, and adaptation appears required for passage to deeper water in both benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes. Together, this suggests that a hyperbaric and thermal physiological bottleneck at bathyal depths contributes to bathymetric zonation. The peak of the unimodal diversity-depth pattern typically occurs at these depths even though the area represented by these depths is relatively low. Although it is recognised that, over long evolutionary time scales, shallow-water diversity patterns are driven by speciation, little consideration has been given to the potential implications for species distribution patterns with depth. Molecular and morphological evidence indicates that cool bathyal waters are the primary site of adaptive radiation in the deep sea, and we hypothesise that bathymetric variation in speciation rates could drive the unimodal diversity-depth pattern over time. Thermal effects on metabolic-rate-dependent mutation and on generation times have been proposed to drive differences in speciation rates, which result in modern latitudinal biodiversity patterns over time. Clearly, this thermal mechanism alone cannot explain bathymetric patterns since temperature generally decreases with depth. We hypothesise that demonstrated physiological effects of high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature at bathyal depths, acting on shallow-water taxa invading the deep sea, may invoke a stress-evolution mechanism by increasing mutagenic activity in germ cells, by inactivating canalisation during embryonic or larval development, by releasing hidden variation or mutagenic activity, or by activating or releasing transposable elements in larvae or adults. In this scenario, increased variation at a physiological bottleneck at bathyal depths results in elevated speciation rate. Adaptation that increases tolerance to high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature allows colonisation of abyssal depths and reduces the stress-evolution response, consequently returning speciation of deeper taxa to the background rate. Over time this mechanism could contribute to the unimodal diversity-depth pattern.

AB  - Objective
   The integration of new treatments into the market and routine clinical practice should be dependent on robustness of evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We assessed study designs of long-term studies for bipolar disorder of all second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the completeness of evidence submitted to the regulatory agency.
   Method
   Systematic review of double-blind RCTs comparing SGAs with placebo or active drugs in adults. FDA website and electronic databases were searched until July 2013.
   Results
   Six placebo-controlled trials comparing aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone were found in the FDA website. Electronic searches found four additional RCTs about aripiprazole, olanzapine or quetiapine. All RCTs (either submitted to FDA or not) selected patients who responded to acute treatment to increase the treatment effect observed in the long-term phase (enrichment design). By contrast, in the prescribing information sheets for all SGAs, the reported indication was 'maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder'.
   Conclusion
   Extrapolation of results from enrichment studies to the more general population of patients should be carried out cautiously because average treatment benefits are likely to be less in unselected patients. Clear guidance for regulatory submission of RCTs is needed.

AB  - Purpose of reviewPeer support and peer-led family psychoeducation represent two distinct and complementary recovery-oriented models to support individuals who live with schizophrenia and their families, respectively. The goals of these models focus on improving knowledge, coping, self-care, social support, and self-management strategies. These models represent important capacity-building strategies for people who live with the illness and the people who love them. This brief article is intended to provide the practicing clinician, person living with schizophrenia, and policy maker with a working knowledge of the current state of the literature in these two related fields. Practitioners should consider these resources and integrate them into their care. A person living with schizophrenia could use this review to advocate for appropriate resources and to identify career opportunities. Policy makers could benefit from an understanding of the literature to mitigate financial and cultural barriers to adopting these practices.Recent findingsThe last 5 years have seen a dramatic expansion of the application of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to give evidence to match the experience of people in these programs. The field has seen Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) named as evidence-based practice by the National Registry of Evidence-Based Practices. A RCT was also conducted for another peer-developed and led program called Building Recovery of Individual Dreams & Goals through Education & Support. Family to Family, the largest peer-led family psychoeducation course, was also found to have significant impact after the study and also 6 months later in RCT. Family to Family has also been named as an evidence-based practice.SummaryThe field of people who are living well with schizophrenia working as resources and supports to others living with the illness is an idea that is growing momentum. This momentum has been matched by the RCT evidence. Peer support as a professional role has an emerging literature that needs to be grown. WRAP and National Alliance on Mental Illness's Family to Family program are evidence-based practices and widely available. Peer support and peer-led family support for persons living with schizophrenia is a nascent field with much potential.

AB  - Purpose of reviewOxidative stress has become an exciting area of schizophrenia research, and provides ample opportunities and hope for a better understanding of its pathophysiology, which may lead to novel treatment strategies. This review describes how recent methodological advances have allowed the study of oxidative stress to tackle fundamental questions and have provided several conceptual breakthroughs to the field.Recent findingsRecent human studies support the notion that intrinsic susceptibility to oxidative stress may underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. More than one animal model that may be relevant to study the biology of schizophrenia also shows sign of oxidative stress in the brain.SummaryThese advances have made this topic of paramount importance to the understanding of schizophrenia and will play a role in advancing the treatment options. This review covers topics from the classic biochemical studies of human biospecimens to the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and novel mouse models, and focuses on highlighting the promising areas of research.

AB  - Wesystematically searched 9 biomedical and social science databases (1980-2012) for primary and secondary interventions that prevented or reduced 2 or more adolescent health risk behaviors (tobacco use, alcohol use, illicit drug use, risky sexual behavior, aggressive acts).
   We identified 44 randomized controlled trials of universal or selective interventions and were effective for multiple health risk behaviors. Most were school based, conducted in the United States, and effective for multiple forms of substance use. Effects were small, in line with findings for other universal prevention programs. In some studies, effects for more than 1 health risk behavior only emerged at long-term follow-up.
   Integrated prevention programs are feasible and effective and may be more efficient than discrete prevention strategies.

AB  - Childhood adversity alters the predisposition to psychiatric disorders later in life. Those with psychiatric conditions and a history of early adversity exhibit a higher incidence of treatment resistance compared with individuals with no such history. Modulation of the influence early stress exerts over neurobiology may help to prevent the development of psychiatric disorders in some cases, while attenuating the extent of treatment resistance in those with established psychiatric disorders. This review aims to critically evaluate the ability of behavioural, environmental and pharmacologic interventions to modulate neurobiological changes induced by early stress in animal models. Databases were systematically searched to locate literature relevant to this review. Early adversity was defined as stress that resulted from manipulation of the mother-infant relationship. Analysis was restricted to animal models to enable characterisation of how a given intervention altered specific neurobiological changes induced by early stress. A wide variety of changes in neurobiology due to early stress are amenable to intervention. Behavioural interventions in childhood, exercise in adolescence and administration of epigenetic-modifying drugs throughout life appear to best modulate cellar and behavioural alterations induced by childhood adversity. Other pharmacotherapies, such as endocannabinoid system modulators, anti-inflammatories and antidepressants can also influence these neurobiological and behavioural changes that result from early stress, although findings are less consistent at present and require further investigation. Further work is required to examine the influence that behavioural interventions, exercise and epigenetic-modifying drugs exert over alterations that occur following childhood stress in human studies, before possible translational into clinical practice is possible.

AB  - This paper is an initial attempt to collate the literature on psychiatric inpatient recovery-based care and, more broadly, to situate the inpatient care sector within a mental health reform dialogue that, to date, has focused almost exclusively on outpatient and community practices. We make the argument that until an evidence base is developed for recovery-oriented practices on hospital wards, the effort to advance recovery-oriented systems will stagnate. Our scoping review was conducted in line with the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (commonly referred to as PRISMA) guidelines. Among the 27 papers selected for review, most were descriptive or uncontrolled outcome studies. Studies addressing strategies for improving care quality provide some modest evidence for reflective dialogue with former inpatient clients, role play and mentorship, and pairing general training in recovery oriented care with training in specific interventions, such as Illness Management and Recovery. Relative to some other fields of medicine, evidence surrounding the question of recovery-oriented care on psychiatric wards and how it may be implemented is underdeveloped. Attention to mental health reform in hospitals is critical to the emergence of recovery-oriented systems of care and the realization of the mandate set forward in the Mental Health Strategy for Canada.

AB  - Background
   Changes in employment conditions in the global economy over the past 30 years have led to increased job insecurity and other work organization hazards. These hazards may play a role in creating and sustaining occupational health disparities by socioeconomic position, gender, race, ethnicity, and immigration status.
   Methods
   A conceptual model was developed to guide the review of 103 relevant articles or chapters on the role of work organization and occupational health disparities identified through a comprehensive search conducted by NIOSH. A second review was conducted of employment and workplace policies and programs designed to reduce the health and safety risks due to job insecurity and other work organization hazards.
   Results
   There is consistent evidence that workers in lower socioeconomic or social class positions are exposed to greater job insecurity and other work organization hazards than workers in higher socioeconomic positions. Likewise, racial and ethnic minorities and immigrants are exposed to greater job insecurity. Limited research examining the effects of interventions targeting work organization hazards on disparities has been conducted; nonetheless, intervention strategies are available and evidence suggests they are effective.
   Conclusions
   Job insecurity and work organization hazards play a role in creating and sustaining occupational health disparities. Employment and workplace policies and programs have the potential to reduce these hazards, and to reduce disparities. Am. J. Ind. Med. 57:495-515, 2014. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To compare the symptoms and social function of patients with psychosis and current substance use to those with psychosis and no history of substance use. Method: The databases EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed publications in English that reported the characteristics of patients with psychotic illness who were current substance users and those who had never used substances. The searches yielded 22 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was used to compare four key outcome variables: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depression and social function - and three secondary outcomes: violence, self-harm and hospital admissions. Results: Current substance-using patients were significantly younger than non-substance-using patients and were more likely to be male, but did not differ in age at onset of psychosis or in their level of education. Current substance users had higher ratings of positive symptoms and were more likely to have a history of violence. Older studies reported a stronger association between current substance use and positive symptoms than more recently published studies. Current substance users did not differ from non-users on measurements of negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, social function, self-harm, or the number of hospital admissions. Conclusion: Current substance users with psychosis may have more severe positive symptoms than patients who have never used substances, but this result should be interpreted with caution because of demographic differences between substance users and non-substance users.

This review will examine and summarize the latest research on IPS.Recent findingsAs the effectiveness of IPS has been well established in the literature, newer research is exploring nonvocational outcomes, such as quality of life and mental health services utilization and expanding the reach of IPS to include different countries and different population groups. There is also a growing literature exploring the cost-effectiveness of IPS compared with traditional vocational services, which has favored IPS. By far, the area of research that has expanded the most is aimed at enhancing IPS outcomes, at both the intervention level and the client level. Researchers are exploring the variance in IPS outcomes as a means of increasing competitive employment rates with IPS.SummaryAlthough the field of research continues to expand, it is clear that many barriers remain to broad implementation of IPS. The solution goes beyond further research and involves policies and practices that support a recovery oriented mental healthcare system.

AB  - Background: Research has shown that suicide risk is often present in patients suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM-1).
   Objectives: The aim of the present paper was to investigate whether there was a relationship between DM-1 and suicidal behavior and to determine whether or not people affected by DM-1 are at an increased risk of completed suicide, attempted suicide, and suicidal ideation.
   Data sources: We performed a careful MedLine, ExcerptaMedica, PsycLit, PsycInfo and Index Medicus search to identify all papers on the topic for the period 1970 to 2013 written in English. The following search terms were used: (suicide OR suicide attempt OR ideation) AND (diabetes mellitus). Where a title or abstract seems to describe a study eligible for inclusion, the full article was examined.
   Eligibility criteria: We included only original articles published in English peer-reviewed journals. We excluded meta-analyses and systematic reviews, studies that were not clear about follow-up times, the method of statistical analysis, diagnostic criteria or the number of patients included, and studies only on patients affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2).
   Results: The research reviewed indicated that patients with DM-1 are at an increased risk for suicide, although no clear consensus exists regarding the level of the increased risk. Limitations: The studies used different measurement techniques and different outcomes, and they assessed patients at different time points.
   Conclusions and implications: Our findings support the recommendation that a suicide risk assessment of patients with DM-1 should be part of the routine clinical assessment. The assessment of patients at risk should consist of the evaluation of current and previous suicidal behaviors (both suicidal ideation and attempted suicide). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the support vector machine (SVM) methodology and its applicability to real-world engineering problems. Specifically, the aim of this study is to review the current state of the SVM technique, and to show some of its latest successful results in real-world problems present in different engineering fields. The paper starts by reviewing the main basic concepts of SVMs and kernel methods. Kernel theory, SVMs, support vector regression (SVR), and SVM in signal processing and hybridization of SVMs with meta-heuristics are fully described in the first part of this paper. The adoption of SVMs in engineering is nowadays a fact. As we illustrate in this paper, SVMs can handle high-dimensional, heterogeneous and scarcely labeled datasets very efficiently, and it can be also successfully tailored to particular applications. The second part of this review is devoted to different case studies in engineering problems, where the application of the SVM methodology has led to excellent results. First, we discuss the application of SVR algorithms in two renewable energy problems: the wind speed prediction from measurements in neighbor stations and the wind speed reconstruction using synoptic-pressure data. The application of SVMs in noninvasive cardiac indices estimation is described next, and results obtained there are presented. The application of SVMs in problems of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data processing is further discussed in the paper: brain decoding and mental disorder characterization. The following application deals with antenna array processing, namely SVMs for spatial nonlinear beamforming, and the SVM application in a problem of arrival angle detection. Finally, the application of SVMs to remote sensing image classification and target detection problems closes this review.

AB  - A key goal in the study of decision making is determining how neural networks involved in perception and motor planning interact to generate a given choice, but this is complicated due to the internal trade-off between speed and accuracy, which confounds their individual contributions. Urgent decisions, however, are special: they may range between random and fully informed, depending on the amount of processing time (or stimulus viewing time) available in each trial, but regardless, movement preparation always starts early on. As a consequence, under time pressure it is possible to produce a psychophysical curve that characterizes perceptual performance independently of reaction time, and this, in turn, makes it possible to pinpoint how perceptual information (which requires sensory input) modulates motor planning (which does not) to guide a choice. Here we review experiments in which, on the basis of this approach, the origin of the speed-accuracy trade-off becomes particularly transparent. Psychophysical, neurophysiological, and modeling results in the "compelled-saccade" task indicate that, during urgent decision making, perceptual information if and whenever it becomes available accelerates or decelerates competing motor plans that are already ongoing. This interaction affects both the reaction time and the probability of success in any given trial. In two experiments with reward asymmetries, we find that speed and accuracy can be traded in different amounts and for different reasons, depending on how the particular task contingencies affect specific neural mechanisms related to perception and motor planning. Therefore, from the vantage point of urgent decisions, the speed-accuracy trade-off is not a unique phenomenon tied to a single underlying mechanism, but rather a typical outcome of many possible combinations of internal adjustments within sensory-motor neural circuits.

AB  - Microwave photons trapped in a superconducting cavity constitute an ideal system to realize some of the thought experiments imagined by the founding fathers of quantum physics. The interaction of these trapped photons with Rydberg atoms crossing the cavity illustrates fundamental aspects of measurement theory. The experiments performed with this "photon box" at the Ecole Normale Suprieure (ENS) belong to the domain of quantum optics called " Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics."We have realized the non-destructive counting of photons, the recording of field quantum jumps, the preparation and reconstruction of "Schrodinger cat" states of radiation and the study of their decoherence, which provides a striking illustration of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. These experiments have also led to the demonstration of basic steps in quantum information processing, including the deterministic entanglement of atoms and the realization of quantum gates using atoms and photons as quantum bits. This lecture starts with an introduction stressing the connection between the ENS photon box and the ion trap experiments of David Wineland, whose accompanying lecture recalls his own contribution to the field of single particle control. I give then a personal account of the early days of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics before describing the main experiments performed at ENS during the last twenty years and concluding with a discussion comparing our work to other research dealing with the control of single quantum particles.

AB  - Kleptoplasty is a remarkable type of photosynthetic association, resulting from the maintenance of functional chloroplasts-the 'kleptoplasts'-in the tissues of a non-photosynthetic host. It represents a biologically unique condition for chloroplast and photosynthesis functioning, occurring in different phylogenetic lineages, namely dinoflagellates, ciliates, foraminiferans and, most interestingly, a single taxon of metazoans, the sacoglossan sea slugs. In the case of sea slugs, chloroplasts from macroalgae are often maintained as intracellular organelles in cells of these marine gastropods, structurally intact and photosynthetically competent for extended periods of time. Kleptoplasty has long attracted interest owing to the longevity of functional kleptoplasts in the absence of the original algal nucleus and the limited number of proteins encoded by the chloroplast genome. This review updates the state-of-the-art on kleptoplast photophysiology, focusing on the comparative analysis of the responses to light of the chloroplasts when in their original, macroalgal cells, and when sequestered in animal cells and functioning as kleptoplasts. It covers fundamental but ecologically relevant aspects of kleptoplast light responses, such as the occurrence of photoacclimation in hospite, operation of photoprotective processes and susceptibility to photoinhibition. Emphasis is given to host-mediated processes unique to kleptoplastic associations, reviewing current hypotheses on behavioural photoprotection and host-mediated enhancement of photosynthetic performance, and identifying current gaps in sacoglossan kleptoplast photophysiology research.

AB  - Neurons in the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are components of an interconnected brainstem, limbic and prefrontal cortex neural network that is engaged during arousal, vigilance, motivated and addictive behaviors, and stress. To better understand the cellular mechanisms underlying these functions, here we review some of the recently characterized electrophysiological and neuropharmacological properties of neurons in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT), derived from whole cell patch clamp recordings in acute rat brain slice preparations. PVT neurons display firing patterns and ionic conductances (I-T and I-H) that exhibit significant diurnal change. Their resting membrane potential (RMP) is maintained by various ionic conductances that include inward rectifier (Kir), hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation (HCN) and TWIK-related acid sensitive (TASK) K+ channels. Firing patterns are regulated by high voltage-activated (HVA) and low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca2+ conductances. Moreover, transient receptor potential (TRP)-like nonselective cation channels together with Ca2+- and Na+-activated K+ conductances (K-Ca; K-Na) contribute to unique slow afterhyperpolarizing potentials (sAHPs) that are generally not detectable in lateral thalamic or reticular thalamic nucleus neurons. The excitability of PVT neurons is also modulated by activation of neurotransmitter receptors associated with afferent pathways to PVT and other thalamic midline nuclei. We report on receptor-mediated actions of GABA, glutamate, monoamines and several neuropeptides: arginine vasopressin, gastrin-releasing peptide, thyrotropin releasing hormone and the orexins (hypocretins). This review represents an initial survey of intrinsic and transmitter-sensitive ionic conductances that are deemed to be unique to this population of midline thalamic neurons, information that is fundamental to an appreciation of the role these thalamic neurons may play in normal central nervous system (CNS) physiology and in CNS disorders that involve the dorsomedial thalamus.

AB  - Cell signaling in response to an array of diverse stress stimuli converges on the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF2 alpha). Evidence is accumulating that persistent eIF2 alpha phosphorylation at Ser51 through prolonged overactivation of regulatory kinases occurs in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to shutdown of general translation and translational activation of a subset of mRNAs. Recent advances in the development of gene-based strategies and bioavailable inhibitors, which specifically target one of the eIF2 alpha kinases, have enabled us to investigate pathogenic roles of dysregulated eIF2 alpha phosphorylation pathways. This review provides an overview of animal model studies in this field, focusing particularly on molecular mechanisms by which the dysregulation of eIF2 alpha kinases may account for synaptic and memory deficits associated with AD. A growing body of evidence suggests that correcting aberrant eIF2 alpha kinase activities may serve as disease-modifying therapeutic interventions to treat AD and related cognitive disorders.

AB  - From the ancient times, there are three basic approaches for the interpretation of the different psychic phenomena: the organic, the psychological, and the sacred approach. The sacred approach forms the primordial foundation for any psychopathological development, innate to the prelogical human mind. Until the second millennium B. C., the Great Mother ruled the Universe and shamans cured the different mental disorders. But, around 1500 B. C., the predominance of the Hellenic civilization over the Pelasgic brought great changes in the theological and psychopathological fields. The Hellenes eliminated the cult of the Great Mother and worshiped Dias, a male deity, the father of gods and humans. With the Father's help and divinatory powers, the warrior-hero made diagnoses and found the right therapies for mental illness; in this way, sacerdotal psychiatry was born.

AB  - Background: In the last decade, sedentary behavior has emerged as a new risk factor for health. The elderly spend most of their awake time in sedentary activities. Despite this high exposure, the impact of this sedentary behavior on the health of this population has not yet been reviewed. We systematically reviewed evidence for associations between sedentary behavior and multiple health outcomes in adults over 60 years of age.
   Methods: We searched the Medline, Embase, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILLACS, and Sedentary Research Database for observational studies published up to May 2013. Additionally, we contacted members of the Sedentary Behaviour Research Network to identify articles that were potentially eligible. After inclusion, the methodological quality of the evidence was assessed in each study.
   Results: We included 24 eligible articles in our systematic review, of which only 2 (8%) provided high-quality evidence. Greater sedentary time was related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality in the older adults. Some studies with a moderate quality of evidence indicated a relationship between sedentary behavior and metabolic syndrome, waist circumference, and overweightness/obesity. The findings for other outcomes such as mental health, renal cancer cells, and falls remain insufficient to draw conclusions.
   Conclusion: This systematic review supports the relationship between sedentary behavior and mortality in older adults. Additional studies with high methodological quality are still needed to develop informed guidelines for addressing sedentary behavior in older adults.

AB  - While much progress has been made in identifying the brain regions and neurochemical systems involved in the cognitive processes disrupted in mental illnesses, to date, the level of detail at which neurobiologists can describe the chain of events giving rise to cognitive functions is very rudimentary. Much of the intense interest in understanding cognitive functions is motivated by the hope that it might be possible to understand these complex functions at the level of neurons and neural circuits. Here, we review the current state of the literature regarding how modulations in catecholamine levels within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) alter the neuronal and behavioral correlates of cognitive functions, particularly attention and working memory.

AB  - This paper reviews the importance of African lakes and their management challenges. African inland lakes contribute significantly to food security, livelihoods and national economies through direct exploitation of fisheries, water resources for irrigation and hydropower generation. Because of these key contributions, the ecosystem services provided are under significant stress mainly owing to high demand by increasing populations, negative anthropogenic impacts on lake catchments and high levels of poverty which result in unsustainable use. Climate variability exacerbates the stress on these ecosystems. Current research findings show that the lakes cannot sustain further development activities on the scale seen over the past few decades. Millions of people are at risk of losing livelihoods through impacts on livestock and wildlife. The review further shows that the problems facing these lakes are beyond the purview of current management practices. A much better understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between different components of the lake socio-ecological systems is needed to address the complex challenges of managing these ecosystem services. This review suggests that the three small wetlands of Chad, Chilwa and Naivasha provide an opportunity for testing novel ideas that integrate sustainability of natural resource management with livelihoods in order to inform policy on how future land use and climatic variability will affect both food security and the ecosystem services associated with it.

AB  - Objective: To conduct the first systematic literature review of clinical trials of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for the treatment of substance abuse disorders and addictive behaviors.
   Methods: A search of the MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO databases was conducted. The inclusion criteria for the review were clinical trials that used NAC in the treatment of a disorder related to substance use and/or addictive behaviors, limited to texts in English, Spanish, or French. The selected studies were evaluated with respect to type of trial, sample size, diagnostic input, intervention, length of follow-up, outcome variables, and results.
   Results: Nine studies analyzing a total of 165 patients met the eligibility criteria and were included in qualitative analysis. These studies evaluated the role of NAC in cocaine dependence (three studies), cannabis dependence (two studies), nicotine dependence (two studies), methamphetamine addiction (one study), and pathological gambling (one study). Five of these trials were double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled.
   Conclusions: The studies analyzed suggest a potential role for NAC in the treatment of addiction, especially of cocaine and cannabis dependence. These results are concordant with the hypothesis of the involvement of glutamatergic pathways in the pathophysiology of addiction.

AB  - Objective: In North America and internationally, efforts have been made to reduce the gaps between knowledge of psychosocial evidence-based practices (EBPs) and the delivery of such services in routine mental health practice. Part 2 of this review identifies key issues for stakeholders to consider when implementing comprehensive psychosocial EBPs for people with severe mental illness (SMI).
   Method: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. Searches were carried out in MEDLINE and PsycINFO for reports published between 1990 and 2012 using key words related to SMI, and psychosocial practices and implementation. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to structure findings according to key domains and constructs known to influence the implementation process.
   Results: The CFIR allowed us to identify 17 issues reflecting more than 30 constructs of the framework that were viewed as influential to the process of implementing evidence-based psychosocial interventions for people with SMI. Issues arising at different levels of influence (intervention, individual, organizational, and system) and at all phases of the implementation process (planning, engagement, execution, and evaluation) were found to play important roles in implementation.
   Conclusion: The issues identified in this review should be taken into consideration by stakeholders when engaging in efforts to promote uptake of new psychosocial EBPs and to widen the range of effective psychosocial services available in routine mental health care.

   This review sought to identify, summarise and critically evaluate studies that investigated attachment amongst individuals with psychosis.
   Method
   The following computerised databases searched were CINAHLDecember 2012; EMBASEDecember 2012; Ovid MEDLINE (R)December 2012; PsychINFODecember 2012; and Google ScholarDecember 2012.
   Results
   We identified 22 papers describing 21 studies comprising 1453 participants, with a mean age of 35.0years (range of 12-71years), of whom 68.4% (n=994) were male. Of our sample, 1112 (76.5%) had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. We found small to moderate associations between greater attachment insecurity (as reflected in anxiety and avoidance) and poorer engagement with services, more interpersonal problems, more avoidant coping strategies, more negative appraisals of parenting experiences and more severe trauma. We also found small to modest associations between attachment insecurity and more positive and negative symptoms and greater affective symptom problems.
   Conclusion
   Attachment theory may be useful as a means of understanding the developmental and interpersonal basis of recovery and adaptation in the context of psychosis. However, further research comprising more representative samples in their first episode and using prospective designs is required.

AB  - The present systematic review and metaanalysis of published observational studies was conducted to assess the health effects of exposure to air pollution on diabetes risk. Online databases were searched through January 2013, and the reference lists of pertinent articles reporting observational studies in humans were examined. Pooled relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated with a random-effects model. Exposure to air pollution was associated with slight increase in risk of diabetes and susceptibility of people with diabetes to air pollution. These results were consistent between time-series, case-crossover and cohort studies and between studies conducted in North America and Europe. The association between exposure to air pollution and diabetes was stronger for gaseous pollutants than for particulate matter. Our metaanalysis suggests that exposure to air pollution may be a risk factor for diabetes and increase susceptibility of people with diabetes to air pollution.

AB  - Aggregation of misfolded protein and resultant intracellular inclusion body formation are common hallmarks of mutant superoxide dismutase (mSOD1)-linked familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) and have been associated with the selective neuronal death. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) represents a family of enzymatic chaperones that can fold nascent and aberrant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Recently, our group found that S-nitrosylated PDI could contribute to protein misfolding and subsequent neuronal cell death. However, the exact role of PDI in the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear. In this study, we propose that PDI attenuates aggregation of mutant/misfolded SOD1 and resultant neurotoxicity associated with ER stress. ER stress resulting in PDI dysfunction therefore provides a mechanistic link between deficits in molecular chaperones, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases. In contrast, S-nitrosylation of PDI inhibits its activity, increases mSOD1 aggregation, and increases neuronal cell death. Specifically, our data show that S-nitrosylation abrogates PDI-mediated attenuation of neuronal cell death triggered by thapsigargin. Biotin switch assays demonstrate S-nitrosylated PDI both in the spinal cords of SOD1 (G93A) mice and human patients with sporadic ALS. Therefore, denitrosylation of PDI may have therapeutic implications. Taken together, our results suggest a novel strategy involving PDI as a therapy to prevent mSOD1 aggregation and neuronal degeneration. Moreover, the data demonstrate that inactivation of PDI by S-nitrosylation occurs in both mSOD1-linked and sporadic forms of ALS in humans as well as mice.

AB  - Living or formerly living organisms are being used to obtain information on the quality of the general health status of our environment by bioindication and biomonitoring methods for many decades. Thus, different roads toward this common scientific goal were developed by a lot of different international research groups. Global cooperation in between various scientific teams throughout the world has produced common ideas, scientific definitions, and highly innovative results of this extremely attractive working field. The transdisciplinary approach of different and multifaceted scientific areas-starting from biology, analytical chemistry, via health physics, up to social and economic issues-have surpassed mental barriers of individual scientists, so that "production" of straightforward common results related to the influence of material and immaterial environmental factors to the well-being of organisms and human life has now reached the forefront of international thinking. For the further sustainable development of our common scientific "hobby" of bioindication and biomonitoring, highest personal energy has to be given by us, being teachers to our students and to convince strategically decision makers as politicians to invest (financially) into the development of education and research of this innovative technique. Young people have to be intensively convinced on the "meaning" of our scientific doing, e.g., by extended forms of education. One example of multilingual education of students on a global scale and perspective is given here, which we started about 3 years ago.

AB  - Objective: Providing comprehensive care to people with severe mental illness (SMI) involves moving beyond pharmacological treatment and ensuring access to a wide range of evidence-based psychosocial services. Numerous initiatives carried out in North America and internationally have promoted the widespread adoption of such services. Objectives of this rapid review were 3-fold: to identify these implementation initiatives, to describe the implementation strategies used to promote the uptake of psychosocial services, and to identify key issues related to the implementation of a broad range of services. Part 1 presents findings for objectives 1 and 2 of the review.
   Method: Searches were carried out in MEDLINE and PsycINFO for reports published between 1990 and 2012 using key words related to SMI, psychosocial practices, and implementation. Contacts with experts and reference list and reverse citation searches were also conducted.
   Results: Fifty-five articles were retained that identified more than a dozen major North American and international implementation initiatives. Initiative leaders employed diverse strategies at the planning, execution, and evaluation stages of the implementation process. Stakeholder meetings, training, ongoing consultation, and quality or fidelity monitoring were strategies consistently adopted across most initiatives, whereas theory-based approaches and organizational- and system-level strategies were less frequently described.
   Conclusion: Insights from the initiatives identified in this review can help guide future efforts to implement a broad range of psychosocial services for people with SMI. However, such efforts will also need to be informed by more rigorous, theory-based studies of implementation processes and outcomes.

AB  - Sepsis is defined as the host's reaction to infection and characterised by a systemic inflammatory response with important clinical implications. Central nervous system dysfunction secondary to sepsis is associated with local generation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, impaired cerebral microcirculation, an imbalance of neurotransmitters, apoptosis and cognitive impairment. It's known that the IL-1 beta is one of the first cytokines to be altered. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the role of IL-1 beta in cognitive parameters in brain tissue through the use of an IL-1 beta (IL-1ra) receptor antagonist up to 10 days and to assess blood-brain barrier permeability, cytokine levels, oxidative parameters and energetic metabolism up to 24 h, after sepsis induction. To this aim, we used sham-operated Wistar rats or submitted to the cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) procedure. Immediately after, the animals received one dose of 10 mu g of IL-1ra. After 24 h, the rats were killed and were evaluated for biochemical parameters in the pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. After 10 days, the animals were submitted to the habituation to the open field and step-down inhibitory avoidance task. We observed that the use of IL-1ra reverted the increase of blood-brain barrier permeability in the pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum; the increase of IL-1 beta, IL1-6 and TNF-alpha levels in the pre-frontal cortex and striatum; the decrease of complex I activity in the pre-frontal, hippocampus and striatum; the increase of oxidative parameters in pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum; and cognitive impairment. In conclusion, the results observed in this study reinforce the role of acute brain inflammatory response, in particular, the IL1 beta response, in the cognitive impairment associated with sepsis.

This paper reviews the current state of the evidence and provides evidence-based guidelines for spiritual assessment and for integration of R/S into mental health treatment.
   Methods: PubMed searches of relevant terms yielded 1,109 papers. We selected empirical studies and reviews that addressed assessment of R/S in clinical practice.
   Results: The most widely acknowledged and agreed-upon application of R/S to clinical practice is the need to take a spiritual history (SH), which may improve patient compliance, satisfaction with care, and health outcomes. We found 25 instruments for SH collection, several of which were validated and of good clinical utility.
   Conclusions: This paper provides practical guidelines for spiritual assessment and integration thereof into mental health treatment, as well as suggestions for future research on the topic.

AB  - Background Like other medical specialties, psychiatry has traditionally sought to develop treatments targeted at ameliorating a deficit of the patient However, there are different therapeutic models that focus on utilising patients' personal and social resources instead of ameliorating presumed deficits. A synopsis of such models might help to guide further research and improve therapeutic interventions.
   Aims To conduct a conceptual review of resource-oriented therapeutic models in psychiatry, in order to identify their shared characteristics.
   Method The literature was searched to identify a range of resource-oriented therapeutic models, particularly for patients with severe mental illness. Key texts for each model were analysed using a narrative approach to synthesise the concepts and their characteristics.
   Results Ten models were included: befriending, client-centred therapy, creative music therapy, open dialogue, peer support workers, positive psychotherapy, self-help groups, solution-focused therapy, systemic family therapy and therapeutic communities. Six types of resources were utilised: social relationships, patients' decision-making ability, experiential knowledge, patients' individual strengths, recreational activities and self-actualising tendencies. Social relationships are a key resource in all the models, including relationships with professionals, peers, friends and family. Two relationship dimensions - reciprocity and expertise - differed across the models.
   Conclusions The review suggests that a range of different therapeutic models in psychiatry address resources rather than deficits. In various ways, they all utilise social relationships to induce therapeutic change. A better understanding of how social relationships affect mental health may inform the development and application of resource-oriented approaches.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia causes great suffering for patients and families. Today, patients are treated with medications, but unfortunately many still have persistent symptoms and an impaired quality of life. During the last 20 years of research in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for schizophrenia, evidence has been found that the treatment is good for patients but it is not satisfactory enough, and more studies are being carried out hopefully to achieve further improvement. Purpose: Clinical trials and meta-analyses are being used to try to prove the efficacy of CBT. In this article, we summarize recent research using the cognitive model for people with schizophrenia. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed (Medline). Relevant articles were selected if they contained a description of cognitive models for schizophrenia or psychotic disorders. Results: There is now evidence that positive and negative symptoms exist in a continuum, from normality (mild form and few symptoms) to fully developed disease (intensive form with many symptoms). Delusional patients have reasoning bias such as jumping to conclusions, and those with hallucination have impaired self-monitoring and experience their own thoughts as voices. Patients with negative symptoms have negative beliefs such as low expectations regarding pleasure and success. In the entire patient group, it is common to have low self-esteem. Conclusions: The cognitive model integrates very well with the aberrant salience model. It takes into account neurobiology, cognitive, emotional and social processes. The therapist uses this knowledge when he or she chooses techniques for treatment of patients.

AB  - The importance of 'big data' in biology is increasing as vast quantities of data are being produced from high-throughput experiments. Techniques such as DNA microarrays are providing a genome-wide picture of gene expression levels, allowing us to investigate the structure and interactions of gene networks in biological systems. Inference of gene regulatory network (GRN) is an underdetermined problem suited to Metaheuristic algorithms which can operate on limited information. Thus GRN inference offers a platform for investigations into data intensive sciences and large scale optimization problems. Here we examine the link between data intensive research and optimization problems for the reverse engineering of GRNs. Briefly, we detail the benefit of the data deluge and the study of ALife for modelling GRNs as well as their reconstruction. We discuss how metaheuristics can solve big data problems and the inference of GRNs offer real world problems for both areas of research. We overview some current reconstruction algorithms and investigate some modelling and computational limits of the inference processes and suggest some areas for development. Furthermore we identify links and synergies between optimization and big data, e.g., dynamic, uncertain and large scale optimization problems, and discuss the potential benefit of multi-and many-objective optimization. We stress the importance of data integration techniques in order to maximize the data available, particularly for the case of inferring GRNs from microarray data. Such multi-disciplinary research is vital as biology is rapidly becoming a quantitative, data intensive science.

AB  - Prejudice is an enduring and pervasive aspect of human cognition. An emergent trend in modern psychology has focused on understanding how cognition is linked to neural function, leading researchers to investigate the neural correlates of prejudice. Research in this area using racial group memberships has quickly highlighted the amygdala as a neural structure of importance. In this article, we offer a critical review of social neuroscientific studies of the amygdala in race-related prejudice. Rather than the dominant interpretation that amygdala activity reflects a racial or outgroup bias per se, we argue that the observed pattern of sensitivity in this literature is best considered in terms of potential threat. More specifically, we argue that negative culturally-learned associations between black males and potential threat better explain the observed pattern of amygdala activity. Finally, we consider future directions for the field and offer specific experiments and predictions to directly address unanswered questions.

AB  - The negative symptoms of schizophrenia, avolition, alogia, apathy and impaired or nonexistent social functioning, are strongly correlated with the progressive course and long-term prognosis of the disease, undermining the patient's ability to integrate socially, interpersonal skills and quality of life. At a time when new drug strategies are being developed, a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis underpinning the occurrence of negative symptoms constitutes an essential prerequisite for real therapeutic advances. Approaching this vulnerability from the neurodevelopmental perspective is especially pertinent with regard to the experimental studies conducted in animals. Several models have been put forward, involving a variety of topics such as the deleterious impact of a prenatal infection or of early maternal deprivation on brain development, or else the consequences of trauma and abuse suffered during childhood. These various models are based on biological abnormalities that could guide the identification of new therapeutic targets. They notably include the hyperreactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and dysfunction of corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission. As such, in the traumagenic model, which associates neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes, the dysfunction of corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission, by reducing the tonic dopamine release, could be the cause of an increase in the phasic dopamine release linked to stress. This excessive phasic response to stress may induce cerebral damage by increasing excitotoxicity and oxidative stress.

AB  - The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) has a multifaceted function in the modulation of information processing through the activation of multiple receptor families, including G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes (5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT4-7) and ligand-gated ion channels (5-HT3). The largest population of serotonergic neurons is located in the midbrain, specifically in the raphe nuclei. Although the medial and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) share common projecting areas, in the basal ganglia (BG) nuclei serotonergic innervations come mainly from the DRN. The BG are a highly organized network of subcortical nuclei composed of the striatum (caudate and putamen), subthalamic nucleus (STN), internal and external globus pallidus (or entopeduncular nucleus in rodents, GPi/EP and GPe) and substantia nigra (pars compacta, SNc, and pars reticulata, SNr). The BG are part of the cortico-BG-thalamic circuits, which play a role in many functions like motor control, emotion, and cognition and are critically involved in diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). This review provides an overview of serotonergic modulation of the BG at the functional level and a discussion of how this interaction may be relevant to treating PD and the motor complications induced by chronic treatment with L-DOPA.

AB  - microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs (20-22 nucleotides) playing a major role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNAs are predicted to regulate more than 50% of all the protein-coding genes. Increasing evidence indicates that they may play key roles in the biological pathways that regulate neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, as well as in neurotransmitter homeostasis in the adult brain. In this article we review recent studies suggesting that miRNAs may be involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and in the action of psychotropic drugs, in particular by analyzing the contribution of genomic studies in patients' peripheral tissues. Alterations in miRNA expression have been observed in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neuropsychiatric conditions. In particular, intriguing findings concern the identification of disease-associated miRNA signatures in peripheral tissues, or modifications in miRNA profiles induced by drug treatments. Furthermore, genetic variations in miRNA sequences and miRNA-related genes have been described in neuropsychiatric diseases. Overall, though still at a preliminary stage, several lines of evidence indicate an involvement of miRNAs in both the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this regard, the data obtained in peripheral tissues may provide further insights into the etiopathogenesis of several brain diseases and contribute to identify new biomarkers for diagnostic assessment improvement and treatment personalization.

AB  - Biological clocks are genetically encoded oscillators that allow organisms to keep track of their environment. Among them, the circadian system is a highly conserved timing structure that regulates several physiological, metabolic and behavioural functions with periods close to 24 h. Time is also crucial for everyday activities that involve conscious time estimation. Timing behaviour in the second-to-minutes range, known as interval timing, involves the interaction of cortico-striatal circuits. In this review, we summarize current findings on the neurobiological basis of the circadian system, both at the genetic and behavioural level, and also focus on its interactions with interval timing and seasonal rhythms, in order to construct a multi-level biological clock.

AB  - This paper reviews the move from virtual reality exposure-based therapy to augmented reality exposure-based therapy (ARET). Unlike virtual reality (VR), which entails a complete virtual environment (VE), augmented reality (AR) limits itself to producing certain virtual elements to then merge them into the view of the physical world. Although, the general public may only have become aware of AR in the last few years, AR type applications have been around since beginning of the twentieth century. Since, then, technological developments have enabled an ever increasing level of seamless integration of virtual and physical elements into one view. Like VR, AR allows the exposure to stimuli which, due to various reasons, may not be suitable for real-life scenarios. As such, AR has proven itself to be a medium through which individuals suffering from specific phobia can be exposed "safely" to the object(s) of their fear, without the costs associated with programming complete VEs. Thus, ARET can offer an efficacious alternative to some less advantageous exposure-based therapies. Above and beyond presenting what has been accomplished in ARET, this paper covers some less well-known aspects of the history of AR, raises some ARET related issues, and proposes potential avenues to be followed. These include the type of measures to be used to qualify the user's experience in an augmented reality environment, the exclusion of certain AR-type functionalities from the definition of AR, as well as the potential use of ARET to treat non-small animal phobias, such as social phobia.

AB  - The emergence of two distinct leadership roles, the task leader and the socio-emotional leader, has been documented in the leadership literature since the 1950s. Recent research in neuroscience suggests that the division between task-oriented and socio-emotional-oriented roles derives from a fundamental feature of our neurobiology: an antagonistic relationship between two large-scale cortical networks the task-positive network (TPN) and the default mode network (DMN). Neural activity in TPN tends to inhibit activity in the DMN, and vice versa. The TPN is important for problem solving, focusing of attention, making decisions, and control of action. The DMN plays a central role in emotional self-awareness, social cognition, and ethical decision making. It is also strongly linked to creativity and openness to new ideas. Because activation of the TPN tends to suppress activity in the DMN, an over-emphasis on task-oriented leadership may prove deleterious to social and emotional aspects of leadership. Similarly, an overemphasis on the DMN would result in difficulty focusing attention, making decisions, and solving known problems. In this paper, we will review major streams of theory and research on leadership roles in the context of recent findings from neuroscience and psychology. We conclude by suggesting that emerging research challenges the assumption that role differentiation is both natural and necessary, in particular when openness to new ideas, people, emotions, and ethical concerns are important to success.

AB  - Job strain results from a combination of high workload and few decision-making opportunities in the workplace. There is inconsistent evidence regarding the association between job strain and hypertension, and methodological shortcomings preclude firm conclusions. Thus, a meta-analysis of observational studies on hypertension among occupational groups was conducted to determine whether job strain was associated with hypertension. In January 2012, we carried out a comprehensive, topic-specific electronic literature search of the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychoINFO databases complemented by individual help from non-communicable disease experts. Experimental/interventional studies and studies on personality disorders were excluded. Nine of 894 identified studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR of the nine studies was 1.3 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.48; p<0.001), of case-control studies 3.17 (95% CI 1.79 to 5.60; p<0.001) and of cohort studies 1.24 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.41; p<0.001), all of which indicated statistically significant positive associations between job strain and hypertension. In a subgroup analysis, cohort studies of good methodological quality showed significant associations between job strain and hypertension, while those of poor methodological quality showed no association or subgroup differences. We conclude that despite methodological differences, case-control and cohort studies of good methodological quality showed positive associations between hypertension and job strain.

AB  - Introduction. The state of health of patients with schizophrenia is a field of growing interest that has probably not received sufficient attention in the past. It is currently held that physical health should form a part of the overall therapeutic strategy in these patients since reference is made to certain treatable conditions that may affect the final prognosis. One example is cardiovascular disease and its associated reduction in life expectancy.
   Development. We carried out a retrospective study in which we described the consultations held between the psychiatric acute care service and the neurology service during a one-year period. We have analyzed the frequency of cerebrovascular complications in our sample and have included a summary of the most relevant published data regarding cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in patients with schizophrenia.
   Conclusions. We have described the high frequency of CVD in both our series of patients with severe mental illness receiving attention as well as in those from the neurology service (25.7%), and in the subgroup presenting psychotic disorders (25%). There are several studies focusing on the possible causes of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially in schizophrenia. However, in regards to CVD specifically, little has been found in the literature and that found shows contradictory results. Given the direct relation between cardiovascular disease and CVD, a consistent relation between CVD and schizophrenia is to be expected.

   Method: Systematic review of randomized trials examining psychological treatment for adult depression to identify the effects of treatment on physical activity.
   Results: We searched published papers on a database of 204 randomized controlled trials on psychological treatment for adult depression. No study reported the effects on physical activity.
   Conclusions: Whether psychological treatments of adult depression have an effect on physical activity has not been examined in randomized trials. We conclude that researchers should include physical activity measures in future trials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives
   The therapeutic effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation in patients with major depression have shown promising results; however, there is a lack of mechanistic studies using biological markers (BMs) as an outcome. Therefore, our aim was to review noninvasive brain stimulation trials in depression using BMs.
   Methods
   The following databases were used for our systematic review: MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and SCIELO. We examined articles published before November 2012 that used TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation as an intervention for depression and had BM as an outcome measure. The search was limited to human studies written in English.
   Results
   Of 1234 potential articles, 52 articles were included. Only studies using TMS were found. Biological markers included immune and endocrine serum markers, neuroimaging techniques, and electrophysiological outcomes. In 12 articles (21.4%), end point BM measurements were not significantly associated with clinical outcomes. All studies reached significant results in the main clinical rating scales. Biological marker outcomes were used as predictors of response, to understand mechanisms of TMS, and as a surrogate of safety.
   Conclusions
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cortical excitability, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor consistently showed positive results. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was the best predictor of patients' likeliness to respond. These initial results are promising; however, all studies investigating BMs are small, used heterogeneous samples, and did not take into account confounders such as age, sex, or family history. Based on our findings, we recommend further studies to validate BMs in noninvasive brain stimulation trials in MDD.

AB  - Evidence is rapidly accumulating that rare, recurrent copy number variants represent large effect risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) (velocardiofacial syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome) is the most common known contiguous gene deletion syndrome and is associated with diverse neuropsychiatric disorders across the life span. One of the most intriguing aspects of the syndrome is the variability in clinical and cognitive presentation: children with 22q11DS have high prevalence of autism spectrum, attention deficit, and anxiety disorders, as well as psychotic-like features, and up to 30% of adolescents and adults develop schizophrenia-like psychosis. Recently, cases of early-onset Parkinson's disease in adults have been reported, collectively suggesting a role for disrupted dopaminergic neurotransmission in the observed neuropsychiatric phenotypes. There is also some evidence that 22q11DS-associated autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia represent two unrelated phenotypic manifestations, consistent with a neuropsychiatric pleiotropy model. This genetic lesion thus provides a unique model for the discovery of specific genomic risk and (potentially) protective factors for neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we provide an overview of neuropsychiatric findings to date, which highlight the value of this syndrome in mapping the developmental trajectory of dimensional phenotypes that traverse multiple diagnostic categories. Potential sources of genetic variability that may contribute to the disorder's heterogeneous presentation are reviewed. Because of its known genetic etiology, animal models can readily be developed that recapitulate specific aspects of the syndrome. Future research directions involve translational models and potential for drug screenable targets in the context of this human model system.

Systematic searches were conducted in electronic databases, reference lists, and journals. Fifty-five studies met inclusion criteria: 21 studies investigating prevalence, symptom presentation, and assessment, as well as 34 intervention studies investigating 14 different interventions. Based on the Chambless criteria for treatment efficacy, four treatments (behavior analysis and behavior modification, risperidone, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine for adults) met criteria for possible efficacious interventions for OCD among individuals with ASD. Positive intervention outcomes were reported in the majority of studies, but there was not enough research to make firm conclusions regarding efficacy of other treatments.

AB  - People are most often exposed to mercury in water, amalgam dental fillings, vaccines with ethylmercury as a preservative and in methylmercury containing fish. Foetuses and children are most susceptible to toxic mercury, which passes to their organisms through the placenta or with mother's milk.
   Distribution of mercury in organs depends on the type of compound absorbed and duration of exposure. Mercury is mainly absorbed through the respiratory system.
   There are two types of mercury poisoning: acute and chronic. The critical organs for acute poisoning with mercury vapour are the lungs. Acute poisoning develops when large amounts of mercury are inhaled, which may lead to acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Chronic exposure to mercury vapour primarily affects the central nervous system.
   Mercury is considered as a contributing factor in aetiology of numerous disorders, including neurologic, renal, immunological, cardiologic, reproductive or even genetic abnormalities. Studies have demonstrated the correlation between mercury toxicity and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, autism and multiple sclerosis.
   Mercury may be involved in four processes which lead to genotoxicity: generation of free radicals and oxidative stress, effects on microtubules and on DNA repair mechanisms as well as direct interaction with DNA molecules.

AB  - The field of endocrine pharmacology is very wide but most of studies in the recent years from the world and Iran have focused on diabetes, osteoporosis, and lipid disorders. In the present review, we tried to evaluate the improvements and publications in that field briefly. Interestingly, many of studies have focused on agents that have traditional and natural origin. Although few basic studies have gone on the direct line to complete preclinical and some clinical trial studies, there are many non-clinical studies that have proved efficacy of many compounds in endocrine diseases but these studies were not continued at clinical stages to reach a drug. However, it is appreciable that, some researchers have given novel ideas that deserve investment by grant bodies to reach out valuable works. We believe that science of endocrine pharmacology is still young and more quality studies are still needed to introduce effective medications for diseases like diabetes and osteoporosis or even obesity and lipid disorders.

   Method: A systematic search was conducted on the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and a personal database for articles on cohort series, preferably controlled, of inpatient suicide (not deliberate self-harm or attempted suicide, unless they also dealt specifically with suicide data).
   Results: A qualitative discussion is presented, based on the findings of the literature searched.
   Conclusions: The bulk of inpatient suicides actually occur not on the ward but off premises, when the patient was on leave or had absconded. Peaks occur shortly after admission and discharge. It is possible to reduce suicide risk on the ward by having a safe environment, optimizing patient visibility, supervising patients appropriately, careful assessment, awareness of and respect for suicide risk, good teamwork and communication, and adequate clinical treatment.

   Methods: We searched the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Global Health using search terms such as substance abuse treatment developing countries, addiction developing nations, and alcohol abuse developing countries. Opinion pieces and articles published before 1994 were excluded. Thirty relevant articles (excluding those reviewed for background information) were identified.
   Findings: Comprehensive overviews of treatment models were markedly absent from the current literature. However, existing research highlights specific areas of need, which may serve as a guide for future research and program development.
   Conclusions: In light of the evident need for treatment of substance use disorder in developing countries, future research would do well to blend inquiry with practice. Although further investigation is needed to fully understand the specific needs of developing world populations, assisting those populations should be a primary goal.

AB  - In the emerging field of computational paralinguistics, most research efforts are devoted to either short-term speaker states such as emotions, or long-term traits such as personality, gender, or age. To bridge this gap on the time axis, and hence broaden the scope of the field, the INTERSPEECH 2011 Speaker State Challenge addressed the algorithmic analysis of medium-term speaker states: alcohol intoxication and sleepiness, both of which are highly relevant in high risk environments. Preserving the paradigms of the two previous INTERSPEECH Challenges, researchers were invited to participate in a large-scale evaluation providing unified testing conditions. This article reviews previous efforts to automatically recognise intoxication and sleepiness from speech signals, and gives an overview on the Challenge conditions and data sets, the methods used by the participants, and their results. By fusing participants' systems, we show that binary classification of alcoholisation and sleepiness from short-term observations, i.e., single utterances, can both reach over 72% accuracy on unseen test data; furthermore, we demonstrate that these medium-term states can be recognised more robustly by fusing short-term classifiers along the time axis, reaching up to 91% accuracy for intoxication and 75% for sleepiness.

AB  - Preconditioning is a phenomenon in which brief episodes of a sublethal insult induce robust protection against subsequent lethal injuries. Preconditioning has been observed in multiple organisms and can occur in the brain as well as other tissues. Extensive animal studies suggest that the brain can be preconditioned to resist acute injuries, such as ischemic stroke, neonatal hypoxia/ischemia, surgical brain injury, trauma, and agents that are used in models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Effective preconditioning stimuli are numerous and diverse, ranging from transient ischemia, hypoxia, hyperbaric oxygen, hypothermia and hyperthermia, to exposure to neurotoxins and pharmacological agents. The phenomenon of "cross-tolerance," in which a sublethal stress protects against a different type of injury, suggests that different preconditioning stimuli may confer protection against a wide range of injuries. Research conducted over the past few decades indicates that brain preconditioning is complex, involving multiple effectors such as metabolic inhibition, activation of extra- and intracellular defense mechanisms, a shift in the neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance, and reduction in inflammatory sequelae. An improved understanding of brain preconditioning should help us identify innovative therapeutic strategies that prevent or at least reduce neuronal damage in susceptible patients. In this review, we focus on the experimental evidence of preconditioning in the brain and systematically survey the models used to develop paradigms for neuroprotection, and then discuss the clinical potential of brain preconditioning.

Keyword searches included "transgender'' and "transsexual.'' Key phrases included "transgender aging,'' "transsexual aging,'' and "LGBT aging.'' Years searched were from January 1, 2011, through April 26, 2013. We found two types of articles: LGBT aging-related (or lumped aging) articles and articles that focused specifically on transgender aging, or trans-aging. We found that the articles spoke of concerns and fears regarding discrimination, potential abuse at the hands of caregivers, inability to live out their lives in their true identities, risk of becoming homeless, loss of independence, and dementia, among other concerns. We note that the elder trans-identified population is significantly ill-prepared for the major legal issues that arise and events that occur in the later-life to end-of-life time periods. Despite these difficulties, a few articles spoke of resilience and successful aging in the population. Some TMLS respondents indicated that they were considering either "detransitioning,'' that is, changing social presentation to the pretransition gender identity, or suicide (which some referred to as euthanasia) as means of managing the severe problems they expected to encounter later in the aging process. A number of potentially modifiable risk factors exist within this population. Modification strategies include increasing the population awareness of the need for end-of-life legal preparations for members of the trans-identified community as well as those who serve it. There is a continued need to reduce stigma and to include gender identity/gender presentation in nondiscrimination and hate crime statutes. Despite these difficulties, there is a resilience and robustness that can be found in many individuals within the community of transgender older adults. There is a need to investigate this further.

AB  - Our phenomenal world remains stationary in spite of movements of the eyes, head and body. In addition, we can point or turn to objects in the surroundings whether or not they are in the field of view. In this review, I argue that these two features of experience and behaviour are related. The ability to interact with objects we cannot see implies an internal memory model of the surroundings, available to the motor system. And, because we maintain this ability when we move around, the model must be updated, so that the locations of object memories change continuously to provide accurate directional information. The model thus contains an internal representation of both the surroundings and the motions of the head and body: in other words, a stable representation of space. Recent functional MRI studies have provided strong evidence that this egocentric representation has a location in the precuneus, on the medial surface of the superior parietal cortex. This is a region previously identified with 'self-centred mental imagery', so it seems likely that the stable egocentric representation, required by the motor system, is also the source of our conscious percept of a stable world.

AB  - Background: Performance on psychometric tests is key to diagnosis and monitoring treatment of dementia. Results are often reported as a total score, but there is additional information in individual items of tests which vary in their difficulty and discriminatory value. Item difficulty refers to an ability level at which the probability of responding correctly is 50%. Discrimination is an index of how well an item can differentiate between patients of varying levels of severity. Item response theory (IRT) analysis can use this information to examine and refine measures of cognitive functioning. This systematic review aimed to identify all published literature which had applied IRT to instruments assessing global cognitive function in people with dementia.
   Methods: A systematic review was carried out across Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and CINHAL articles. Search terms relating to IRT and dementia were combined to find all IRT analyses of global functioning scales of dementia.
   Results: Of 384 articles identified four studies met inclusion criteria including a total of 2,920 people with dementia from six centers in two countries. These studies used three cognitive tests (MMSE, ADAS-Cog, BIMCT) and three IRT methods (Item Characteristic Curve analysis, Samejima's graded response model, the 2-Parameter Model). Memory items were most difficult. Naming the date in the MMSE and memory items, specifically word recall, of the ADAS-cog were most discriminatory.
   Conclusions: Four published studies were identified which used IRT on global cognitive tests in people with dementia. This technique increased the interpretative power of the cognitive scales, and could be used to provide clinicians with key items from a larger test battery which would have high predictive value. There is need for further studies using IRT in a wider range of tests involving people with dementia of different etiology and severity.

AB  - Accumulating evidence supports the view that deregulation of the immune system represents an important vulnerability factor for psychosis. In a subgroup of psychotic patients, the high comorbidity with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions suggests a common underlying immune abnormality leading to both conditions. The reviewed data of affective and nonaffective psychosis show that if immune biomarkers exist for such immune abnormality, they may be found in raised macrophage/monocyte inflammatory activation patterns (monocytosis, high-inflammatory gene expression, raised glucocorticoid receptor beta/glucocorticoid receptor a ratio, and high levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory monocyte/macrophage derived cytokines in serum/plasma), reduced T cell numbers/proliferation, and TH1 skewing. This activation of the inflammatory response system may be suggestive for microglia activation, as these cells are the macrophages of the brain. Indeed, there is some evidence of activation of the microglia as detected in positron emission tomography scans and in histopathology, and it is assumed that this activation disturbs the development and function of neuronal circuits in the brain. Further, animal models of psychotic conditions (maternal stress and inflammation paradigms) suggest that such monocyte/microglia activation could be seen as the result of a combination of genetic predisposition and an immune-mediated two-hit model. Infection but also environmental stressors during gestation/early life activate microglia, perturbing neuronal development, thereby setting the stage for vulnerability for later psychotic disorders. A second hit, such as endocrine changes, stress, or infection, could further activate microglia, leading to functional abnormalities of the neuronal circuitry in the brain and psychosis.

AB  - Background: Little is known about whether peer support improves outcomes for people with severe mental illness.
   Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Cochrane CENTRAL Register, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched to July 2013 without restriction by publication status. Randomised trials of non-residential peer support interventions were included. Trial interventions were categorised and analysed separately as: mutual peer support, peer support services, or peer delivered mental health services. Meta-analyses were performed where possible, and studies were assessed for bias and the quality of evidence described.
   Results: Eighteen trials including 5597 participants were included. These comprised four trials of mutual support programmes, eleven trials of peer support services, and three trials of peer-delivered services. There was substantial variation between trials in participants' characteristics and programme content. Outcomes were incompletely reported; there was high risk of bias. From small numbers of studies in the analyses it was possible to conduct, there was little or no evidence that peer support was associated with positive effects on hospitalisation, overall symptoms or satisfaction with services. There was some evidence that peer support was associated with positive effects on measures of hope, recovery and empowerment at and beyond the end of the intervention, although this was not consistent within or across different types of peer support.
   Conclusions: Despite the promotion and uptake of peer support internationally, there is little evidence from current trials about the effects of peer support for people with severe mental illness. Although there are few positive findings, this review has important implications for policy and practice: current evidence does not support recommendations or mandatory requirements from policy makers for mental health services to provide peer support programmes. Further peer support programmes should be implemented within the context of high quality research projects wherever possible. Deficiencies in the conduct and reporting of existing trials exemplify difficulties in the evaluation of complex interventions.

AB  - Sirtuins are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacylases that have traditionally been linked with calorie restriction and aging in mammals. These proteins also play an important role in maintaining neuronal health during aging. During neuronal development, the SIR2 ortholog SIRT1 is structurally important, promoting axonal elongation, neurite outgrowth, and dendritic branching. This sirtuin also plays a role in memory formation by modulating synaptic plasticity. Hypothalamic functions that affect feeding behavior, endocrine function, and circadian rhythmicity are all regulated by SIRT1. Finally, SIRT1 plays protective roles in several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and motor neuron diseases, which may relate to its functions in metabolism, stress resistance, and genomic stability. Drugs that activate SIRT1 may offer a promising approach to treat these disorders.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited form of intellectual disability and autism. Among other symptoms, FXS patients demonstrate abnormalities in sensory processing and communication. Clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological studies consistently show auditory hypersensitivity in humans with FXS. Consistent with observations in humans, the Fmr1 KO mouse model of FXS also shows evidence of altered auditory processing and communication deficiencies. A well-known and commonly used phenotype in pre-clinical studies of FXS is audiogenic seizures. In addition, increased acoustic startle response is seen in the Fmr1 KO mice. In vivo electrophysiological recordings indicate hyper-excitable responses, broader frequency tuning, and abnormal spectrotemporal processing in primary auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, auditory hyper-excitability is a robust, reliable, and translatable biomarker in Fmr1 KO mice. Abnormal auditory evoked responses have been used as outcome measures to test therapeutics in FXS patients. Given that similarly abnormal responses are present in Fmr1 KO mice suggests that cellular mechanisms can be addressed. Sensory cortical deficits are relatively more tractable from a mechanistic perspective than more complex social behaviors that are typically studied in autism and FXS. The focus of this review is to bring together clinical, functional, and structural studies in humans with electrophysiological and behavioral studies in mice to make the case that auditory hypersensitivity provides a unique opportunity to integrate molecular, cellular, circuit level studies with behavioral outcomes in the search for therapeutics for FXS and other autism spectrum disorders.

AB  - Health education and behavior researchers and practitioners often develop, adapt, or adopt surveys/scales to quantify and measure cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and psychosocial characteristics. To ensure the integrity of data collected from these scales, it is vital that psychometric properties (i.e., validity and reliability) be assessed. The purpose of this investigation was to (a) determine the frequency with which published articles appearing in health education and behavior journals report the psychometric properties of the scales/subscales employed and (b) outline the methods used to determine the reliability and validity of the scores produced. The results reported herein are based on a final sample of 967 published articles, spanning seven prominent health education and behavior journals between 2007 and 2010. Of the 967 articles examined, an exceedingly high percentage failed to report any validity (ranging from 40% to 93%) or reliability (ranging from 35% to 80%) statistics in their articles. For health education/behavior practitioners and researchers to maximize the utility and applicability of their findings, they must evaluate the psychometric properties of the instrument employed, a practice that is currently underrepresented in the literature. By not ensuring the instruments employed in a given study were able to produce accurate and consistent scores, researchers cannot be certain they actually measured the behaviors and/or constructs reported.

AB  - Objective: People with serious mental illness (SMI) die at least 11 years earlier than the general U.S. population, on average, due largely to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Disparities in CVD morbidity and mortality also occur among some U.S. racial and ethnic minorities. The combined effect of race/ethnicity and SMI on CVD-related risk factors, however, remains unclear. To address this gap, we conducted a critical literature review of studies assessing the prevalence of CVD risk factors (overweight/obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and physical inactivity) among U.S. racial/ethnic groups with schizophreniaspectrum and bipolar disorders.
   Methods and Results: We searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO for articles published between 1986 and 2013. The search ultimately yielded 40 articles. There was great variation in sampling, methodology, and study populations. Results were mixed, though there was some evidence for increased risk for obesity and diabetes mellitus among African Americans, and to a lesser degree for Hispanics, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Sex emerged as an important possible effect modifier of risk, as women had higher CVD risk among all racial/ethnic subgroups where stratified analyses were reported.
   Conclusions: Compared to general population estimates, there was some evidence for an additive risk for CVD risk factors among racial/ethnic minorities with SMI. Future studies should include longitudinal assessment, stratification by sex, subgroup analyses to clarify the mechanisms leading to potentially elevated risk, and the evaluation of culturally appropriate interventions to eliminate the extra burden of disease in this population.

AB  - India, among the low- and middle-income countries, in the 1980s, made an early attempt at formulating a mental health program. India's National Mental Health Program (NMHP) intended to attend to the mental health needs of all her citizens. Some aspects of this program bear significant resemblance to what recent experts in global mental health (GMH) have been proposing. The paper uses India as a country-level example to review and critically analyze the contextual background culminating in the formulation of the NMHP. Literature searches from two bibliographic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) with supplementary searches and manual search from Indian Journal of Psychiatry were made relating to the context of formulation of India's NMHP. The search helped isolate 12 peer reviewed journal articles, three chapters from books, and one policy group approach paper. This literature has been synthesized to enumerate the various contextual factors. The present analysis identifies two vital factors relevant for international health, viz. the primary health care movement and the changing concepts of institutional care/de-institutionalization in mental health. This then puts in perspective the opportunities allowed and challenges produced, for NMHP, by subsequent changes in public health services in India. The lessons for GMH movement are then pointed out.

AB  - Objective: Major depressive disorder is the most common psychiatric disorder, worldwide, yet response and remission rates are still unsatisfactory. The identification of genetic predictors of antidepressant (AD) response could provide a promising opportunity to improve current AD efficacy through the personalization of treatment. The major steps and findings along this path are reviewed together with their clinical implications and limitations.
   Method: We systematically reviewed the literature through MEDLINE and Embase database searches, using any word combination of "antidepressant," "gene," "polymorphism," "pharmacogenetics," "genome-wide association study," "GWAS," "response," and "adverse drug reactions." Experimental works and reviews published until March 2012 were collected and compared.
   Results: Numerous genes pertaining to several functional systems were associated with AD response. The more robust findings were found for the following genes,: solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter), member 4; serotonin receptor 1A and 2A; brain-derived neurotrophic factor; and catechol-O-methyltransferase. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) provided many top markers, even if none of them reached genome-wide significance..
   Conclusions: AD pharmacogenetics have not produced any knowledge applicable to routine clinical practice yet, as results were mainly inconsistent across studies. Despite this, the rising awareness about methodological deficits of past studies could allow for the identication of more suitable strategies, such as the integration of the GWAS approach with the candidate gene approach, and innovative methodologies, such as pathway analysis and study of depressive endophenotypes.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is utilized worldwide for various severe and treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. Research studies have shown that ECT is the most effective and rapid treatment available for elderly patients with depression, bipolar disorder and psychosis. For patients who suffer from intractable catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, ECT can be life saving. For elderly patients who cannot tolerate or respond poorly to medications and who are at a high risk for drug-induced toxicity or toxic drug interactions, ECT is the safest treatment option. Organic causes are frequently associated with late-life onset of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as parkinsonism, dementia and stroke. ECT has proven to be efficacious even when these conditions are present. During the next decade, research studies should focus on the use of ECT as a synergistic therapy, to enhance other biological and psychological treatments, and prevent symptom relapse and recurrence.

AB  - Approximately 513 million Chinese citizens used the Internet in 2011, with adolescents reporting comparatively high levels of use. Although numerous studies (reviewed herein) indicate that Internet Addiction/Pathological Internet Use (IA/PIU) is endemic among Chinese youth and trending upward, no prior review has examined family correlates of IA/PIU in Chinese youth. Thus, our principal aim was to evaluate methodological features and substantive findings of all studies examining family correlates of IA/PILI in Chinese youth. Internet, demographic, psychosocial, and psychiatric/behavioral correlates of IA/PIU, and prevalence estimates for adolescent IA/PIU, were also examined using the large set of studies evaluated in association with our principal aim. Comprehensive bibliographic searches identified 42 pertinent investigations. Youth with IA/PIU reported greater global dissatisfaction with their families; less organized, cohesive and adaptable families; greater inter-parental and parent-child conflict; and perceived their parents as more punitive, and less supportive, warm, and involved compared to non-IA youth. IA/PIU youth were significantly more likely to have divorced parents, live with a single parent, and be an only child than non-IA/PIU youth. IA/PIU is prevalent among Chinese youth and associated with diverse family, psychosocial and psychiatric/behavioral impairments, but rarely is the focus of prevention and treatment interventions.

AB  - Background: It appears that the female reproductive events and hormonal treatments may impact the course of bipolar disorder in women. In particular, childbirth is known to be associated with onset of affective episodes in women with bipolar disorder. During the female reproductive events the sex hormones, e.g. estrogen, are fluctuating and particularly postpartum there is a steep fall in the levels of serum estrogen. The role of estrogen in women with bipolar disorder is, however, not fully understood. Aim: The main objective of this review is to evaluate the possible relation between serum estrogen levels and women with bipolar disorder including studies of the anti manic effects of the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen. Method: A systematically literature search on PubMed was conducted: two studies regarding the connection between serum estrogen levels and women with bipolar disorder were identified. Furthermore, four studies were found concerning the antimanic effects of tamoxifen. Results: Both studies in the estrogen studies showed very low levels of estrogen in women with postpartum psychosis and significant improvement of symptoms after treatment with estrogen. The four tamoxifen studies found that tamoxifen was effective in producing antimanic effects. Conclusion: These results indicate that estrogen fluctuations may be an important factor in the etiology of bipolar disorder and it is obvious that more research on this topic is needed to clarify the role of estrogen in women with bipolar disorder.

AB  - Pregnancy and postpartum pose a challenge for the illness course and treatment in bipolar disorder (BD). This article reviews the most updated data on the pregnancy and birth outcomes and child-bearing related course of illness together with treatment during pregnancy in BD. Two electronic databases, MEDLINE and SCOPUS were searched for the child-bearing related clinical studies and systematic reviews published in English. The reference lists of identified publications were also searched for other relevant publications. Data from a limited number of studies reveal an increased risk for small for gestational age and preterm births in women with BD. The results are inconclusive owing to the potential confounders, such as lifestyle and medication. Despite repeatedly reported high rates of episode recurrences during pregnancy, the exact impact of pregnancy on the course of illness in BD is equivocal. However, abrupt medication discontinuation sets a definite risk factor for significantly increased episode recurrences during pregnancy. Continuing lithium may be an option with a close fetal cardiac monitorization. However, avoidance from valproate is suggested. Safety data on the atypical antipsychotics remains inconclusive. There is no specific recommendation on the medication selection. Pregnancy is an event that may intersect the treatment course in women with BD. The exact impact of pregnancy on the course of BD and its subtypes is still to be explored, as is the role of confounding factors such as lifestyle and medication use on the adverse course of illness and birth outcomes.

AB  - Evidence that childhood adversities are risk factors for psychosis has accumulated rapidly. Research into the mechanisms underlying these relationships has focused, productively, on psychological processes, including cognition, attachment and dissociation. In 2001, the traumagenic neurodevelopmental model sought to integrate biological and psychological research by highlighting the similarities between the structural and functional abnormalities in the brains of abused children and adults diagnosed with schizophrenia'. No review of relevant literature has subsequently been published. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to summarize the literature on biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between childhood trauma and psychosis published since 2001. A comprehensive search for relevant papers was undertaken via Medline, PubMed and psycINFO. In total, 125 papers were identified, with a range of methodologies, and provided both indirect support for and direct confirmation of the traumagenic neurodevelopmental model. Integrating our growing understanding of the biological sequelae of early adversity with our knowledge of the psychological processes linking early adversity to psychosis is valuable both theoretically and clinically.

AB  - Although the involvement of genetic abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is well-accepted, recent studies point to an equal contribution by environmental factors, particularly environmental toxicants. However, these toxicant-related studies in ASD have not been systematically reviewed to date. Therefore, we compiled publications investigating potential associations between environmental toxicants and ASD and arranged these publications into the following three categories: (a) studies examining estimated toxicant exposures in the environment during the preconceptional, gestational and early childhood periods; (b) studies investigating biomarkers of toxicants; and (c) studies examining potential genetic susceptibilities to toxicants. A literature search of nine electronic scientific databases through November 2013 was performed. In the first category examining ASD risk and estimated toxicant exposures in the environment, the majority of studies (34/37; 92%) reported an association. Most of these studies were retrospective case-control, ecological or prospective cohort studies, although a few had weaker study designs (for example, case reports or series). Toxicants implicated in ASD included pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), solvents, toxic waste sites, air pollutants and heavy metals, with the strongest evidence found for air pollutants and pesticides. Gestational exposure to methylmercury (through fish exposure, one study) and childhood exposure to pollutants in water supplies (two studies) were not found to be associated with ASD risk. In the second category of studies investigating biomarkers of toxicants and ASD, a large number was dedicated to examining heavy metals. Such studies demonstrated mixed findings, with only 19 of 40 (47%) case-control studies reporting higher concentrations of heavy metals in blood, urine, hair, brain or teeth of children with ASD compared with controls. Other biomarker studies reported that solvent, phthalate and pesticide levels were associated with ASD, whereas PCB studies were mixed. Seven studies reported a relationship between autism severity and heavy metal biomarkers, suggesting evidence of a dose-effect relationship. Overall, the evidence linking biomarkers of toxicants with ASD (the second category) was weaker compared with the evidence associating estimated exposures to toxicants in the environment and ASD risk (the first category) because many of the biomarker studies contained small sample sizes and the relationships between biomarkers and ASD were inconsistent across studies. Regarding the third category of studies investigating potential genetic susceptibilities to toxicants, 10 unique studies examined polymorphisms in genes associated with increased susceptibilities to toxicants, with 8 studies reporting that such polymorphisms were more common in ASD individuals (or their mothers, 1 study) compared with controls (one study examined multiple polymorphisms). Genes implicated in these studies included paraoxonase (PON1, three of five studies), glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1 and GSTP1, three of four studies), delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (one study), SLC11A3 (one study) and the metal regulatory transcription factor 1 (one of two studies). Notably, many of the reviewed studies had significant limitations, including lack of replication, limited sample sizes, retrospective design, recall and publication biases, inadequate matching of cases and controls, and the use of nonstandard tools to diagnose ASD.
   The findings of this review suggest that the etiology of ASD may involve, at least in a subset of children, complex interactions between genetic factors and certain environmental toxicants that may act synergistically or in parallel during critical periods of neurodevelopment, in a manner that increases the likelihood of developing ASD. Because of the limitations of many of the reviewed studies, additional high-quality epidemiological studies concerning environmental toxicants and ASD are warranted to confirm and clarify many of these findings.

AB  - Aims: The aims of this study were to conduct a meta-analysis and meta-regression to estimate the prevalence rates for obsessive compulsive symptoms (OCS) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in schizophrenia, and to investigate what influences these prevalence rates.
   Method: Studies were identified via an online OVID database search, including PsychInfo, Embase and Medline until December 2009.
   Results: Forty-three studies summarizing outcomes for 3978 subjects met inclusion criteria. The mean OCD prevalence is 12.3%, slightly increasing to 13.6% after adjustment in meta-regression. The prevalence rate of OCS, defined as any obsession or compulsion is 30.7% (30.3% adjusted). Higher severity of OCS, DIGS assessment, and Sub-Saharan African origin of study are associated with a lower OCS/OCD prevalence rate, use of DSM-IV edition, Y-BOCS assessment and longer schizophrenia history are associated with a higher prevalence rate.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of OCS and OCD in schizophrenia is substantial, specifically in more chronic patient populations and is influenced by the method of assessment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nigella sativa (NS) or black seed has been used for the treatment of various disorders for centuries. Experimentally, seed extract or thymoquinone (TQ) which is the main constituent of its oil has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic and anticancer properties. Interestingly, the published data demonstrates that NS acts as anti-oxidant in various diseases simultaneously, it behaves like a pro-oxidant for cancer cells. Here, we have summarized the dual properties of this medicinal plant. Current review is systematic, based on search from PubMed. Pubmed data indicated that NS has both anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant properties in different cell types hence should be used carefully because it acts as a cytoprotective or cytotoxic agent in inflammatory and malignant conditions respectively.

AB  - The definition of the locally covariant Dirac field is adapted such that it may be charged under a gauge group and in the presence of generic gauge and Yukawa background fields. We construct renormalized Wick powers and time-ordered products. It is shown that the Wick powers may be defined such that the current and the stress-energy tensor are conserved, and the remaining ambiguity is characterized. We sketch a variant of the background field method that can be used to determine the renormalization group flow at the one loop level from the nontrivial scaling of Wick powers.

AB  - Effect of different meditation practices on various aspects of mental and physical health is receiving growing attention. The present paper reviews evidence on the effects of several mediation practices on cognitive functions in the context of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The effect of meditation in this area is still poorly explored. Seven studies were detected through the databases search, which explores the effect of meditation on attention, memory, executive functions, and other miscellaneous measures of cognition in a sample of older people and people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, reviewed studies suggested a positive effect of meditation techniques, particularly in the area of attention, as well as memory, verbal fluency, and cognitive flexibility. These findings are discussed in the context of MRI studies suggesting structural correlates of the effects. Meditation can be a potentially suitable non-pharmacological intervention aimed at the prevention of cognitive decline in the elderly. However, the conclusions of these studies are limited by their methodological flaws and differences of various types of meditation techniques. Further research in this direction could help to verify the validity of the findings and clarify the problematic aspects.

AB  - Musical training has recently gained additional interest in education as increasing neuroscientific research demonstrates its positive effects on brain development. Neuroimaging revealed plastic changes in the brains of adult musicians but it is still unclear to what extent they are the product of intensive music training rather than of other factors, such as preexisting biological markers of musicality. In this review, we synthesize a large body of studies demonstrating that benefits of musical training extend beyond the skills it directly aims to train and last well into adulthood. For example, children who undergo musical training have better verbal memory, second language pronunciation accuracy, reading ability and executive functions. Learning to play an instrument as a child may even predict academic performance and IQ in young adulthood. The degree of observed structural and functional adaptation in the brain correlates with intensity and duration of practice. Importantly, the effects on cognitive development depend on the timing of musical initiation due to sensitive periods during development, as well as on several other modulating variables. Notably, we point to motivation, reward and social context of musical education, which are important yet neglected factors affecting the long-term benefits of musical training. Further, we introduce the notion of rhythmic entrainment and suggest that it may represent a mechanism supporting learning and development of executive functions. It also hones temporal processing and orienting of attention in time that may underlie enhancements observed in reading and verbal memory. We conclude that musical training uniquely engenders near and far transfer effects, preparing a foundation for a range of skills, and thus fostering cognitive development.

AB  - Background: Musculoskeletal pain may be triggered by physical strains and psychosocial risk factors. The effort-reward imbalance model (ERI model) is a stress model which measures psychosocial factors in the working world. The question is whether workers with an effort-reward imbalance report musculoskeletal pain more frequently than those with no effort-reward imbalance. A systematic review using a best evidence synthesis approach was conducted to answer this question.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted for the period from 1996 to 2012, using three databases (Pubmed, Embase and PsycINFO). The research criteria related to psychosocial, work-related stress as per the ERI model and to musculoskeletal pain. A quality score was developed using various quality criteria to assess the standard of the studies. The level of evidence was graded as in (Am J Ind Med 39:180-193, 2001).
   Results: After applying the inclusion criteria, a total of 19 studies were included in the review: 15 cross-sectional studies, three prospective studies and one case-control study. 74% of all studies exhibited good methodological quality, 53% collected data using the original ERI questionnaire, and in 42% of the studies, there was adequate control for physical working conditions. Furthermore, different cut-off points were used to classify exposed and non-exposed individuals. On the basis of 13 studies with a positive, statistically significant association, a moderate level of evidence was inferred for the association between effort-reward imbalance and musculoskeletal pain. The evidence for a role of over-commitment and for its interaction with effort-reward imbalance was rated as inconclusive - on the basis of eight and five studies, respectively.
   Conclusions: On the basis of the available evidence, no reliable conclusion may be drawn about any association between the psychosocial factors ascertained using the ERI model and musculoskeletal pain. Before a reliable statement can be made on the association between ERI and musculoskeletal pain, additional longitudinal studies must be performed - with a standardised method for recording and classifying exposure, as well as control of physical confounders. Appropriate preventive measures can then be specified.

AB  - Humans share with other animals an ability to measure the passage of physical time and subjectively experience a sense of time passing. Subjective time has hallmark qualities, akin to other senses, which can be accounted for by formal, psychological, and neurobiological models of the internal clock. These include first-order principles, such as changes in clock speed and how temporal memories are stored, and second-order principles, including timescale invariance, multisensory integration, rhythmical structure, and attentional time-sharing. Within these principles there are both typical individual differences-influences of emotionality, thought speed, and psychoactive drugs-and atypical differences in individuals affected with certain clinical disorders (e.g., autism, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia). This review summarizes recent behavioral and neurobiological findings and provides a theoretical framework for considering how changes in the properties of the internal clock impact time perception and other psychological domains.

AB  - Salt marshes are widely distributed and most productive ecosystems in the temperate zones on the globe. These areas perform vital ecological functions and are populated mainly by halophytes-plants that are able to survive and reproduce in environments with exceptionally high salt concentrations. In salt marshes, in addition to tolerating high salt concentrations, salt marsh halophytes have to cope with damages caused by multiple anthropgenic pressures including metal and metalloid pollution. Extensive studies have been performed aiming at exploring naturally occurring endemic salt marsh halophytes with extraordinary potential for metals and metalloids remediation. However, a knowledge gap is perceptible on the basics of salt marsh halophyte adaptation/tolerance to the joint action of damaging factors such as high concentration of salt and presence of metals-metalloids. In light of available literature, the current paper is critical in: (i) highlighting ecological significance of salt marsh halophytes and their use as bioindicators or biomonitors of metal-metalloid pollution; (ii) analyzing salt marsh halophyte significant contributions for metal-and metalloid-remediation processes; (iii) overviewing salt marsh halophytes-microbes interaction influence on metal-phytoremediation processes; and (iv) cross-talking important physiological/biochemical strategies adopted by salt marsh halophytes for salinity-, metal-, and metalloid-tolerance. Conclusively, the paper highlights important aspects so far less explored in the context of salt marsh halophyte services to metal-metalloid remediation and underlying mechanisms. The discussion will enable researchers and environmentalists to set further exhaustive studies aiming at efficient and sustainable management of rapidly mounting salt marshes metal-metalloid contamination issues.

AB  - Seizures are complex phenomena spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales, from ion dynamics to communication between brain regions, from milliseconds (spikes) to days (interseizure intervals). Because of the existence of such multiple scales, the experimental evaluation of the mechanisms underlying the initiation, propagation, and termination of epileptic seizures is a difficult problem. Theoretical models and numerical simulations provide new tools to investigate seizure mechanisms at multiple scales. In this chapter, we review different theoretical approaches and their contributions to our understanding of seizure mechanisms.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of a-synuclein protein in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing support cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is the most lipid-rich organ in the body and disordered metabolism of various lipid constituents is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. alpha-Synuclein is a 17 kDa protein with a close association to lipid membranes and biosynthetic processes in the CNS, yet its precise function is a matter of speculation, particularly in oligodendrocytes. alpha-Synuclein aggregation in neurons is a well-characterized feature of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Epidemiological evidence and in vitro studies of alpha-synuclein molecular dynamics suggest that disordered lipid homeostasis may play a role in the pathogenesis of alpha-synuclein aggregation. However, MSA is distinct from other a-synucleinopathies in a number of respects, not least the disparate cellular focus of alpha-synuclein pathology. The recent identification of causal mutations and polymorphisms in COQ2, a gene encoding a biosynthetic enzyme for the production of the lipid-soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10 ( ubiquinone), puts membrane transporters as central to MSA pathogenesis, although how such transporters are involved in the early myelin degeneration observed in MSA remains unclear. The purpose of this review is to bring together available evidence to explore the potential role of membrane transporters and lipid dyshomeostasis in the pathogenesis of a-synuclein aggregation in MSA. We hypothesize that dysregulation of the specialized lipid metabolism involved in myelin synthesis and maintenance by oligodendrocytes underlies the unique neuropathology of MSA.

AB  - Metallothioneins (MT) are a family of proteins actively involved in metal detoxification and storage as well as in prevention of free-radical damage. Changes in the levels of MT have been described in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion protein disease, Binswanger type of subcortical vascular dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This suggests that MT functions might be more complex and vast than what was initially thought. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the potential involvement of MT in the mentioned neurodegenerative diseases while also discussing the emerging evidence proposing MT modulation as a feasible therapeutic approach. Enhancing repair mechanisms after neurological damage and/or protection against oxidative stress through a proper modulation of this family of protein might indeed represent an important avenue to cope neurodegeneration.

AB  - This paper presents a narrative review of psychological treatments for hypochondriasis and health anxiety. An extensive literature search encompassing publications in the English language yields over 40 case reports and systematic studies on mainly cognitive and behavioral interventions. After a brief introduction of the types of intervention, a summary of recent studies is given, and their methodological and clinical status are being discussed. It is concluded that there is a general evidence for psychological treatments (in particular cognitive-behavioral interventions) to be effective in reducing hypochondriacal symptoms. However, since most studies possess methodological flaws, their results should be interpreted with care.

AB  - Objectives. Currently, there are no guidelines for when to use an antiepileptic drug (AED) in nonepileptic panic disorder (PD) patients. We conducted this review to ascertain what guidance available literature can provide as to when to consider AEDs for PD patients. Methods. The primary data sources were PubMed and Google-Scholars. Search was limited to "English" and "Humans". Only papers addressing use of nonbenzodiazepine AEDs in PD were included. Data regarding study subjects, the AED utilized, and clinical responses were collected. EEG data were used to classify reports of patients with abnormal versus those with normal and/or no EEG work-up. Results. Ten reports were identified for use of AEDs in PD patients with abnormal EEGs with a total of 20 patients (17 responders). None of the 10 reports were controlled studies. Eighteen reports were identified for use of AEDs in panic patients with either normal EEGs or unselected groups (no EEG work-up). Out of the 18 reports, three were controlled studies. Included in the 18 studies were 253 patients (137 responders). Conclusions. We preliminary concluded that EEG work-up could be useful in guiding the treatment in PD as an abnormal EEG may be indicative of a higher likelihood of a positive response to an AED.

AB  - Objective: Neuroimaging techniques have begun to elucidate the neurophysiology of bipolar disorder (BPD). Several features of BPD have hindered understanding of how mood-state changes are reflected in changes in brain physiology. Longitudinal studies have advantages in isolating state-related changes and in studying the instability, inherent in these disorders, that gives rise to pathological mood states.
   Methods: To assess the state of the art in longitudinal neuroimaging studies in BPD, we conducted a literature review, searching MEDLINE for articles that included the key words bipolar disorder and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or emission tomography. The search was limited to studies with multiple subjects at two distinct and defined mood states. This search yielded eight MRS studies, four functional MRI studies, and three positron emission tomography studies.
   Results: Although longitudinally designed studies allow for the isolation of biomarkers of mood state (including euthymia), the current literature is hampered by a lack of replication between studies.
   Conclusions: The current body of longitudinal BPD imaging studies is heterogeneous and incomplete, and does not lend itself to the construction of an explanatory model of mood-state transitions. Drawing on extant studies, we propose a hypothetical framework for future experiments combining multimodal imaging with a longitudinal study design.

AB  - Adenosine and adenosine receptors (ARs) are increasingly recognized as important therapeutic targets for controlling cognition under normal and disease conditions for its dual roles of neuromodulation as well as of homeostatic function in the brain. This chapter first presents the unique ability of adenosine, by acting on the inhibitory A(1) and facilitating A(2A) receptor, to integrate dopamine, glutamate, and BNDF signaling and to modulate synaptic plasticity (e.g., long-term potentiation and long-term depression) in brain regions relevant to learning and memory, providing the molecular and cellular bases for adenosine receptor (AR) control of cognition. This led to the demonstration of AR modulation of social recognition memory, working memory, reference memory, reversal learning, goal-directed behavior/habit formation, Pavlovian fear conditioning, and effort-related behavior. Furthermore, human and animal studies support that AR activity can also, through cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection, reverse cognitive Impairments in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia. Lastly, epidemiological evidence indicates that regular human consumption of caffeine, the most widely used psychoactive drug and nonselective AR antagonists, is associated with the reduced cognitive decline in aging and AD patients, and with the reduced risk in developing PD. Thus, there is a convergence of the molecular studies revealing AR as molecular targets for integrating neurotransmitter signaling and controlling synaptic plasticity, with animal studies demonstrating the strong procognitive impact upon AR antagonism in normal and disease brains and with epidemiological and clinical evidences in support of caffeine and AR drugs for therapeutic modulation of cognition. Since some of adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists are already in phase III clinical trials for motor benefits in PD patients with remarkable safety profiles, additional animal and human studies to better understand the mechanism underlying the AR-mediated control of cognition under normal and disease conditions will provide the required rationale to stimulate the necessary clinical investigation to rapidly translate adenosine and AR drug as a novel strategy to control memory impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Many cerebellar models use a form of synaptic plasticity that implements decorrelation learning. Parallel fibers carrying signals positively correlated with climbing-fiber input have their synapses weakened (long-term depression), whereas those carrying signals negatively correlated with climbing input have their synapses strengthened (long-term potentiation). Learning therefore ceases when all parallel-fiber signals have been decorrelated from climbing-fiber input. This is a computationally powerful rule for supervised learning and can be cast in a spike-timing dependent plasticity form for comparison with experimental evidence. Decorrelation learning is particularly well suited to sensory prediction, for example, in the reafference problem where external sensory signals are interfered with by reafferent signals from the organism's own movements, and the required circuit appears similar to the one found to mediate classical eye blink conditioning. However, for certain stimuli, avoidance is a much better option than simple prediction, and decorrelation learning can also be used to acquire appropriate avoidance movements. One example of a stimulus to be avoided is retinal slip that degrades visual processing, and decorrelation learning appears to play a role in the vestibulo-ocular reflex that stabilizes gaze in the face of unpredicted head movements. Decorrelation learning is thus suitable for both sensory prediction and motor control. It may also be well suited for generic spatial and temporal coordination, because of its ability to remove the unwanted side effects of movement. Finally, because it can be used with any kind of time-varying signal, the cerebellum could play a role in cognitive processing.

   Design/methodology/approach - The authors provide an overview of the findings of neurobiological studies conducted in the last five years. Publications chosen for review were found using Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus search engines.
   Findings - Data in the literature reveal that psychopathy is associated with brain abnormalities in frontal and temporo-limbic regions, i.e. regions responsible for moral decision making, emotional processing and learning. Additionally, interactions between the brain areas have been identified as crucial for the development of psychopathic personality traits. Research findings suggest that the flow of impulses between the frontal cortex and temporo-limbic structures in psychopaths is significantly hindered.
   Originality/value - The current paper provides an in-depth review of most recent neurobiological studies inquiring into brain abnormalities associated with psychopathic personality traits. Moreover, a particular attention has been paid to identifying abnormalities in brain structures not previously studied in relation to psychopathy (e.g. mirror neuron system, white matter connections).

AB  - Climate change is affecting Canada's boreal zone, which includes most of the country's managed forests. The impacts of climate change in this zone are expected to be pervasive and will require adaptation of Canada's forest management system. This paper reviews potential climate change adaptation actions and strategies for the forest management system, considering current and projected climate change impacts and their related vulnerabilities. These impacts and vulnerabilities include regional increases in disturbance rates, regional changes in forest productivity, increased variability in timber supply, decreased socioeconomic resilience, and increased severity of safety and health issues for forest communities. Potential climate change adaptation actions of the forest management system are categorized as those that reduce nonclimatic stressors, those that reduce sensitivity to climate change, or those that maintain or enhance adaptive capacity in the biophysical and human subsystems of the forest management system. Efficient adaptation of the forest management system will revolve around the inclusion of risk management in planning processes, the selection of robust, diversified, and no-regret adaptation actions, and the adoption of an adaptive management framework. Monitoring is highlighted as a no-regret action that is central to the implementation of adaptive forest management.

KW  - Sex trafficking
KW  - T-Visa
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore and expand the legal discussion on T-Visa requirements and how it can be better structured to provide support for victims of sex trafficking that suffer from severe mental health injuries.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted extensive US legal and sociological research compiling human trafficking mental health report data, primarily conducted in Europe. Based on these finding, the authors interviewed practitioners in the legal field to verify assumed legal hurdles. Once validated the author's attempted to address and design an equitable approach towards mitigating the demonstrated legal shortfall.
   Findings - There is a dearth of US research on mental health trauma survivors of trafficking endure. This void prevents the legal system from adequately addressing likely outcomes suffered by the victims of this crime and prevents policy makers from structuring legal requirements equitably. Policy makers often need concrete examples of problems before reacting. This paper attempts to demonstrate how the current T-Visa requirements fail to fully recognize mental health injuries of sex trafficking and begins to provide a pathway to balance.
   Originality/value - While the statistical data was previously conducted by outside sources, the legal analysis is completely original by the author's and is likely to have a very high value to policy makers when addressing these issues. This paper also highlights the need for a more robust research program into human trafficking and mental health injuries within the US so that many of the analogies and assumptions can be supported.

AB  - Background: Indigenous young people have significantly higher suicide rates than their non-indigenous counterparts. There is a need for culturally appropriate and effective suicide prevention programs for this demographic. Aims: This review assesses suicide prevention programs that have been evaluated for indigenous youth in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Method: The databases MEDLENE and PsycINFO were searched for publications on suicide prevention programs targeting indigenous youth that include reports on evaluations and outcomes. Program content, indigenous involvement, evaluation design, program implementation, and outcomes were assessed for each article. Results: The search yielded 229 articles; 90 abstracts were assessed, and 11 articles describing nine programs were reviewed. Two Australian programs and seven American programs were included. Programs were culturally tailored, flexible, and incorporated multiple-levels of prevention. No randomized controlled trials were found, and many programs employed ad hoc evaluations, poor program description, and no process evaluation. Conclusion: Despite culturally appropriate content, the results of the review indicate that more controlled study designs using planned evaluations and valid outcome measures are needed in research on indigenous youth suicide prevention. Such changes may positively influence the future of research on indigenous youth suicide prevention as the outcomes and efficacy will be more reliable.

AB  - According to theories of psychological defense, humans are motivated to protect themselves against various types of psychological threat, including death awareness, uncertainty, and other inherently anxiety-provoking experiences. Protective mechanisms include strengthening close relationships; maintaining appraisals of self-worth, accomplishment, and agency; and cultivating meaningful views of the world. Thus, defensiveness theories incorporate research from many areas of psychology (e.g., information-processing biases, attitudes, and interpersonal and intergroup relations), to help explain why people think, feel, and act in the diverse ways that they do. Currently, the study of psychological defense is hindered by contradictory empirical results and a proliferation of theories that make very similar predictions. This article examines a cross-section of defensiveness theories and research, highlighting conclusions that can be drawn and areas where conceptual and research problems linger. It suggests that the field needs methodological innovation (e.g., more reliable and valid manipulations and measures of unconscious constructs, more diverse methodological approaches), a more complete and reliable body of data, and some fresh new ideas from psychological scientists across disciplines.

AB  - This review aimed to explore the evidence base of psychodynamic therapy for personality disorder (PD). A systematic approach was applied to the literature search with the use of a clear inclusion/exclusion criteria and a quality assessment checklist. Nineteen studies investigating the use of psychodynamic therapy for PD were reviewed. Four randomised controlled trials (RCT) demonstrated superior results for psychodynamic therapy compared with another type of therapy, two RCTs found that cognitive-based therapies were superior and one RCT found no difference between therapies for PD. Another seven RCTs found positive results for psychodynamic therapies compared with a treatment as usual condition (n = 3) or another dynamic therapy (n = 4). Five non-RCTs were included with mixed findings for treating PD with psychodynamic therapy. Many of the included studies focusing on psychodynamic-based therapies with borderline personality disorder had positive outcomes, and concentrated on mentalisation-based therapy and transference-focused therapy. There were good outcomes for short-and long-term psychodynamic therapies with individuals with PD. Implications for developing services for treating PD are discussed. Research that addresses methodological issues and increases understanding of the ingredients of change in psychodynamic therapy for PD is also recommended.

AB  - Since the Industrial Revolution, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) has been increasing and global ocean surface waters have absorbed 30% of the anthropogenic CO2 released into the atmosphere. An increase in pCO(2) in surface ocean waters causes an increase in bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) and protons (H+) and a decrease in carbonate ions (CO32-),thereby decreasing the pH and the saturation state of the seawater with respect to CO32-. These changes in ocean chemistry (termed ocean acidification) are expected to have negative impacts on marine calcifying organisms. Because calcifying marine primary producers are important to the carbon cycle and rocky shore habitat structure and stability, investigating how they will respond to future oceanic pCO(2) levels is a relevant and important topic of research. Due to a recent strong increase in the number of studies investigating the responses of calcifying marine macroalgae to elevated pCO(2), this review aims to present the state of knowledge on the response of calcifying macroalgae to ocean acidification alone and in combination with global and local stressors. We discuss the physiological responses of calcifying macroalgae to elevated pCO(2) within the contexts biogeo graphy, taxonomy, and calcification mechanisms. Generally, coralline algae that deposit high-Mg calcite are most susceptible to high pCO(2), and polar species are particularly at risk. However, some dolomite-depositing species may be able to acclimate to high pCO(2). Calcifiers generally show sensitivity to overgrowth and outcompetition by noncalcifying algae when grown under elevated CO2 conditions, and this trend could be amplified under conditions of high inorganic nutrients. However, it still remains unknown whether or not calcifiers will be able to adapt to their rapidly changing environments. We discuss the lack of research on this topic, and provide some suggestions for how this knowledge gap can be filled by future research.

AB  - Sulfide intrusion in seagrasses, as assessed by stable sulfur isotope signals, is widespread in all climate zones, where seagrasses are growing. Seagrasses can incorporate substantial amounts of S-34-depleted sulfide into their tissues with up to 87% of the total sulfur in leaves derived from sedimentary sulfide. Correlations between delta S-34 in leaves, rhizomes, and roots show that sedimentary sulfide is entering through the roots, either in the form of sulfide or sulfate, and translocated to the rhizomes and the leaves. The total sulfur content of the seagrasses increases as the proportion of sedimentary sulfide in the plant increases, and accumulation of elemental sulfur (S-0) inside the plant with delta S-34 values similar to the sedimentary sulfide suggests that S-0 is an important reoxidation product of the sedimentary sulfide. The accumulation of S-0 can, however, not account for the increase in sulfur in the tissue, and other sulfur containing compounds such as thiols, organic sulfur, and sulfate contribute to the accumulated sulfur pool. Experimental studies with seagrasses exposed to environmental and biological stressors show decreasing delta S-34 in the tissues along with reduction in growth parameters, suggesting that sulfide intrusion can affect seagrass performance.

AB  - The association between wind turbines and health effects is highly debated. Some argue that reported health effects are related to wind turbine operation [electromagnetic fields (EMF), shadow flicker, audible noise, low-frequency noise, infrasound]. Others suggest that when turbines are sited correctly, effects are more likely attributable to a number of subjective variables that result in an annoyed/stressed state. In this review, we provide a bibliographic-like summary and analysis of the science around this issue specifically in terms of noise (including audible, low-frequency noise, and infrasound), EMF, and shadow flicker. Nowthere are roughly 60 scientific peer-reviewed articles on this issue. The available scientific evidence suggests that EMF, shadow flicker, low-frequency noise, and infrasound from wind turbines are not likely to affect human health; some studies have found that audible noise from wind turbines can be annoying to some. Annoyance may be associated with some self-reported health effects (e.g., sleep disturbance) especially at sound pressure levels >40 dB(A). Because environmental noise above certain levels is a recognized factor in a number of health issues, siting restrictions have been implemented in many jurisdictions to limit noise exposure. These setbacks should help alleviate annoyance from noise. Subjective variables (attitudes and expectations) are also linked to annoyance and have the potential to facilitate other health complaints via the nocebo effect. Therefore, it is possible that a segment of the population may remain annoyed (or report other health impacts) even when noise limits are enforced. Based on the findings and scientific merit of the available studies, the weight of evidence suggests that when sited properly, wind turbines are not related to adverse health. Stemming from this review, we provide a number of recommended best practices for wind turbine development in the context of human health.

AB  - Stress alters adaptive behaviours such as learning and memory. Stressors can either enhance or diminish learning, memory formation and/or memory recall. We focus attention here on how environmentally relevant stressors alter learning, memory and forgetting in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. Operant conditioning of aerial respiration causes associative learning that may lead to long-term memory (LTM) formation. However, individual ecologically relevant stressors, combinations of stressors, and bio-active substances can alter whether or not learning occurs or memory forms. While the behavioural memory phenotype may be similar as a result of exposure to different stressors, how each stressor alters memory formation may occur differently. In addition, when a combination of stressors are presented it is difficult to predict ahead of time what the outcome will be regarding memory formation. Thus, how combinations of stressors act is an emergent property of how the snail perceives the stressors.

AB  - In living organisms production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is counterbalanced by their elimination and/or prevention of formation which in concert can typically maintain a steady-state (stationary) ROS level. However, this balance may be disturbed and lead to elevated ROS levels called oxidative stress. To our best knowledge, there is no broadly acceptable system of classification of oxidative stress based on its intensity due to which proposed here system may be helpful for interpretation of experimental data. Oxidative stress field is the hot topic in biology and, to date, many details related to ROS-induced damage to cellular components, ROS-based signaling, cellular responses and adaptation have been disclosed. However, it is common situation when researchers experience substantial difficulties in the correct interpretation of oxidative stress development especially when there is a need to characterize its intensity. Careful selection of specific biomarkers (ROS-modified targets) and some system may be helpful here. A classification of oxidative stress based on its intensity is proposed here. According to this classification there are four zones of function in the relationship between "Dose/concentration of inducer" and the measured "Endpoint": I - basal oxidative stress (BOS); II - low intensity oxidative stress (LOS); III - intermediate intensity oxidative stress (IOS); IV - high intensity oxidative stress (HOS). The proposed classification will be helpful to describe experimental data where oxidative stress is induced and systematize it based on its intensity, but further studies will be in need to clear discriminate between stress of different intensity.

AB  - Modeling the mechanisms that determine how humans and other agents choose among different behavioral and cognitive processesbe they strategies, routines, actions, or operatorsrepresents a paramount theoretical stumbling block across disciplines, ranging from the cognitive and decision sciences to economics, biology, and machine learning. By using the cognitive and decision sciences as a case study, we provide an introduction to what is also known as the strategy selection problem. First, we explain why many researchers assume humans and other animals to come equipped with a repertoire of behavioral and cognitive processes. Second, we expose three descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive challenges that are common to all disciplines which aim to model the choice among these processes. Third, we give an overview of different approaches to strategy selection. These include cost-benefit, ecological, learning, memory, unified, connectionist, sequential sampling, and maximization approaches. We conclude by pointing to opportunities for future research and by stressing that the selection problem is far from being resolved. (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Considerable overlap in diagnostic criteria and shared psychopathologic symptoms in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) have stimulated research activities in this field. Longitudinal studies have shown that BPD is frequently diagnosed in adult patients who had been diagnosed with ADHD in childhood. The question of whether ADHD and BPD randomly co-occur as comorbidities, have similar origins or share common pathological mechanisms remains unresolved. Some authors suggest that ADHD contributes to the development of BPD via various mechanisms, and therefore consider it a risk factor for later BPD development. In this article the evidence for the co-occurrence of these disorders will be reviewed as well as studies on their common genetic and environmental influences. Temperamental and developmental issues will be reviewed, and shared features such as impulsivity and emotion dysregulation discussed. From a therapeutic perspective, few studies have investigated psychotherapeutic treatment of the comorbid condition, though the issue is highly important to the management of patients suffering from both disorders. Some thought is given to how therapeutic methods and approaches can be modified to benefit patients, and to their possible succession.

AB  - Studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, animal models and pathogenic actions of genetic mutations that cause familial PD have established that neuronal bioenergetics are compromised with brainstem and midbrain monoaminergic neurons being particularly vulnerable. Peripheral insulin resistance and diabetes in midlife may increase the risk of PD, and diet and lifestyle changes that increase insulin sensitivity (exercise and intermittent energy restriction) can counteract neurodegenerative processes and improve functional outcome in animal models. Insulin sensitizing glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogs are beneficial in animal models of PD, and the results of an initial clinical trial in PD patients are promising. In addition to improving peripheral and brain energy metabolism, exercise, intermittent energy restriction and GLP-1 analogs may bolster neuronal adaptive stress response pathways that enhance neurotrophic signaling, DNA repair, proteostasis and mitochondrial biogenesis.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this review is to identify consistent themes among the qualitative literature on stigma as experienced by patients with schizophrenia receiving community mental health care. With the treatment focus of schizophrenia nowadays shifting more and more towards community-based mental health care, professionals need to be aware of the increased vulnerability of their clients in their social environment as a result of stigma towards their disease. In-depth knowledge on stigma is critical in order to offer a dignifying community mental health care.
   Methods A systematic search of the qualitative literature in Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO and Francis was performed to review the subjective experiences and ideas on stigma in outpatients with schizophrenia.
   Results Three major themes were identified in 18 studies and need to be taken into consideration when implementing an adequate community mental health care: (i) the continuing existence of stigma inherent in the health care setting, (ii) the importance of relational aspects of stigma encounters in daily life and (iii) the significance of the behavioural aspects related to previous stigma experiences and beliefs among patients.
   Conclusions Despite much effort in community treatment, patients still experience stigma and discrimination. Community mental health care professionals should not only be aware of structural problems in mental health care, but should also pay considerable attention towards the relational and behavioural aspects in their clients' life concerning stigma. Furthermore, they have the crucial role in the community to raise awareness about stigma in order to increase their clients' acceptance in society.

AB  - Orientation: To identify the effects of interventions in cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) on employment-related outcomes world-wide for individuals with mental illness.
   Research purpose: A search of the relevant literature was conducted through PsychInfo, Medline, Scopus and Google Scholar T, covering the period between 1995 and August 2011. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the criteria from Evidence Based Library and Information Practice (EBLIP). Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria.
   Motivation for the study: Evidence is needed on best practices to support work participation by people with mental illness. Effective cognitive-behavioural intervention might enhance their personal control over participation in employment aside from systemic or policy-oriented interventions.
   Research approach, design and method: A scoping review was done to map trends in the evidence for CBT as an intervention to support employment participation by people with mental illness. A scoping review is exploratory, the evidence of which lays the basis for subsequent studies. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the EBLIP Critical Appraisal Checklist.
   Main findings: Cognitive-behaviour therapy was an effective intervention approach for better work productivity, longer work hours, higher re-employment rate and enhanced mental health for individuals with mental illness.
   Practical/ managerial implications: Cognitive-behaviour therapy is a promising strategy for industrial and organisational psychologists dealing with people who have a mental illness. It enhances employment and maintains work adjustment. Additional clinical trials in diverse populations and contexts will further establish its efficacy.
   Contribution/value-add: This scoping review aggregated the preliminary evidence for the efficacy of cognitive-behaviour therapy as a work-participation intervention for people with mental illness.

TI  - Injustice to transsexual women in a hetero-normative healthcare system
AB  - Background: Transsexual women who are on the journey of sexual re-alignment will experience various health problems. These problems are related directly to the treatment regime that they are following in order to attain and maintain their physical embodiment as a woman. They are forced to negotiate a hetero-normative healthcare system in order to receive assistance and care for their health problems related to their sexual re-alignment process.
   Aim: The questions posed were: What are the unique health problems that transsexual women experience whilst on the journey of sexual re-alignment? What is the current context of the South African healthcare system in which transsexual women should negotiate healthcare? These questions were asked in order to explore the health problems with which transsexual women are faced and to describe the hetero-normative healthcare system in South Africa.
   Method: An electronic literature search was executed via the EBSCO host with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search words that were used were: Transsexual/s and Health/Healthcare. All studies had to be peer reviewed and published in the English language, from January 1972 up until February 2013. Literature on transsexual children was excluded.
   Results: Transsexual women have the potential to suffer significant side-effects from their sexual re-alignment treatment, including cardio-vascular problems, endocrine problems and mental ill-health. They are also vulnerable to HIV infection. They have poor access to quality holistic healthcare and this may lead an increase in the mortality and morbidity figures of women.
   Conclusion: A hetero-normative healthcare system has a negative impact on the health of transsexual women and will cause them to be marginalised. This could contribute to both homo and trans-phobia that will in turn strengthen the belief that transsexual women are un-African.

AB  - The discovery of allosteric modulators of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) provides a promising new strategy with potential for developing novel treatments for a variety of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Traditional drug discovery efforts targeting GPCRs have focused on developing ligands for orthosteric sites which bind endogenous ligands. Allosteric modulators target a site separate from the orthosteric site to modulate receptor function. These allosteric agents can either potentiate (positive allosteric modulator, PAM) or inhibit (negative allosteric modulator, NAM) the receptor response and often provide much greater subtype selectivity than orthosteric ligands for the same receptors. Experimental evidence has revealed more nuanced pharmacological modes of action of allosteric modulators, with some PAMs showing allosteric agonism in combination with positive allosteric modulation in response to endogenous ligand (ago-potentiators) as well as "bitopic" ligands that interact with both the allosteric and orthosteric sites. Drugs targeting the allosteric site allow for increased drug selectivity and potentially decreased adverse side effects. Promising evidence has demonstrated potential utility of a number of allosteric modulators of GPCRs in multiple CNS disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as psychiatric or neurobehavioral diseases such as anxiety, schizophrenia, and addiction.

AB  - The pathomechanism behind the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease involves damage to the dopaminergic and nondopaminergic systems with dysfunctioning of the dopaminergic-glutamatergic circuitry in the basal ganglional neural processing. Excitotoxicity may contribute markedly to neuronal damage and loss. Beside the cardinal motor signs of the disease, non-motor symptoms, including mental disturbances, are characteristic features of the clinical course. Affective or autonomic changes may precede motor symptoms. Neuroprotective drugs are not yet available. However, new modes of therapy targeting the defective dopaminergic-glutamatergic system might also be effective both for symptomatologic treatment and for neuroprotection. Alterations in the kynurenine pathway have been demonstrated in Parkinson's disease. Preclinical studies suggest that intervention in the kynurenine pathway may result in neuroprotection and additionally alleviate the symptoms through influencing the glutamatergic neurotransmission.

AB  - Seafarers experience a lot of job-related risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Considering the healthy-worker effect due to the biennial pre-employment examination and the periodical medical fitness tests, a (slightly) elevated risk for CVD among seafarers is assumed compared to the reference population ashore. In seafaring, the most important, influenceable risk factors for CVD refer to the ship-specific stress situation, the malnutrition and the lack of exercises on board. Furthermore, the prognosis of acute severe CVD often depends on the measures taken in the first few hours after occurrence of the symptoms. Owing to the lack of health professionals on board and the limited treatment options of events at sea, effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation is often delayed and the outcome of cardiac events is worse compared to that ashore.

AB  - Data is progressively and robustly accumulating regarding the biological basis of autism. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are currently considered a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with onset very early in life and a complex, heterogeneous, multifactorial aetiology. A comprehensive search of the last five years of the Medline database was conducted in order to summarize recent evidence on the neurobiological bases of autism. The main findings on genetic influence, neuropathology, neurostructure and brain networks are summarized. In addition, findings from peripheral samples of subjects with autism and animal models, which show immune, oxidative, mitochondrial dysregulations, are reported. Then, other biomarkers from very different systems associated with autism are reported. Finally, an attempt is made to try and integrate the available evidence, which points to a oligogenetic, multifactorial aetiology that converges in an aberrant micro-organization of the cortex, with abnormal functioning of the synapses and abnormalities in very general physiological pathways (such as inflammatory, immune and redox systems).

AB  - Strong evidence of considerable plasticity in primary sensory areas in the adult cortex, and of dramatic cross-modal reorganization in visual areas, after short- or long-term visual deprivation has recently been reported. In the context of patient rehabilitation, this scientifically challenging topic takes on urgent clinical relevance, especially given the lack of information about the role of such reorganization on spared or newly emerged visual performance. Amongst the most common visual field defects found upon unilateral occipital damage of the primary visual cortex is homonymous hemianopia (HH), a perfectly symmetric loss of vision in both eyes. Traditionally, geniculostriate lesions were considered to result in complete and permanent visual loss in the topographically related area of the visual field (Huber, 1997). However, numerous studies in monkeys, and later, in humans, have demonstrated that despite destruction of the striate cortex, or even following a hemispherectomy, some patients retain a certain degree of unconscious visual function, known as blindsight. Accordingly, there have recently been attempts to restore visual function in patients by stimulating unconscious preserved blindsight capacities. Herein we review different visual rehabilitation techniques designed for brain-damaged patients with visual field loss. We discuss the hypothesis that explicit (conscious) visual detection can be restored in the blind visual field by harnessing implicit (unconscious) visual capacities. The results that we summarize here underline the need for early diagnosis of cortical visual impairment (CVI), and the urgency in rehabilitating such deficits, in these patients. Based on the research precedent, we explore the link between implicit (unconscious) vision and conscious perception and discuss possible mechanisms of adaptation and plasticity in the visual cortex.

AB  - Self-consciousness is the remarkable human experience of being a subject: the "I". Self-consciousness is typically bound to a body, and particularly to the spatial dimensions of the body, as well as to its location and displacement in the gravitational field. Because the vestibular system encodes head position and movement in three-dimensional space, vestibular cortical processing likely contributes to spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness. We review here recent data showing vestibular effects on first-person perspective (the feeling from where "I" experience the world) and self-location (the feeling where "I" am located in space). We compare these findings to data showing vestibular effects on mental spatial transformation, self-motion perception, and body representation showing vestibular contributions to various spatial representations of the body with respect to the external world. Finally, we discuss the role for four posterior brain regions that process vestibular and other multisensory signals to encode spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness: temporoparietal junction, parietoinsular vestibular cortex, ventral intraparietal region, and medial superior temporal region. We propose that vestibular processing in these cortical regions is critical in linking multisensory signals from the body (personal and peripersonal space) with external (extrapersonal) space. Therefore, the vestibular system plays a critical role for neural representations of spatial aspects of bodily self-consciousness.

AB  - Background: For many years, studies have confirmed that there is a high prevalence of addiction amongst seafarers. The effect of this is even more serious when one considers their isolated and even hostile living environment presenting risks which require vigilance and rapid reactions. The purpose of this article is to determine the extent of knowledge about addiction among seafarers.
   Materials and methods: This is a review of the literature between 1993 and 2013 with respect to the prevalence of consumption of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and other drugs amongst seafarers. Total prevalence was calculated using the virtual population represented by the subjects of each article, when drug consumption definition was the same between articles and when mariners studied were different.
   Results: 63.1% (range 38.4-96.3%) of seafarers smoked tobacco. 14.5% (range 8.8-75%) of seafarers drank alcohol. 3.4% (range 9-45%) had used cannabis during the previous month. Few studies concerned other drugs; 3-10% of seafarers used drugs on board.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of tobacco and alcohol consumption amongst seafarers was higher than that in the general population. Further studies on the use of drugs at work would be valuable for this population who are subject to significant occupational risk.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders affect almost 30 million individuals leading to disability and death. These disorders are characterized by pathological changes in disease-specific areas of the brain and degeneration of distinct neuron subsets. Despite the differences in clinical manifestations and neuronal vulnerability, the pathological processes appear similar, suggesting common neurodegenerative pathways. Apoptosis seems to play a key role in the progression of several neurologic disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as demonstrated by studies on animal models and cell lines. On the other hand, research on human brains reported contradictory results. However, many dying neurons have been detected in brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and these conditions are often associated with significant cell loss accompanied by typical morphological features of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and activation of cysteine-proteases, caspases. Cell death and neurodegenerative conditions have been linked to oxidative stress and imbalance between generation of free radicals and antioxidant defenses. Multiple sclerosis, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. Here we present an overview of the involvement of neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress in the most important neurodegenerative diseases, mainly focusing the attention on several genetic disorders, discussing the interaction between primary genetic abnormalities and the apoptotic pathways.

AB  - This paper aims to review longitudinal studies assessing the impact of cognition on function in patients with schizophrenia. PubMed and Scholars Portal were searched using search terms related to schizophrenia, cognition, function, and longitudinal studies. Some functional abilities have been studied more than others. Some studies suggest that the impact of cognition on function depends on the severity of baseline cognitive deficits. Other studies suggest that the impact of cognition on function depend on what phase of the illness the patient is in or what stage in that particular function the patient is involved in. Finally, few studies assessed interactions between cognition and other aspects of schizophrenia in predicting function, such as functional capacity, insight, motivation, and negative symptoms. More longitudinal and comprehensive studies are needed. A focus on community living is of high public significance as patients with schizophrenia continue to grow old. Future studies should also focus on the longitudinal interactions between cognition and other dimensions of schizophrenia as well as on the biological factors that underlie these interactions.

AB  - Under stress conditions, many species of bacteria enter into starvation mode of metabolism or a physiologically viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state. Several human pathogenic bacteria have been reported to enter into the VBNC state under these conditions. The pathogenic VBNC bacteria cannot be grown using conventional culture media, although they continue to retain their viability and express their virulence. Though there have been debates on the VBNC concept in the past, several molecular studies have shown that not only can the VBNC state be induced under in vitro conditions but also that resuscitation from this state is possible under appropriate conditions. The most notable advance in resuscitating VBNC bacteria is the discovery of resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf), which is a bacterial cytokines found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. VBNC state is a survival strategy adopted by the bacteria, which has important implication in several fields, including environmental monitoring, food technology, and infectious disease management; and hence it is important to investigate the association of bacterial pathogens under VBNC state and the water/foodborne outbreaks. In this review, we describe various aspects of VBNC bacteria, which include their proteomic and genetic profiles under the VBNC state, conditions of resuscitation, methods of detection, antibiotic resistance, and observations on Rpf.

AB  - In Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies, chronic neurodegeneration occurs within different areas of the central nervous system leading to progressive motor and nonmotor symptoms. The symptomatic treatment options that are currently available do not slow or halt disease progression. This highlights the need of a better understanding of disease mechanisms and disease models. The generation of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus and in the subventricular zone/olfactory bulb system is affected by many different regulators and possibly involved in memory processing, depression, and olfaction, symptoms which commonly occur in PD. The pathology of the adult neurogenic niches in human PD patients is still mostly elusive, but different preclinical models have shown profound alterations of adult neurogenesis. Alterations in stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival as well as neurite outgrowth and spine formation have been related to different aspects in PD pathogenesis. Therefore, neurogenesis in the adult brain provides an ideal model to study disease mechanisms and compounds. In addition, adult newborn neurons have been proposed as a source of endogenous repair. Herein, we review current knowledge about the adult neurogenic niches in PD and highlight areas of future research.

AB  - Elevated number of parental Communication Deviance (CD) has been connected with psychiatric and thought disorders in their offspring. However, no earlier systematic efforts have been made to review this issue. The aim of this study was to survey the existing literature systematically and perform a meta-analysis of this association. A literature search for published and unpublished observational studies on the association of parental Communication Deviance with psychopathology in the offspring was conducted. Multiple electronic databases were searched (from 1960 to 2012) and the reference lists of the resulting publications were scanned. The findings were pooled using random effect meta-analysis. A total of 19 relevant papers were found and accessed. The results showed that a high level of parental CD is associated with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the offspring. A large overall effect size (0.79) was found in the meta-analysis. No meta-analysis could be performed on the association of parental CD with an offspring's thought disorders, but the results suggest that such an association may exist. Parental Communication Deviance is associated with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the offspring. High parental CD could be treated as an indicator of a risk of developing a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, at least among high-risk groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. Comorbid psychiatric disorders are frequent among patients affected by tinnitus. There are mutual clinical influences between tinnitus and psychiatric disorders, as well as neurobiological relations based on partially overlapping hodological and neuroplastic phenomena. The aim of the present paper is to review the evidence of alterations in brain networks underlying tinnitus physiopathology and to discuss them in light of the current knowledge of the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders. Methods. Relevant literature was identified through a search on Medline and PubMed; search terms included tinnitus, brain, plasticity, cortex, network, and pathways. Results. Tinnitus phenomenon results from systemic-neurootological triggers followed by neuronal remapping within several auditory and nonauditory pathways. Plastic reorganization and white matter alterations within limbic system, arcuate fasciculus, insula, salience network, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, auditory pathways, ffrontocortical, and thalamocortical networks are discussed. Discussion. Several overlapping brain network alterations do exist between tinnitus and psychiatric disorders. Tinnitus, initially related to a clinicoanatomical approach based on a cortical localizationism, could be better explained by an holistic or associationist approach considering psychic functions and tinnitus as emergent properties of partially overlapping large-scale neural networks.

AB  - Seafarer's mental health is vital for a well-functioning organisation. Neglecting mental health status on board could be extremely costly for both the crew affected as well as the company. The present article outlines an extensive programme implemented in the Royal Norwegian Navy for personnel deployed in international operations. The challenges involved in international operations bare similarities to onboard personnel in civilian maritime operations.
   The program utilised by the Royal Norwegian Navy is extensive and not immediately applicable to civilian maritime companies. However, elements of this program could be used with limited resources. Questionnaire based screening, before, during and at the end of a contract period could result in early detections of mental health problems and increased retaining of personnel. This should be done by health professionals. Early targeting of at risk personnel could prevent serious costs for the individual as well as the company.

AB  - Sleep disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are very common and have an immense negative impact on their quality of life. Insomnia, daytime sleepiness with sleep attacks, restless-legs syndrome (RLS) and REM-sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) are the most frequent sleep disorders in PD. Neurodegenerative processes within sleep regulatory brain circuitries, antiparkinsonian (e. g., levodopa and dopamine agonists) and concomitant medication (e. g., antidepressants) as well as comorbidities or other non-motor symptoms (such as depression) are discussed as causative factors. For the diagnosis of sleep disturbances we recommend regular screening using validated questionnaires such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) or the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS), for evaluating daytime sleepiness we would suggest to use the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the inappropriate sleep composite score (ISCS) or the Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS). All of these questionnaires should be used in combination with a detailed medical history focusing on common sleep disorders and medication. If necessary, patients should be referred to sleep specialists or sleep laboratories for further investigations. Management of sleep disorders in PD patients usually starts with optimization of (dopaminergic) antiparkinsonian therapy followed by specific treatment of the sleep disturbances. Aside from these clinical issues of sleep disorders in PD, the concept of REM-sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) as an early sign for emerging neurodegenerative diseases is of pivotal interest for future research on biomarkers and neuroprotective treatment strategies of neurodegenerative diseases, and particularly PD.

It has been shown that physical complaints can be efficiently reduced via learning and cognitive processes (conditioning and expectancies). However, despite evidence demonstrating a large variety of physiological similarities between pain and itch, the possible transfer of the analgesic placebo model to itch has not yet been widely discussed in research. This review therefore aims at highlighting potential transfers of placebo mechanisms to itch processes by demonstrating the therapeutic issues in pharmacological treatments for pruritus on a physiological basis and by discussing the impact of psychological mechanisms and psychological factors influencing itch sensations.

AB  - Background: The homeostasis and physiological role of iron in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been debated for decades. Overall, it has been difficult to reach a consensus to prove marked disease-associated changes in the iron content of the AD brain, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
   Objectives: We sought to contribute to resolve this issue by quantifying the iron content in serum, CSF, and sub-regions of the AD brain.
   Methods: We conducted a comprehensive systematic meta-analysis and review of multiple observational studies till October 2013 that investigated the iron content in AD serum, CSF, or brain tissue.
   Results: 2,556 publications were screened. Forty-three eligible studies with 1,813 AD patients and 2,401 healthy controls were identified. Twenty-one studies investigated the serum iron in AD while seven and nineteen studies investigated the CSF iron and various brain regions iron respectively. Our meta-analysis showed that serum iron was significant lower in AD than healthy controls. CSF iron appeared not to be affected by AD although more studies are required due to the relative small number of CSF studies reported to date. We critically analyzed iron content in twelve selective brain regions by separated meta-analyses using cross-referenced statistical methods. We found that eight specific brain regions had higher iron concentrations that correlated with the clinical diagnosis of AD in a statistically validated manner.
   Conclusions: These data provided rigorous statistical support for the model that iron homeostasis was changed in AD patients, including the finding of lower iron in their serum and evidence for iron overload in several specific brain regions.

AB  - Abiotic stress is one of the primary constraints limiting the range and success of arthropods, and nowhere is this more apparent than Antarctica. Antarctic arthropods have evolved a suite of adaptations to cope with extremes in temperature and water availability. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the environmental physiology of terrestrial arthropods in Antarctica. To survive low temperatures, mites and Collembola are freeze-intolerant and rely on deep supercooling, in some cases supercooling below -30 degrees C. Also, some of these microarthropods are capable of cryoprotective dehydration to extend their supercooling capacity and reduce the risk of freezing. In contrast, the two best-studied Antarctic insects, the midges Belgica antarctica and Eretmoptera murphyi, are freeze-tolerant year-round and rely on both seasonal and rapid cold-hardening to cope with decreases in temperature. A common theme among Antarctic arthropods is extreme tolerance of dehydration; some accomplish this by cuticular mechanisms to minimize water loss across their cuticle, while a majority have highly permeable cuticles but tolerate upwards of 50-70% loss of body water. Molecular studies of Antarctic arthropod stress physiology are still in their infancy, but several recent studies are beginning to shed light on the underlying mechanisms that govern extreme stress tolerance. Some common themes that are emerging include the importance of cuticular and cytoskeletal rearrangements, heat shock proteins, metabolic restructuring and cell recycling pathways as key mediators of cold and water stress in the Antarctic.

AB  - Background: The possible link between creativity and psychopathology has been a long-time focus of research up to the present day. However, the research results in this field are heterogeneous and contradictory. Links between creativity and specific psychiatric disorders have been confirmed and refuted in different studies. This disparity is partly explained by the methodological challenges peculiar to this field. Methods: In this systematic review of the literature from 1950, research articles in the field of creativity and psychopathology are presented, focusing on the methodology and results of the collected studies. Results:This review confirms the methodological problems and the heterogeneity of the study designs and results. The assessment of psychopathology, but more so of creativity, remains a fundamental challenge. On the whole, study results cautiously confirm an association between creativity and both bipolar disorder and schizotypy. Conclusion: The research on creativity and psychopathology is hampered by serious methodological problems. Study results are to be interpreted with caution and future research needs more methodological rigor. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background
   The present review summarizes published papers reporting the results of both open-label and double-blind studies, which explored the potential efficacy of antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN).
   Methods
   The literature was sourced from recent searches on Pubmed updated to January 2013 using the terms "eating disorders", "pharmacotherapy", "anorexia nervosa", "bulimia nervosa", "therapy" or "treatment". Studies were selected for inclusion if they met a level of evidence that minimized the risk of bias such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or systematic review of RCTs.
   Results
   This critical review seems to suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have a proven efficacy in BN. An-tipsychotics seem to be potentially promising options in the treatment of severe adult and adolescent AN patients, revealing positive psychopathological effects and good tolerability. Other treatments, such as the anticonvulsant topiramate in BN, may be promising.
   Conclusion
   Even if there have been useful researches on the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of BN, there are still many unsolved issues regarding the optimal management of other EDs. Future directions for pharmacological treatment researches in EDs should include randomized controlled trials with different medications, inpatient versus outpatient trials and the assessment of medication effects for relapse prevention in recovered patients.

AB  - Objective: To review information regarding the association of physical activity (PA) with quality of life (QoL) in the elderly and to identify the study designs and measurement instruments most commonly used in its assessment, in the period 2000-2012.
   Methods: Relevant articles were identified by a search of four electronic databases and cross-reference lists and by contact with the authors of the included manuscripts. Original studies on the association between PA and QoL in individuals aged 60 years or older were examined. The quality of studies as well as the direction and the consistency of the association between PA and QoL were evaluated.
   Results: A total of 10,019 articles were identified as potentially relevant, but only 42 (0.42%) met the inclusion criteria and were retrieved and examined. Most studies demonstrated a positive association between PA and QoL in the elderly. PA had a consistent association with the following QoL domains: functional capacity; general QoL; autonomy; past, present and future activities; death and dying; intimacy; mental health; vitality; and psychological.
   Conclusion: PA was positively and consistently associated with some QoL domains among older individuals, supporting the notion that promoting PA in the elderly may have an impact beyond physical health. However, the associations between PA and other QoL domains were moderate to inconsistent and require further investigation.

AB  - In order to find related family factors and outcomes of being a street child in Iran, this study has classified and evaluated studies on this issue from a recent decade according to their strengths and weaknesses. We used a systematic review method in this study. By searching Iranian and international databases, and many universities and related organisations in Iran, and after their quality had been evaluated by a quality evaluation form, the findings of 40 studies were described and analysed. Street children in Iran are confronted with some serious family disadvantages such as family breakdown and abuse that may, along with poverty, push them to the streets. Many children also suffer from physical and mental health problems, and are involved in delinquency and drug abuse. It seems that both mechanisms of poverty and adverse familial conditions drive children to leave their homes for the streets as a way to solve their problems.

AB  - Depression and impulse control disorders (ICD) are two common neuropsychiatric features in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have revealed that both phenomena are associated with aberrations in ventral striatal dopamine signaling and concomitant dysfunction of the reward-related (limbic) corticostriatal-thalamocortical (CSTC) circuit. Depression in PD seems associated with decreased activity in the limbic CSTC circuit, whereas ICD seem associated with increased limbic CSTC circuit activity, usually after commencing dopamine replacement therapy (DRT). Not all DRT using PD patients, however, develop symptoms of ICD, suggesting an additional underlying neurobiological susceptibility. Furthermore, the symptoms of depression and ICD frequently coincide even though they are related to seemingly contrasting limbic CSTC circuit activation states. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the currently available literature on the neurobiology of PD-related depression and ICD and discusses possible susceptibility factors. Finally, we propose a neurobiological model that identifies ventral striatal dopaminergic denervation as a common underlying neurobiological substrate of depression and ICD and subsequent dysfunction of reward and motivation-related brain areas.

This study engaged academic and community stakeholders in conducting a best evidence-synthesis to identify modifiable risk and protective worker factors across health conditions impacting work-related absence.
   OBJECTIVES: To identify modifiable worker disability risk and protective factors across common health conditions impacting work-related absence.
   METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, CINHAL, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, BusinessSourceComplete, and ABI/Inform from 2000 to 2011. Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods systematic reviews of work-focused population were considered for inclusion. Two or more reviewers independently reviewed articles for inclusion and methodological screening.
   RESULTS: The search strategy, expert input and grey literature identified 2,467 unique records. One hundred and forty-two full text articles underwent comprehensive review. Twenty-four systematic reviews met eligibility criteria. Modifiable worker factors found to have consistent evidence across two or more health conditions included emotional distress, negative enduring psychology/personality factors, negative health and disability perception, decreased physical activity, lack of family support, poor general health, increased functional disability, increased pain, increased fatigue and lack of motivation to return to work.
   CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviews are limited by availability of high quality studies, lack of consistency of methodological screening and reporting, and variability of outcome measures used.

AB  - The olfactory system has a rich cortical representation, including a large archicortical component present in most vertebrates, and in mammals neocortical components including the entorhinal and orbitofrontal cortices. Together, these cortical components contribute to normal odor perception and memory. They help transform the physicochemical features of volatile molecules inhaled or exhaled through the nose into the perception of odor objects with rich associative and hedonic aspects. This chapter focuses on how olfactory cortical areas contribute to odor perception and begins to explore why odor perception is so sensitive to disease and pathology. Odor perception is disrupted by a wide range of disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, autism, and early life exposure to toxins. This olfactory deficit often occurs despite maintained functioning in other sensory systems. Does the unusual network of olfactory cortical structures contribute to this sensitivity?

AB  - beta-Secretase-1 (BACE1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the genesis of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides, the main constituents of the amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. BACE1 is being evaluated as an anti-A beta target for AD therapy. Recent studies indicate that BACE1 elevation is associated with axonal and presynaptic pathology during plaque development. Evidence also points to a biological role for BACE1 in axonal outgrowth and synapse formation during development. Axonal, including presynaptic, pathology exists in AD as well as many other neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, and trauma. In this review, we discuss pharmaceutical BACE1 inhibition as a therapeutic option for axonal pathogenesis, in addition to amyloid pathology. We first introduce the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor and describe the normal expression pattern of the amyloidogenic proteins in the brain, with an emphasis on BACE1. We then address BACE1 elevation relative to amyloid plaque development, followed by updating recent understanding of a neurotrophic role of BACE1 in axon and synapse development. We further elaborate the occurrence of axonal pathology in some other neurological conditions. Finally, we propose pharmacological inhibition of excessive BACE1 activity as an option to mitigate early axonal pathology occurring in AD and other neurological disorders.

AB  - In this paper, we provide a historical account of the contribution of a single line of research to our current understanding of the structure of cis-regulatory regions and the genetic basis for morphological evolution. We revisit the experiments that shed light on the evolution of larval cuticular patterns within the genus Drosophila and the evolution and structure of the shavenbaby gene. We describe the experiments that led to the discovery that multiple genetic changes in the cis-regulatory region of shavenbaby caused the loss of dorsal cuticular hairs (quaternary trichomes) in first instar larvae of Drosophila sechellia. We also discuss the experiments that showed that the convergent loss of quaternary trichomes in D. sechellia and Drosophila ezoana was generated by parallel genetic changes in orthologous enhancers of shavenbaby. We discuss the observation that multiple shavenbaby enhancers drive overlapping patterns of expression in the embryo and that these apparently redundant enhancers ensure robust shavenbaby expression and trichome morphogenesis under stressful conditions. All together, these data, collected over 13 years, provide a fundamental case study in the fields of gene regulation and morphological evolution, and highlight the importance of prolonged, detailed studies of single genes.

AB  - Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive, safe, and portable optical neuroimaging method that can be used to assess brain dynamics during skill acquisition and performance of complex work and everyday tasks. In this paper we describe neuroergonomic studies that illustrate the use of fNIRS in the examination of training-related brain dynamics and human performance assessment. We describe results of studies investigating cognitive workload in air traffic controllers, acquisition of dual verbal-spatial working memory skill, and development of expertise in piloting unmanned vehicles. These studies used conventional fNIRS devices in which the participants were tethered to the device while seated at a workstation. Consistent with the aims of mobile brain imaging (MoBI), we also describe a compact and battery-operated wireless fNIRS system that performs with similar accuracy as other established fNIRS devices. Our results indicate that both wired and wireless fNIRS systems allow for the examination of brain function in naturalistic settings, and thus are suitable for reliable human performance monitoring and training assessment.

AB  - Background: The UK Parliamentary Enquiry and USA Institute of Medicine state that lesbians may be at a higher risk of breast cancer but there is insufficient information. Lesbians and bisexual (LB) women have behavioural risk-factors at higher rates compared to heterosexuals such as increased alcohol intake and higher stress levels. Conversely, breast cancer rates are higher in more affluent women yet income levels in LB women are relatively low. This systematic review investigated all evidence on whether there is, or likely to be, higher rates of breast cancer in LB women.
   Methods: Cochrane library (CDSR, CENTRAL, HTA, DARE, NHSEED), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CAB abstracts, Web of Science (SCI, SSCI), SIGLE and Social Care Online databases were searched to October 2013. Unpublished research and specific lesbian, gay and bisexual websites were checked, as were citation lists of relevant papers. Included were studies in LB populations reporting breast cancer incidence or prevalence rates, risk model results or risk-factor estimates. Inclusions, data-extraction and quality assessment were by two reviewers with disagreements resolved by discussion.
   Results: Searches found 198 references. No incidence rates were found. Nine studies gave prevalence estimates - two showed higher, four showed no differences, one showed mixed results depending on definitions, one had no comparison group and one gave no sample size. All studies were small with poor methodological and/or reporting quality. One incidence modelling study suggested a higher rate. Four risk modelling studies were found, one Rosner-Colditz and three Gail models. Three suggested higher and one lower rate in LB compared to heterosexual women. Six risk-factor estimates suggested higher risk and one no difference between LB and heterosexual women.
   Conclusions: The only realistic way to establish rates in LB women would be to collect sexual orientation within routine statistics, including cancer registry data, or from large cohort studies.

AB  - Abnormal protein folding and self-assembly causes over 30 cureless human diseases for which no disease-modifying therapies are available. The common side to all these diseases is formation of aberrant toxic protein oligomers and amyloid fibrils. Both types of assemblies are drug targets, yet each presents major challenges to drug design, discovery, and development. In this review, we focus on two small molecules that inhibit formation of toxic amyloid protein assemblies - the green-tea derivative (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which was identified through a combination of epidemiologic data and a compound library screen, and the molecular tweezer CLR01, whose inhibitory activity was discovered in our group based on rational reasoning, and subsequently confirmed experimentally. Both compounds act in a manner that is not specific to one particular protein and thus are useful against a multitude of amyloidogenic proteins, yet they act via distinct putative mechanisms. CLR01 disrupts protein aggregation through specific binding to lysine residues, whereas the mechanisms underlying the activity of EGCG are only recently beginning to unveil. We discuss current in vitro and, where available, in vivo literature related to EGCG and CLR01's effects on amyloid beta-protein, alpha-synuclein, transthyretin, islet amyloid polypeptide, and calcitonin. We also describe the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and mechanism of action of each compound.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that produces motor and non-motor symptoms. The majority of cases are idiopathic and characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies containing fibrillar alpha-synuclein. Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) immunoreactivity was observed among others in cases with PD. Key disease-associated proteins are SUMO-modified, linking this posttranslational modification to neurodegeneration. SUMOylation and SUMO-mediated mechanisms have been intensively studied in recent years, revealing nuclear and extranuclear functions for SUMO in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of transcriptional activity, modulation of signal transduction pathways, and response to cellular stress. This points to a role for SUMO more than just an antagonist to ubiquitin and proteasomal degradation. The identification of risk and age-at-onset gene loci was a breakthrough in PD and promoted the understanding of molecular mechanisms in the pathology. PD has been increasingly linked with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial quality control. Interestingly, SUMO is involved in many of these processes and up-regulated in response to cellular stress, further emphasizing the importance of SUMOylation in physiology and disease.

AB  - BackgroundThe most recent Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2010) is the first to include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD) for burden quantification. We present the epidemiological profiles of ADHD and CD across three time periods for 21 world regions.
   MethodsA systematic review of global epidemiology was conducted for each disorder (based on a literature search of the Medline, PsycInfo and EMBASE databases). A Bayesian metaregression tool was used to derive prevalence estimates by age and sex in three time periods (1990, 2005 and 2010) for 21 world regions including those with little or no data. Prior expert knowledge and covariates were applied to each model to adjust suboptimal data. Final prevalence output for ADHD were adjusted to reflect an equivalent value if studies had measured point prevalence using multiple informants while final prevalence output for CD were adjusted to reflect a value equivalent to CD only.
   ResultsPrevalence was pooled for males and females aged 5-19years with no difference found in global prevalence between the three time periods. Male prevalence of ADHD in 2010 was 2.2% (2.0-2.3) while female prevalence was 0.7% (0.6-0.7). Male prevalence of CD in 2010 was 3.6% (3.3-4.0) while female prevalence was 1.5% (1.4-1.7). ADHD and CD were estimated to be present worldwide with ADHD prevalence showing some regional variation while CD prevalence remained relatively consistent worldwide.
   ConclusionsWe present the first prevalence estimates of both ADHD and CD globally and for all world regions. Data were sparse with large parts of the world having no estimates of either disorder. Epidemiological studies are urgently needed in certain parts of the world. Our findings directly informed burden quantification for GBD 2010. As mental disorders gained increased recognition after the first GBD study in 1990, the inclusion of ADHD and CD in GBD 2010 ensures their importance will be recognized alongside other childhood disorders.

AB  - Redox species are produced during the physiological cellular metabolism of a normal tissue. In turn, their presence is also attributed to pathological conditions including neurodegenerative diseases. Many are the molecular changes that occur during the unbalance of the redox homeostasis. Interestingly, posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs) play a remarkable role. In fact, several target proteins are modified in their activation, localization, aggregation, and expression after the cellular stress. Among PTMs, protein SUMOylation represents a very important molecular modification pathway during "oxidative stress". It has been reported that this ubiquitin-like modification is a fine sensor for redox species. Indeed, SUMOylation pathway efficiency is affected by the exposure to oxidative species in a different manner depending on the concentration and time of application. Thus, we here report updated evidence that states the role of SUMOylation in several pathological conditions, and we also outline the key involvement of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and small ubiquitin modifier pathway cross talk.

AB  - The burgeoning interest in placebo effects over the last 10-15 years has fallen into two main research areas: elucidation of the neurobiological mechanisms recruited following placebo administration, and investigations into the situations and contexts in which placebo effects are evoked. There has been little attention focused on bridging these two i.e. how to actively translate and apply these neurobiological mechanisms into daily clinical practice in a responsible way. This article addresses this gap, first through a narrative review of the last 15 years of neuroscience findings with special attention focussed on the elucidation of the neurotransmitters, pathways and mechanisms involved in placebo effects, and secondly, at how these psycho(neuro)biological effects could be harnessed in medical care.

AB  - Domiasiat (25A degrees 30'N 91A degrees 30'E) located in the west Khasi hill district of Meghalaya in northeast India is one of the largest sandstone-type uranium (U) ore deposit in India containing 9.22 million tonnes of ore reserves with an average ore grade of around 0.1 % U3O8. This geographically distinct U deposit of Domiasiat is un-mined and harbours diverse group of bacteria surviving the stressful environmental conditions prevalent in the ore deposit. Studies show that the diverse bacteria belonged to 10 different bacterial groups with occurrence of some previously uncharacterized bacteria. The cultured identified bacteria have been reported to tolerate substantial concentration of U and other metals and showed potent capacity for uptake and precipitation of U. Studying the bacterial community associated with such pre-mined U ore deposit are advantageous as it not only generates the baseline information on microbial community structure as resourceful indicator to estimate the impact of mining to be undertaken in future but also identifies the bacteria which can be explored for their potential as bioremediation agents for radionuclide/multi-metal waste sites.

AB  - Timely and efficient information transfer at synapses is fundamental to brain function. Synapses are highly dynamic structures that exhibit long-lasting activity-dependent alterations to their structure and transmission efficiency, a phenomenon termed synaptic plasticity. These changes, which occur through alterations in presynaptic release or in the trafficking of postsynaptic receptor proteins, underpin the formation and stabilisation of neural circuits during brain development, and encode, process and store information essential for learning, memory and cognition. In recent years, it has emerged that the ubiquitin-like posttranslational modification SUMOylation is an important mediator of several aspects of neuronal and synaptic function. Through orchestrating synapse formation, presynaptic release and the trafficking of postsynaptic receptor proteins during forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation, long-term depression and homeostatic scaling, SUMOylation is being increasingly appreciated to play a central role in neurotransmission. In this review, we outline key discoveries in this relatively new field, provide an update on recent progress regarding the targets and consequences of protein SUMOylation in synaptic function and plasticity, and highlight key outstanding questions regarding the roles of protein SUMOylation in the brain.

Articles were included if they were in English, represented original research, appeared in peer-reviewed publications, and addressed our research questions.
   Sixteen articles met our inclusion criteria. We found that mobile phone ownership ranged from 44% to 62%; computer ownership, from 24% to 40%; computer access and use, from 47% to 55%; and Internet use, from 19% to 84%. Homeless persons used technologies for a range of purposes, some of which were health related.
   Many homeless persons had access to information technologies, suggesting possible health benefits to developing programs that link homeless persons to health care through mobile phones and the Internet.

AB  - Research in the last century has demonstrated that light is a critical regulator of physiology in animals. More recent research has exposed the influence of light on human behavior, including the phenomenon of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Repeated studies have shown that light treatment is effective in this disorder. The molecular mechanism by which the body absorbs the light that has energizing and antidepressant effects is still uncertain. This review presents evidence regarding the role of rod and cone photoreceptors, as well as the role of recently discovered nonvisual neuronal melanopsin-containing photoreceptors. The authors discuss an evolutionary-based theoretical model of humoral phototransduction. This model postulates that tetrapyrrole pigments, including hemoglobin and bilirubin, are blood-borne photoreceptors, regulating gasotransmitters such as carbon monoxide when exposed to light in the eye. Recent studies in an animal model for seasonality provide data consistent with this model. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which light affects physiology may guide the development of therapies for SAD and other pathologies of circadian and circannual regulation.

AB  - ObjectiveThe pharmaceutical industry exercises pervasive influence in the mental health field. The internet has become a primary source of mental health information for the public and practitioners. This study therefore compared mental health websites funded and not funded by drug companies.
   MethodA systematic literature review of studies examining the role of drug companies in the funding of mental health websites was conducted, followed by a meta-analysis of studies comparing drug company-funded (DCF) sites with sites not funded by the industry.
   ResultsMental health websites, in general, overemphasize biogenetic causal explanations and medication. Many mental health websites (42%) are either drug company owned (6%) or receive funding from drug companies (36%). A meta-analysis found that DCF sites are significantly more biased toward biogenetic causes (P<0.01) and toward medication (P<0.0001) than sites that are financially independent of the industry.
   ConclusionPractitioners are encouraged to inform patients about the bias inherent in industry-sponsored websites and to recommend, instead, more balanced websites that present a range of evidence-based information about causes and treatments.

AB  - There is evidence that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has implications for the pathophysiology of major depressive disorders (MDD). Measures of BDNF levels are highly dependent on the methodologies used and these vary among different studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to carry out a descriptive analysis of the methodologies used to measure BDNF in clinical trials (CT) in patients with the diagnosis of major depression. We conducted a qualitative systematic review of CT that included samples of subjects diagnosed with major depression and evaluated the BDNF levels as an outcome. The search was performed on Pubmed, Scielo, Psychinfo and Lilacs. The selected articles were analyzed according to the CONSORT Statement and their methods of BDNF collection and analysis were described. Twenty-eight studies were included in the final analysis. Of those, 6 trials (21.4 %) involved non-pharmacological interventions and only half had the MDD diagnosis based on structured interview. Trials used different methods to evaluate BDNF levels: most of them verified serum BDNF levels, 17 (60.7 %) trials mentioned that measured BDNF levels in duplicate and 9 (32.1 %) collected blood in fasting. A variety of methods for BDNF collection and analysis was used in the different studies, making it difficult to compare results. However, despite of the methodology, BDNF seems to increase after treatment for major depression.

AB  - The cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP are common signalling molecules synthesized in neurons following the activation of adenylyl or guanylyl cyclase. In the striatum, the synthesis and degradation of cAMP and cGMP is highly regulated as these second messengers have potent effects on the activity of striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons. This review will summarize the literature on cyclic nucleotide signalling in the striatum with a particular focus on the impact of cAMP and cGMP on the membrane excitability of striatal medium-sized spiny output neurons (MSNs). The effects of non-selective and selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors on membrane activity and synaptic plasticity of MSNs will also be reviewed. Lastly, this review will discuss the implications of the effects PDE modulation on electrophysiological activity of striatal MSNs as it relates to the treatment of neurological disorders such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Assessment of cortisol concentrations in hair is one of the latest innovations for measuring long-term cortisol exposure. We performed a systematic review of correlates of cortisol in human hair to inform the design, analysis, and interpretation of future epidemiologic studies. Relevant publications were identified through electronic searches on PubMed, WorldCat, and Web of Science using keywords, "cortisol," "hair," "confounders," "chronic," "stress," and "correlates." Thirty-nine studies were included in this review. Notwithstanding scarce data and some inconsistencies, investigators have found hair cortisol concentrations to be associated with stress-related psychiatric symptoms and disorders (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder), medical conditions indicating chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., Cushing's syndrome), and other life situations associated with elevated risk of chronic stress (e.g., shiftwork). Results from some studies suggest that physical activity, adiposity, and substance abuse may be correlates of hair cortisol concentrations. In contrast to measures of short-term cortisol release (saliva, blood, and urine), cigarette smoking and use of oral contraceptives appear not to be associated with hair cortisol concentrations. Studies of pregnant women indicate increased hair cortisol concentrations across successive trimesters. The study of hair cortisol presents a unique opportunity to assess chronic alterations in cortisol concentrations in epidemiologic studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The amyloid beta (A beta) peptide in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is cytotoxic to neurons and has a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is an antioxidant protein and could act as a cytoprotective protein. However, the role of Prdx6 in neurodegenerative disease has not been studied. Thus, the roles and action mechanisms in the development of AD were examined. A beta(1-42)-induced memory impairment in Prdx6 transgenic mice was worse than C57BL/6 mice, and the expression of amyloid precursor protein cleavage, C99, beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 was greatly increased. In addition, the astrocytes and microglia cells of A beta-infused Prdx6 transgenic mice were more activated, and A beta also significantly increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl levels, but decreased glutathione levels. Furthermore, we found that translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to the nucleus was increased in A beta-infused Prdx6 transgenic mice. These results suggest that the overexpression of Prdx6 could accelerate the development of AD through increased amyloidogenesis through independent PLA2 activation and Nrf2 transcription.

Major Western and Chinese electronic databases were searched without language restriction for studies reporting defined daily doses. A total of 76 studies published between 2000 and 2010 reporting data on prescriptions for depression in China between 1996 and 2008 were included. All studies were published in Chinese. Most trials were conducted in urban areas in south and east China. Twenty-nine drugs were reported as antidepressants. On the basis of defined daily doses, melitracen/flupentixol combination, fluoxetine, and paroxetine were the most frequently prescribed compounds. According to published evidence, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressant drugs in China.

AB  - Background: There is evidence that psychological therapies including cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) may be effective in reducing postnatal depression (PND) when offered to individuals. In clinical practice, this is also implemented in a group therapy format, which, although not recommended in guidelines, is seen as a cost-effective alternative. To consider the extent to which group methods can be seen as evidence-based, we systematically review and synthesise the evidence for the efficacy of group CBT compared to currently used packages of care for women with PND, and we discuss further factors which may contribute to clinician confidence in implementing an intervention.
   Methods: Seventeen electronic databases were searched. All full papers were read by two reviewers and a third reviewer was consulted in the event of a disagreement on inclusion. Selected studies were quality assessed, using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, were data extracted by two reviewers using a standardised data extraction form and statistically synthesised where appropriate using the fixed-effect inverse-variance method.
   Results: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses showed group CBT to be effective in reducing depression compared to routine primary care, usual care or waiting list groups. A pooled effect size of d = 0.57 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.80, p < 0.001) was observed at 10-13 weeks post-randomisation, reducing to d = 0.28 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.53, p = 0.025) at 6 months. The non-randomised comparisons against waiting list controls at 10-13 weeks was associated with a larger effect size of d = 0.94 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.47, p < 0.001). However due to the limitations of the available data, such as ill-specified definitions of the CBT component of the group programmes, these results should be interpreted with caution.
   Conclusions: Although the evidence available is limited, group CBT was shown to be effective. We argue, therefore, that there is sufficient evidence to implement group CBT, conditional upon routinely collected outcomes being benchmarked against those obtained in trials of individual CBT, and with other important factors such as patient preference, clinical experience, and information from the local context taken into account when making the treatment decision.

AB  - The hippocampal mossy fibers (MFs), the axons of the granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus, innervate mossy cells and interneurons in the hilus on their way to CA3 where they innervate interneurons and pyramidal cells. Synapses on each target cell have distinct anatomical and functional characteristics. In recent years, the paradigmatic view of the MF synapses being only glutamatergic and, thus, excitatory has been questioned. Several laboratories have provided data supporting the hypothesis that the MFs can transiently release GABA during development and, in the adult, after periods of enhanced excitability. This transient glutamate-GABA co-transmission coincides with the transient up-regulation of the machinery for the synthesis and release of GABA in the glutamatergic GCs. Although some investigators have deemed this evidence controversial, new data has appeared with direct evidence of co-release of glutamate and GABA from single, identified MF boutons. However, this must still be confirmed by other groups and with other methodologies. A second, intriguing observation is that MF activation produced fast spikelets followed by excitatory postsynaptic potentials in a number of pyramidal cells, which, unlike the spikelets, underwent frequency potentiation and were strongly depressed by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. The spikelets persisted during blockade of chemical transmission and were suppressed by the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone. These data are consistent with the hypothesis of mixed electrical chemical synapses between MFs and some pyramidal cells. Dye coupling between these types of principal cells and ultra structural studies showing the co-existence of AMPA receptors and connexin 36 in this synapse corroborate their presence. A deeper consideration of mixed neurotransmission taking place in this synapse may expand our search and understanding of communication channels between different regions of the mammalian CNS.

AB  - Introduction: Access to hepatitis C (hereafter HCV) antiviral therapy has commonly excluded populations with mental health and substance use disorders because they were considered as having contraindications to treatment, particularly due to the neuropsychiatric effects of interferon that can occur in some patients. In this review we examined access to HCV interferon antiviral therapy by populations with mental health and substance use problems to identify the evidence and reasons for exclusion.
   Methods: We searched the following major electronic databases for relevant articles: PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria comprised studies of adults aged 18 years and older, peer-reviewed articles, date range of (2002-2012) to include articles since the introduction of pegylated interferon with ribarvirin, and English language. The exclusion criteria included articles about HCV populations with medical co-morbidities, such as hepatitis B (hereafter HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (hereafter HIV), because the clinical treatment, pathways and psychosocial morbidity differ from populations with only HCV. We identified 182 articles, and of these 13 met the eligibility criteria. Using an approach of systematic narrative review we identified major themes in the literature.
   Results: Three main themes were identified including: (1) pre-treatment and preparation for antiviral therapy, (2) adherence and treatment completion, and (3) clinical outcomes. Each of these themes was critically discussed in terms of access by patients with mental health and substance use co-morbidities demonstrating that current research evidence clearly demonstrates that people with HCV, mental health and substance use co-morbidities have similar clinical outcomes to those without these co-morbidities.
   Conclusions: While research evidence is largely supportive of increased access to interferon by people with HCV, mental health and substance use co-morbidities, there is substantial further work required to translate evidence into clinical practice. Further to this, we conclude that a reconsideration of the appropriateness of the tertiary health service model of care for interferon management is required and exploration of the potential for increased HCV care in primary health care settings.

AB  - Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a relatively new technique that can measure hemoglobin changes in brain tissues, and its use in psychiatry has been progressing rapidly. Although it has several disadvantages (e.g., relatively low spatial resolution and the possibility of shallow coverage in the depth of brain regions) compared with other functional neuroimaging techniques (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography), fNIRS may be a candidate instrument for clinical use in psychiatry, as it can measure brain activity in naturalistic position easily and non-invasively. fNIRS instruments are also small and work silently, and can be moved almost everywhere including schools and care units. Previous fNIRS studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia have impaired activity and characteristic waveform patterns in the prefrontal cortex during the letter version of the verbal fluency task, and part of these results have been approved as one of the Advanced Medical Technologies as an aid for the differential diagnosis of depressive symptoms by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan in 2009, which was the first such approval in the field of psychiatry. Moreover, previous studies suggest that the activity in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex is associated with their functions in chronic schizophrenia and is its next candidate biomarker. Future studies aimed at exploring fNIRS differences in various clinical stages, longitudinal changes, drug effects, and variations during different task paradigms will be needed to develop more accurate biomarkers that can be used to aid differential diagnosis, the comprehension of the present condition, the prediction of outcome, and the decision regarding treatment options in schizophrenia. Future fNIRS researches will require standardized measurement procedures, probe settings, analytical methods and tools, manuscript description, and database systems in an fNIRS community.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThe past few years have seen a steep increase in journal articles relating to feeding and eating disorders in children, making a succinct overview timely. The relevance of this review is enhanced by the recent publication of revised feeding and eating disorder diagnostic criteria in DSM-5. These have significant implications for younger patients, in particular through the inclusion of the new diagnostic category Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). It is likely that this will encourage increased research interest in this field.Recent findingsRecent publications included in this article cover a broad range of topics relevant to childhood feeding and eating disorders, to include: presentation, diagnosis and classification; epidemiology; risk factors; assessment measures; treatment, prognosis and outcome.SummaryThe area of feeding and eating disorders in children remains relatively under-researched, with significant gaps in knowledge about epidemiology, course and prognosis as well as a limited evidence base for treatment. However, important and promising avenues are increasingly being explored. In relation to clinical practice, there is now a much better recognition of these disorders and a greater awareness of their complexity, severity and potential impact in both the short and the longer term if not appropriately managed.

Therefore, psychosocial interventions, such as psychoeducation, have been increasingly recognized as an essential component in the treatment of depression, associated with pharmacological strategies. Thus, the aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychoeducation for patients with unipolar depression, analyzing the evidence from the literature.
   Method: Searches were undertaken from April to October 2012 in LILACS, PsycINFO, PubMed, SCOPUS and ISI Web of Knowledge with keywords including psychoeducation', psychoeducational intervention' and depression', with no restriction regarding publishing dates.
   Results: Fifteen studies were included in the review, 13 of which evaluated the effectiveness of psychoeducation for patients with depression: 10 papers evaluated in-person psychoeducation approaches and three papers evaluated long-distance approaches. In addition to these 13 papers, one evaluated psychoeducational interventions for patients' families and patients' responses and another evaluated psychoeducational interventions for patients' families and families' responses. Findings suggest that increased knowledge about depression and its treatment is associated with better prognosis in depression, as well as with the reduction of the psychosocial burden for the family.
   Conclusions: Psychoeducation is a psychosocial treatment that has been well documented as an adjunct to pharmacological therapy. However, there are only a few studies regarding its effectiveness on adult patients with major depressive disorder. Although the publications in this area are still very limited, the articles selected in this review suggest that psychoeducation is effective in improving the clinical course, treatment adherence, and psychosocial functioning of depressive patients.

AB  - Freshwater species worldwide are experiencing dramatic declines partly attributable to ongoing climate change. It is expected that the future effects of climate change could be particularly severe in mediterranean climate (med-) regions, which host many endemic species already under great stress from the high level of human development. In this article, we review the climate and climate-induced changes in streams of med-regions and the responses of stream biota, focusing on both observed and anticipated ecological responses. We also discuss current knowledge gaps and conservation challenges. Expected climate alterations have already been observed in the last decades, and include: increased annual average air temperatures; decreased annual average precipitation; hydrologic alterations; and an increase in frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events, such as floods, droughts and fires. Recent observations, which are concordant with forecasts built, show stream biota of med-regions when facing climate changes tend to be displaced towards higher elevations and upper latitudes, communities tend to change their composition and homogenize, while some life-history traits seem to provide biota with resilience and resistance to adapt to the new conditions (as being short-lived, small, and resistant to low streamflow and desiccation). Nevertheless, such responses may be insufficient to cope with current and future environmental changes. Accurate forecasts of biotic changes and possible adaptations are difficult to obtain in med-regions mainly because of the difficulty of distinguishing disturbances due to natural variability from the effects of climate change, particularly regarding hydrology. Long-term studies are needed to disentangle such variability and improve knowledge regarding the ecological responses and the detection of early warning signals to climate change. Investments should focus on taxa beyond fish and macroinvertebrates, and in covering the less studied regions of Chile and South Africa. Scientists, policy makers and water managers must be involved in the climate change dialogue because the freshwater conservation concerns are huge.

AB  - Background
   Problems with the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia have led for a call to change strategy and focus on individual psychotic experiences. In recent years, research on delusions has led the way.
   Aims
   To update our 1999 review of almost 40 studies on delusions.
   Method
   A systematic literature search was conducted of reasoning and affective processes related to delusions.
   Results
   Over 200 studies were identified. The presence of 'jumping to conclusions' in individuals with delusions has been substantiated, the theory of mind account has not stood up to subsequent testing, and there is a promising new focus on the ways that affective processes contribute to delusional experience.
   Conclusions
   Theoretical work rendering delusions understandable can be translated into treatment; future clinical trials should focus on individual psychotic experiences as outcomes.

AB  - The present review article summarizes and expands upon the discussions that were initiated during a meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS; http://cntrics.ucdavis.edu) meeting. A major goal of the CNTRICS meeting was to identify experimental procedures and measures that can be used in laboratory animals to assess psychological constructs that are related to the psychopathology of schizophrenia. The issues discussed in this review reflect the deliberations of the Motivation Working Group of the CNTRICS meeting, which included most of the authors of this article as well as additional participants. After receiving task nominations from the general research community, this working group was asked to identify experimental procedures in laboratory animals that can assess aspects of reinforcement learning and motivation that may be relevant for research on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as other disorders characterized by deficits in reinforcement learning and motivation. The tasks described here that assess reinforcement learning are the Autoshaping Task, Probabilistic Reward Learning Tasks, and the Response Bias Probabilistic Reward Task. The tasks described here that assess motivation are Outcome Devaluation and Contingency Degradation Tasks and Effort-Based Tasks. In addition to describing such methods and procedures, the present article provides a working vocabulary for research and theory in this field, as well as an industry perspective about how such tasks may be used in drug discovery. It is hoped that this review can aid investigators who are conducting research in this complex area, promote translational studies by highlighting shared research goals and fostering a common vocabulary across basic and clinical fields, and facilitate the development of medications for the treatment of symptoms mediated by reinforcement learning and motivational deficits.

AB  - Context: It has been suggested that the commonly prescribed class of antidepressants selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are associated with birth defects. However, the teratogenic effect of individual SSRIs has not been previously compared using meta-analysis.
   Objective: To determine the strength of the association between individual SSRIs and major, minor, and cardiac malformation among infants born to women taking these medications.
   Data sources: Electronic search of CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and ISI Web of Science using the search terms (SSRI OR antidepressant) AND (obstetric outcome OR malformation OR birth outcome OR teratogen), supplemented by manual searching of published references and requests of primary researchers for unpublished data.
   Study selection: There were 115 studies identified by electronic search and reviewed in full text, which yielded 16 papers reporting 36 data samples for major malformations, nine papers reporting 26 data samples for cardiac malformations, and four papers reporting seven data samples for minor malformations.
   Data synthesis: Fluoxetine (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.30) and paroxetine (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49) were associated with increased risk of major malformations. Paroxetine was associated with increased risk of cardiac malformations (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.12-1.86). Sertraline and citalopram were not significantly associated with congenital malformation. Between-sample heterogeneity was low and a range of methodological considerations had no significant impact on effect size. There was little evidence of publication bias.
   Conclusions: Fluoxetine and paroxetine should be avoided in the first trimester and among those at risk of an unplanned pregnancy.

AB  - Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) is a critical component of the brain circuitry regulating behavioral activation and effort-related processes. Although nucleus accumbens (NAc) DA depletions or antagonism leave aspects of appetite and primary food motivation intact, rats with impaired DA transmission reallocate their instrumental behavior away from food-reinforced tasks with high response requirements, and instead select less effortful food-seeking behaviors. Previous work showed that adenosine A(2A) antagonists can reverse the effects of DA D-2 antagonists on effort-related choice, and that stimulation of adenosine A(2A) receptors produces behavioral effects that are similar to those induced by DA antagonism. The present review summarizes the literature on the role of NAc DA and adenosine in effort-related processes, and also presents original data on the effects of local stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in NAc core. Local injections of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine directly into NAc core produces shifts in effort-related choice behavior similar to those induced by DA antagonism or A(2A) receptor stimulation, decreasing lever pressing but increasing chow intake in rats responding on a concurrent fixed ratio/chow feeding choice task. In contrast, injections into a neostriatal control site dorsal to the NAc were ineffective. The actions of pilocarpine on this task were attenuated by co-administration of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine. Thus, drugs that act on DA, adenosine A(2A), and muscarinic receptors regulate effort-related choice behavior, which may have implications for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms such as psychomotor slowing, fatigue or anergia that can be observed in depression and other disorders.

This review examines the philosophical issues that emerge from an analysis of those debates and current literature.Recent findingsThe resolution of controversies in the publication of the DSM 5 drew upon the available evidence, theories of mental disorder, and normative assumptions. The rise of the Internet presents difficult challenges in this field.SummaryNumerous philosophical assumptions underlie the psychiatric understandings of paraphilias. The focus here is on the nosological issues such as boundary justification for the determinations of normative and nonnormative human sexuality; the importance of not collapsing the distinction between mental disorder and crime, and the relationship between fantasy and action; epistemological questions of perspectivity, reasons-giving, and relationship of communication to truth claims; and sex differences not only in the paraphilias but also in the social context in which sex is formed and given expression.

AB  - Purpose of reviewTo systematize new neurobiological findings on the cause and treatment of eating disorders.Recent findingsThe conceptual framework of the cause of eating disorders has undergone great changes in the past decades. Recently, the National Institute of Mental Health proposed a new set of criteria for research purposes - the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). We aim to structure this study as much as possible using these constructs across biological units of analysis, summarizing new findings. Brain imaging techniques have become sophisticated in identifying brain circuits related to illness behaviour and to fundamental traits such as reward and social processing. Genetic studies have moved from candidate gene studies onto genome-wide association studies; however, the field needs to cooperate to collect larger samples in order to benefit from this approach. Hormonal changes as the results of starvation or as underlying factors for behavioural changes still receive attention in both animal and human studies. Advances made in neuropsychology show problems in cognition (set shifting and central coherence) and in other RDoC domains. Some of these findings have been translated into treatment.SummaryNew biological models are being developed which explain causal and maintaining factors. The RDoC construct may be used to systematize these findings.

AB  - This joint article reflects the authors' personal views regarding noteworthy advances in the neuroscience of consciousness in the last 10 years, and suggests what we feel may be promising future directions. It is based on a small conference at the Samoset Resort in Rockport, Maine, USA, in July of 2012, organized by the Mind Science Foundation of San Antonio, Texas. Here, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of subjectivity in humans and other animals, including empirical, applied, technical, and conceptual insights. These include the evidence for the importance of fronto-parietal connectivity and of "top-down" processes, both of which enable information to travel across distant cortical areas effectively, as well as numerous dissociations between consciousness and cognitive functions, such as attention, in humans. In addition, we describe the development of mental imagery paradigms, which made it possible to identify covert awareness in non-responsive subjects. Non-human animal consciousness research has also witnessed substantial advances on the specific role of cortical areas and higher order thalamus for consciousness, thanks to important technological enhancements. In addition, much progress has been made in the understanding of non-vertebrate cognition relevant to possible conscious states. Finally, major advances have been made in theories of consciousness, and also in their comparison with the available evidence. Along with reviewing these findings, each author suggests future avenues for research in their field of investigation.

AB  - Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder with high rates of morbidity, comorbidity and mortality, which in a subset of patients (21%) takes on a chronic course. Since an evidence based treatment for AN is scarce, it is crucial to investigate new treatment options, preferably focused on influencing the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of AN. The objective of the present paper was to review the evidence for possible neurobiological correlates of AN, and to hypothesize about potential targets for Deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for chronic, therapy-refractory AN. One avenue for exploring new treatment options based on the neurobiological correlates of AN, is the search for symptomatologic and neurobiologic parallels between AN and other compulsivity- or reward-related disorders. As in other compulsive disorders, the fronto-striatal circuitry, in particular the insula, the ventral striatum (VS) and the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, temporal, parietal and anterior cingulate cortices, are likely to be implicated in the neuropathogenesis of AN. In this paper we will review the few available cases in which DBS has been performed in patients with AN (either as primary diagnosis or as comorbid condition). Given the overlap in symptomatology and neurocircuitry between reward-related disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and AN, and the established efficacy of accumbal DBS in OCD, we hypothesize that DBS of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other areas associated with reward, e. g. the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), might be an effective treatment for patients with chronic, treatment refractory AN, providing not only weight restoration, but also significant and sustained improvement in AN core symptoms and associated comorbidities and complications. Possible targets for DBS in AN are the ACC, the ventral anterior limb of the capsula interna (vALIC) and the VS. We suggest conducting larger efficacy studies that also explore the functional effects of DBS in AN.

AB  - The study of synaptic plasticity and specifically LTP and LTD is one of the most active areas of research in neuroscience. In the last 25 years we have come a long way in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity. In 1988, AMPA and NMDA receptors were not even molecularly identified and we only had a simple model of the minimal requirements for the induction of plasticity. It is now clear that the modulation of the AMPA receptor function and membrane trafficking is critical for many forms of synaptic plasticity and a large number of proteins have been identified that regulate this complex process. Here we review the progress over the last two and a half decades and discuss the future challenges in the field.

AB  - Background: Past studies have identified poor rates of detection of mental illness among inmates. Consequently, mental health screening is a common feature to various correctional mental health strategies and best practice guidelines. However, there is little guidance to support the selection of an appropriate tool. This systematic review compared the sensitivity and specificity of mental health screening tools among adult jail or prison populations.
   Methods: A systematic review of MEDLINE and PsycINFO up to 2011, with additional studies identified from a search of reference lists. Only studies involving adult jail or prison populations, with an independent measure of mental illness, were included. Studies in forensic settings to determine fitness to stand trial or criminal responsibility were excluded. Twenty-four studies met all inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review. All articles were coded by two independent authors. Study quality was coded by the lead author.
   Results: Twenty-two screening tools were identified. Only six tools have replication studies: the Brief Jail Mental Health Screen (BJMHS), the Correctional Mental Health Screen for Men (CMHS-M), the Correctional Mental Health Screen for Women (CMHS-W), the England Mental Health Screen (EMHS), the Jail Screening Assessment Tool (JSAT), and the Referral Decision Scale (RDS). A descriptive summary is provided in lieu of use of meta-analytic techniques due to the lack of replication studies and methodological variations across studies.
   Conclusions: The BJMHS, CMHS-M, CMHS-W, EMHS and JSAT appear to be the most promising tools. Future research should consider important contextual factors in the implementation of a screening tool that have received little attention. Randomized or quasi-randomized trials are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of screening to improve the detection of mental illness compared to standard practices.

AB  - In the striatum, the dendritic tree of the two main populations of projection neurons, called "medium spiny neurons (MSNs)", are covered with spines that receive glutamatergic inputs from the cerebral cortex and thalamus. In Parkinson's disease (PD), striatal MSNs undergo an important loss of dendritic spines, whereas aberrant overgrowth of striatal spines occurs following chronic cocaine exposure. This review examines the possibility that opposite dopamine dysregulation is one of the key factors that underlies these structural changes. In PD, nigrostriatal dopamine degeneration results in a significant loss of dendritic spines in the dorsal striatum, while rodents chronically exposed to cocaine and other psychostimulants, display an increase in the density of "thin and immature" spines in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In rodent models of PD, there is evidence that D2 dopamine receptor-containing MSNs are preferentially affected, while D1-positive cells are the main targets of increased spine density in models of addiction. However, such specificity remains to be established in primates. Although the link between the extent of striatal spine changes and the behavioral deficits associated with these disorders remains controversial, there is unequivocal evidence that glutamatergic synaptic transmission is significantly altered in both diseased conditions. Recent studies have suggested that opposite calcium-mediated regulation of the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) function induces these structural defects. In conclusion, there is strong evidence that dopamine is a major, but not the sole, regulator of striatal spine pathology in PD and addiction to psychostimulants. Further studies of the role of glutamate and other genes associated with spine plasticity in mediating these effects are warranted.

AB  - Our understanding of the molecular properties of kainate receptors and their involvement in synaptic physiology has progressed significantly over the last 30 years. A plethora of studies indicate that kainate receptors are important mediators of the pre- and postsynaptic actions of glutamate, although the mechanisms underlying such effects are still often a topic for discussion. Three clear fields related to their behavior have emerged: there are a number of interacting proteins that pace the properties of kainate receptors; their activity is unconventional since they can also signal through G proteins, behaving like metabotropic receptors; they seem to be linked to some devastating brain diseases. Despite the significant progress in their importance in brain function, kainate receptors remain somewhat puzzling. Here we examine discoveries linking these receptors to physiology and their probable implications in disease, in particular mood disorders, and propose some ideas to obtain a deeper understanding of these intriguing proteins.

AB  - Recent breakthroughs in optogenetic technologies to alter neuronal firing and function with light, combined with cell type-specific transgenic animal lines, has led to important insights into the function of distinct neuronal cell subtypes and afferent connections in the heterogeneously complex striatum. A vital part of the basal ganglia, the striatum is heavily implicated in both motor control and motivation-based behavior; as well as in neurological disorders and psychiatric diseases including Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, drug addiction, depression, and schizophrenia. Researchers are able to manipulate firing and cell signaling with temporal precision using optogenetics in the two striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) subpopulations, the striatal interneurons, and striatal afferents. These studies confirmed the classical hypothesis of movement control and reward seeking behavior through direct versus indirect pathway MSNs; illuminated a selective role for TANs in cocaine reward; dissected the roles of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs to striatum in reward; and highlighted a role for striatal signaling molecules including an adrenergic G-protein coupled receptor in reward and the rho-GTPase Rac1 in cocaine reward and cocaine induced structural plasticity. This review focuses on how the evolving optogenetic toolbox provides insight into the distinct behavioral roles of striatal cell subpopulations and striatal afferents, which has clinically relevant implications into neurological disorders and psychiatric disease.

AB  - Background: Diabetic patients with depression are often inadequately treated within primary care. These comorbid conditions are associated with poor outcomes. The aim of this systematic review was to examine whether collaborative care can improve depression and diabetes outcomes in patients with both depression and diabetes.
   Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane library and PsyINFO were systematically searched to identify relevant publications. All randomized controlled trials of collaborative care for diabetic patients with depression of all ages who were reported by depression treatment response, depression remission, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, adherence to antidepressant medication and/or oral hypoglycemic agent were included. Two authors independently screened search results and extracted data from eligible studies. Dichotomous and continuous measures of outcomes were combined using risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) either by fixed or random-effects models.
   Results: Eight studies containing 2,238 patients met the inclusion criteria. Collaborative care showed a significant improvement in depression treatment response (RR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05-1.68), depression remission (adjusted RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.11-2.12), higher rates of adherence to antidepressant medication (RR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.19-2.69) and oral hypoglycemic agent (RR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.61-2.96), but indicated a non-significant reduction in HbA1c values (MD = -0.13, 95% CI = -0.46-0.19).
   Conclusions: Improving depression care in diabetic patients is very necessary and important. Comparing with usual care, collaborative care was associated with significantly better depressive outcomes and adherence in patients with depression and diabetes. These findings emphasize the implications for collaborative care of diabetic patients with depression in the future.

AB  - The stunting effect of ocean acidification on development of calcifying invertebrate larvae has emerged as a significant effect of global change. We assessed the arm growth response of sea urchin echinoplutei, here used as a proxy of larval calcification, to increased seawater acidity/pCO(2) and decreased carbonate mineral saturation in a global synthesis of data from 15 species. Phylogenetic relatedness did not influence the observed patterns. Regardless of habitat or latitude, ocean acidification impedes larval growth with a negative relationship between arm length and increased acidity/pCO(2) and decreased carbonate mineral saturation. In multiple linear regression models incorporating these highly correlated parameters, pCO(2) exerted the greatest influence on decreased arm growth in the global dataset and also in the data subsets for polar and subtidal species. Thus, reduced growth appears largely driven by organism hypercapnia. For tropical species, decreased carbonate mineral saturation was most important. No single parameter played a dominant role in arm size reduction in the temperate species. For intertidal species, the models were equivocal. Levels of acidification causing a significant (approx. 10-20+%) reduction in arm growth varied between species. In 13 species, reduction in length of arms and supporting skeletal rods was evident in larvae reared in near-future (pCO(2) 800+ mu atm) conditions, whereas greater acidification (pCO(2) 1000+ mu atm) reduced growth in all species. Although multi-stressor studies are few, when temperature is added to the stressor mix, near-future warming can reduce the negative effect of acidification on larval growth. Broadly speaking, responses of larvae from across world regions showed similar trends despite disparate phylogeny, environments and ecology. Larval success may be the bottleneck for species success with flow-on effects for sea urchin populations and marine ecosystems.

AB  - Predictions concerning the consequences of the oceanic uptake of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) have been primarily occupied with the effects of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms, particularly those critical to the formation of habitats (e. g. coral reefs) or their maintenance (e. g. grazing echinoderms). This focus overlooks direct and indirect effects of CO2 on non-calcareous taxa that play critical roles in ecosystem shifts (e. g. competitors). We present the model that future atmospheric [CO2] may act as a resource for mat-forming algae, a diverse and widespread group known to reduce the resilience of kelp forests and coral reefs. We test this hypothesis by combining laboratory and field CO2 experiments and data from 'natural' volcanic CO2 vents. We show that mats have enhanced productivity in experiments and more expansive covers in situ under projected near-future CO2 conditions both in temperate and tropical conditions. The benefits of CO2 are likely to vary among species of producers, potentially leading to shifts in species dominance in a high CO2 world. We explore how ocean acidification combines with other environmental changes across a number of scales, and raise awareness of CO2 as a resource whose change in availability could have wide-ranging community consequences beyond its direct effects.

AB  - Pregnancy is a period of increased vulnerability for migrant women, and access to healthcare, use and quality of care provided during this period are important aspects to characterize the support provided to this population. A systematic review of the scientific literature contained in the MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases was carried out, searching for population based studies published between 1990 and 2012 and reporting on maternal healthcare in immigrant populations. A total of 854 articles were retrieved and 30 publications met the inclusion criteria, being included in the final evaluation. The majority of studies point to a higher health risk profile in immigrants, with an increased incidence of co-morbidity in some populations, reduced access to health facilities particularly in illegal immigrants, poor communication between women and caregivers, a lower rate of obstetrical interventions, a higher incidence of stillbirth and early neonatal death, an increased risk of maternal death, and a higher incidence of postpartum depression. Incidences vary widely among different population groups. Some migrant populations are at a higher risk of serious complications during pregnancy, for reasons that include reduced access and use of healthcare facilities, as well as less optimal care, resulting in a higher incidence of adverse outcomes. Tackling these problems and achieving equality of care for all is a challenging aim for public healthcare services.

AB  - Assess the association between 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) levels and particulate matter air pollution in non-occupational exposure groups from peer-reviewed literature.
   Ovid Medline and PubMed were used to search for all peer-reviewed articles published between 1946 and May 2013. Keywords included particulate matter, air pollution, deoxyguanosine, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and known abbreviations. Seven English, non-occupational exposure, human subject studies were evaluated.
   Of the two studies involving children one found significant positive associations between exposure to particulate matter air pollution and 8OHdG. Investigations into non-occupationally exposed adults were mixed. The lone double-blind crossover study found no relationship between diesel exhaust exposure and 8OHdG. Two out of three panel studies and one cohort study found significant associations between 8OHdG and classes of particles and for various lags.
   Analyses accounting for particle composition and lags between exposure and physiological responses had the strongest significant associations. Results are not conclusive due to the inconsistency in study designs, small sample sizes, and differences in exposure assessment techniques. Consistent methodology with representative populations including women and other non-occupationally exposed groups are recommended.

AB  - While the cause of dopaminergic neuronal cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not yet understood, many endogenous molecules have been implicated in its pathogenesis. beta-phenethylamine (beta-PEA), a component of various food items including chocolate and wine, is an endogenous molecule produced from phenylalanine in the brain. It has been reported recently that long-term administration of beta-PEA in rodents causes neurochemical and behavioral alterations similar to that produced by parkinsonian neurotoxins. The toxicity of beta-PEA has been linked to the production of hydroxyl radical (.OH) and the generation of oxidative stress in dopaminergic areas of the brain, and this may be mediated by inhibition of mitochondrial complex-I. Another signifi cant observation is that administration of beta-PEA to rodents reduces striatal dopamine content and induces movement disorders similar to those of parkinsonian rodents. However, no reports are available on the extent of dopaminergic neuronal cell death after administration of beta-PEA. Based on the literature, we set out to establish beta-PEA as an endogenous molecule that potentially contributes to the progressive development of PD. The sequence of molecular events that could be responsible for dopaminergic neuronal cell death in PD by consumption of beta-PEA-containing foods is proposed here. Thus, long-term over-consumption of food items containing beta-PEA could be a neurological risk factor having significant pathological consequences.

Predicated on the Theory of Planned Behavior, the proposed model describes how person, task, and situation factors influence individuals' decision to seek interpersonal help for goal-directed or instrumental purposes. This paper also contributes to help-seeking research by (i) adopting a constellation approach to examine how various salient beliefs mediate between these exogenous factors and people's help-seeking decision and behavior, (ii) providing a multi-level perspective on help-seeking behavior, and by (iii) highlighting the moderating role of expectancy in people's decision to seek interpersonal help.

AB  - Background: Social inclusion is crucial to mental health and well-being and is emphasised in Australia's Fourth National Mental Health Plan. There is a recognition that a measure of social inclusion would complement the suite of outcome measures that is currently used in public sector mental health services. This paper is an initial scope of candidate measures of social inclusion and considers their suitability for this purpose.
   Methods: We identified potential measures through searches of PsycINFO and Medline and a more general Internet search. We extracted descriptive and evaluative information on each measure identified and compared this information with a set of eight criteria. The criteria related to the measure's inclusion of four domains of social inclusion outlined in Australia's Fourth National Mental Health Plan, its usability within the public mental health sector and its psychometric properties.
   Results: We identified 10 candidate measures of social inclusion: the Activity and Participation Questionnaire (APQ-6); the Australian Community Participation Questionnaire (ACPQ); the Composite Measure of Social Inclusion (CMSI); the EMILIA Project Questionnaire (EPQ); the Evaluating Social Inclusion Questionnaire (ESIQ); the Inclusion Web (IW); the Social and Community Opportunities Profile (SCOPE); the Social Inclusion Measure (SIM); the Social Inclusion Questionnaire (SIQ); and the Staff Survey of Social Inclusion (SSSI). After comparison with the eight review criteria, we determined that the APQ-6 and the SCOPE-short form show the most potential for further testing.
   Conclusions: Social inclusion is too important not to measure. This discussion of individual-level measures of social inclusion provides a springboard for selecting an appropriate measure for use in public sector mental health services. It suggests that there are two primary candidates, but neither of these is quite fit-for-purpose in their current form. Further exploration will reveal whether one of these is suitable, whether another measure might be adapted for the current purpose or whether a new, specifically designed measure needs to be developed.

AB  - We reviewed the literature on standard case management (SCM), intensive case management (ICM), assertive community treatment (ACT), and critical time intervention (CTI) for homeless adults. We searched databases for peer-reviewed English articles published from 1985 to 2011 and found 21 randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies comparing case management to other services.
   We found little evidence for the effectiveness of ICM. SCM improved housing stability, reduced substance use, and removed employment barriers for substance users. ACT improved housing stability and was cost-effective for mentally ill and dually diagnosed persons. CTI showed promise for housing, psychopathology, and substance use and was cost-effective for mentally ill persons.
   More research is needed on how case management can most effectively support rapid-rehousing approaches to homelessness.

AB  - Studies investigating effectiveness of group psychotherapy intervention in depression in persons with HIV have showed varying results with differing effect sizes. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of group psychotherapy in depression in persons with HIV has been conducted to present the best available evidence in relation to its effect on depressive symptomatology. Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials. Selected studies were quality assessed and data extracted by two reviewers. If feasible, it was planned to conduct a meta-analysis to obtain a pooled effect size of group psychotherapeutic interventions on depressive symptoms. Odds ratio for drop out from group was calculated. The studies were assessed for their quality using the Quality Rating Scale and other parameters for quality assessment set out by COCHRANE. The quality of reporting of the trials was compared against the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist for non-pharmacological studies (CONSORT-NPT). Four studies met the full inclusion criteria for systematic review. The trials included in the review examined group interventions based on the Cognitive behavioral therapy model against other therapeutic interventions or waiting list controls. In all four studies, group psychotherapy was an effective intervention for reducing depressive symptoms in persons with HIV in comparison to waiting list controls. The reported benefits from the group psychotherapy in comparison to active controls were less impressive. There were no statistically significant differences in drop outs at post treatments across group psychotherapy, wait list control, and other active interventions. The methodological quality of the studies varied. The quality of reporting of the studies was sub-optimal. The results of this systematic review support that group psychological interventions for depression in persons with HIV have a significant effect on depressive symptomatology. This review also indicates that group cognitive behavioral therapies are an acceptable psychological intervention for persons with HIV and comorbid depression.

AB  - Objective Previous research has identified gaps in pandemic response planning for primary care. Identifying the challenges that general practitioners (GPs) face during public health crises of infectious diseases will help to improve prepandemic planning. In this integrative systematic review, we identified research-based evidence to (1) challenges that GPs have when participating in pandemics or epidemics and (2) whether GPs from different countries encountered different challenges.
   Methods A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases during October to November 2012 to identify studies relevant to experience by GPs during epidemics or pandemics.
   Results Six quantitative, 2 mixed method, and 2 qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. The challenges identified were not exclusive to specific countries and encompassed different responses to outbreaks. These challenges included difficulties with information access; supply and use of personal protective equipment; performing public health responsibilities; obtaining support from the authorities; appropriate training; and the emotional effects of participating in the response to an infectious disease with unknown characteristics and lethality.
   Conclusion GPs' response to public health crises in different countries presents potential for improving pandemic preparedness.

   We searched electronic databases and contacted Brazilian researchers up to 05/2012. Studies were included in the review if they reported the prevalence of or risk factors for conduct problems, conduct disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder for 100 + Brazilian children aged a parts per thousand currency sign18 years, systematically sampled in schools or the community. Prevalence rates and sex differences were meta-analysed. Risk factor studies were reviewed one by one.
   The average prevalence of conduct problems in screening questionnaires was 20.8 %, and the average prevalence of conduct disorder/oppositional defiant disorder was 4.1 %. There was systematic variation in the results of screening studies according to methodology: recruitment location, informants, instruments, impairment criterion for case definition, and response rates. Risk factors previously identified in high-income countries were mainly replicated in Brazil, including comorbid mental health problems, educational failure, low religiosity, harsh physical punishment and abuse, parental mental health problems, single parent family, and low socioeconomic status. However, boys did not always have higher risk for conduct problems than girls.
   Studies using screening questionnaires suggest that Brazilian children have higher rates of conduct problems than children in other countries, but diagnostic studies do not show this difference. Risk factors in Brazil were similar to those in high-income countries, apart from child sex. Future research should investigate developmental patterns of antisocial behaviour, employ a variety of research designs to identify causal risk mechanisms, and examine a broader range of risk factors.

The literature search was conducted in Psyclnfo and PubMed. Inclusion criteria were: (1) studies for which adult subjects with an OCD diagnosis were recruited (2) n > 10 (3a) studies with data on the percentage of individuals seeking treatment for OCD symptoms in OCD subsamples of community studies or (3b) studies with data on the percentage of patients in treatment-seeking OCD populations receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or behavior therapy (BT) (4) publication written in English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese or Italian. 20 articles met these criteria, 12 for part (a), and 8 for part (b) of the review. Findings indicate that a majority of OCD sufferers never seek help for this disorder. Moreover, only a minority of treatment-seekers with OCD seems to receive cognitive-behavioral therapy including exposure techniques. Studies with representative OCD patient samples are urgently needed to shed more light on the actual treatment situation, and to derive measures for the prevention of negative long-term outcome.

AB  - Fads in psychiatry are little more than bad ideas with short half-lives. They have arisen because of the great discontinuities that have swept psychiatry unlike other specialties in the 20th century: the transition in the 1920s from asylum-based biological psychiatry to psychoanalysis, and the transition in the 1960s from psychoanalysis to a biological model based on psychopharmacology. In no other medical specialty has the knowledge base been scrapped and rebuilt, and then again scrapped and rebuilt. In these great transitions, when psychiatry each time has had to reconstruct from scratch, bad ideas have crept in with good. Psychiatry, in its heavy use of consensus conferences, is often unable to employ science as a means of discarding fads, which, once installed, are often difficult to remove. Each of the great paradigms of psychiatry in the last hundred years has given rise to fads, and psychopharmacology is no exception, with faddish uses of neurotransmitter doctrine claiming centre stage. Only when psychiatry becomes firmly linked to the neurosciences will its subjugation to the turbulence of faddism be moderated.

AB  - In the present study, the role of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in sodium arsenite (arsenite)-induced neurotoxicity was investigated using primary cultured cortical neurons. Incubation with arsenite was found to cause cell death of primary cultured cortical neurons in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, arsenite induced caspase 3 activation and decreased procaspase 12 levels, indicating that apoptosis is involved in the arsenite-induced neurotoxicity. The oxidative mechanism underlying arsenite-induced neurotoxicity was investigated. Western blot assay showed that arsenite significantly increased HO-1 levels, a redox-regulated protein. Co-incubation with glutathione (10 mM) attenuated arsenite-induced HO-1 elevation and caspase 3 activation, suggesting that oxidative stress is involved in the arsenite-induced neurotoxicity. The neurotoxic effects of inorganic arsenics were compared; arsenite was more potent than arsenate in inducing HO-1 expression and caspase 3 activation. Moreover, the cell viabilities of arsenite and arsenate were 60 +/- 2 and 99 +/- 2 % of control, respectively. HO-1 siRNA transfection was employed to prevent arsenite-induced HO-1 elevation. At the same time, arsenite-induced caspase 3 activation and neuronal death were attenuated in the HO-1 siRNA-transfected cells. Taken together, HO-1 appears to be neuroprotective in the arsenite-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultured cortical neurons. In addition to antioxidants, HO-1 elevation may be a neuroprotective strategy for arsenite-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Diet in human health is no longer simple nutrition, but in light of recent research, especially nutrigenomics, it is linked via evolution and genetics to cell health status capable of modulating apoptosis, detoxification, and appropriate gene response. Nutritional deficiency and disease especially lack of vitamins and minerals is well known, but more recently, epidemiological studies suggest a role of fruits and vegetables, as well as essential fatty acids and even red wine (French paradox), in protection against disease. In the early 1990s, various research groups started considering the use of antioxidants (e.g., melatonin, resveratrol, green tea, lipoic acid) and metabolic compounds (e.g., nicotinamide, acetyl-l-carnitine, creatine, coenzyme Q(10)) as possible candidates in neuroprotection. They were of course considered on par with snake oil salesman (women) at the time. The positive actions of nutritional supplements, minerals, and plant extracts in disease prevention are now mainstream and commercial health claims being made are subject to regulation in most countries. Apart from efficacy and finding, the right dosages, the safety, and especially the level of purification and lack of contamination are all issues that are important as their use becomes widespread. From the mechanistic point of view, most of the time these substances replenish the body's deficiency and restore normal function. However, they also exert actions that are not sensu stricto nutritive and could be considered pharmacological especially that, at times, higher intake than recommended (RDA) is needed to see these effects. Free radicals and neuroinflammation processes underlie many neurodegenerative conditions, even Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Curcumin, carotenoids, acetyl-l-carnitine, coenzyme Q(10), vitamin D, and polyphenols and other nutraceuticals have the potential to target multiple pathways in these conditions. In summary, augmenting neuroprotective pathways using diet and finding new natural substances that can be more efficacious, i.e., induction of health-promoting genes and reduction of the expression of disease-promoting genes, could be incorporated into neuroprotective strategies of the future.

AB  - The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) involves probabilistic learning via monetary rewards and punishments, where advantageous task performance requires subjects to forego potential large immediate rewards for small longer-term rewards to avoid larger losses. Pathological gamblers (PG) perform worse on the IGT compared to controls, relating to their persistent preference toward high, immediate, and uncertain rewards despite experiencing larger losses. In this contribution, we review studies that investigated processes associated with poor IGT performance in PG. Findings from these studies seem to fit with recent neurocognitive models of addiction, which argue that the diminished ability of addicted individuals to ponder short-term against long-term consequences of a choice may be the product of an hyperactive automatic attentional and memory system for signaling the presence of addiction-related cues (e.g., high uncertain rewards associated with disadvantageous decks selection during the IGT) and for attributing to such cues pleasure and excitement. This incentive-salience associated with gambling-related choice in PG may be so high that it could literally "hijack" resources ["hot" executive functions (EFs)] involved in emotional self-regulation and necessary to allow the enactment of further elaborate decontextualized problem-solving abilities ("cool" EFs). A framework for future research is also proposed, which highlights the need for studies examining how these processes contribute specifically to the aberrant choice profile displayed by PG on the IGT.

AB  - Mitochondrial quality control is fundamental to all neurodegenerative diseases, including the most prominent ones, Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinsonism. It is accomplished by mitochondrial network dynamics - continuous fission and fusion of mitochondria. Mitochondrial fission is facilitated by DRP1, while MFN1 and MFN2 on the mitochondrial outer membrane and OPA1 on the mitochondrial inner membrane are essential for mitochondrial fusion. Mitochondrial network dynamics are regulated in highly sophisticated ways by various different posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolytic processing of their key-proteins. By this, mitochondria process a wide range of different intracellular and extracellular parameters in order to adapt mitochondrial function to actual energetic and metabolic demands of the host cell, attenuate mitochondrial damage, recycle dysfunctional mitochondria via the mitochondrial autophagy pathway, or arrange for the recycling of the complete host cell by apoptosis. Most of the genes coding for proteins involved in this process have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations in one of these genes are associated with a neurodegenerative disease that originally was described to affect retinal ganglion cells only. Since more and more evidence shows that other cell types are affected as well, we would like to discuss the pathology of dominant optic atrophy, which is caused by heterozygous sequence variants in OPA1, in the light of the current view on OPA1 protein function in mitochondrial quality control, in particular on its function in mitochondrial fusion and cytochrome C release. We think OPA1 is a good example to understand the molecular basis for mitochondrial network dynamics.

AB  - Many clinical studies have investigated the use of mental practice (MP) through motor imagery (MI) to enhance functional recovery of patients with diverse physical disabilities. Although beneficial effects have been generally reported for training motor functions in persons with chronic stroke (e.g., reaching, writing, walking), attempts to integrate MP within rehabilitation programs have been met with mitigated results. These findings have stirred further questioning about the value of MP in neurological rehabilitation. In fact, despite abundant systematic reviews, which customarily focused on the methodological merits of selected studies, several questions about factors underlying observed effects remain to be addressed. This review discusses these issues in an attempt to identify factors likely to hamper the integration of MP within rehabilitation programs. First, the rationale underlying the use of MP for training motor function is briefly reviewed. Second, three modes of MI delivery are proposed based on the analysis of the research protocols from 27 studies in persons with stroke and Parkinson's disease. Third, for each mode of MI delivery, a general description of MI training is provided. Fourth, the review discusses factors influencing MI training outcomes such as: the adherence to MI training, the amount of training and the interaction between physical and mental rehearsal; the use of relaxation, the selection of reliable, valid and sensitive outcome measures, the heterogeneity of the patient groups, the selection of patients and the mental rehearsal procedures. To conclude, the review proposes a framework for integrating MP in rehabilitation programs and suggests research targets for steering the implementation of MP in the early stages of the rehabilitation process. The challenge has now shifted towards the demonstration that MI training can enhance the effects of regular therapy in persons with subacute stroke during the period of spontaneous recovery.

AB  - Human genetics has indicated a causal role for the protein alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of familial Parkinson's disease (PD), and the aggregation of synuclein in essentially all patients with PD suggests a central role for this protein in the sporadic disorder. Indeed, the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein now defines multiple forms of neural degeneration. Like many of the proteins that accumulate in other neurodegenerative disorders, however, the normal function of synuclein remains poorly understood. In this article, we review the role of synuclein at the nerve terminal and in membrane remodeling. We also consider the prion-like propagation of misfolded synuclein as a mechanism for the spread of degeneration through the neuraxis.

AB  - Laboratory rats alternate between behaviorally active and inactive states every 1-2 h throughout the 24 hour day, the ultradian basic rest-activity cycle (BRAC). During the behaviorally active phases of the BRAC, brown adipose tissue (BAT) temperature, body and brain temperature, and arterial pressure and heart rate increase in an integrated manner. Since the BAT temperature increases are substantially greater than the corresponding body and brain temperature increases, BAT thermogenesis contributes to the body and brain temperature increases. When food is available ad libitum, eating commences approximately 15 min after the onset of an episodic increase in BAT temperature, and not at other times. If no food is available, the rat still disturbs the empty food container approximately 15 min after the onset of an episodic increase in BAT temperature, and not at other times. The increase in brain temperature that precedes eating may facilitate the cognitive processing that occurs during the search for food, when the rat engages with the external environment. Rather than being triggered by changes in levels of body fuels or other meal-associated factors, in sedentary laboratory rats with ad libitum access to food, meal initiation normally occurs as part of the centrally-programmed ultradian BRAC. BRAC-associated BAT temperature increases occur in a thermoneutral environment and they are not preceded by falls in body or brain temperature, so they are not homeostatic thermoregulatory responses. The pattern of integrated behaviors and physiological functions associated with the BRAC presumably reflects Darwinian natural selection, and homeostatic thermoregulatory explanations of the BRAC-associated changes in temperature should be considered in this context.

AB  - Background: There is increasing interest in promoting young people's health by modifying the school environment. However, existing research offers little guidance on how the school context enables or constrains students' health behaviours, or how students' backgrounds relate to these processes. For these reasons, this paper reports on a meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining: through what processes does the school environment (social and physical) influence young people's health?
   Methods: Systematic review of qualitative studies. Sixteen databases were searched, eliciting 62, 329 references which were screened, with included studies quality assessed, data extracted and synthesized using an adaptation of Noblit and Hare's meta-ethnographic approach.
   Results: Nineteen qualitative studies were synthesised to explore processes through which school-level influences on young people's health might occur. Four over-arching meta-themes emerged across studies focused on a range of different health issues. First, aggressive behaviour and substance use are often a strong source of status and bonding at schools where students feel educationally marginalised or unsafe. Second, health-risk behaviours are concentrated in unsupervised 'hotspots' at the school. Third, positive relationships with teachers appear to be critical in promoting student wellbeing and limiting risk behaviour; however, certain aspects of schools' organisation and education policies constrain this, increasing the likelihood that students look for a sense of identity and social support via health-risk behaviours. Fourth, unhappiness at school can cause students to seek sources of 'escape', either by leaving school at lunchtime or for longer unauthorized spells or through substance use. These meta-themes resonate with Markham and Aveyard's theory of human functioning and school organisation, and we draw on these qualitative data to refine and extend this theory, in particular conceptualising more fully the role of young people's agency and student-led 'systems' in constituting school environments and generating health risks.
   Conclusion: Institutional features which may shape student health behaviours such as lack of safety, poor student-staff relationships and lack of student voice are amenable to interventions and should be the subject of future investigation. Future qualitative research should focus on health behaviours which are under-theorised in this context such as physical activity, sexual and mental health.

AB  - Exposure to arsenic (As) is a global public health problem because of its association with various cancers and numerous other pathological effects, and millions of people worldwide are exposed to As on a regular basis. Increasing lines of evidence indicate that As may adversely affect the immune system, but its specific effects on immune function are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a literature search of non-cancer immune-related effects associated with As exposure and summarized the known immunotoxicological effects of As in humans, animals and in vitro models. Overall, the data show that chronic exposure to As has the potential to impair vital immune responses which could lead to increased risk of infections and chronic diseases, including various cancers. Although animal and in vitro models provide some insight into potential mechanisms of the As-related immunotoxicity observed in human populations, further investigation, particularly in humans, is needed to better understand the relationship between As exposure and the development of disease.

AB  - Purpose of reviewIn the last decade, a number of studies have been published to shed light on the interaction between neuroscience and the law, notably on the introduction of neuroscience data in forensic psychiatric evaluation (FPE). Even if there is a growing consensus on the relevance of neuroscience in clinical practice, the role of neuroscience in FPE is still controversial.Recent findingsThe use of neuroscience data in FPE can support the detection of psychopathological disabilities (e.g. deficit of self-control, aggressiveness) that may be involved in criminal action. Traumatic brain injury-related clinical disorders that may lead to misconduct have a relevant role in the debate. Traditionally, literature refers also to rare and weird cases in which brain tumours, infections and morphological abnormalities were supposed to be significantly associated with disorders leading to criminal action.SummaryAfter reviewing recent literature from both legal and neuroscientific perspectives, we consider a broader range of clinical conditions (e.g. disorders of consciousness in sleepwalking, dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease, misattributions of self in delusional experience) that may have implications in legal settings. Obviously, it would be possible to consider also different clinical conditions. We conclude by suggesting further experimental and theoretical analysis.

AB  - Background: Individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis have become a major focus for research designed to explore early predictors of transition to full psychosis. Characterizing differences in neurocognitive (NC) functioning between psychosis converters (CHR-C) and non-converters (CHR-NC) might contribute to the identification of specific NC predictors of psychosis onset. Therefore, the aim of the present meta-analysis was to compare the baseline NC performance between CHR-C and CHR-NC.
   Method: PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Embase and reference lists were searched for studies reporting baseline cognitive data of CHR-C and CHR-NC. Included NC tests were classified within the MATRICS - Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia - cognitive domains.
   Results: Of 95 studies assessed for eligibility, 9 studies comprising 583 CHR subjects (N CHR-C = 195, N CHR-NC = 388) met all the inclusion criteria. CHR-C performed significantly worse compared to CHR-NC on 2 MATRICS domains namely working memory (ES = -0.29, 95% CI = -0.53 to -0.05) and visual learning (ES = -0.40, 95% CI = -0.68 to -0.13). For the remaining 4 domains (processing speed, attention/vigilance, verbal learning, reasoning/problem solving) no significant differences between CHR-C and CHR-NC were observed.
   Conclusion: Based on the current meta-analytic data we might conclude that it is possible to differentiate between CHR-C and CHR-NC with respect to working memory and visual learning. The addition of visual learning and working memory tasks to psychosis regression models might contribute to the predictive power of these models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Research on hypochondriasis and other somatoform disorders (SFD) has provided evidence that patients with SFD tend to attribute their symptoms to organic dysfunctions or disease. However, recent studies appear to discredit this. There is no systematic evidence on whether patients with SFD predominantly rely on somatic attributions, despite calls to include somatic attributions as a positive criterion of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) in the upcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).
   Methods: This study is a systematic review of quantitative studies which assess the descriptive and predictive validity of somatic attribution in SFD. The literature search was restricted to studies with patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for SFD.
   Results: Somatic attribution style in SFD has acceptable descriptive but insufficient predictive validity. This confirms that the overlap between somatic and psychological attributions is often substantial. Attribution style can discriminate between SFD patients with and without comorbidity.
   Conclusion: A somatic attribution style does not qualify as a positive criterion in SSD. However, there is an urgent need for further research on causal illness perceptions in the full spectrum of medically unexplained symptoms in order to confirm this result. Given its high prevalence, research on psychological attribution style is warranted. Re-attribution does not provide a framework sophisticated enough to address the needs of patients in primary care.

AB  - Since the time of the first microbe hunters, primary culture and isolation of bacteria has been a foundation of microbiology. Like other microbial methods, bacterial culture and isolation methodologies continue to develop. Although fundamental concepts like selection and enrichment are as relevant today as they were over 100 yr ago, advances in chemistry, molecular biology and bacterial ecology mean that today's culture and isolation techniques serve additional supporting roles. The primary isolation of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) from environmental sources relies on enriching the target while excluding extensive background flora. Due to the complexity of environmental substrates, no single method can be recommended; however, common themes are discussed. Brilliant Green Bile Broth, with or without antibiotics, is one of many broths used successfully for selective STEC enrichment. Stressed cells may require a pre-enrichment recovery step in a nonselective broth such as buffered peptone water. After enrichment, immunomagnetic separation with serotype specific beads drastically increases the chances for recovery of STEC from environmental or insect sources. Some evidence suggests that acid treating the recovered beads can further enhance isolation. Although it is common in human clinical, food safety, and water quality applications to plate the recovered beads on Sorbitol MacConkey Agar, other chromogenic media, such as modified CHROMagar, have proven helpful in field and outbreak applications, allowing the target to be distinguished from the numerous background flora. Optimum conditions for each sample and target must be determined empirically, highlighting the need for a better understanding of STEC ecology.

   Method: We conducted a systematic literature search following the PRISMA-Statement in eleven databases including Medline, Web of Science and PsycINFO to address medical as well as psychological aspects of the relation between psychosocial work-stress models and HRV.
   Results: We identified 19 publications with a total of 8382 employees from ten countries reporting data from the years 1976-2008. Overall, nine of all studies report a negative and significant association between vagally-mediated HRV and measures of stress at work, while eight of all studies report a negative and significant association to mixed sympathetic and parasympathetic measures of HRV.
   Conclusions: This systematic review provides evidence that adverse psychosocial work conditions are negatively associated with ANS function as indexed by HRV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While it has been reported previously that the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) is a putative biological marker or a predictor of treatment response, there have been few studies of LDAEP in bipolar disorder. However, a recent study by Park and colleagues raised the possibility that the LDAEP could be useful as a biological marker of bipolar disorder. They found that the LDAEP was significantly higher in normal controls than in patients with either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Lee and colleagues also examined the LDAEP in bipolar disorder and normal controls, and found that it differed according to the bipolar phase, being significantly higher in cases of euthymic bipolar disorder, bipolar depression, and bipolar mania. With regard to treatment response, early clinical findings were that a higher LDAEP and a stronger intensity dependence of visual evoked potentials were related to a favorable response to lithium treatment. Juckel and colleagues recently demonstrated that the pretreatment LDAEP could be a predictor of successful prophylactic lithium treatment. The present article reviews the literature in order to determine whether the LDAEP can be used as a biological marker or a predictor of treatment response in patients with bipolar disorder and of manic switch or treatment resistance in patients with major depressive episode(s).

AB  - Serotonergic neurotoxicity following MDMA is well-established in laboratory animals, and neuroimaging studies have found lower serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users. Serotonin is a modulator for many different psychobiological functions, and this review will summarize the evidence for equivalent functional deficits in recreational users. Declarative memory, prospective memory, and higher cognitive skills are often impaired. Neurocognitive deficits are associated with reduced SERT in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. EEG and ERP studies have shown localised reductions in brain activity during neurocognitive performance. Deficits in sleep, mood, vision, pain, psychomotor skill, tremor, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status, have also been demonstrated. The children of mothers who take Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy have developmental problems. These psychobiological deficits are wide-ranging, and occur in functions known to be modulated by serotonin. They are often related to lifetime dosage, with light users showing slight changes, and heavy users displaying more pronounced problems. In summary, abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users can show deficits in a wide range of biobehavioral functions with a serotonergic component. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt) is a novel protein encoded by an intronless gene mapped to chromosome 5q23.1. Ferritin is ubiquitously expressed; however, FtMt expression is restricted to specific tissues such as the testis and the brain. The distribution pattern of FtMt suggests a functional role for this protein in the brain; however, data concerning the roles of FtMt in neurodegenerative diseases remain scarce. In the human cerebral cortex, FtMt expression was increased in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to control cases. Cultured neuroblastoma cells showed low-level expression of FtMt, which was increased by H2O2 treatment. FtMt overexpression showed a neuroprotective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and A beta-induced neurotoxicity in neuroblastoma cells. FtMt expression was also detected in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and was increased in patients with restless legs syndrome, while FtMt had a protective effect against cell death in a neuroblastoma cell line model of Parkinson's disease. FtMt is involved in other neurodegenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), with an FtMt gene mutation identified in AMD patients, and Friedreich's ataxia, which is caused by a deficiency in frataxin. FtMt overexpression in frataxin-deficient cells increased cell resistance to H2O2 damage. These results implicate a neuroprotective role of FtMt in neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a multi-factorial disease characterized by a high heritability and environmental risk factors. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers worldwide have started investigating the "two-hit hypothesis" of schizophrenia predicting that genetic and environmental risk factors (GxE) interactively cause the development of the disorder. This work is starting to produce valuable new animal models and reveal novel insights into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This mini review will focus on recent advancements in the field made by challenging mutant and transgenic rodent models for the schizophrenia candidate gene neuregulin 1 (NRG1) with particular environmental factors. It will outline results obtained from mouse and rat models for various Nrg1 isoforms/isoform types (e.g., transmembrane domain Nrg1, Type II Nrg1), which have been exposed to different forms of stress (acute versus chronic, restraint versus social) and housing conditions (standard laboratory versus minimally enriched housing). These studies suggest Nrg1 as a prime candidate for GxE interactions in schizophrenia rodent models and that the use of rodent models will enable a better understanding of GxE interactions and the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) form a common group of neurodevelopmental disorders appearing to be under polygenic control, but also strongly influenced by multiple environmental factors. The brain mechanisms responsible for ASD are not understood and animal models paralleling related emotional and cognitive impairments may prove helpful in unraveling them. BTBR T(+)tf/J (BTBR) mice display behaviors consistent with the three diagnostic categories for ASD. They show impaired social interaction and communication as well as increased repetitive behaviors. This review covers much of the data available to date on BTBR behavior, neuroanatomy and physiology in search for candidate biomarkers, which could both serve as diagnostic tools and help to design effective treatments for the behavioral symptoms of ASD.

AB  - Objective: From time to time misconceptions about violence risk assessment raise debate about the role mental health professionals play in managing aggression, with associated concerns about the utility of violence risk assessment. This paper will address some of the misconceptions about risk assessment in those with serious mental illness.
   Methods: The authors have expertise as clinicians and researchers in the field and based on their accumulated knowledge and discussion they have reviewed the literature to form their opinions.
   Results: This paper reflects the authors' views.
   Conclusion: There is a modest yet statistical and clinically significant association between certain types of mental illness and violence. Debate about the appropriateness of clinician involvement in violence risk assessment is sometimes based on a misunderstanding about the central issues and the degree to which this problem can be effectively managed. The central purpose of risk assessment is the prevention rather than the prediction of violence. Violence risk assessment is a process of identifying patients who are at greater risk of violence in order to facilitate the timing and prioritisation of preventative interventions. Clinicians should base these risk assessments on empirical knowledge and consideration of case-specific factors to inform appropriate management interventions to reduce the identified risk.

AB  - A common feature in most neurodegenerative diseases and aging is the progressive accumulation of damaged proteins. Proteins are essential for all crucial biological functions. Under some notorious conditions, proteins loss their three dimensional native conformations and are converted into disordered aggregated structures. Such changes rise into pathological conditions and eventually cause serious protein conformation disorders. Protein aggregation and inclusion bodies formation mediated multifactorial proteotoxic stress has been reported in the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Prion disease. Ongoing studies have been remarkably informative in providing a systematic outlook for better understanding the concept and fundamentals of protein misfolding and aggregations. However, the precise role of protein quality control system and precursors of this mechanism remains elusive. In this review, we highlight recent insights and discuss emerging cytoprotective strategies of cellular protein quality control system implicated in protein deposition diseases. Our current review provides a clear, understandable framework of protein quality control system that may offer the more suitable therapeutic strategies for protein-associated diseases.

AB  - Objective: Quality of life (QoL) is a growing issue in medicine, particularly in the evaluation of rehabilitative care. The concept of QoL is included in and expands the definition of health given by the WHO (World Health Organization) and comprises complete physical, mental, and social well-being. It expresses the degree of satisfaction in various areas as a result of the opportunities that arise during one's lifetime despite the restrictions and impediments that life itself puts forth. The last decade has exponentially increased the number of studies on QoL, although they are still limited.
   Methods: We performed a literature review on the QoL scales used in patients with neurological disorders.
   Results: Recent studies have shown the importance of QoL assessment because standard treatments do not assess the treatment impact felt by the patient. In fact, by understanding the impact of treatment on survival and QoL, one can make a clearer interpretation of the health of the patient.
   Conclusion: This review has adopted an innovative holistic methodological approach, which allowed a global evaluation of the comfort reported by the patients. The scales applied in this study allowed to choose the most suitable therapeutic strategies and programme individual therapeutic treatment.

AB  - Objectives: To consider what the barriers are to effective depression education; to understand what attitudes, knowledge, and skills doctors need to acquire, and finally to examine what we currently know about effective ways of training family physicians (FPs) about depression.
   Methods: A narrative review of the published literature compiled from searching reviews and original articles was conducted using the following key words: education, training, attitudes, depression, and primary care. Further relevant articles were identified from reference lists.
   Results: The identified barriers are FPs' attitudes and confidence toward recognizing and managing depression, the way in which they conceptualize depression, and the difficulties they face in implementing change in the systems in which they work. We, as educators, can identify what FPs need to know, and this should include novel ways of organizing care. However, of key importance is the need to address how more effective interventions may be provided, recognizing that FPs may be starting from many different points on 3 differing continua of attitude, skills, and knowledge in relation to depression.
   Conclusions: We have to not only ensure that the content of what we teach is perceived as relevant to primary care but also review exactly how we go about providing it, using methods that will engage and stimulate doctors at differing stages of readiness to acquire new attitudes, skills, and knowledge about depression. However, we still need to find better ways of helping FPs to recognize and acknowledge their educational needs. Further research is also required to thoroughly evaluate these novel approaches to tailoring educational interventions.

AB  - A person's judgeability, or the extent to which a person is easy to understand, plays an important role in how accurately a target will be perceived by others. Research on this topic, however, has not been systematic or well-integrated. The current review begins to remedy this by integrating the available research on judgeability from the fields of personality perception, nonverbal communication, and social cognition. Specifically, this review summarizes the characteristics that are likely to promote judgeability and explores its potential consequences. A diverse range of characteristics are identified as predictors of judgeability, all relating to three broader categories: psychological adjustment, social status, and socialization. Furthermore, being judgeable has a variety of potential, largely positive, consequences for the target, leaving good targets poised for greater personal and interpersonal well-being. Nevertheless, many questions on this topic remain and it is crucial for this relatively understudied topic to receive more systematic empirical attention.

Significant amount of work has been done in the past on drought resistance traits in rice crop, still the benefit of improved drought tolerant rice cultivars reaching the farmer's field is not very high and ways to expedite the development of drought tolerant and productive rice cultivars needs to be addressed. In this article, an assessment of easily practicable approach of managed stress screening and prospect of direct selection for yield under drought stress is discussed. Also the large effect yield QTLs identified for grain yield under drought stress field conditions is being reviewed for successful introgression into elite genetic background for developing drought tolerant cultivars with improved yield for the drought prone target environment.

AB  - The eyes are the window of the brain; various pathologies of the eyes can be explained on the basis of neurological disorders and vice versa. Today, our only approach for the management of glaucoma is intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, whether by pharmacological or surgical methods. Available methods may effectively control IOP but fall short of stopping the progression of glaucoma. IOP is just one of the risk factors our therapy addresses, so we need to work towards shifting our approach towards addressing other factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. Pathogenesis of glaucoma at molecular level can be compared with that of common neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinsonism. Targets for therapeutic intervention in chronic neurodegenerative diseases and glaucoma include apoptosis, axonal transport, free radical damage, role of polyunsaturated fatty acids, chaperones, gene regulation, etc. p38MAPK is a common pathway involved in all the neurodegenerative disease and glaucoma as well, and more research in this direction can be really beneficial for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic measures.

AB  - This review was conducted to assess the role of statins in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted meta-analysis using the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in patients who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, by conducting searches for RCTs in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane (up to 2012). An overall of five studies were included and analysed. The evaluation was done for some commonly evaluated clinical parameters like Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-CoG). Statistical evaluation was done as per method described by Neyeloff et al. and forest plots were plotted for each evaluated parameter. MMSE score showed a significant difference in favour of statins. ADAS-CoG and CGIC did not show a significant advantage for statins in comparison to placebo. Highly heterogeneous distribution was seen for MMSE score. Further trials need to be conducted to arrive at more robust results.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities may lead to the accumulation of inorganic and organic compounds in topsoils. Biota living in close contact with contaminated soils may experience stress at different levels of biological organization throughout the continuum from molecular to community level. Biological responses observed at the individual or infra-individual level of biological organization led to the development of biomarkers. The development of biomarkers consists often in evidencing biological modifications following a contaminant stress in laboratory conditions, using naive organisms and it is sometime proposed to use the biological state of individuals from sentinel species collected in the field to evaluate the level of environmental exposure. However, considering the possibility of local adaptation following long-term exposure, organisms response sampled in the field may substantially differ from laboratory specimens. In this review, we discuss this point focusing on the definition and validity of molecular biomarkers of metal pollution using earthworms of the Lumbricidae family. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mammalian glutamate dehydrogenase is an allosterically regulated enzyme that is central to glutamate metabolism. It contributes to important cellular processes, including Krebs cycle anaplerotic mechanisms, energy production, and ammonia homeostasis. In addition to this housekeeping hGDH1, humans have acquired through duplication an hGDH2 isoenzyme expressed in neural tissues with distinct regulatory properties. There is increasing evidence that deregulation of human GDHs leads to human disorders. Thus, in hGDH1, regulatory mutations that attenuate GTP inhibition can result in the hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia syndrome, which is often associated with epileptic seizures, mental retardation, and generalized dystonia. Also, transgenic overexpression of GLUD1 in neurons has resulted in age-dependent degeneration of the CA1 behippocampal region, associated with upregulation of -synuclein and other proteins linked to major human movement disorders. With regard to hGDH2, a rare T1492G variation in the GLUD2 gene, resulting in substitution of Ala for Ser445 in the regulatory domain of hGDH2, interacts significantly with Parkinson's disease (PD) onset. In two independent Greek and one North American PD cohorts, Ser445Ala hemizygous males, but not heterozygous females, developed PD 6-13 years earlier than subjects with other genotypes. The Ala445-hGDH2 variant displays increased catalytic activity that is amenable to inhibition by estrogens. Enhanced glutamate oxidation by Ala445-hGDH2 is thought to accelerate nigral cell degeneration in hemizygous males, and inhibition of the overactive variant by estrogens may protect heterozygous females. Hence, deregulation of hGDH1 and hGDH2 may play a role in degenerative processes, so these observations identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention in human disorders.

AB  - Cocaine exposure causes enduring neuroadaptations in ventral striatum, or nucleus accumbens (NAc), an area critically involved in reward learning and relapse of drug seeking. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in striatum are dichotomous in their expression of either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors, along with other receptors and neuropeptides. In dorsal striatum, these two subpopulations show non-overlapping innervation of distinct terminal fields via the direct or indirect pathways. However, NAc D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs are not fully segregated in this manner, with both cell types innervating ventral pallidum. Recent studies show that D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs play opposing roles in cocaine-associated behaviors. Further, cocaine induces differential adaptations in these two subpopulations in NAc, including changes to synaptic plasticity, glutamatergic signaling, and spine morphology.

AB  - Objectives. This review is to inform clinicians of currently available data on vilazodone for treating patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), focusing on its differential action mechanism and extended clinical utility. Methods. A data search was conducted in June 2012 using the PubMed/MEDLINE/relevant clinical trial databases with the key terms "vilazodone" or "Viibryd." Results. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vilazodone have been demonstrated in two pivotal 8-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies. Certain pharmacological characteristics of vilazodone were observed, including early onset of action, fewer sexual side effects, the absence of known cardiac toxicity, and minimal effect on weight gain, that may provide potential clinical advantages compared with currently available antidepressants. However, such possibilities should be replicated and confirmed in more well-designed and adequately powered clinical trials. Vilazodone requires dose titration up to 2 weeks to reach a target dose of 40 mg/d due to high rate of gastrointestinal side effects. No direct comparative studies with other antidepressants are currently available to confirm the aforementioned potential clinical utility. Conclusion. Vilazodone is a newer antidepressant possessing different action mechanisms compared to currently available antidepressants but whether it has superiority to other class of antidepressants in terms of efficacy and safety should still warrant further evaluation through more well-controlled and direct comparison clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric disorder that negatively impacts a large portion of the population. Although a range of antidepressant treatments have been developed, many patients are unable to obtain an adequate therapeutic response despite completing several antidepressant medication trials. As a result, neurostimulation treatment modalities have been developed as potential alternatives. This article provides an overview of advances in neurostimulation for treating depression.
   METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of the neurostimulation literature to identify recent findings involving the description and rationale, efficacy, and side effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), and deep brain stimulation (DBS).
   RESULTS: VNS and TMS are the newest neurostimulation modalities that have been approved by the FDA for treating depression. VNS is approved for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), while TMS has demonstrated efficacy only for milder forms of TRD. Despite demonstrated efficacy, further research is needed to address certain limitations and/or determine how best to utilize these forms of neurostimulation. Investigational forms of neurostimulation include MST and DBS. Although MST and DBS have demonstrated promise as a depression treatment, research is still being conducted to determine and/or enhance their antidepressant properties.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although electroconvulsive therapy remains the primary and most effective treatment option for patients with severe TRD, there have been considerable gains in the field of neurostimulation. Many of the neurostimulation techniques described in this review represent promising treatment alternatives for patients with TRD.

AB  - This article describes the emerging evidence of hormonal influence on epileptogenesis, which is a process whereby a brain becomes progressively epileptic due to an initial precipitating event of diverse origin such as brain injury, stroke, infection, or prolonged seizures. The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of epilepsy are poorly understood. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration appear to trigger epileptogenesis. There is an intense search for drugs that truly prevent the development of epilepsy in people at risk. Hormones play an important role in children and adults with epilepsy. Corticosteroids, progesterone, estrogens, and neurosteroids have been shown to affect seizure activity in animal models and in clinical studies. However, the impact of hormones on epileptogenesis has not been investigated widely. There is emerging new evidence that progesterone, neurosteroids, and endogenous hormones may play a role in regulating the epileptogenesis. Corticosterone has excitatory effects and triggers epileptogenesis in animal models. Progesterone has disease-modifying activity in epileptogenic models. The antiepileptogenic effect of progesterone has been attributed to its conversion to neurosteroids, which binds to GABA-A receptors and enhances phasic and tonic inhibition in the brain. Neurosteroids are robust anticonvulsants. There is pilot evidence that neurosteroids may have antiepileptogenic properties. Future studies may generate new insight on the disease-modifying potential of hormonal agents and neurosteroids in epileptogenesis.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients commonly exhibit a variety of comorbid traits including seizures, anxiety, aggressive behavior, gastrointestinal problems, motor deficits, abnormal sensory processing, and sleep disturbances for which the cause is unknown. These features impact negatively on daily life and can exaggerate the effects of the core diagnostic traits (social communication deficits and repetitive behaviors). Studying endophenotypes relevant to both core and comorbid features of ASD in rodent models can provide insight into biological mechanisms underlying these disorders. Here we review the characterization of endophenotypes in a selection of environmental, genetic, and behavioral rodent models of ASD. In addition to exhibiting core ASD-like behaviors, each of these animal models display one or more endophenotypes relevant to comorbid features including altered sensory processing, seizure susceptibility, anxiety-like behavior, and disturbed motor functions, suggesting that these traits are indicators of altered biological pathways in ASD. However, the study of behaviors paralleling comorbid traits in animal models of ASD is an emerging field and further research is needed to assess altered gastrointestinal function, aggression, and disorders of sleep onset across models. Future studies should include investigation of these endophenotypes in order to advance our understanding of the etiology of this complex disorder.

AB  - The psychological revolution that follows the onset of independent locomotion in the latter half of the infant's first year provides one of the best illustrations of the intimate connection between action and psychological processes. In this paper, we document some of the dramatic changes in perception-action coupling, spatial cognition, memory, and social and emotional development that follow the acquisition of independent locomotion. We highlight the range of converging research operations that have been used to examine the relation between locomotor experience and psychological development, and we describe recent attempts to uncover the processes that underlie this relation. Finally, we address three important questions about the relation that have received scant attention in the research literature. These questions include: (1) What changes in the brain occur when infants acquire experience with locomotion? (2) What role does locomotion play in the maintenance of psychological function? (3) What implications do motor disabilities have for psychological development? Seeking the answers to these questions can provide rich insights into the relation between action and psychological processes and the general processes that underlie human development.

AB  - Introduction: Recent models of psychosis implicate stressful events in its etiology. However, while evidence has accumulated for childhood trauma, the role of adult life events has received less attention. Therefore, a review of the existing literature on the relationship between life events and onset of psychotic disorder/experiences is timely. Methods: A search was conducted using PsychInfo, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science to identify studies of life events and the onset of psychosis or psychotic experiences within the general population. Given previous methodological concerns, this review included a novel quality assessment tool and focused on findings from the most robust studies. A meta-analysis was performed on a subgroup of 13 studies. Results: Sixteen studies published between 1968 and 2012 were included. Of these, 14 reported positive associations between exposure to adult life events and subsequent onset of psychotic disorder/experiences. The meta-analysis yielded an overall weighted OR of 3.19 (95% CI 2.15-4.75). However, many studies were limited by small sample sizes and the use of checklist measures of life events, with no consideration of contextual influences on the meaning and interpretation of events. Conclusions: Few studies have assessed the role of adult life events in the onset of psychosis. There was some evidence that reported exposure to adult life events was associated with increased risk of psychotic disorder and subclinical psychotic experiences. However, the methodological quality of the majority of studies was low, which urges caution in interpreting the results and points toward a need for more methodologically robust studies.

AB  - Background: Coronary heart disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Psychosocial factors such as depression and low social support are established risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with heart disease. However, little is known about the hypothetical relationship pattern between them.
   Purpose: The purposes of this narrative review are (1) to appraise the 2002-2012 empirical evidence about the multivariate relationship between depression, social support and health outcomes in patients with heart disease; (2) to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies.
   Method: PubMed and PsychINFO were searched for quantitative studies assessing the multiple effects of low social support and depression on prognosis outcomes in patients with heart disease. The following search terms were used: social relation*, cardiac disease, support quality, relationship, and relational support.
   Results: Five studies (three prospective cohort studies, one case-control study, and one randomization controlled trial) were selected and coded according to the types of support (social and marital). The majority of findings suggests that low social support/being unmarried and depression are independent risk factors for poor cardiac prognosis. However, all analyzed studies have some limitations. The majority of them did not focus on the quality of marital or social relationships, but assessed only the presence of marital status or social relationship. Moreover, some of them present methodological limitations.
   Conclusion: Depressive symptoms and the absence of social or marital support are significant risk factors for poor prognosis in cardiac patients and some evidence supports their independence in predicting adverse outcomes. Cardiac rehabilitation and prevention programs should thus include not only the assessment and treatment of depression but also a specific component on the family and social contexts of patients

AB  - Objective: No recent meta-analysis has examined the effects of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for adult depression. We decided to conduct such an updated meta-analysis.
   Methods: Studies were identified through systematic searches in bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane library). We included studies examining the effects of CBT, compared with control groups, other psychotherapies, and pharmacotherapy.
   Results: A total of 115 studies met inclusion criteria. The mean effect size (ES) of 94 comparisons from 75 studies of CBT and control groups was Hedges g = 0.71 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.79), which corresponds with a number needed to treat of 2.6. However, this may be an overestimation of the true ES as we found strong indications for publication bias (ES after adjustment for bias was g = 0.53), and because the ES of higher-quality studies was significantly lower (g = 0.53) than for lower-quality studies (g = 0.90). The difference between high-and low-quality studies remained significant after adjustment for other study characteristics in a multivariate meta-regression analysis. We did not find any indication that CBT was more or less effective than other psychotherapies or pharmacotherapy. Combined treatment was significantly more effective than pharmacotherapy alone (g = 0.49).
   Conclusions: There is no doubt that CBT is an effective treatment for adult depression, although the effects may have been overestimated until now. CBT is also the most studied psychotherapy for depression, and thus has the greatest weight of evidence. However, other treatments approach its overall efficacy.

AB  - Objective: Functional neuroimaging techniques represent fundamental tools in the context of translational research integrating neurobiology, psychopathology, neuropsychology, and therapeutics. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven its efficacy in the treatment of anxiety disorders and may be useful in phobias. The literature has shown that feelings and behaviors are mediated by specific brain circuits, and changes in patterns of interaction should be associated with cerebral alterations. Based on these concepts, a systematic review was conducted aiming to evaluate the impact of CBT on phobic disorders measured by functional neuroimaging techniques.
   Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted including studies published between January 1980 and April 2012. Studies written in English, Spanish or Portuguese evaluating changes in the pattern of functional neuroimaging before and after CBT in patients with phobic disorders were included.
   Results: The initial search strategy retrieved 45 studies. Six of these studies met all inclusion criteria. Significant deactivations in the amygdala, insula, thalamus and hippocampus, as well as activation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, were observed after CBT in phobic patients when compared with controls.
   Conclusion: In spite of their technical limitations, neuroimaging techniques provide neurobiological support for the efficacy of CBT in the treatment of phobic disorders. Further studies are needed to confirm this conclusion.

AB  - The history and phenomenology of hadronic parity nonconservation (PNC) is reviewed. We discuss the current status of the experimental tests and theory. We describe a reanalysis of the asymmetry for (p) over right arrow + p that, when combined with other experimental constraints and with a recent lattice QCD calculation of the weak pion nucleon coupling h(pi)(1). reveals a much more consistent pattern of PNC couplings. In particular, isoscalar coupling strengths are similar to but somewhat larger than the "best value" estimate of Donoghue, Desplanques, and Holstein, while both lattice QCD and experiment indicate a suppressed h(pi)(1). We discuss the relationship between meson-exchange models of hadronic PNC and formulations based on effective theory, stressing their general compatibility as well as the challenge presented to theory by experiment, as several of the most precise measurements involve significant momentum scales. Future directions are proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background:
   Adherence to a Mediterranean diet has been associated with lower risk of various age-related diseases including dementia. Although narrative reviews have been published, no systematic review has synthesized studies on the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and cognitive function or dementia.
   Methods:
   We conducted a systematic review of 11 electronic databases (including Medline) of published articles up to January 2012. Reference lists, selected journal contents, and relevant websites were also searched. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers using predefined criteria. Studies were included if they examined the association between a Mediterranean diet adherence score and cognitive function or dementia.
   Results:
   Twelve eligible papers (11 observational studies and one randomized controlled trial) were identified, describing seven unique cohorts. Despite methodological heterogeneity and limited statistical power in some studies, there was a reasonably consistent pattern of associations. Higher adherence to Mediterranean diet was associated with better cognitive function, lower rates of cognitive decline, and reduced risk of Alzheimer disease in nine out of 12 studies, whereas results for mild cognitive impairment were inconsistent.
   Conclusions:
   Published studies suggest that greater adherence to Mediterranean diet is associated with slower cognitive decline and lower risk of developing Alzheimer disease. Further studies would be useful to clarify the association with mild cognitive impairment and vascular dementia. Long-term randomized controlled trials promoting a Mediterranean diet may help establish whether improved adherence helps to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer disease and dementia.

Method: For review, PubMed, MEDLINE, ERIC, and Google Scholar searches identified six studies and six subsequent publications. In addition to five studies focusing on children with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV)-diagnosed ADHD, one study reports on adults. Results: SCP protocols utilize unipolar-electrode placement at Cz, randomized bidirectional signal regulation, feedback/transfer trials, and discrete feedback/rewards. Results demonstrated learning of SCP self-regulation, moderate to large within group effect sizes for core ADHD symptom reduction, and enhancement of event-related potentials/electroencephalogram components. Neurophysiological and session variables were predictive of treatment outcome, but open questions of specific and nonspecific effects remain. Study limitations and future directions are discussed. Conclusion: SCP is an efficacious and standardized neurofeedback protocol that addresses behavioral and neurophysiological deficits in ADHD.

AB  - Objective: Several practice guidelines recommend routine screening for psychological distress in cancer care. The objective was to evaluate the effect of screening cancer patients for psychological distress by assessing the (1) effectiveness of interventions to reduce distress among patients identified as distressed; and (2) effects of screening for distress on distress outcomes.
   Methods: CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE;PsycINFO, and SCOPUS databases were searched through April 6, 2011 with manual searches of 45 relevant journals, reference list review, citation tracking of included articles, and trial registry reviews through June 30, 2012. Articles in any language on cancer patients were included if they (1) compared treatment for patients with psychological distress to placebo or usual care in a randomized controlled trial (RCT); or (2) assessed the effect of screening on psychological distress in a RCT.
   Results: There were 14 eligible RCTs for treatment of distress, and 1 RCT on the effects of screening on patient distress. Pharmacological, psychotherapy and collaborative care interventions generally reduced distress with small to moderate effects. One study investigated effects of screening for distress On psychological outcomes, and it found no improvement
   Conclusion: Treatment studies reported modest improvement in distress symptoms, but only a single eligible study was found on the effects of screening cancer patients for distress, and distress did not improve in screened patients versus those receiving usual care. Because of the lack of evidence of beneficial effects of screening cancer patients for distress, it is premature to recommend or mandate implementation of routine screening. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Internet offers many opportunities to provide parenting support. An overview of empirical studies in this domain is lacking, and little is known about the design of web based parenting resources and their evaluations, raising questions about its position in the context of parenting intervention programs. This article is a systematic review of empirical studies (n = 75), published between 1998 and 2010, that describe resources of peer and professional online support for parents. These studies generally report positive outcomes of online parenting support. A number of recent experimental studies evaluated effects, including randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs (totaling 1,615 parents and 740 children). A relatively large proportion of the studies in our sample reported a content analysis of e-mails and posts (totaling 15,059 coded messages). The results of this review show that the Internet offers a variety of opportunities for sharing peer support and consulting professionals. The field of study reflects an emphasis on online resources for parents of preschool children, concerning health topics and providing professional support. A range of technologies to facilitate online communication is applied in evaluated Web sites, although the combination of multiple components in one resource is not very common. The first generation of online resources has already changed parenting and parenting support for a large group of parents and professionals. Suggestions for future development and research are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To provide a quantitative synthesis of randomized controlled trials examining the effect of exercise training on symptomatic fatigue in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar) were searched for articles published between 1960 and October 2012 by using the key words "fatigue," OR "tiredness," OR "energy," OR "mood," OR "lassitude," AND "exercise," OR "physical activity," OR "rehabilitation," OR "fitness" WITH "multiple sclerosis." The initial search resulted in 311 articles, of which 74 were reviewed in detail and 17 met the inclusion criteria and provided enough data to compute effect sizes (ESs; Cohen d). The meta-analysis was conducted using a meta-analysis software program, and a random-effects model was used to calculate the overall ES, expressed as Hedge g. Results: The weighted mean ES from 17 randomized controlled trials with 568 participants with MS was 0.45 (standard error = 0.12, 95% confidence interval = 0.22-0.68, z = 3.88, p <=.001). The weighted mean ES was slightly heterogeneous (Q = 29.9, df = 16, p=.019). Conclusions: The cumulative evidence supports that exercise training is associated with a significant small reduction in fatigue among persons with MS.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder that is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta resulting in dopamine deficiency in the striatum. Although majority of the PD cases are sporadic several genetic mutations have also been linked to the disease thus providing new opportunities to study the pathology of the illness. Studies in humans and various animal models of PD reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction might be a defect that occurs early in PD pathogenesis and appears to be a widespread feature in both sporadic and monogenic forms of PD. The genera] mitochondrial abnormalities linked with the disease include mitochondria] electron transport chain impairment, alterations in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, mitochondrial DNA mutations and anomaly in calcium homeostasis. Mitochondria are vital organelles with multiple functions and their dysfunction can lead to a decline in energy production, generation of reactive oxygen species and induction of stress-induced apoptosis. In this review, we give an outline of mitochondrial functions that are affected in the pathogenesis of sporadic and familial PD, and hence provide insights that might be valuable for focused future research to exploit possible mitochondria] targets for neuroprotective interventions in PD.

AB  - Purpose of review
   The Global Burden of Disease study 2010 (GBD 2010) estimated regional and global burden of 291 diseases and 67 risk factors. Here, we provide an overview of the methodological approach taken to this work, as well as the challenges and limitations encountered in deriving the burden of mental and drug use disorders.
   Recent findings
   GBD 2010 estimated the burden of 11 mental disorders and four drug use disorders for 21 regions. This involved a systematic literature search for epidemiological data; setting lay case definitions; synthesizing available epidemiological data into an internally consistent disease model; and quantifying the associated disability and health outcomes, to derive region, sex, year and age-specific burden estimates. Notable challenges included the difficulty in deriving culturally comparable case definitions for mental and drug use disorders, the paucity of epidemiological data and the difficulty in capturing disability associated with mental and drug use disorders.
   Summary
   GBD 2010 findings demonstrated the major public health importance of mental and drug use disorders. The methodology used to estimate burden was more sophisticated than previous GBD studies, with some restrictions required in order to achieve defensible numerical measures of burden for mental and drug use disorders.

AB  - Annual suicide rates of Hungary were unexpectedly high in the previous century. In our narrative review, we try to depict, with presentation of the raw data, the main descriptive epidemiological features of the Hungarian suicide scene of the past decades. Accordingly, we present the annual suicide rates of the period mentioned and also data on how they varied by gender, age, urban vs. rural living, seasons, marital status, etc. Furthermore, the overview of trends of other factors that may have influenced suicidal behavior (e. g., alcohol and tobacco consumption, antidepressant prescription, unemployment rate) in the past decades is appended as well. Based on raw data and also on results of the relevant papers of Hungarian suicidology we tried to explain the observable trends of the Hungarian suicide rate. Eventually, we discuss the results, the possibilities, and the future tasks of suicide prevention in Hungary.

AB  - Historically, episodic memory has been described as autonoetic, personally relevant, complex, context-rich, and allowing mental time travel. In contrast, semantic memory, which is theorized to be free of context and personal relevance, is noetic and consists of general knowledge off acts about the world. The field of comparative psychology has adopted this distinction in order to study episodic memory in non-human animals. Our aim in this article is not only to reflect on the concept of episodic memory and the experimental approaches used in comparative psychology to study this phenomenon, but also to provide a critical analysis of these paradigms. We conclude the article by providing new avenues for future research.

AB  - During development of the nervous system, the formation of connections (synapses) between neurons is dependent upon electrical activity in those neurons, and neurotrophic factors produced by target cells play a pivotal role in such activity-dependent sculpting of the neural networks. A similar interplay between neurotransmitter and neurotrophic factor signaling pathways mediates adaptive responses of neural networks to environmental demands in adult mammals, with the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) being particularly prominent regulators of synaptic plasticity throughout the central nervous system. Optimal brain health throughout the lifespan is promoted by intermittent challenges such as exercise, cognitive stimulation and dietary energy restriction, that subject neurons to activity-related metabolic stress. At the molecular level, such challenges to neurons result in the production of proteins involved in neurogenesis, learning and memory and neuronal survival; examples include proteins that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, protein quality control, and resistance of cells to oxidative, metabolic and proteotoxic stress. BDNF signaling mediates up-regulation of several such proteins including the protein chaperone GRP-78, antioxidant enzymes, the cell survival protein Bcl-2, and the DNA repair enzyme APEL Insufficient exposure to such challenges, genetic factors may conspire to impair BDNF production and/or signaling resulting in the vulnerability of the brain to injury and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Further, BDNF signaling is negatively regulated by glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids impair synaptic plasticity in the brain by negatively regulating spine density, neurogenesis and long-term potentiation, effects that are potentially linked to glucocorticoid regulation of BDNF. Findings suggest that BDNF signaling in specific brain regions mediates some of the beneficial effects of exercise and energy restriction on peripheral energy metabolism and the cardiovascular system. Collectively, the findings described in this article suggest the possibility of developing prescriptions for optimal brain health based on activity-dependent BDNF signaling.

Here we review the literature on adaptation effects of face stimuli to give an overview of existing findings in this area, highlight gaps in its research literature, initiate new directions in face adaptation research, and help to design future adaptation studies. Furthermore, this review should lead to better understanding of the processing characteristics as well as the mental representations of face-relevant information. The review systematizes studies at a behavioral level in respect of a framework which includes three dimensions representing the major characteristics of studies in this field of research. These dimensions comprise (1) the specificity of adapting face information, e.g., identity, gender, or age aspects of the material to be adapted to (2) aspects of timing (e.g., the sustainability of adaptation effects) and (3) transfer relations between face images presented during adaptation and adaptation tests (e.g., images of the same or different identities). The review concludes with options for how to combine findings across different dimensions to demonstrate the relevance of our framework for future studies.

AB  - The learning and memory deficits associated with non-pathological ageing mainly result from alterations to the plasticity of neuronal network dynamics within the hippocampus. In addition to the broad spectrum of changes that affect the morphology and function of hippocampal excitatory circuits in the ageing brain, the impaired activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDA-R) is a typical feature, altering the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation, a major form of synaptic plasticity. In addition to glutamate, the binding of a co-agonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding site is required for NMDA-R activation. This review presents recent evidence that: (i) the amino acid d-serine is an endogenous co-agonist of synaptic NMDA-R and necessary for long-term potentiation expression, (ii) reduced d-serine levels in the hippocampus contribute to synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in normal ageing, and (iii) age-related oxidative stress selectively targets hippocampal serine racemase to impact d-serine availability in neuronal networks. These results emphasize the critical role of the hippocampal d-serine-dependent pathway in changes affecting neuronal network dynamics in physiological ageing that underlie memory deficits. In addition, the central role of serine racemase in these changes opens new perspectives in the search for relevant therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing age-related memory defects.

AB  - The majority of women with a severe mental illness (SMI) become pregnant and have children. The aim of this systematic review and meta-synthesis was to examine the qualitative research on the experiences of motherhood in women with SMI from preconception decision making to being a mother. The experiences of the health professionals treating women with SMI were also reviewed. Eleven databases were searched for papers published up to April 25, 2012, using keywords and mesh headings. A total of 23 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria on the views of women with SMI, eight reported the views of health professionals including one which reported both. The meta-synthesis of the 23 studies on women's views produced two overarching themes Experiences of Motherhood and Experiences of Services. Sub-themes included the following: Guilt, Coping with Dual Identities, Stigma, and Centrality of Motherhood. Four themes emerged from the synthesis of the eight papers reporting the views of health professionals: Discomfort, Stigma, Need for education, and Integration of services. An understanding of the experiences of pregnancy and motherhood for women with SMI can inform service development and provision to ensure the needs of women and their families are met.

AB  - The Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD) is one of the most widely used instruments to measure insight into mental disorders. The aim of this study was to review all studies using the SUMD in the last 20 years. We performed an electronic search of MEDLINE using PubMed to identify all relevant studies published from 1993 to 2012. The following data were extracted from each article: characteristics of the SUMD (version, rating scale, scoring, and item/dimension used), methodological aspects (country, language, subject inclusion criteria, and sample size), and statistical methods to analyse insight. Of the 133 articles screened, 100 studies were included in the review. Fifty-two studies were published over the past five years. The SUMD was rarely used in its entirety, and the use of selected items or subscales was heterogeneous across studies. The studies also varied in terms of response modalities and in the use of 3- or 5-point Likert scales. The calculation of insight scores was highly variable and included the following: treating items as categorical or continuous variables, separate analysis of individual items, items expressed in terms of the sum total or the mean scores, and a range of score values used to define insight. This paper provides a systematic review of studies using the SUMD and reveals important differences in the versions used, the methods of calculation, and the interpretation of scores across studies. The use of a modified SUMD may compromise the psychometric properties of the scale, lead to erroneous conclusions, and prevents comparison of results across studies. Our review underlines the need for the standardised use of the SUMD.

TI  - Efficacy of supportive family interventions in bipolar disorder: a review of the literature
KW  - Bipolar disorder
KW  - Supportive family intervention
KW  - Psychoeducation, family burden
AB  - Background
   To review the efficacy of supportive family interventions for bipolar disorder on patients' clinical and social outcome and family functioning.
   Methods
   A review of the studies on supportive family interventions in bipolar disorder carried out in the last 20 years has been performed using the main databases. Searched keywords include "psychoeducational family intervention", "family therapy", "family supportive interventions", "caregivers"; these terms have been matched with "bipolar disorder", "affective disorders" or with "manic-depressive illness".
   Results
   The different approaches developed, alone or integrated with more complex treatment strategies, can improve the course of bipolar disorder, reduce the risk of relapses and hospitalizations and improve patient adherence to pharmacological treatment. Only few studies have tested the efficacy of these interventions on the reduction of suicidal ideation or in patients with an early onset of the disease. Supportive family interventions improve coping strategies of relatives and family burden.
   Conclusions
   Supportive family interventions should be an integral part of optimal management of bipolar disorder. Studies on the implementation of these interventions in routine practice are needed.

AB  - Background. There is strong evidence that those with a long-standing psychotic disorder have fewer social contacts and less social support than comparison groups. There is less research on the extent of social contacts and support prior to or at the onset of psychosis. In the light of recent evidence implicating a range of social experiences and contexts at the onset of psychosis, it is relevant to establish whether social networks and support diminished before or at the time of onset and whether the absence of such supports might contribute to risk, either directly or indirectly. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review of this literature to establish what is currently known about the relationship between social networks, support and early psychosis.
   Methods. We identified all studies investigating social networks and support in first episode psychosis samples and in general population samples with measures of psychotic experiences or schizotype by conducting systematic searches of electronic databases using pre-defined search terms and criteria. Findings were synthesized using non-quantitative approaches.
   Results. Thirty-eight papers were identified that met inclusion criteria. There was marked methodological heterogeneity, which limits the capacity to draw direct comparisons. Nonetheless, the existing literature suggests social networks (particularly close friends) and support diminished both among first episode samples and among non-clinical samples reporting psychotic experiences or with schizotype traits, compared with varying comparison groups. These differences may be more marked for men and for those from minority ethnic populations.
   Conclusions. Tentatively, reduced social networks and support appear to pre-date onset of psychotic disorder. However, the substantial methodological heterogeneity among the existing studies makes comparisons difficult and suggests a need for more robust and comparable studies on networks, support and early psychosis.

AB  - There is growing evidence that exposure to cooking oil fumes (COF) is linked to lung cancer. Existing literature on this risk was reviewed, specifically as it may relate to potentially at-risk populations such as Chinese immigrants and restaurant workers in the United States. Studies were identified by searching the NCBI database with key terms. All studies that examined the significance, prevalence, and/or mechanism(s) of the association between COF exposure and cancer (all types) were included. A majority of epidemiologic studies found associations between lung cancer and COF exposure. All studies that examined the mechanisms underlying the risk found evidence for mutagenic and/or carcinogenic compounds in COF extract and/or molecular mechanisms for COF-induced DNA damage or carcinogenesis. The evidence reviewed underscores the need to thoroughly investigate the association among at-risk groups in the United States, as well as to develop and assess concrete interventions to reduce these risks.

AB  - Aims and method To examine the association between the use of paroxetine during pregnancy and the risk of cardiovascular defects in the newborn. A systematic review of nine electronic databases was carried out and bibliographies were hand-searched for other relevant articles. Inclusion criteria for studies were the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the first trimester of pregnancy, with separate data available for paroxetine and cardiovascular defects in newborn babies. A randomeffect model was used to combine the data.
   Results A total of 11 studies were included in the analysis, concerning 4515 offspring who were exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester and 1 469 302 controls. In pooled analysis, paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy was slightly, but significantly, associated with a risk of cardiovascular malformations in the offspring (relative risk = 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.54). Separate analyses of case-control and cohort studies made this difference non-significant.
   Clinical implications This meta-analysis supports current guidelines advising not to use paroxetine in early pregnancy.

AB  - A systematic review was undertaken to assess the construct validity and responsiveness of four generic health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures in personality disorders (PDs). Ten databases were searched and reference lists scrutinized to identify relevant studies. Relevant data were extracted accordingly. A narrative synthesis was performed of the evidence on construct validity, including known groups validity (detecting differences in HRQL scores between two different groups), convergent validity (strength of association between generic HRQL), and other measures (e.g., symptom) and responsiveness (differences in generic HRQL measure scores in responders/nonresponders or correlation with changes in other measures). Ten studies were identified: six of the EQ-5D, two involving the SF-36, and another two the SF-12, but none with the SF-6D. Evidence indicated that the EQ-5D, SF-36, and SF-12 were probably valid measures with PDs. Four studies demonstrated that the EQ-5D Index was able to detect changes in patients. The authors conclude that generic HRQL measures appear appropriate for use with people with PDs in terms of psychometric performance. However, qualitative concerns remain as to whether they fully reflect the impact of the condition.

AB  - Actigraphy has become increasingly recognized as a useful method to study sleep/wake patterns and activity monitoring. It is a reliable tool for confirming a diagnosis and evaluating the effect of treatments for sleep problems in patients with primary psychiatric diagnoses such as schizophrenia. In addition, actigraphy is an objective measure that circumvents the lack of insight and often unreliable self-reporting of mental health related problems. However, the literature regarding the use of actigraphy in research and clinical applications related to severe psychiatric populations is scarce. Amalgamation of the evidence is needed to advance the use of actigraphy in psychiatry. We summarized the literature to date related to the use of actigraphy in patients with psychotic disorders, specifically schizophrenia. We conducted a systematic review of journal databases. Sixty-six studies emerged from the search of the electronic search engines, 14 were RCTs/case-control studies and 14 were review/guideline papers and others were case studies. Results of the RCT/case-control studies comparing the use of actigraphy with patients versus control-were summarized. Actigraphy not only allows for the objective evaluation of sleep habits and circadian rhythm disorders, but also helps to clarify and compare sleep and activity patterns among severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Additionally, actigraphy data can be used as an outcome measure for changes in sleep patterns either when primary psychotic disorders are treated and/or when the sleep disturbance associated with the psychotic disorder is treated. Finally, actigraphy serves as a supplementary tool to study neuropathology of movement-related psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia.

AB  - Evidence for a cerebellar role in non-motor functions has been demonstrated by clinical and neuroimaging research. These approaches do not allow causal relationships to be inferred though the experimental manipulation of the cerebellum. Transcranial magnetic and current stimulation may allow better understanding of the cerebellum via the temporary alteration of its operation in healthy volunteers. This review examined all studies of the cerebellar role in non-motor functions using non-invasive brain stimulation. Of 7585 papers captured by an initial search, 26 met specific selection criteria. Analysis revealed behavioural effects across learning, memory, cognition, emotional processing, perception and timing, though the results were not sufficiently similar as to offer a definitive statement of the cerebellum's role. The non-invasive application of stimulation to the cerebellum presents challenges due to surrounding anatomy and the relatively small target areas involved. This review analysed the methods used to address these challenges with a view to suggesting methodological improvements for the establishment of standards for the location of cerebellar stimulation targets and appropriate levels of stimulation.

AB  - There is still a considerable burden of occupational diseases and injuries in the world. It is not well known which interventions can effectively reduce the exposures at work that cause this burden. The objective of this article is to summarize evidence from systematic reviews of interventions to prevent occupational diseases and injuries. We included systematic reviews of interventions to reduce the incidence of work-related cancer, dust-related diseases, occupational asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noiseinduced hearing loss, back pain, and occupational injuries. We searched Medline and Embase with predefined search strategies to locate systematic reviews of these interventions. We found 23 systematic reviews of which the results are also applicable to low-and middle income countries. Effective measures to reduce exposure leading to work-related cancer, dust-related diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noise, and injuries are available. However, better implementation of these measures is needed. Regulation, enforcement of regulation, and incentives for employers are effective interventions to achieve this goal. There is evidence that feedback and rewards for workers help in reducing occupational injuries. There is no evidence in many studies that back pain can be prevented. Personal protective equipment technically has the potential to reduce exposure but this is difficult to put into effect. There is no evidence in the studies regarding the effectiveness of education and training, preventive drugs, or health examinations. There is evidence that the implementation of technical measures enforced by regulation can prevent occupational diseases and injuries. For other interventions such as education or health examinations, there is no evidence that supports their effectiveness. More systematic reviews are needed in the area of injury prevention.

AB  - The intertidal zone of tropical islands is particularly poorly known. In contrast, temperate locations such as California's Monterey Bay are fairly well studied. However, even in these locations, studies have tended to focus on a few species or locations. Here we present the results of the first broadscale surveys of invertebrate, fish and algal species richness from a tropical island, Oahu, Hawaii, and a temperate mainland coast, Central California. Data were gathered through surveys of 10 sites in the early 1970s and again in the mid-1990s in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, California, and of nine sites in 20012005 on Oahu. Surveys were conducted in a similar manner allowing for a comparison between Oahu and Central California and, for California, a comparison between time periods 24years apart. We report a previously undocumented richness of intertidal species in both locations: 516 for Oahu and 801 for Central California. Surprisingly, when differences in search efforts are controlled, overall (alpha) diversity appears to be similar between locations, although site level (beta) diversity is much higher in California. Species richness in California generally increased along a wave exposure gradient and distance from an urban area. Much higher numbers of both invasive and endemic species were found on Oahu. In California, more invertebrate species were found in the 1990s, likely due to an improvement in taxonomic resources since the 1970s, and species composition was different in the two surveys due to the high incidence of rare species. Although some southern species increased in number between the two time periods and some northern species decreased, we detected little evidence of change favoring southern or northern species. These results are in line with recent findings that water temperatures in the Monterey Bay have been in a cooling trend since the 1980s, in contrast to many locations elsewhere in the world.

AB  - Extensive research has identified stereotypic behavioral and biological abnormalities in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as heightened autonomic activity, an exaggerated startle response, reduced basal cortisol levels and cognitive impairments. We have reviewed primary research in this area, noting that factors involved in the susceptibility and expression of PTSD symptoms are more complex and heterogeneous than is commonly stated, with extensive findings which are inconsistent with the stereotypic behavioral and biological profile of the PTSD patient. A thorough assessment of the literature indicates that interactions among myriad susceptibility factors, including social support, early life stress, sex, age, peri- and post-traumatic dissociation, cognitive appraisal of trauma, neuroendocrine abnormalities and gene polymorphisms, in conjunction with the inconsistent expression of the disorder across studies, confounds attempts to characterize PTSD as a monolithic disorder. Overall, our assessment of the literature addresses the great challenge in developing a behavioral and biomarker-based diagnosis of PTSD. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We propose that neglect includes a disorder of representational updating. Representational updating refers to our ability to build mental models and adapt those models to changing experience. This updating ability depends on the processes of priming, working memory, and statistical learning. These processes in turn interact with our capabilities for sustained attention and precise temporal processing. We review evidence showing that all these non-spatial abilities are impaired in neglect, and we discuss how recognition of such deficits can lead to novel approaches for rehabilitating neglect.

AB  - Background: The fear of crime may have negative consequences for health and wellbeing. It is influenced by factors in the physical and social environment. This study aimed to review and synthesize qualitative evidence from the UK on fear of crime and the environment.
   Methods: Eighteen databases were searched, including crime, health and social science databases. Qualitative studies conducted in the UK which presented data on fear of crime and the environment were included. Quality was assessed using Hawker et al.'s framework. Data were synthesized thematically.
   Results: A total of 40 studies were included in the review. Several factors in the physical environment are perceived to impact on fear of crime, including visibility and signs of neglect. However, factors in the local social environment appear to be more important as drivers of fear of crime, including social networks and familiarity. Broader social factors appear to be of limited relevance. There is considerable evidence for limitations on physical activity as a result of fear of crime, but less for mental health impacts.
   Conclusions: Fear of crime represents a complex set of responses to the environment. It may play a role in mediating environmental impacts on health and wellbeing.

AB  - Human HSP27 (HSPB1) is a molecular chaperone sensor which, through dynamic changes in its phosphorylation and oligomerization, allows cells to adapt to changes in their physiology and/or mount a protective response to injuries. In pathological conditions, the high level of HSPB1 expression can either be beneficial, such as in diseases characterized by cellular degenerations, or be malignant in cancer cells where it promotes tumourigenesis, metastasis and anti-cancer drug resistance. Structural changes allow HSPB1 to interact with specific client protein partners in order to modulate their folding/activity and/or half-life. Therefore, the search is open for therapeutic compounds aimed at either down- or upregulating HSPB1 activity. In this respect, we have previously described two peptide aptamers (PA11 and PA50) that specifically interact with HSPB1 small oligomers and decrease its anti-apoptotic and tumourigenic activities. A novel analysis of the different HSPB1-interacting aptamers that were isolated earlier revealed that one aptamer (PA23) has the intriguing ability to stimulate the protective activity of HSPB1. We show here that this aptamer abolishes the dominant negative effect induced by the R120G mutant of alpha B-crystallin (HSPB5) by disrupting its interaction with HSPB1. Hence, developing structure-based interfering strategies could lead to the discovery of HSPB1-based therapeutic drugs.

   Methods and results: Major bibliographic databases were searched for quantitative studies meeting inclusion criteria. After screening, narrative synthesis and a quality review were applied. Forty-eight studies met the eligibility criteria. While the findings were inconclusive for associations between alcohol use and deprivation, poverty, income, unemployment, social disorder and crime, there was some indication that social capital characteristics were protective.
   Conclusions: Social capital has a potentially important association with reducing alcohol use. Further studies are required to better understand social influences on alcohol use. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Describe the rates of suicidal ideation, self-injury, and suicide among detained youth as well as risk factors and preventive measures that have been attempted. Method: Literature searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Social Science Citation Index were undertaken to identify published studies written in English. Governmental data was also included from English-speaking nations. Results: The adjusted risk of suicide was 3 to 18 times higher than age-matched controls. The prevalence of lifetime suicidal ideation ranged from 16.9% to 59% while lifetime self-injury ranged from 6.2% to 44%. Affective disorders, borderline personality traits, substance use disorders, impulse control disorders, and anxiety disorders were associated with suicidal thoughts and self-injury. Screening for suicidal ideation upon entry was associated with a decreased rate of suicide. Conclusions: All youth should be screened upon admission. Identified co-morbid disorders should also be treated.

AB  - Learning Objectives: After participating in this educational activity, the reader should be better able to evaluate the empirical evidence for pre/post changes in psychoanalysis patients with complex mental disorders, and assess the limitations of the meta-analysis.
   Background: The effectiveness of psychoanalysis is still a controversial issue, despite increasing research efforts.
   Objective: To investigate the empirical evidence for psychoanalysis by means of a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of the research data.
   Method: A systematic literature search was undertaken to find studies regarding the effectiveness of psychoanalysis, published between 1970 and 2011. A meta-analysis was performed.
   Results: Fourteen studies (total n = 603) were included in the meta-analysis. All but one were pre/post cohort studies. At treatment termination, the mean pre/post effect size across all outcome measures was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.50; p < .01). The mean pre/post effect size for symptom improvement was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.20-1.84; p < .01), and for improvement in personality characteristics 1.08 (95% CI, 0.89-1.26; p < .01). At follow-up the mean pre/follow-up effect size was 1.46 across all outcome measures (95% CI, 1.08-1.83; p < .01), 1.65 for symptom change (95% CI, 1.24-2.06; p < .01), and 1.31 for personality change (95% CI, 1.00-1.62; p < .01).
   Conclusions: A limited number of mainly pre/post studies, presenting mostly completers analyses, provide empirical evidence for pre/post changes in psychoanalysis patients with complex mental disorders, but the lack of comparisons with control treatments is a serious limitation in interpreting the results. Further controlled studies are urgently needed.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature on quality of life (QoL) in borderline personality disorder (BPD) by examining the use of QoL instruments, the extent of QoL impairments in BPD, and the impact of treatment on QoL in BPD.
   Methods: Studies were identified through PubMed and PsycINFO searches for articles from 1980 to 2011 using the following keywords: quality of life OR health-related quality of life OR QOL OR HRQOL AND borderline personality disorder. We focused our search on studies that actually measured QoL. Two authors agreed independently on including 25 studies that met specific selection criteria.
   Results: The data on QoL in BPD are still sparse, with high heterogeneity in the instruments used to measure QoL, which decreases the comparability of existing studies. EQ-5D, WHOQOL, SF-36, Satisfaction Profile, and Q-LESQ have been utilized as QoL measures in BPD research. The reviewed studies uniformly demonstrated grave impairments in QoL of BPD patients. The available evidence indicates that BPD treatments improve not only psychiatric symptoms but also QoL, as shown by psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy studies. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether current treatments are able to restore QoL to community norms.
   Conclusions: QoL is gaining more importance as an outcome measure of psychiatric interventions. Research evidence confirms that QoL is seriously impaired in BPD and that QoL improves with treatment. Further research is needed to build a consensus on the utilization of QoL measures and to improve their validity in BPD. More importantly, future studies need to develop and test interventions to improve QoL in BPD.

AB  - To systematically analyse evidence on the incremental effect of work-related psychosocial risk factors on the development of neck and shoulder disorders, as reported in longitudinal studies.
   A systematic literature search was conducted in three data bases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO) until May 2009. The quality assessment leading to a methodological quality score of the included studies was conducted by two independent reviewers using a standardised checklist. Criteria for the evaluation of evidence were established. Heterogeneity analyses were conducted.
   Altogether 18 prospective longitudinal studies were included in the analysis. Potential psychosocial risk factors were mainly based on the job demand control (support) model by Karasek (1998). Study results were too heterogeneous to deduce pooled risk estimates. But the weight of evidence was strong for an incremental effect of job demands, job control, social support, and job strain, on the development of neck and/or shoulder disorders.
   While we found evidence for an incremental effect of different psychosocial work factors (in addition to the effect of physical job factors), these results have to be interpreted carefully in order to support the notion that psychological factors can have an independent causal influence on the development of musculoskeletal disorders. Nevertheless, our findings are important for the development of preventive strategies, as they stress the need for preventive approaches that tackle both physical and psychosocial factors. Future research is warranted to consolidate and strengthen the results of this review.

AB  - Patients experiencing an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have a three times higher chance to develop depression. Vice versa, depressive symptoms increase the risk of cardiovascular events. The co-existence of both conditions is associated with substantially worse prognosis. Although the underlying mechanism of the interaction is largely unknown, inflammation is thought to be of pivotal importance. AMI-induced peripheral cytokines release may cause cerebral endothelial leakage and hence induces a neuroinflammatory reaction. The neuroinflammation may persist even long after the initial peripheral inflammation has subsided. Among those selected brain regions that are prone to blood-brain barrier dysfunction, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), a major center for cardiovascular autonomic regulation, is indicated to play a mediating role. Optimal cardiovascular therapy improves cardiovascular prognosis without major effects on depression. By the same token, antidepressant therapy in cardiovascular disease is associated with modest improvement in depressive symptoms, however without improvement in cardiac outcome. The failure of current antidepressants and the growing number of patients suffering from both conditions legitimize the search for better antidepressive therapies, from patients as well as society perspectives. Though we appreciate the mutual character of the interaction between depression and AMI, the present review focuses on the side of AMI induced depression and discusses the role of inflammation, represented by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, as potential underlying mechanism. It is conceivable that inhibition of the inflammatory response post-AMI, through targeted anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapeutical agents may prevent the development of depressive symptoms and ultimately may improve cardiovascular outcomes.

AB  - Background: Several studies have been conducted in Iran in order to investigate the prevalence of depression among infertile couples. However, there is a remarkable diversity among the results. This meta-analysis was conducted to estimate an overall prevalence rate of depression among infertile couples in Iran.
   Methods: International and national electronic databases were searched up to June 2011 including MEDLINE, Science Citation Index Expanded, Scopus, SID, MagIran, and IranMedex as well as conference databases. Furthermore, reference lists of articles were screened and the studies' authors were contacted for additional references. Cross-sectional studies addressing the prevalence of depression among infertile couples were included in this meta-analysis. We assessed 12 separate studies involving overall 2818 participants of which 1251 had depression.
   Results: Overall prevalence rate of depression among infertile couples was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.55). The prevalence rate of depression was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.56) during 2000 to 2005 and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.57 during 2006 to 2011. The prevalence rate of depression was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.53) among women and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.54) among men.
   Conclusion: Not only the prevalence of depression in infertile couples was high but also had increasing growth in recent years. Furthermore, despite many studies conducted addressing the prevalence of depression in infertile couples, there is however a remarkable diversity between the results. Thus, one can hardly give a precise estimation of the prevalence rate of depression among infertile couples in Iran now.

AB  - Objectives: To estimate risk of comorbid depression on all-cause mortality over time among individuals with diabetes.
   Methods: The Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched through September 30, 2012. We limited our search to longitudinal or prospective studies reporting all-cause mortality among those having depression and diabetes, compared with those having diabetes alone that used hazard ratios (HRs) as the main outcome. Two reviewers independently extracted primary data and evaluated the quality of studies using predetermined criteria. The pooled random effects adjusted HRs were estimated using meta-analysis. The impact of moderator variables on study effect size was examined with meta-regression.
   Results: A total of 42,363 respondents from 10 studies were included in the analysis. Depression was significantly associated with risk of mortality (pooled HR=1.50, 95% confidence interval=1.35-1.66). Little evidence for heterogeneity was found across the studies (Cochran Q=13.52, P=.20, I-2=26.03). No significant possibility of publication bias was detected (Egger's regression intercept=0.98, P=.23).
   Conclusion: Depression significantly increases the risk of mortality among individuals with diabetes. Early detection and treatment of depression may improve health outcomes in this population. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
