AB  - Extant evidence indicates that individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) are differentially affected by overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity. Excess weight is associated with a more complex illness presentation, non-recovery, and recurrence. Herein, we sought to review literature describing the effects of structured individualized physical exercise on disparate neurobiological substrates implicated in the pathophysiology of BD. We conducted a PubMed search of all English-language articles published between 1966 and July 2008 with BD cross-referenced with the following search terms: exercise, neurobiology, pathophysiology, pathoetiology, brain, cognition, neuroplasticity, and neurodegeneration. Articles selected for review were based on adequacy of sample size, the use of standardized experimental procedures, validated assessment measures, and overall manuscript quality. Contemporary models of disease pathophysiology in BD implicate disturbances in cellular resilience, plasticity, and survival in the central nervous system. Individualized exercise interventions are capable of alleviating the severity of affective and cognitive difficulties in heterogeneous samples. It is posited that exercise is a pleiotropic intervention that engages aberrant neurobiological systems implicated in metabolism, immuno-inflammatory function, and cellular respiration. Structured exercise regimens exert a salutary effect on interacting networks mediating metabolism, immuno-inflammatory function, and cellular respiration. In keeping this view, buttressed by controlled evidence describing robust anti-depressant effects with exercise (e.g., public health dose), a testable hypothesis is that structured exercise is capable of improving psychiatric and somatic health in BD.

AB  - Objective: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics lasting at least a year in duration. Children with TS often experience comorbid conditions Such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit disorder. The goal of this article was to review the long-term clinical Course of tics and comorbid conditions in children with TS. Method: We conducted a traditional literature search to locate relevant articles regarding long-term outcome and prognosis in TS and tic disorders. Results: Tics typically have an onset between the ages of 4 and 6 years and reach their worst-ever severity between the ages of 10 and 12 years. On average, tic severity declines during adolescence. By early adulthood, roughly three-quarters of children with TS will have greatly diminished tic symptoms and over one-third will be tic free. Comorbid conditions such as OCD and other anxiety and depressive disorders, are more common during the adolescence and early adulthood of individuals with TS than in the general population. Conclusion: Although tics are the sine qua non of TS, they are often not the most enduring or impairing symptoms in children with TS. Measures used to enhance self-esteem, such its encouraging strong friendships and the exploration of interests, are crucial to ensuring positive adulthood Outcome in TS.

AB  - In a phylogenetic perspective, the phenomenal and the functional aspects of consciousness cannot be separated because consciousness, as a phenomenal experience, must be causally effective. The hypothesis I propose is that the fundamental property of consciousness consists of a self-organizing process: the differentiation of a content. The differentiation of a content occurs on the basis of the relations internal to a representational whole, which behaves like a field and tends towards a condition of equilibrium. This hypothesis can be somehow considered an extension of Gestalt Visual perceptual theory. Unlike neurocomputational processes. which are non-conscious and extrinsic to the representation, conscious processes are intrinsic to the representational whole. Consciousness, as an intrinsically self-organizing process interwoven with its phenomenal aspects, can be more than epiphenomenal and it can be involved in mental function. The paper then discusses the implications of this hypothesis for subjectivity and the explanatory gap. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The striatum is thought to play a central role in learning how to choose acts that lead to reward and avoid punishment. Dopamine-dependent modification of striatal synapses in the action selection circuitry has long been thought to be a key step toward this type of learning. The development of new genetic and optical tools has pushed this field forward in the last couple of years, demanding a re-evaluation of models of how experience controls dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity and how disease states like Parkinson's disease affect the striatal circuitry.

AB  - Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by impairing episodes of mania and depression. Twin studies have established that bipolar disorder is among the most heritable of medical disorders and efforts to identify specific susceptibility genes have intensified over the past two decades. The search for genes influencing bipolar disorder has been complicated by a paucity of animal models, limited understanding of pathogenesis, and the genetic and phenotypic complexity of the syndrome. Linkage studies have implicated several chromosomal regions as harboring relevant genes, but results have been inconsistent. It is now widely accepted that the genetic liability to bipolar disorder reflects the action of many genes of individually small effect, a scenario for which linkage studies are poorly suited. Thus, association studies, which are more powerful for the detection of modest effect loci, have become the focus of gene-finding research. A large number of candidate genes, including biological candidates derived from hypotheses about the pathogenesis of the disorder and positional candidates derived from linkage and cytogenetic studies, have been evaluated. Several of these genes have been associated with the disorder in independent studies (including BDNF, DAOA, DISCI, GRIK4, SLC6A4, and TPH2), but none has been established. The clinical heterogeneity of bipolar disorder and its phenotypic and genetic overlap with other disorders (especially schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and major depressive disorder) have raised questions about the optimal phenotype definition for genetic studies. Nevertheless, genome-wide association analysis, which has successfully identified susceptibility genes for a variety of complex disorders, has begun to implicate specific genes for bipolar disorder (DGKH, CACNA1C, ANK3). The polygenicity of the disorder means that very large samples will be needed to detect the modest effect loci that likely contribute to bipolar disorder. Detailed genetic dissection of the disorder may provide novel targets (both pharmacologic and psychosocial) for intervention. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Imaging techniques are a potentially powerful method of identifying phenotypes that are associated with, or are indicative of, a vulnerability to developing major depressive disorder (MDD). Here we identify seven promising MDD-associated traits identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET). We evaluate whether these traits are state-independent, heritable endophenotypes, or state-dependent phenotypes that may be useful markers of treatment efficacy. In MDD, increased activity of the amygdala in response to negative stimuli appears to be a mood-congruent phenomenon, and is likely moderated by the 5-HT transporter gene (SLC6A4) promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR). Hippocampal volume loss is characteristic of elderly or chronically-ill samples and may be impacted by the val66met brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene variant and the 5-HTTLPR SLC6A4 polymorphism. White matter pathology is salient in elderly MDD cohorts but is associated with cerebrovascular disease, and is unlikely to be a useful marker of a latent MDD diathesis. Increased blood flow or metabolism of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), together with gray matter volume loss in this region, is a well-replicated finding in MDD. An attenuation of the usual pattern of fronto-limbic connectivity, particularly a decreased temporal correlation in amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity, is another MDD-associated trait. Concerning neuroreceptor PET imaging, decreased 5-HT1A binding potential in the raphe, medial temporal lobe, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been strongly associated with MDD, and may be impacted by a functional single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the 5-HT1A gene (HTR1A: -1019 C/G; rs6295). Potentially indicative of inter-study variation in MDD etiology or mood state, both increased and decreased binding potential of the 5-HT transporter has been reported. Challenges facing the field include the problem of phenotypic and etiological heterogeneity, technological limitations, the confounding effects of medication, and non-disease related inter-individual variation in brain morphology and function. Further advances are likely as epigenetic, copy-number variant, gene-gene interaction, and genome-wide association (GWA) approaches are brought to bear on imaging data.

AB  - Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma protein mostly known for being the transporter of thyroxine and retinol. When mutated, TTR is also well-described as the cause of familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a neurodegenerative lethal disorder characterized by systemic deposition of TTR amyloid fibrils, particularly in the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies have determined that besides its carrier properties,TTR is an important protein in peripheral and central nervous system physiology, namely by participating in behavior, in the maintenance of normal cognitive processes during ageing, amidated neuropeptide processing and nerve regeneration. Additionally, it has been proposed that TTR is neuroprotective in Alzheimer's disease, by preventing the formation of amyloid beta fibrils. With the advent of powerful screening techniques, TTR has also been linked to a number of other pathological conditions, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, among others. These associations, together with the recently unraveled nervous system-related functions, suggest that the relevance of TTR in physiology, particularly in neurobiology, is undervalued and that additional research in this field is needed. The aim of this review is to integrate in a critical perspective the current scattered knowledge concerning TTR most and less acknowledged functions and its association with several neuropathologies.

AB  - Objective:
   Children and adolescents with schizophrenia share a similar pattern of phenomenological, genetic and cognitive abnormalities to adults with schizophrenia. However, an early-onset of schizophrenia (EOS) (prior to 18 years of age) is associated with a higher frequency of risk indicators associated with schizophrenia (e.g. developmental delays and familial spectrum disorders) and a worse long-term outcome. This overview examines recent research on the neurobiological alterations, possible causes, developmental trajectory and treatment of EOS and attempts to identify gaps in the field.
   Method:
   The authors provide a selective review of major findings from genetics, neuroimaging and treatment studies of pediatric schizophrenia that were presented at a workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health. These data are synthesized in conjunction with preclinical studies into a model of the pathophysiology of EOS.
   Results:
   EOS is associated with a high frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g. velocardiofacial syndrome, sex chromosome anomalies) and other rare denovo chromosomal aberrations. Brain imaging research in adolescents with EOS has revealed a progressive loss of cortical grey matter post-onset of psychosis and subtle abnormalities in white matter microstructure. Although EOS patients are more likely to be treatment-refractory than their adult counterparts, there are substantial data that this subgroup is particularly responsive to clozapine.
   Conclusions:
   Genetic or environmental factors operating during adolescence that reduce frontal capacity might contribute to an EOS in susceptible individuals. Additional longitudinal studies of adolescents with schizophrenia are needed to better understand the relationship between structural changes in fronto-limbic regions, stress responsivity, and cognitive and neurochemical development.

AB  - Clinical experience suggests that longstanding personality characteristics as a person's most distinctive features of all are likely to play a role in how someone with dementia copes with his increasing deficiencies. Personality characteristics may have a pathoplastic effect on both behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPS) or on cognition as well as cognitive decline.
   Cognitive disorders accompanied by BPS are a tremendous burden for both the patient and their proxies. This review suggests that premorbid personality characteristics are co-determinants of BPS in cognitive disorders, but much effort is needed to clarify whether or not specific premorbid personality traits are associated with specific BPS as no strong links have so far emerged. This review further shows that a growing field of research is interested in the links not only between quite short-lived emotional states and cognitive processes, but also between longstanding personality traits and cognition in both healthy individuals and patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, a few studies found that specific premorbid personality traits may be risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases.
   However, research findings in this area remain scarce despite a huge literature on personality and cognitive disorders in general. An important shortcoming that hampers so far the progress of our understanding in these domains is the confusion in the literature between longstanding premorbid personality traits and transient personality changes observed in neurodegenerative diseases. Few studies have based their assessments on accepted personality theories and carefully investigated premorbid personality traits in patients with cognitive disorders, although assessing personality may be complicated in these patients.
   Studying the impact of personality characteristics in cognitive disorders is an especially promising field of research in particular when concomitantly using neurobiological approaches, in particular structural brain imaging and genetic studies as suggested by as yet rare studies.
   Improved understanding of premorbid personality characteristics as determinants of both BPS or cognitive capacities or decline is likely to influence our attitudes towards the treatment of demented patients and ultimately to help in alleviating a patient's and their proxies' burden.

   The aim of this study was to critically review the literature in order to determine if Theory of Mind (ToM) impairment can be considered a trait-marker for schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder (BD).
   Method:
   After a thorough literature search, we reviewed the empirical studies investigating ToM impairments in remitted schizophrenia patients, first episode patients, subjects at high-risk (HR) for psychosis and first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. Studies investigating ToM impairment in other schizophrenia spectrum conditions, affective psychosis and BD were also reviewed.
   Results:
   ToM abnormalities exist at onset and continue throughout the course of schizophrenia, persist into remission, and while less severe, are apparent in HR populations. Mentalizing impairments are also observed in other forms of psychotic illness and BD.
   Conclusion:
   Mentalizing impairment in schizophrenia spectrum disorders and BD might reflect underlying general cognitive deficits and residual symptom expression, rather than representing a specific trait-marker.

AB  - Objective: Although the fact that brain diseases can cause behavioral, cognitive and emotional changes is well-established, a field specifically addressing this area has been slow to develop. A proper nomenclature that places this field in a proper position within the larger field of psychiatry has also been difficult to arrive at. In this article the development of concepts and nomenclature related to disorders on the border between Neurology and Psychiatry is reviewed.
   Methods: Both the evolution of the "organicity'' concepts in the DSM system as well as the parallel development in the actual clinical field of Neuropsychiatry are examined.
   Results: The author concludes that while the field of Psychiatry in general continues to struggle with the mind-body dualism problem, classification of neuropsychiatric disorders does not seem to be influenced by this issue. The subspecialty field of Neuropsychiatry continues to evolve rapidly with a subspecialty certification already in place.
   Conclusions and recommendations: The author supports the use of the term "Neuropsychiatric'' to refer to the subgroups of psychiatric disorders directly or indirectly resulting from manifest brain pathology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   To conduct a critical review of recent empirical research regarding mood, behaviour and nutrition factors including essential fatty acids, macronutrients, micronutrients and food additives.
   Method
   A literature search of databases Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL and Embase up to October 2008. The search emphasised empirical research published in the last 10 years and also included older literature. Studies in both adults and children were addressed.
   Results
   Research into omega-3 fatty acids has been substantial but evidence for their potential in treating mood and behaviour is modest. In comparison, there has been much less research into carbohydrate and protein intakes and little evidence for their ability to influence mood and behaviour. Recent trials with food additives suggest their removal from the diet may benefit susceptible children with hyperactivity disorders. Micronutrient supplementation appears to improve mood only in those who were initially deficient in micronutrients.
   Conclusions
   More stringent research designs such as longitudinal studies and the use of biologically inert placebos within randomised controlled trials are needed before supplemental use of omega-3 fatty acids to treat disorders of mood and behaviour can be recommended. Caution is advised regarding the indiscriminate use of diets free of artificial food additives in managing hyperactivity disorders, as they may place an undue burden on individuals and their families. Should omega-3 fatty acid supplementation or the elimination of certain food additives be established as effective, they may provide cost-effective, accessible and well-tolerated adjuncts to standard psychiatric treatments for mood and behavioural disturbances.

AB  - Aim: To explore the influence of occupational stress on mental health in off-shore oil production. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 561 Chinese off-shore oil workers. The workers were invited to fill in a self-administered questionnaire exploring their socio-demographic characteristics, occupational stress levels, and 12-item general health questionnaire. A hierarchical multiple regression procedure was used to assess the effects of occupational stress on mental health. Results: After controlling for age, educational level, marital status and years of off-shore work, poor mental health was found to have a significant positive association with seven of the nine identified sources of occupational stress. They were: conflict between job and family/social life, poor development of career and achievement at work, safety problems at work, management problems and poor relationship with others at work, poor physical environment of the work place, uncomfortable ergonomic factors at work, and poor organizational structure at work. All of these occupational stress sources together explained 19.9% of the total variance. Conclusions: The results confirmed that occupational stress was a major risk factor for poor mental health among Chinese off-shore oil workers. Reducing or eliminating occupational stressors at work would benefit workers' mental health.

AB  - The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a functionally heterogeneous region involved in diverse cognitive and emotional processes that support goal-directed behaviour. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropathological findings over the past two decades have converged to suggest abnormalities in the region may represent a neurobiological basis for many of the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia. However, while each approach offers complimentary information that can provide clues regarding underlying patholophysiological processes, the findings from these 2 fields are seldom integrated. In this article, we review structural neuroimaging and neuropathological studies of the ACC, focusing on the unique information they provide. The available imaging data suggest grey matter reductions in the ACC precede psychosis onset in some categories of high-risk individuals, show sub-regional specificity, and may progress with illness duration. The available post-mortem findings indicate these imaging-related changes are accompanied by reductions in neuronal, synaptic, and dendritic density, as well as increased afferent input, suggesting the grey matter differences observed with MRI arise from alterations in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissue compartments. We discuss the potential mechanisms that might facilitate integration of these findings and consider strategies for future research.

AB  - Given the profound negative public health effects of major depressive disorder (MDD), and data suggesting only modest effectiveness of existing psychological and pharmacological treatments for this condition, there has been increasing interest in exploring the antidepressant potential of non-pharmacological, brain-based interventions, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). The use of the DBS for psychiatric indications follows a decade of data suggesting that DBS is an effective, evidence-based strategy for the treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. At the present time there is open-label case series data to suggest that DBS in the subgenual cingulate gyrus, ventral caudate/ventral striatum, and the nucleus accumbens, is associated with antidepressant effects in individuals who fail to respond to conventional treatments for MDD. However a number of unresolved issues about the optimal use of DBS for MDD remain, such as the optimal anatomical placement of the electrodes and the mechanisms of its antidepressant effects. This review summarizes the clinical experience of DBS for treatment resistant depression (TRD). The rationale for the use of DBS for TRD is reviewed in the context of the growing neuroimaging literatures exploring the biomarkers of antidepressant response, and the neural substrates of emotional regulation in both normal and pathological states.

AB  - A multi-proxy investigation (loss-on-ignition, major and trace elements, pollen, plant macrofossil and siliceous algae) was carried out on the sediment of a crater lake (Lake Saint Ana, 950 m a.s.l.) from the Eastern Carpathian Mountains. Diatom-based transfer functions were applied to estimate the lake's trophic status and pH, while reconstruction of the water-depth changes was based on the plant macrofossil and diatom records. The lowest Holocene water depths were found between 9000 and 7400 calibrated BP years, when the crater was occupied by Sphagnum-bog. Significant increases in water depth were found from 5350(1), 3300(2) and 2700 cal yr BP. Of these, the first two coincided with major terrestrial vegetation changes, namely (1) the establishment of Carpinus betulus on the crater slope and (2) the replacement of the lakeshore Picea abies forest by Fagus sylvatica. The chemical record indicated significant soil changes along with the canopy changes (from coniferous to deciduous) that led to increased in-lake productivity and pH. A further increase in water depth around 2700 cal yr BP resulted in stable thermal stratification and hypolimnetic anoxia that via P-release further increased in-lake productivity and eventually led to phytoplankton blooms with large populations of Scenedesmus. High productivity was depressed by anthropogenic lakeshore forest clearances from ca. 1000 cal yr BP that led to the re-establishment of P. abies on the lakeshore and consequent acidification of the lake water. On the whole, these data suggest that Lake Saint Ana is a vulnerable ecosystem: in-lake productivity is higher under deciduous canopy and litter, and considerably repressed by coniferous canopy and litter. The lake today subsists in a managed environment that is far from its natural state. This would be a dense F. sylvatica forest supplying more nutrients and keeping up a more productive in-lake flora and fauna.

AB  - Dolphins live in aquatic environments that differ greatly from our terrestrial environments. Several studies have demonstrated that dolphins have complex cognitive abilities comparable to those of great apes. No comparative cognitive studies of dolphins were conducted in Japan until the mid-1990s, but several pioneering works on dolphin comparative brain studies in Japan had already implied the higher cognitive ability of dolphins by the 1940s. Research in this field is now increasing gradually. This paper provides an overview of comparative cognitive studies of dolphins conducted in Japan, in order to promote dolphin cognition studies in Japan in the future. It begins with a brief history of dolphin cognitive studies in Japan, which is followed by case studies of visual, acoustic, and social cognition, and a discussion of future studies.

AB  - Objective: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Canada is estimated to be 1% and expected to increase during the next decade. Mental illness, particularly depression, is common among HCV-infected patients and remains an obstacle to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment. We summarize the risk factors for interferon-alpha-induced major depressive disorder (IFN-alpha-MDD) in HCV patients and the evidence for antidepressant prophylaxis and symptomatic antidepressant treatment of depression.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL for randomized controlled or quasi-experimental trials evaluating antidepressant prophylactic and symptomatic treatment approaches for depression emerging during IFN-alpha treatment. Manual searches of references listed in review articles, case series, and anecdotal reports supplemented our literature search.
   Results: A total of 9 trials involving prophylactic and symptomatic treatment approaches for IFN-alpha-MDD are summarized in our review. Antidepressant pretreatment is beneficial for patients with elevated baseline depressive symptoms and a preexisting history of IFN-alpha-MDD. Although limited evidence exists for several antidepressant agents, much of the evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are safe and efficacious in treating depressive symptoms secondary to IFN-alpha therapy.
   Conclusion: Both antidepressant pretreatment and symptomatic treatment are viable strategies for treating IFN-alpha-MDD. Improved treatment outcomes and early identification of depression during HCV treatment can be achieved using an integrated medical and mental health treatment approach.

AB  - Ocean acidification from the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is expected to have deleterious consequences for many calcifying marine animals. Forecasting the vulnerability of these marine organisms to climate change is linked to an understanding of whether species possess the physiological capacity to compensate for the potentially adverse effects of ocean acidification. We carried out a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of the physiological response of larvae of a calcifying marine invertebrate, the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to CO2-driven seawater acidification. In lab-based cultures, larvae were raised under conditions approximating current ocean pH conditions (pH 8.01) and at projected, more acidic pH conditions (pH 7.96 and 7.88) in seawater aerated with CO2 gas. Targeting expression of similar to 1000 genes involved in several biological processes, this study captured changes in gene expression patterns that characterize the transcriptomic response to CO2-driven seawater acidification of developing sea urchin larvae. In response to both elevated CO2 scenarios, larvae underwent broad scale decreases in gene expression in four major cellular processes: biomineralization, cellular stress response, metabolism and apoptosis. This study underscores that physiological processes beyond calcification are impacted greatly, suggesting that overall physiological capacity and not just a singular focus on biomineralization processes is essential for forecasting the impact of future CO2 conditions on marine organisms. Conducted on targeted and vulnerable species, genomics-based studies, such as the one highlighted here, have the potential to identify potential 'weak links' in physiological function that may ultimately determine an organism's capacity to tolerate future ocean conditions.

AB  - The field of Internet-supported therapeutic interventions has suffered from a lack of clarity and consistency. The absence of professional leadership and of accepted governing approaches, terminology, professional standards, and methodologies has caused this field to be diffused and unstructured. Numerous terms have been used to label and describe the activities conducted over the Internet for mental and physical health purposes: web-based therapy, e-therapy, cybertherapy, eHealth, e-Interventions, computer-mediated interventions, and online therapy (or counseling), among others.
   Following a comprehensive review, we conceptualized Internet-supported interventions, using four categories based on prime practice approaches: web-based interventions, online counseling and therapy, Internet-operated therapeutic software, and other online activities (e.g., as supplements to face-to-face therapy). We provide a working definition and detailed description of each category, accompanied by numerous examples.
   These categories may now serve as guiding definitions and related terminologies for further research and development in this emerging field.

AB  - Depression is a family of complex and multifactorial illnesses that are characterized by disruptions in the functioning of a number of physiological, neuroendocrine and behavioral processes. Of these, sleep disturbance and circadian rhythm abnormalities constitute the most prevalent signs of depressive illness. Difficulty in falling asleep, decreases in total sleep time and sleep efficiency, early morning awakenings, and rapid eye movement sleep alterations are all commonly seen in depressed patients. Advances or delays in the phase of circadian rhythms have been documented in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder and patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The disturbances in the amplitude and rhythm of melatonin secretion that occur in patients with depression resemble those seen in subjects with chronobiological disorders. The finding that insomnia and circadian rhythm abnormalities are prominent features in depression suggests that a close link exists between melatonin secretion disturbance and depressed mood. This inference has been further strengthened by the finding that agomelatine, a recently introduced melatonergic agent with a novel mechanism of action, has beneficial effects in patients with MDD, bipolar disorder or SAD. Among agomelatine's characteristics are a rapid onset of action and a pronounced effectiveness for improving sleep efficiency and correcting circadian rhythm abnormalities. Disruptions in melatonin secretion or availability may be the common factor, which underlies depressive disorder and its prominent signs and symptoms such as sleep and circadian rhythm abnormalities.

AB  - Alterations in brain plasticity are increasingly thought to play important roles in major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicide. To gain a better understanding of the gross structural changes observed in the brains of major depressed and suicide subjects, a number of recent investigations have scrutinized the cellular integrity of brain regions implicated in mood disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the microscopic features of neuronal and glial cell populations in these different brain regions, namely the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, raphe nucleus and locus coeruleus. In general, evidence from this burgeoning field supports the hypothesis of altered cell plasticity in MDD and suicide occurring mainly in key fronto-limbic areas. Interestingly, reported morphometric and cell density alterations are generally region-specific and implicate several neuromodulatory systems. notably GABAergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic and glutamatergic pathways. Cell-specific changes involve reductions in densities of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, while increases in microglial densities have also been reported. Furthermore, increases in neuronal densities have been found in subcortical regions. The implication of such findings for our understanding of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of MDD and suicide are discussed, and the strengths and weaknesses of morphological approaches used to analyse human postmortem brain tissues are evaluated.

AB  - Some core symptoms of major depression show a circathan rhythm in their clinical manifestations or are closely linked to the circadian system functioning, such as sleep-wake cycle. Moreover, abnormalities in circadian rhythmicity of core body temperature and some endocrine-metabolic parameters have been detected in depressive patients compared to healthy controls. The circadian rhythm disturbances described in depressive states as well as the efficacy and fast onset of action of chronobiological based treatments point out the circadian system as an important therapeutic target in the treatment of depression. The aim of this work is to review the biological and clinical data that link major depression to circadian rhythm abnormalities, the mechanisms that may underlie the abnormalities of circadian rhythm physiology seen in depressive states and the different therapeutic approaches to depression that involve the circadian system in their mechanisms of action.

AB  - Violent behavior appears to result from a complex web of interacting genetic as well as environmental factors. Psychopathy is a strong predictor for relapse in violent acts. The current review shed light on rapidly expanding knowledge in brain imaging related to violent behavior and psychopathy. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane and Psyclnfo combining the key words: mentally disordered offender/aggression/violence/crime/forensic psychiatry/brain imaging neuroimaging/IMRI/MRI/PET/SPECT/lack of empathy/psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder. The reviewed material, which consisted of 48 articles, indicates a rather strong consensus on the connection between dysfunctional parts of the frontal and temporal lobes and violent antisocial behavior and psychopathy. In future studies, it would be useful to focus on the limbic system and to investigate which pans of the frontal lobes and cerebral networks that are of interest in the psychopathic personality. Moreover, the reviewed material highlights some of the methodological difficulties in this area of research such as selection bias in the recruitment of patients, inadequate matching of control subjects, and sometimes incongruous results. In the future we hope that brain imaging can be used to map biological deviations in different offenders in order to try to learn more about the different mechanisms behind violent behaviors.

AB  - Background
   Early worsening of anxiety, agitation and irritability are thought to be common among people commencing antidepressants, especially for anxiety disorders. This phenomenon, which may be termed jitteriness/anxiety syndrome, is cited as an explanation for early treatment failure and caution in using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, we believe that it is inconsistently defined and that robust evidence to support the phenomenon is lacking.
   Aims
   To review systematically all evidence relating to jitteriness/anxiety syndrome to identify: constituent symptoms; medications implicated; disorders in which it was reported; incidence; time course; management strategies; relationship of this syndrome to therapeutic response; distinction between syndrome and akathisia; relationship between syndrome and suicide; and genetic predispositions.
   Method
   A systematic search identified articles and these were included in the review if they addressed one of the above aspects of jitteriness/anxiety syndrome.
   Results
   Of 245 articles identified, 107 articles were included for review, No validated rating scales for jitteriness/anxiety syndrome were identified. There was no robust evidence that the incidence differed between SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, or that there was a higher incidence in anxiety disorders. Published incidence rates varied widely from 4 to 65% of people commencing antidepressant treatment. Common treatment strategies for this syndrome included a slower titration of antidepressant and the addition of benzodiazepines. Conclusive evidence for the efficacy of these strategies is lacking. There was conflicting and inconclusive evidence as to whether the emergence of this syndrome had a predictive value on the response to treatment, it appears to be a separate syndrome from akathisia, but evidence for this assertion was limited. The effect of jitteriness/anxiety syndrome on suicide rates has not been evaluated. Three studies examined genetic variations and side-effects from treatment, but none was specifically designed to assess jitteriness/anxiety syndrome.
   Conclusions
   Jitteriness/anxiety syndrome remains poorly characterised. Despite this, clinicians' perception of this syndrome influences prescribing and it is cited to support postulated mechanisms of drug action. We recommend systematised evaluation of side-effects at earlier time points in antidepressant trials to further elucidate this clinically important syndrome.

AB  - This paper focuses on the potential of mental simulation (mentally rehearsing an action to enhance performance) as a useful contemporary educational method. By means of a meta-review, it is examined which conditions impede or facilitate the effectiveness of mental simulation (MS). A computer search was conducted using Ovid PsycINFO. Reviews, meta-reviews, or meta-analyses published between 1806 and 2006 were included. The current paper presents the results of ten publications in which about 630 studies on mental simulation or mental practice are reviewed. According to the analyses, conditions that influence the effect of MS are the type of skill practiced, personal factors, time per trial, amount of trials, and instructional procedures. Based on these insights, it is reflected upon in which areas MS would be functional with regard to contemporary educational demands, such as for emotional, behavioral, and (other) complex cognitive tasks.

AB  - Males and females learn and remember differently at different times in their lives. These differences occur in most species, from invertebrates to humans. We review here sex differences as they occur in laboratory rodent species. We focus on classical and operant conditioning paradigms, including classical eyeblink conditioning, fear-conditioning, active avoidance and conditioned taste aversion. Sex differences have been reported during acquisition, retention and extinction in most of these paradigms. In general, females perform better than males in the classical eyeblink conditioning, in fear-potentiated startle and in most operant conditioning tasks, such as the active avoidance test. However, in the classical fear-conditioning paradigm, in certain lever-pressing paradigms and in the conditioned taste aversion, males outperform females or are more resistant to extinction. Most sex differences in conditioning are dependent on organizational effects of gonadal hormones during early development of the brain, in addition to modulation by activational effects during puberty and adulthood. Critically, sex differences in performance account for some of the reported effects on learning and these are discussed throughout the review. Because so many mental disorders are more prevalent in one sex than the other, it is important to consider sex differences in learning when applying animal models of learning for these disorders. Finally, we discuss how sex differences in learning continue to alter the brain throughout the lifespan. Thus, sex differences in learning are not only mediated by sex differences in the brain, but also contribute to them. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The field of behavioral neuroendocrinology has generated thousands of studies that indicate differences in brain structure and reactivity to gonadal steroids that produce sex-specific patterns of social behavior. However, rapidly emerging evidence shows that genetic polymorphisms and resulting differences in the expression of neuroactive peptides and receptors as well as early-life experience and epigenetic changes are important modifiers of social behavior. Furthermore, due to its inherent complexity, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying sex differences in social behavior are usually studied in a tightly regulated laboratory setting rather than in complex environments. Importantly, specific hormones may elicit a range of different behaviors depending on the cues present in these environments. For example, individuals exposed to a psychosocial stressor may respond differently to the effects of a gonadal steroid than those not exposed to chronic stress. The objective of this review is not to re-examine the activational effects of hormones on sex differences in social behavior but rather to consider how genetic and environmental factors modify the effects of hormones on behavior. We will focus on estrogen and its receptors but consideration is also given to the role of androgens. Furthermore, we have limited our discussions to the importance of oxytocin and vasopressin as targets of gonadal steroids and how these effects are modified by genetic and experiential situations. Taken together. the data clearly underscore the need to expand research initiatives to consider gene-environment interactions for better understanding of the neurobiology of sex differences in social behavior.

AB  - This article reviews the literature focusing on the relationship between perceived threat to life and risk-taking behaviors. The review of empirical data, garnered from field studies and controlled experiments, suggests that personal threat to life results in elevated risk-taking behavior. To account for these findings, this review proposes a number of theoretical explanations. These frameworks are grounded in divergent conceptual models: coping with stress, emotion regulation, replenishing of lost resources through self-enhancement, modifications of key parameters of cognitive processing of risky outcomes, and neurocognitive mechanisms. The review concludes with a number of methodological considerations, as well as directions for future work in this promising area of research.

School of Physiotherapy, Curtin University of Technology, Australia-Objectives: Spinal pain is a significant occupational health issue. Whilst neck pain and low back pain have received considerable attention, thoracic spinal pain (TSP) has not. The objective of this study was to systematically identify and report the evidence describing the prevalence and correlates of TSP within occupational groups. Methods: This literature review systematically searched for reports of TSP prevalence and associated factors for TSP in working adult cohorts using nine electronic databases. Studies were evaluated for level of evidence and epidemiologic data were narratively synthesised. Results: 52 studies were identified describing 65 cohorts covering manual labourers, office workers, health professionals, manufacturing and industrial workers, drivers, military personnel and performing artists. Prevalence varied with occupational group and time period. One year prevalence of TSP ranged from 3.0-55.0%, with most occupational groups having medians around 30%. Significant odds ratios for individual (concurrent musculoskeletal disorders, exercising, pre-menstrual tension and female gender), general work-related (high work load, high work intensity, perceiving ergonomic problems in the workplace, working in some specialised areas, performing boring/tedious work tasks, certain year levels of study, employment duration, driving specialised vehicles, and a high number of flying hours), physical work-related (manual physiotherapy tasks, climbing stairs and high physical stress) and psychosocial work-related (perceived risk of injury and high mental pressure) factors were reported.Conclusions: The high median prevalence rates suggest TSP may be a significant occupational health problem. The multiple domains of associated factors point to the need for prospective research encompassing these domains to inform targeted occupational interventions. (J Occup Health 2009; 51: 177-192)

AB  - Stress hormones released by an experience can modulate memory strength via the basolateral amygdala, which in turn acts on sites of memory storage such as the cerebral cortex [McGaugh, J. L (2004). The amygdala modulates the consolidation of memories of emotionally arousing experiences. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 27, 1-28]. Stimuli that acquire behavioral importance gain increased representation in the cortex. For example, learning shifts the tuning of neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) to the frequency of a conditioned stimulus (CS), and the greater the level of CS importance, the larger the area of representational gain [Weinberger, N. M. (2007). Associative representational plasticity in the auditory cortex: A synthesis of two disciplines. Learning & Memory, 14(1-2), 1-16]. The two lines of research suggest that BLA strengthening of memory might be accomplished in part by increasing the representation of an environmental stimulus. The present study investigated whether stimulation of the BLA can affect cortical memory representations. In male Sprague-Dawley rats studied under urethane general anesthesia, frequency receptive fields were obtained from A1 before and up to 75 min after the pairing of a tone with BLA stimulation (BLAstm: 100 trials, 400 ms, 100 Hz, 400 mu A [+/- 16.54]). Tone started before and continued after BLAstm. Group BLA/1.0 (n = 16) had a 1 s CS-BLAstm interval while Group BLA/1.6 (n = 5) has a 1.6 s interval. The BLA/1.0 group did develop specific tuning shifts toward and to the CS, which could change frequency tuning by as much as two octaves. Moreover, its shifts increased over time and were enduring, lasting 75 min. However, group BLA/1.6 did not develop tuning shifts, indicating that precise CS-BLAstm timing is important in the anesthetized animal. Further, training in the BLA/1.0 paradigm but stimulating outside of the BLA did not produce tuning shifts. These findings demonstrate that the BLA is capable of exerting highly specific, enduring, learning-related modifications of stimulus representation in the cerebral cortex. These findings suggest that the ability of the BLA to alter specific cortical representations may underlie, at least in part, the modulatory influence of BLA activity on strengthening long-term memory.

AB  - Objective: To study the course of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS), somatisation disorder, and hypochondriasis, and related prognostic factors. Knowledge of prognostic factors in patients presenting persistent M-US might improve our understanding of the naturalistic course and the identification of patients with a high risk of a chronic course. Methods: A comprehensive search of Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and EMBASE was performed to select studies focusing on patients with MUS, somatisation disorder, and hypochondriasis, and assessing prognostic factors. Studies focusing on patients with single-symptom unexplained disorder or distinctive functional somatic syndromes were excluded. A best-evidence synthesis for the interpretation of results was used. Results: Only six studies on MUS, six studies on hypochondriasis, and one study on abridged somatisation could be included. Approximately 50% to 75% of the patients with MUS improve, whereas 10% to 30% of patients with MUS deteriorate. in patients with hypochondriasis, recovery rates vary between 30% and 50%. In studies on MUS and hypochondriasis, we found some evidence that the number of somatic symptoms at baseline influences the course of these conditions. Furthermore, the seriousness of the condition at baseline seemed to influence the prognosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression do not seem to predict the course of hypochondriasis. Conclusions: Due to the limited numbers of studies and their high heterogeneity, there is a lack of rigorous empirical evidence to identify relevant prognostic factors in patients presenting persistent MUS. However, it seems that a more serious condition at baseline is associated with a worse outcome. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To provide clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations for the management of bipolar disorder in adults that are informative, easy to assimilate and facilitate clinical decision-making.
   A comprehensive literature review of over 500 articles was undertaken using electronic database search engines (e.g. MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Cochrane reviews). In addition articles, book chapters and other literature known to the authors were reviewed. The findings were then formulated into a set of recommendations that were developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians who routinely deal with mood disorders. These preliminary recommendations underwent extensive consultative review by a broader advisory panel that included experts in the field, clinical staff and patient representatives.
   The clinical practice recommendations for bipolar disorder (bipolar CPR) summarise evidence-based treatments and provide a synopsis of recommendations relating to each phase of the illness. They are designed for clinical use and have therefore been presented succinctly in an innovative and engaging manner that is clear and informative.
   These up-to-date recommendations provide an evidence-based framework that incorporates clinical wisdom and consideration of individual factors in the management of bipolar disorder. Further, the novel style and practical approach should promote their uptake and implementation.

AB  - It is firmly established that women experience major depression (MD) at roughly twice the rate of men and that dysregulation of the immune system is associated with the appearance and course of this condition. In the present study, we sought to identify whether "sickness behavior", an inflammatory model of MD, is characterized by sexual dimorphism by focusing on both neurochemical and behavioral responses. Therefore, we investigated the serotonergic and dopaminergic activity of various brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders (hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and striatum) in response to a mild lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, in rats of both sexes. According to our results, at 2 h post-LPS administration (100 mu g/kg i.p.), the neurochemical substrate was primarily altered in female rats with the serotonergic function being markedly enhanced in all brain regions examined. Dopaminergic activation following immune system sensitization with LPS was not apparent in male rats and only modest in female rats with the exception of striatum. LPS administration also affected sickness-associated behaviors to a different extent in male and female rats, as assessed in the forced swim test (FST), the hot plate test (HPT) and the open-field arena. LPS-treated female rats coped better with the stressful FST procedure, as evidenced by an increase in swimming duration. The effects of LPS treatment appeared to be more robust in male rats, as far as suppression of locomotor activity is concerned, while the antinociceptive properties of LPS were evident in both sexes though showing sex-dependent kinetics. Moreover, when traditional measures of sickness (i.e. sucrose consumption, social exploration, food intake) were assessed, males and females appeared to be similarly affected, except for food intake. These data are the first to demonstrate that the serotonergic system is affected to a greater extent in female rats at 2 h post-LPS administration and further contribute to our understanding regarding sexual dimorphism upon sickness establishment.

AB  - Degabriele R, Lagopoulos J. A review of EEG and ERP studies in bipolar disorder.
   The electroencephalogram (EEG) can be a useful tool in determining differences in general neural activity and specific waveforms in individuals with a number of psychiatric disorders. This paper aims to outline and discuss significant findings in EEG and event-related potential (ERP) research into bipolar disorder (BD).
   A literature review was performed through searches of MedLine, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo medical research databases for papers published from 1985 onwards. References of selected articles were also examined for other relevant studies.
   Differences in general EEG data were found in subjects with BD, namely increased theta and delta and decreased alpha wave bands. Changes in EEG were also found in euthymic BD subjects and those undergoing medication programmes. ERP studies commonly report prolonged latencies and reduced amplitudes in the P300 component. Hyperfunctioning of the right hemisphere in BD was also reported in some studies, although further confirmation of this finding is required. Finally, the effects of medication and the role that genetics plays in EEG still remain unclear.
   The literature reviewed demonstrates supporting evidence for the presence of significant differences in EEG and ERP data in subjects with BD. However, methodological considerations such as varying mood states and medication status of the patients need to be followed more stringently for future research to bring about a robust model of the cognitive deficits of BD.

AB  - On rocky shores, wave-swept macroalgae experience dramatic and repeated wave-induced hydrodynamic forces. However, previous studies of macroalgal mechanics have shown that individual waves are not forceful enough to account for observed rates of breakage. Instead, fatigue may contribute to algal breakage, with damage accumulating over time in conditions of repeated loading. Here I examine the entire process of fatigue, from crack initiation to eventual specimen fracture, in the common red alga Mazzaella. Propensity for fatigue failure in laboratory tests varied with life history phase and species: at a given repeated loading stress, male gametophytes endured more loading cycles before breakage than tetrasporophytes, which in turn lasted longer than female gametophytes; likewise, M. splendens withstood more loading cycles at a given repeated loading stress than M. flaccida. Fatigue failure begins with formation of cracks, the timing and location of which were assessed. Cracks formed, on average, after approximately 80-90% of cycles required for failure had passed, although crack timing varied with life history phase. Also, crack formation frequently occurred in association with endophytes and female gametophyte reproductive structures, suggesting a cost of endophyte infection and a tradeoff between reproduction and mechanical survival. Comparison between laboratory and field loading conditions provides robust confirmation that fatigue breaks fronds in natural M. flaccida populations. Large, female gametophyte fronds are predicted to be most susceptible to fatigue failure in the field, whereas small, male gametophyte fronds are least likely to break.

AB  - Lagoons in the heavily populated, semi-arid coastal zone of the Southern Mediterranean Region exemplify the conflict between human utilisation of water and related resources and aquatic ecosystems. Having recognised the requirement to improve understanding of the functioning of the region's coastal wetlands, the MELMARINA Project undertook integrated hydro-ecological monitoring and modelling within lagoons in Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt. This article highlights some key issues regarding environmental science and management of the region's coastal lagoons revealed during the course of the project. It stresses the importance of hydrology as a key control upon lagoon functioning and ecosystem dynamics. Hydrological modifications due to water resource management schemes are the cause of many recent changes experienced within lagoons. Linkages between water quality, water availability, human activities and biological characteristics of coastal lagoons are discussed with particular reference to the controls upon vegetation within the MELMARINA lagoons. A series of methodological advances are reviewed which have potential for wider application within coastal lagoons. It is suggested that the use of lagoon sediment for environmental reconstruction can be invaluable, especially when monitoring data are lacking. Recent advances in instrumentation technologies make long-term continuous monitoring more feasible although these approaches can be combined with more traditional site surveys to provide wider spatial coverage at the expense of temporal resolution. Wider spatial coverage can also be achieved through the use of space-borne or aerial remote sensing imagery whilst longer-term trends in site characteristics can be assessed through historical map analyses. Geographical Information Systems, which facilitate the storage and interrogation of large and varied datasets, have enormous potential. Similarly, coupled hydro-ecological models can inform understanding of lagoon functioning and can assess scenarios associated with environmental change or alternative management approaches. The application of integrated, basin-wide approaches to the management of water resources and aquatic ecosystems in the Southern Mediterranean Region is advocated. This includes the application of principles from the EU's Water Framework Directive. Finally, the need to place management in the context of climate change and associated sea level rise is stressed. Emphasis should be placed on the development of adaptation strategies designed to minimise the effects of these changes.

AB  - The brains of animals show chemical, anatomical, and functional differences, such as dopamine production and structure of sleep, between Amniota and older groups. In addition, play behavior, capacity to acquire taste aversion, sensory pleasure in decision making, and expression of emotional tachycardia and fever started also to be displayed by Amniota, suggesting that the brain may have began to work differently in early Amniota than in Lissamphibia and earlier vertebrates. Thus we propose that emotion, and more broadly speaking consciousness, emerged in the evolutionary line among the early Amniota. We also propose that consciousness is characterized by a common mental pathway that uses pleasure, or its counterpart displeasure, as a means to optimize behavior. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Throughout history, vestibular and emotional dysregulation have often manifested together in clinical settings, with little consideration that they may have a common basis. Regarding vestibular mechanisms, the role of brainstem and cerebellar structures has been emphasized in the neurological literature, whereas emotion processing in the cerebral hemispheres has been the focus in psychology. A conceptual model is proposed that links research in the 2 disparate fields by means of a functional cerebral systems framework. The claim is that frontal regions exert regulatory control over posterior systems for sensation and autonomic functions in a dense, interconnected network. Impairment at levels within the system is expected to influence vestibular and cognitive processes depending on the extent of frontal regulatory capacity. M. Kinsbounie's (1980) shared cerebral space model specifies the conditions under which dysfunction of the vestibular modality will influence higher cognitive levels. A position on laterality and associative relations within the right hemisphere is proposed to explain links among dizziness, nausea, and negative emotion.

AB  - Objective: The authors sought to determine the efficacy of multiple-session psychological interventions to prevent and treat traumatic stress symptoms beginning within 3 months of a traumatic event.
   Method: Nine computerized databases were searched, and manual searches were conducted of reference lists of selected articles as well as two journals. In addition, key researchers in the field were contacted to determine whether they were aware of other relevant studies. The reviewers identified randomized controlled trials of multiple-session psychological treatments aimed at preventing or reducing traumatic stress symptoms in individuals within 3 months of exposure to a traumatic event. Details of the studies were independently extracted by two reviewers, and outcome data were entered into the Review Manager software package. Quality assessment was also conducted by two researchers independently.
   Results: Twenty-five studies examining a range of interventions were identified. For treatment of individuals exposed to a trauma irrespective of their symptoms, there was no significant difference between any intervention and usual care. For treatment of traumatic stress symptoms irrespective of diagnosis, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective than waiting list or supportive counseling conditions. The difference was greatest for treatment of acute stress disorder and acute posttraumatic stress disorder.
   Conclusions: Trauma-focused CBT within 3 months of a traumatic event appears to be effective for individuals with traumatic stress symptoms, especially those who meet the threshold for a clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Three set of experiments were performed in an enclosed space (open-field) and in an open space (elevated platform). The surface of the open-field and the elevated platform were divided in nine equal squares. Rats were exposed (without previous habituation) in a unique session (experiment 1) or three consecutive sessions (experiment 2) either to an open-field (enclosed space) or to an elevated platform (open space) with and without an object on the Centre of the field. In experiment 3, rats were exposed (without previous habituation) either to an enclosed or an open space on five consecutive sessions, one session a day. They were tested in an object recognition test in sessions 1, 3 and 5. In sessions 2 and 4, no objects were present. In experiment 1, we recorded the latency, frequency and duration of entries into different areas of the field. In experiment 3, we recorded the latency, frequency and duration of contacts with objects in addition to entries into different areas of the field.
   The first experiment demonstrates that rats exposed for the first time to an enclosed or an open space do not express neophobia toward novel objects in the absence of walls that surround an open-field. They crossed frequently into and spent more time in areas occupied with an object than in unoccupied areas. After two sessions of habituation to an empty open space or an empty enclosed space, the latency of first approach to a novel object is reduced while the frequency and duration of approaches are increased. The third experiment on object recognition confirmed that rats do not avoid novel objects; they made frequent visit and spent more time in the corner of the field occupied with an object than in empty corners. Recording of crossings provided detailed information about the patterns of exploratory behavior of rats but failed to reveal discrimination between novel and familiar objects which was evident in both open and enclosed space with recording of contacts with objects on the fifth exposure.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) during pregnancy and to discuss its risks and benefits for treating severe mental illness during pregnancy. Method: PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched for English or English-translated articles, case reports, letters, chapters, and Web sites providing original contributions and/or summarizing prior data on ECT administration during pregnancy. Results: A total of 339 cases were found. The majority of patients were treated for depression and at least partial remission was reported in 78% of all cases where efficacy data were available. Among the 339 cases reviewed, there were 25 fetal or neonatal complications, but only 11 of these, which included two deaths, were likely related to ECT. There were 20 maternal complications reported and 18 were likely related to ECT. Conclusions: Although there are limited available data in the literature, it seems that ECT is an effective treatment for severe mental illness during pregnancy and that the risks to fetus and mother are low.

AB  - Neuroscience was an integral part of psychosomatic medicine at its inception in the early 20th century. Since the mid-20th century, however, psychosomatic research has largely ignored the brain. The field of neuroscience has burgeoned in recent years largely because a variety of powerful new methods have become available. Many of these methods allow for the noninvasive study of the living human brain and thus are potentially available for integration into psychosomatic medicine research at this time. In this first paper we examine various methods available for human neuroscientific investigation and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. We next review some basic functional neuroanatomy involving structures that are increasingly being identified as relevant for psychosomatic processes. We then discuss, and provide examples of, flow the brain influences end organs through "information transfer systems," including the autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune systems. The evidence currently available suggests that neuroscience holds great promise for advancing the goal of understanding the mechanisms by which psychosocial variables influence physical disease outcomes. An increased focus on such mechanistic research in psychosomatic medicine is needed to further its acceptance into the field of medicine.

AB  - During the second half of the last century, biopsychosocial research in psychosomatic medicine largely ignored the brain. Neuroscience has started to make a comeback in psychosomatic medicine research and promises to advance the field in important ways. In this paper we briefly review select brain imaging research findings in psychosomatic medicine in four key areas: cardiovascular regulation, visceral pain in the context of functional gastrointestinal disorders, acute and chronic somatic pain and placebo. In each area, there is a growing literature that is beginning to define a network of brain areas that participate in the functions in question. Evidence to date suggests that cortical and subcortical areas that are involved in emotion and emotion regulation play an important role in each domain. Neuroscientific research is therefore validating findings from previous psychosomatic research and has the potential to extend knowledge by delineating the biological mechanisms that link mind and body more completely and with greater specificity. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for how research in psychosomatic medicine is conducted, the ways in which neuroscientific advances can lead to new clinical applications in psychosomatic contexts, the implications of this work for the field of medicine more generally, and the priorities for research in the next 5 to 10 years.

AB  - Voluntary wheel running in rodents is associated with a number of adaptive behavioral and physiological effects including improved learning, reduction in stress-associated behaviors, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, increases in neurotrophic factors, and changes in several signaling molecules. Exercise has also been reported to reduce anxiety-like behaviors. However, other studies have failed to find an anxiolytic effect of exercise. The inconsistencies in the literature may contribute to the scarcity of data examining the physiological correlates of the anxiolytic effect of exercise. Here we show that 2 weeks of voluntary exercise in male C57 mice is associated with reduced anxiety as measured with acoustic startle, stress-induced hyperthermia, social interaction, light-enhanced startle, and some, but not all, measures in the open field. A great deal is known about the neural circuits underlying anxiety. Given the consistency of the anxiolytic effect of voluntary exercise across several measures, it is now possible to begin a systematic analysis of the physiological basis of the anxiolytic effect of exercise.

AB  - Whole-brain neuroimaging studies have demonstrated regional variations in function within human cingulate cortex. At the same time, regional variations in cingulate anatomical connections have been found in animal models. It has, however, been difficult to estimate the relationship between connectivity and function throughout the whole cingulate cortex within the human brain. In this study, magnetic resonance diffusion tractography was used to investigate cingulate probabilistic connectivity in the human brain with two approaches. First, an algorithm was used to search for regional variations in the probabilistic connectivity profiles of all cingulate cortex voxels with the whole of the rest of the brain. Nine subregions with distinctive connectivity profiles were identified. It was possible to characterize several distinct areas in the dorsal cingulate sulcal region. Several distinct regions were also found in subgenual and perigenual cortex. Second, the probabilities of connection between cingulate cortex and 11 predefined target regions of interest were calculated. Cingulate voxels with a high probability of connection with the different targets formed separate clusters within cingulate cortex. Distinct connectivity fingerprints characterized the likelihood of connections between the extracingulate target regions and the nine cingulate subregions. Last, a meta-analysis of 171 functional studies reporting cingulate activation was performed. Seven different cognitive conditions were selected and peak activation coordinates were plotted to create maps of functional localization within the cingulate cortex. Regional functional specialization was found to be related to regional differences in probabilistic anatomical connectivity.

AB  - The prevention of neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease, is a public health priority. Due to the large numbers of affected patients, even interventions bringing about a relatively small delay in disease onset could have large public health effects. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to demonstrate the effectiveness of preventive interventions, but such trials raise specific methodological questions because they are new in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, and require large numbers of elderly subjects and lengthy follow-up periods. We performed a literature search to identify primary prevention RCTs for neurodegenerative dementia. The methodology of the trials was summarized and discussed during two expert meetings. Overall, 39 trials were identified that assessed dementia incidence or cognitive decline as a primary or secondary study outcome. Age was the most common selection criteria for target populations. Follow-up periods ranged from one month to nine years and were longest in studies measuring dementia incidence as an outcome. Results of RCTs have so far been generally negative and conflicting with those of observational studies, perhaps due to methodological issues. Future trials must therefore carefully consider the target population, outcomes and duration of follow-up to be used, and should assess the problem of attrition.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to assess the quality of commonly found websites on bipolar disorder. A specifically designed quality tool, the Bipolar Website Quality Checklist (BWQC), was developed for this purpose.
   Methods: The BWQC was developed from quality criteria identified by a literature review of Medline (1966+), Medline in-process and non-indexed citations, PsychINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Pub Med, Science citation index, and PsychArticles, using keywords: 'quality, reliability, accuracy, readability, evaluation, assessment, information, internet, web, www'. To identify relevant websites, seven common search engines were accessed and searched using a string of key words: 'bipolar disorder + mania + manic depression + hypomania'. The top active 15 sites identified were rated by three independent raters, using the BWQC and DISCERN instruments.
   Results: There was a wide variability in the quality of the websites reviewed. The Black Dog Institute website was ranked first by the BWQC and DISCERN instruments. The National Institute of Mental Health website was ranked second by DISCERN and seventh by BWQC. The BWQC demonstrated high interrater reliability (r = 0.89) and correlated strongly (r = 0.78, p = 0.001) with the more generic DISCERN instrument. Websites with an editorial board or affiliation to a professional organization or which contained information on a variety of mental health issues had higher quality information on bipolar disorder and its treatment than websites that did not share these characteristics.
   Conclusions: High-quality information on bipolar disorder does exist on the Internet. It is important that clinicians are familiar with such websites so that they can recommend the most appropriate site that meets the specific need of the individual. Use of such websites can assist clinicians in adhering to clinical practice guidelines by providing material to augment psychoeducational interventions.

AB  - Background
   Peacekeeping personnel are exposed to multiple sources of trauma, including combat and other primary traumas, and the secondary trauma of serving a traumatized population. Exposure to trauma is a risk factor for mental illness and mental illness is a risk factor for suicidal behavior. This review of published articles provides prevalence estimates of posttraumatic stress disorder and other mental illness among peacekeepers, risk factors for mental illness in peacekeepers, and suicidal behavior among peacekeepers.
   Methods
   A search of bibliographic databases (Pub Men, Google Scholar,) was completed in February 2009. Methodological rigor of published studies varies considerably.
   Results
   Studies on prevalence of mental illness and risk factors for mental illness among peacekeepers were cross-sectional, but varied in type. Studies were from different countries and used different measures, some included a pre-deployment baseline and repeat surveys, others features repeat surveys with no baseline, and still others were one-time surveys. Studies on suicidal behavior among peacekeepers were from different countries and used different methods.
   Conclusions
   There is a wide range of reported rates of psychiatric diagnosis including PTSD. Studies on suicide prevalence among peacekeepers show either no difference between peacekeepers and the general population, or reduced risk of suicide among peacekeepers, but these studies are few in number. Implications for policy and practice among peacekeeping organizations are discussed. Future research should address suicide among peacekeepers of different nationalities.

AB  - Objective: Recent neuroimaging studies aimed at investigating effects of psychological stress on the neural activity have used a range of experimental paradigms to elicit an acute stress response. The goal of this review is to, first, summarize results from these studies from a perspective of task design and, second, assess the appropriateness of the different stress tasks used.
   Method: We completed a PubMed search on recent articles that have examined the effects of psychological stress on neural processes in a neuroimaging environment. Selected articles were arranged according to the stress task used in the following categories: script-driven stress stimuli, Stroop colour-word interference task, speech in front of an audience, serial subtraction, and Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST).
   Results: Only studies using serial subtraction or the MIST were able to induce a significant cortisol stress response in their participants. Most consistent findings include decreased activity in orbitofrontal regions in response to stress. Additional findings of note are increases in activity in the frontal lobes, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as deactivation of the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus.
   Conclusion: Research to date is beginning to outline the involvement of prefrontal and limbic regions in perception and modulation of psychological stress. However, additional research is needed in designing a neuroimaging stress task that will yield a significant cortisol stress response consistently, across populations and laboratories.

AB  - Relevant literature was searched using MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Google in addition to Arabic search engines for information. Due to the shortage of scholarly articles on the subject, we broadened our search to publications from human rights organisation and articles in the mainstream press. We estimated the total carceral population in the member countries of the Arab league at 338,500 prisoners, over 46,000 of whom could be suffering from severe mental illness. We relied on indirect indicators of mental health services such as the quality of medical care in general, accounts of prison conditions by prisoners and their families, and the abundant literature on human rights abuses. Despite a grim overall picture, we highlight signs of improvement in recent years. Psychiatrists working in Arabic prisons face a number of challenges. We comment on directions for the future in the field of correctional psychiatry in the Arab countries including from the perspective of research.

The data used for these guidelines have been extracted from a MEDLINE and EMBASE search, from the clinical trial database clinicaltrials.gov, from recent proceedings of key conferences, and from various national and international treatment guidelines. Their scientific rigor was categorised into six levels of evidence (A-F). As these guidelines are intended for clinical use, the scientific evidence was finally asigned different grades of recommendation to ensure practicability.

AB  - The substantia nigra, located in the ventral mesencephalon, is one of the five nuclei that constitute the basal ganglia circuit, which controls voluntary movements.
   It is divided into the pars compacta and the pars reticulata, which mainly contain dopaminergic and GABAergic cells respectively. Here we overview the electrophysiological properties of these substantia nigra neurons in the pars compacta and reticulata, together with their synaptic connections, and discuss the functional effects of dopaminergic and GABAergic inputs within the basal ganglia. We also examine the phenomenon that when a deficiency of dopamine (DA) occurs (e.g. in Parkinson's disease), there is an aberrant synaptic plasticity in the basal ganglia.
   Moreover, we point out that the appearance of an altered pattern of neuronal firing (beta-oscillations) and synchrony among neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, the internal globus pallidus, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata has been related to motor symptoms and possibly, persistent degeneration of DA-containing neurons.
   Finally, we believe that, based on pathophysiological data, new and significant targets for therapeutic intervention can be identified and tested.

AB  - In order to reduce societal levels of violence, it is essential to advance understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in initiating and maintaining individual patterns of physical aggression. New technologies such as Magnetic Resonance Imagining and analyses of DNA provide tools for identifying these mechanisms. The reliability and validity of the results of studies using these tools depend not only on aspects of the technology, but also on the methodological rigour with which the studies are conducted, particularly with respect to characterizing the phenotype. The present article discusses five challenges confronting scientists who aim to advance understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms associated with persistent violence. These challenges are: (1) to develop evidence-based hypotheses and to design studies that test alternate hypotheses; (2) to recruit samples that are homogeneous with respect to variables that may be linked to neurobiological mechanisms underpinning violent behaviour; (3) to use reliable and valid measures in order to fully characterize participants so that the external validity of the results is evident; (4) to restrict the range of age of participants so as not to confuse developmental change with group differences; and (5) to take account of sex. Our goal is to contribute to elevating methodological standards in this new field of research and to thereby improve the validity of results and move closer to finding effective ways to reduce violence.

AB  - Adherence is defined as the extent to which a patient's behavior coincides with medical or prescribed health advice. Adherence is considered non-judgmental and is preferred over the term "compliance," which carries negative connotations and suggests blame for the patient. A major challenge in the field of psychiatry has been to understand why patients may or may not adhere to medication and other treatment recommendations. A comprehensive review of the literature on medication adherence among patients with psychiatric illnesses was conducted with the following objectives: 1) to better understand the impact of medication nonadherence, 2) to identify risk factors for medication nonadherence, and 3) to study interventions designed to improve patient adherence. The authors initially searched the Ovid Medline electronic database using the key words "medication adherence" and "compliance" to identify all articles written in the English language published through early 2008. This produced over 2,000 references. The search was then narrowed to publications specific to psychotropic medication. The ultimate goal of the review was to increase awareness of this critical issue and to discuss strategies that the psychiatric clinician can implement to address patient adherence to prescribed medications. The authors chose to include articles that were deemed to be clinically useful to the practicing clinician.
   Studies that have specifically investigated adherence to psychiatric medications vary in the definitions of adherence and methodology that were used, making interpretation of results across studies difficult. Psychoeducational interventions have long been the mainstay of treatment for adherence problems. However, there is growing evidence that other approaches such as cognitive-behavioral strategies and motivational interviewing may be effective. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the authors recommend the following strategies for addressing adherence problems: focus on strengthening the therapeutic alliance; devote time in treatment specifically to address medication adherence; assess patients' motivation to take prescribed medications; and identify and address potential barriers to treatment adherence.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to identify and synthesize recent research findings in the aetiology and psychological treatment of social anxiety disorder and consider how these might improve outcome through more effective intervention. The electronic databases Medline, EMBASE and PsychInfo were searched for January 2000-December 2008. Publications of interest referred to in relevant articles were also reviewed. Case reports and publications not in English were excluded. The greatest variance in social anxiety disorder is accounted for by temperamental and personality factors and these may be associated with significant heritability. The environmental contribution is smaller and mainly due to non-shared factors, with a small contribution from shared environmental factors. Epidemiological research confirms that social anxiety disorder is chronic, and among the anxiety disorders has the lowest rates of treatment seeking, receipt of evidence-based treatments and recovery. Effective psychological treatments have been available for some time, and the research emphasis is on increasing the efficacy of treatments through innovations in programme content and delivery. Cognitive science research has contributed a better understanding of cognitive factors that maintain social anxiety disorder and informed enhancement of the cognitive elements of therapy. Internet-based programmes show promise as a novel way to deliver and improve access to effective therapy. Genetic, personality and temperamental factors contribute to the risk for social anxiety disorder. Given the associated comorbidity and disability, energy needs to be directed towards early recognition and treatment, and to increasing engagement and retention in effective therapy. Ongoing professional education is required to ensure that the disorder is recognized and evidence-based treatments received by patients who do seek help. Current cognitive behavioural treatments are being enhanced as the results of cognitive science research are being applied, and novel forms of treatment delivery show promise in increasing access.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical concept proposed as an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia. This condition has multiple heterogeneous sources, including clinical presentation, etiology, and prognosis. Recently, the prevalence and associated features of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in MCI have been described. We systematically searched the PubMed database (last accessed on August 31, 2008) for articles on NPS in MCI. Included articles used strict selection criteria, and outcome variables were extracted in duplicate; of the 27 articles included, 14 (52%) used prospective cohorts. The global prevalence of NPS in MCI ranged from 35% to 85%. The most common behavioral symptoms were depression, anxiety, and irritability. Hospital-based samples reported a higher global prevalence of NPS than population-based studies; this discrepancy probably reflected differences in demographics, study setting, MCI diagnostic criteria, and behavioral instruments used. Prospective studies showed that NPS, particularly depression, may represent risk factors for MCI or predictors for the conversion of MCI to Alzheimer's disease (AD). NPS are very prevalent in subjects with MCI, displaying a similar pattern of symptoms compared to dementia and AD. Large cohort studies using standardized MCI criteria and behavioral instruments are required to evaluate the prognostic role of NPS in MCI.

AB  - From an ecological psychological perspective, the current chapter discusses the influence of anxiety on the perception, selection, and realization of affordances in sports and other high-pressure contexts, particularly police work. Drawing on recent developments in the anxiety-performance literature (i.e., the attentional control theory) the authors' experimental work on the impact of anxiety on perceptual-motor performance is described. Furthermore, several experiments showing positive effects of training with anxiety on performance under pressure are discussed. We argue that through reality-based training with anxiety, processes that underlie performance might be recalibrated to the new task constraints, thereby preventing a degradation of eventual performance in stressful situations.

TI  - Frailty and dependence in elderly dialysis patients
KW  - frailty
KW  - dependence
KW  - elderly
KW  - dialysis
AB  - Patients older than 75 years of age currently represent more than 35% of the population that begins dialysis each year in most European registries; in our centre, at least 30 patients in this age bracket begin dialysis, which represent 45% of the total incident patients. The absence of systematic studies makes this patient category almost indistinguishable from other categories, even though its peculiarity is now becoming evident. At least 30-40% of elderly individuals are expected to be frail and/or dependent, but the incidence of frailty is likely to be higher in those undergoing haemodialysis. Due to severe physical and/or mental impairment and often because of social hardship, these patients rarely experience clinical stability and are dependent on third parties for their survival. Early symptoms of frailty consist of weakness, anorexia, weight loss, muscular atrophy, reactive depression and cognitive deficits. Commonly, early signs and symptoms are underestimated until patients become dependent as defined by the presence of several pathological conditions, such as instability, immobility, iatrogenic drug reactions, intellectual impairment, and incontinence. The last phase of the condition is that of acute complications pathological fractures, pressure ulcers, delirium, infectious complications with multiple hospital admissions, which cause a significant reduction in patient survival. The care of these patients presents complex problems for welfare services, and has led to the re-organisation of in-patient and out-patient dialysis units. Repeated patient admissions to the hospital require a much greater use of facilities and staff compared to younger dialysis patients. Of 112 elderly patients consecutively admitted to our dialysis programme over a period of 10 years, we identified 35 dependent ( defined here as the need for continual assistance) patients ( 31.2%). Dependence proved to be the only clinical parameter associated with survival, while co-morbidity ( in particular cardiovascular disease that usually affects survival rates in younger age groups) did not seem to be discriminating risk factors in the elderly. Emerging data from larger studies will likely demonstrate that the elderly should be systematically monitored for frailty and dependence during dialysis, as is the case in exclusively geriatric fields. Many of the clinical problems of the dialysed elderly, such as sensory, mental, and functional impairment, are more the result of advanced age, pre-existent diseases, and social deprivation, rather than of uraemia and dialysis per se. Prevention, as well as a therapeutic approach specifically modelled on these conditions, could help to improve the prognosis of this patient category, which is becoming numerically predominant in dialysis units.

AB  - The lifetime risk for major depression in women is well known to be twice the risk in men and is especially high during the reproductive years between menarche and menopause. A subset of reproductive-age women experience depressive episodes that are triggered by hormonal fluctuations. Such reproductive depressions involve episodes of depression that occur specifically during the premenstrual, postpartum, and perimenopausal phases in women. These reproductive subtypes of depression can be conceptualized as a specific biological response to the effects of hormonal fluctuations in the brain. The different types of reproductive depressions are associated with each other, have unique risk factors that are distinct from nonreproductive depression episodes, and respond to both hormonal and nonhormonal interventions. This review uses a PubMed search of relevant literature to discuss clinical, animal, and genetic evidence for reproductive depression as a specific subtype of major depression. Unique treatment options, such as hormonal interventions, are also discussed, and hypotheses regarding the underlying biology of reproductive depressionincluding interactions between the serotonergic system and estrogen, as well as specific effects on neurosteroidsare explored. This review will provide evidence supporting reproductive depression as a distinct clinical entity with specific treatment approaches and a unique biology that is separate from nonreproductive depression.

AB  - Background: There are now a substantial number of controlled trials investigating the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). This meta-analysis combined multiple well-controlled studies to help clarify the overall impact of ACT relative to waiting lists, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, and established therapies. Method: A comprehensive literature search produced 18 randomized controlled trials (n = 917) that were included in the final analyses. Effect size was computed with Hedges's g which can be interpreted with Cohen's convention of small (0.2), medium (0.5), and large (0.8) effects. Results: There was a clear overall advantage of ACT compared to control conditions (effect size = 0.42). The average ACT-treated participant was more improved than 66% of the participants in the control conditions. Analyzed separately ACT was superior to waiting lists and psychological placebos (effect size = 0.68) and treatment as usual (effect size = 0.42). However, ACT was not significantly more effective than established treatments (effect size = 0.18, p = 0.13). Also, ACT was not superior to control conditions for the distress problems (anxiety/depression: effect size = 0.03, p = 0.84). Conclusions: The results reveal that ACT is more effective than control conditions for several problem domains, but there is no evidence yet that ACT is more effective than established treatments.

AB  - Louis-Victor Marce, MD, of Paris compiled an extensive monograph published in 1858 that surveyed knowledge of psychiatric disorders of women during and following pregnancy. This work has largely been ignored for 150 years. We summarize here what is known about Marce's life and work, and include selected passages from his monograph. Marce provides extensive clinical descriptions of syndromes, with 79 case examples, and summarizes etiological theories and treatments characteristic of his era and place. This work was based on cases that he personally evaluated and on other reported cases, all drawn from broad social and economic backgrounds. Marce shows an appreciation of epidemiological evidence and a critical approach to then conventional pathophysiological and therapeutic views. His work anticipated modern rediscovery of the high risk of depression in pregnancy and of both acute mood disorders and psychoses, postpartum. This comprehensive summary of clinical knowledge of perinatal psychiatric disorders of women is a landmark early contribution to a field that has only recently emerged as a psychiatric subspecialty.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent, potentially disabling, and sometimes fatal. Antidepressants (ADs) have improved its treatment, but incomplete response, sustained morbidity, recurrences, agitation, substance abuse, excess medical mortality, and suicide remain unsolved problems among mood disorder patients. AD treatment itself sometimes induces adverse behavioral responses. Several anticonvulsants (ACs) used to treat bipolar disorder (BPD) might also be of value for MDD. Accordingly, we reviewed published reports on ACs for MDD, identifying studies by computerized searches. We excluded reports dealing only with BPD patients or with sedatives, classified trials by design quality, and evaluated treatment of acute episodes and recurrences of adult MDD. We found 36 reports involving 41 relevant trials of carbamazepine (12 trials), valproate (11), lamotrigine (9), gabapentin (3), topiramate (3), phenytoin (2), and tiagabine (1). They include 9 blinded, controlled trials (of 28-70 days), involving carbamazepine (3 trials), lamotrigine (3), phenytoin (2), or topiramate (1) as primary treatments (5) or AD adjuncts (4). Some of these trials, as well as 7 of lesser quality, suggest benefits of carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproate, mainly as adjuncts to ADs. Another 20 anecdotes or small trials further suggest that these ACs might be useful as AD adjunctsspecifically to treat irritability or agitation in MDD. Overall, these reports provide suggestive evidence of beneficial effects of carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproate that require further study, especially for long-term adjunctive use, particularly in patients with recurring MDD with prominent irritability or agitation.

AB  - Background: borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychiatric diagnosis characterized by high exposure, reactivity, and vulnerability to stress. Given these abnormalities in stress reactivity in BPD, there is a question of whether the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functions normally in BPD, since the activation of the HPA axis normally occurs to coordinate both behavioral and physiologic responses to stress. Several studies have investigated the functioning of the HPA axis in BPD and have shown varied results. This review seeks to summarize and interpret the findings of this growing literature. Methods: Pubmed search for English language articles on borderline personality disorder and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Results: findings are mixed but suggest that important variables relevant to between-group differences include comorbid depression, comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder, dissociative symptoms, and history of childhood abuse. Discussion: comorbid diagnoses and clinical features such as trauma history and symptom severity may have variable, interacting influences on the psychoneuroendocrine profile in BPD. Also explored here are the implications of these findings for developing possible models of HPA-axis dysfunction in BPD, for identifying potential targets for treatment, and for improving the methodology of future studies.

AB  - Mitochondrial electron transport generates the ATP that is essential for the excitability and survival of neurons, and the protein phosphorylation reactions that mediate synaptic signaling and related long-term changes in neuronal structure and function. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that divide, fuse, and move purposefully within axons and dendrites. Major functions of mitochondria in neurons include the regulation of Ca2+ and redox signaling, developmental and synaptic plasticity, and the arbitration of cell survival and death. The importance of mitochondria in neurons is evident in the neurological phenotypes in rare diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial genes. Mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress, perturbed Ca2+ homeostasis, and apoptosis may also contribute to the pathogenesis of prominent neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases; stroke; annyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and psychiatric disorders. Advances in understanding the molecular and cell biology of mitochondria are leading to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders.

AB  - Evidence from diverse literatures supports the viewpoint that two modes of self-regulation exist, a lower-order system that responds quickly to associative cues of the moment and a higher-order system that responds more reflectively and planfully; that low serotonergic function is linked to relative dominance of the lower-order system; that how dominance of the lower-order system is manifested depends on additional variables; and that low serotonergic function therefore can promote behavioral patterns as divergent as impulsive aggression and lethargic depression. Literatures reviewed include work on two-mode models; studies of brain function supporting the biological plausibility of the two-mode view and the involvement of serotonergic pathways in functions pertaining to it and studies relating low serotonergic function to impulsiveness, aggression (including extreme violence), aspects of personality, and depression vulnerability. Substantial differences between depression and other phenomena reviewed are interpreted by proposing that depression reflects both low serotonergic function and low reward sensitivity. The article closes with brief consideration of the idea that low serotonergic function relates to even more diverse phenomena, whose natures depend in part on sensitivities of other systems.

AB  - Objective: To review the evidence of benefit from use of telemental health (TMH) in Studies that reported clinical or administrative outcomes.
   Method: Relevant publications were identified through computerized literature searches using several electronic databases. Included for review were scientifically valid articles that described controlled studies, comparing TMH with a non-TMH alternative, and uncontrolled studies that had no fewer than 20 participants. Quality of the evidence was assessed with an approach that considers both Study performance and Study design. Judgments were made on whether further data were needed to establish each TMH application as suitable for routine clinical use.
   Results: Included in the review were 72 papers that described 65 clinical Studies; 32 (49%) studies were of high or good quality. Quality of evidence was higher for Internet- and telephone-based interventions than for video conferencing approaches. There was evidence of success with TMH in the areas of child psychiatry, depression, dementia, schizophrenia, Suicide prevention, posttraumatic stress, panic disorders, Substance abuse. eating disorders, and smoking prevention. Evidence of success for general TMH programs and in the management of obsessive-compulsive disorder were less convincing. Further Study was judged to be necessary or desirable in 53 (82%) Of the Studies.
   Conclusion: Evidence of benefit from TMH applications is encouraging, though Still limited. There is a need for more good-quality studies on the use of TMH in routine care. The emerging use of Internet-based applications is an important development that deserves further evaluation.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of this review is to report on existing literature regarding children and adolescents younger than 16 years of age experiencing a first-episode psychiatric disturbance. Rather than providing a comprehensive list of service implications, this paper identifies some of the gaps in knowledge and practice to encourage ongoing analysis regarding better practices for early intervention for children and adolescents experiencing a first-episode psychiatric disturbance.
   Methods: A search was conducted to identify key evidence-based literature published from 1985 to 2007 discussing various aspects of child and youth mental health in Canada, the USA, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The review also included 'grey' literature. Categories of information include diagnoses, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, prevalence, environmental and other risk factors, and demographic variables.
   Results: Understanding first-episode psychiatric disturbance for patients under the age of 16 years is limited because of a scarcity of controlled studies focusing on this population. Programme evaluations are sparse, perhaps because of the small number of specialized units servicing this population. It may be helpful to enlist early intervention psychosis programmes that have been successful in assisting young people aged 16-24 in the development of better practices and care outcomes for younger age groups.
   Conclusions: The authors highlight information that has the potential to assist in optimizing care for those youth younger than 16 years experiencing or exhibiting signs of a first-episode psychiatric disturbance.

AB  - Objectives: To review the literature evaluating outcomes resulting from expansion of the bipolar disorder (BD) diagnostic category. We were particularly interested in identifying high-level evidence for improved clinical outcomes as documented by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or cohort studies.
   Methods: The English-language literature was searched using Ovid MEDLINE for studies of BD referenced against the key word spectrum. We used bibliographies and other databases to extend this search when no relevant RCTs or relevant cohort studies were identified.
   Results: In the MEDLINE searches, abstracts and titles of 86 studies were examined and 48 were found to be related to the topic of bipolar spectrum disorders (BSD). No RCTs or prospective cohort studies evaluating modified diagnostic or therapeutic practices were identified. The literature about the BSD consists mostly of expert opinion emphasizing: various links between bipolar and unipolar mood disorders a proposal that a greater proportion of the Population without a mood disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders should be diagnosed under the BD category; and, proposals that syndromes currently classified elsewhere should be subsumed under the BD category.
   Conclusions: Our search failed to uncover high-level evidence demonstrating the clinical utility of proposed diagnostic realignments. The widespread acceptance of the expanded spectrum concept appears to be based on interpretation of descriptive epidemiologic data by high-profile experts.

AB  - Objective: A growing number of studies have tested the efficacy of preventive interventions in reducing the incidence of depressive disorders. Until now, no meta-analysis has integrated the results of these studies.
   Method: The authors conducted a meta-analysis. After a comprehensive literature search, 19 studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. The studies had to be randomized controlled studies in which the incidence of depressive disorders (based on diagnostic criteria) in an experimental group could be compared with that of a control group.
   Results: The mean incidence rate ratio was 0.78, indicating a reduction of the incidence of depressive disorders by 22% in experimental compared with control groups. Heterogeneity was low to moderate (I-2=33%). The number needed to treat to prevent one case of depressive disorder was 22. Moderator analyses revealed no systematic differences between target populations or types of prevention (universal, selective, or indicated). The data included indications that prevention based on interpersonal psychotherapy may be more effective than prevention based on cognitive-behavioral therapy.
   Conclusions: Prevention of new cases of depressive disorders does seem to be possible. Prevention may become an important way, in addition to treatment, to reduce the enormous public health burden of depression in the coming years.

AB  - Research indicates that people value music primarily because of the emotions it evokes. Yet, the notion of musical emotions remains controversial, and researchers have so far been unable to offer a satisfactory account of such emotions. We argue that the study of musical emotions has suffered from a neglect of underlying mechanisms. Specifically, researchers have studied musical emotions without regard to how they were evoked, or have assumed that the emotions must be based on the "default" mechanism for emotion induction, a cognitive appraisal. Here, we present a novel theoretical framework featuring six additional mechanisms through which music listening may induce emotions: (1) brain stem reflexes, (2) evaluative conditioning, (3) emotional contagion, (4) visual imagery, (5) episodic memory, and (6) musical expectancy. We propose that these mechanisms differ regarding such characteristics as their informatin focus, ontogenetic development, key brain regions, cultural impact, induction speed, degree of volitional influence, modularity, and dependence on musical structure. By synthesizing theory and findings from different domains, we are able to provide the first set of hypotheses that can help researchers to distinguish among the mechanisms. We show that failure to control for the underlying mechanism may lead to inconsistent or non-interpretable findings. Thus, we argue that the new framework may guide future research and help to resolve previous disagreements in the field. We conclude that music evokes as a whole by providing novel paradigms for emotion induction.

AB  - Objective: To provide a selective review of the literature on the recognition of facial expressions of emotion in Alzheimer's disease (AD), to evaluate whether these patients show variation in their ability to recognise different emotions and whether any such impairments are instead because of a general decline in cognition.
   Methods: A narrative review based on relevant articles identified from PubMed and PsycInfo searches from 1987 to 2007 using keywords 'Alzheimer's', 'facial expression recognition', 'dementia' and 'emotion processing'.
   Conclusions: Although the literature is as yet limited, with several methodological inconsistencies, AD patients show poorer recognition of facial expressions, with particular difficulty with sad expressions. It is unclear whether poorer performance reflects the general cognitive decline and/or verbal or spatial deficits associated with AD or whether the deficits reflect specific neuropathology. This under-represented field of study may help to extend our understanding of social functioning in AD. Future work requires more detailed analyses of ancillary cognitive measures, more ecologically valid facial displays of emotion and a reference situation that more closely approximates an actual social interaction.

AB  - Rumination has been persistently implicated in the etiology of hopelessness and depression, which are proximal predictors of suicidality. As a result, researchers have started to examine the role of rumination in suicidality. This systematic review provides a concise synopsis of the current progress in examining the relationship between rumination and suicidality, and highlights areas for future research. A search of the international literature was conducted using the three main psychological and medical databases. Eleven studies were identified providing evidence, with one exception, of a relationship between rumination and suicidality. This review also highlights the considerable dearth of studies on this area of concern, specifically of case-control and prospective, clinical studies, in the worldwide literature.

AB  - The diagnostic criteria of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include emotional impairments. However, scientific evidence for these impairments is varied and subtle. In this contribution, recent empirical studies that examined the emotional competence in children and adolescents with ASD are reviewed. Four aspects of emotional competence that are important to children's daily social functioning (expression, perception, responding, and understanding) are discussed, differentiating between mentally retarded and normally intelligent children and adolescents with and without ASD in natural and structured contexts. On various accounts, the emotional impairments of children with ASD that are found in scientific studies provide a more differentiated view on the impairments suggested by the diagnostic literature. Consistent empirical findings and gaps in the field are discussed. Theoretical and clinical recommendations for assessment procedures are suggested. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Method: A review of the literature in the last five years was conducted by a search of the Medline, Lilacs and SciELO indexing services using the following key words: "anxiety", 'panic", "agoraphobia", "social anxiety", "posttraumatic" and "obsessive-compulsive", crossed one by one with "magnetic resonance", "voxel-based", "ROI" and "morphometry". Results: We selected 134 articles and 41 of them were included in our review. Recent studies have shown significant morphological abnormalities in various brain regions of patients with anxiety disorders and healthy controls. Despite some apparently contradictory findings, perhaps reflecting the variability and limitations of the methodologies used, certain brain regions appear to be altered in a consistent and relatively specific manner in some anxiety disorders. These include the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex in posttraumatic stress disorder and the orbitofrontal cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder Conclusions: The present review indicates that structural neuroimaging has contributed to a better understanding of the neurobiology of anxiety disorders. Further development of neuroimaging techniques, better sample standardization and the integration of data across neuroimaging modalities may extend progress in this area.

   Aims To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of CCBT for the treatment of mild to moderate depression.
   Method Electronic databases were searched to identify randomised controlled trials. Selected studies were quality assessed and data extracted by two reviewers.
   Results Four studies of three computer software packages met the inclusion criteria. Comparators were treatment as usual, using a depression education website and an attention placebo.
   Conclusions There is some evidence to support the effectiveness of CCBT for the treatment of depression, However, all studies were associated with considerable drop-out rates and little evidence was presented regarding participants' preferences and the acceptability of the therapy. More research is needed to determine the place of CCBT in the potential range of treatment options offered to individuals with depression.

We review naturalistic studies and elicitation studies that evoke emotion responses among participants, including emotion expression, experience, and autonomic physiology. We also consider how these emotion response measures correspond to schizophrenia symptoms, and we focus particular attention on the issue of sex differences in emotional responding and how this may influence our understanding emotional functioning among individuals with schizophrenia.

AB  - Some individuals have a greater capacity than others to carry out sophisticated information processing about emotions and emotion-relevant stimuli and to use this information as a guide to thinking and behavior. The authors have termed this set of abilities emotional intelligence (EI). Since the introduction of the concept, however, a schism has developed in which some researchers focus on El as a distinct group of mental abilities, and other researchers instead study an eclectic mix of positive traits such as happiness, self-esteem, and optimism. Clarifying what El is and is not can help the field by better distinguishing research that is truly pertinent to EI from research that is not. EI-conceptualized as an ability-is an important variable both conceptually and empirically, and it shows incremental validity for predicting socially relevant outcomes.

AB  - Background. - Subjective Memory Impairment (SMI) may hold value in the elderly as a predictor of dementia. There is yet to exist any standard definition of SMI for use in research or for clinical practice.
   Objective. - This study aims to identify previous and current definitions of SMI used in published research and to propose a set of criteria that may help increase SMI's predictive power of future cognitive decline.
   Methods. - Literature searches were conducted across a number of electronic databases including Medline.
   Results. - 515 citations were identified, 336 papers were obtained, of which 44 were selected for containing definitions for SMI. These definitions varied widely in terms of the types of questions used to determine SMI and additional features pertaining to memory complaints included in the definition.
   Conclusion. - There is no consistency in how SMI is defined. We propose a set of criteria aimed to increase specificity of memory complainers for those at increased risk of dementia. Further research is required to refine and validate the different criteria suggested. An international consent on the necessary criteria by experts in the field might be useful.

   Methods This paper reviews briefly the common neurocognitive causes for performance problems in doctors and provides an updated account of the current literature. Search on Medline and PsychINFO for English language articles between 1956 and September 2006 was performed, as well as a manual search by the authors for other relevant articles.
   Results Neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment is increasingly accepted as an accurate evaluation tool to clarify the performance problems in doctors. Furthermore, it seems that neurocognitive difficulties are commonly found to be the cause for such problems.
   Conclusions The performance problems in doctors need to be acknowledged 'better too soon than too late'. Neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment helps to create an accurate treatment and rehabilitation plan for the specific functional tasks of the particular doctor's duties.

AB  - Background. Methamphetamine (METH) dependence is a significant public health, criminal justice, and social service concern, and although abuse of this drug spans the past 40 years in the U.S., effective treatments have only recently been developed and evaluated. Psychosocial therapies comprise the mainstay of treatment, yet many patients experience ongoing impairments in mood, cognition, emotional control, and motivation, suggesting a role for pharmacotherapy.
   Methods. A search of the literature was performed to identify drug therapies utilized with METH dependent patients and the outcome of these trials.
   Results. With the exception of bupropion, most trials employing direct monoamine agonists yielded negative or inclusive results, a counterintuitive finding. Positive results were produced by a trial of the mixed monoamine agonist/antagonist mirtazapine and by several studies employing indirect dopamine- and glutamate-modulating GABA agonists. Most trials were hampered by high rates of subject attrition, mirroring the difficulty in treating these patients in the outpatient setting.
   Conclusions. Although considered preliminary, several therapeutic agents were, identified that may prove beneficial in treating METH-dependent patients, including bupropion, mirtazapine, baclofen, and topiramate. Psychosocial therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment, and drug therapy should be regarded as an adjunct, rather than a replacement for psychosocial approaches.

AB  - The perception of pain is sensitive to various mental processes such as the feelings and beliefs that someone has about pain. It is therefore not exclusively driven by the noxious input. Attentional modulation involving the descending pain modulatory system has been examined extensively in neuroimaging studies. However, the investigation of neural mechanisms underlying more complex cognitive modulation is an emerging field in pain research. Recent findings indicate an engagement of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during more complex modulation, leading to a change or reappraisal of the emotional significance of pain. Taking placebo-induced analgesia as an example, we discuss the contribution of attention, expectation and reappraisal as three basic mechanisms that are important for the cognitive modulation of pain.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) supply (concentration and flux) is an important driver for biological activity in flowing waters and needs to be managed to avoid eutrophication impacts associated with urbanisation and agricultural intensification. This paper examines the role of in-stream retention and cycling in regulating river P concentrations in order to better understand the links between P sources and their ecological impacts. In terms of their composition (solubility and concentration), patterns of delivery (mode and timing) and therefore ecological relevance, P sources entering rivers are best grouped into wastewater discharges > runoff from impervious surfaces (roads, farmyards) > runoff from pervious surfaces (forestry, cultivated land and pasture). The localized impacts of soluble P discharges during ecologically sensitive periods can be distinguished from the downstream impacts associated with particulate P discharges under high flows due to the different processes by which these sources are retained, transformed and assimilated within the river channel. The range of physico-chemical processes involved in P cycling and the variable importance of these processes in different river environments according to stream size, stream geomorphology and anthropogenic pressures are summarised. It is concluded that the capacity to retain (process) P within the river channel, and hence regulate the downstream delivery of P without stressing the aquatic communities present, is considerable, especially in headwaters. To help achieve good water quality, there is scope to better manage this ecosystem service through regulation of P supply whilst optimising in-stream P retention according to subsidy-stress theory. Further research is needed to develop in-stream management options for maximising P subsidies and to demonstrate that regulation of downstream P delivery will reduce the incidence of eutrophication in connected waterbodies.

AB  - Background. Anxiety (among several other symptoms) has been identified in one prospective study as associated with suicide risk in depressed patients early in treatment. It has been suggested that treatment of anxiety in depression with sedative/hypnotic agents, especially benzodiazepines, in the first several weeks may decrease suicide risk. Sedative/hypnotic agents also have depressant and disinhibitory properties which might increase suicide risk, however. This review addresses the potential benefits and risks with regard to suicide of using sedative/hypnotics as an early adjunct to antidepressant treatment in anxious depressed patients.
   Methods. Pertinent medical literature was reviewed using Medline/PubMed search as well as bibliographies from related publications. Reports in English from 1958 to 2006 were included.
   Results. The review did not reveal any evidence that using sedative/hypnotics as an early adjunct to antidepressant treatment of anxious depressed patients decreases their suicide risk. There is considerable evidence that sedative/hypnotics produce depressant and/or disinhibitory effects in a small proportion (perhaps 5%) of people who take them. However, there is no clear evidence that their brief use early in depression increases suicide risk. Toxicological data of suicides indicate that a majority of people who commit suicide are under the influence of sedative/hypnotic chemicals (including alcohol) at the little.
   Conclusions. The authors conclude that the question of whether sedative/hypnotic may prevent or provoke suicide in anxious depressed patients cannot be answered definitively with the available information. They believe the potential risks of prescribing sedative/hypnotics for depressed patients who may be suicidal are serious. They suggest that alternatives to sedative/hypnotics should be used if early adjunctive treatment for anxiety in depressed patients is thought to be indicated.

AB  - One reason for the universal appeal of music lies in the emotional rewards that music offers to its listeners. But what makes these rewards so special? The authors addressed this question by progressively characterizing music-induced emotions in 4 interrelated studies. Studies 1 and 2 (n = 354) were conducted to compile a list of music-relevant emotion terms and to study the frequency of both felt and perceived emotions across 5 groups of listeners with distinct music preferences. Emotional responses varied greatly according to musical genre and type of response (felt vs. perceived). Study 3 (n = 801)-a field study carried out during a music festival-examined the structure of music-induced emotions via confirmatory factor analysis of emotion ratings, resulting in a 9-factorial model of music-induced emotions. Study 4 (n = 238) replicated this model and found that it accounted for music-elicited emotions better than the basic emotion and dimensional emotion models. A domain-specific device to measure musically induced emotions is introduced-the Geneva Emotional Music Scale.

AB  - Melatonin, an endogenous signal of darkness, is an important component of the body's internal timekeeping system. As such it regulates major physiological processes including the sleep wake cycle, pubertal development and seasonal adaptation. In addition to its relevant antioxidant activity, melatonin exerts many of its physiological actions by interacting with membrane MT1 and MT2 receptors and intracellular proteins such as quinone reductase 2, calmodulin, calreticulin and tubulin. Here we review the current knowledge about the properties and signaling of melatonin receptors as well as their potential role in health and some diseases. Melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors are G protein coupled receptors which are expressed in various parts of the CNS (suprachiasmatic nuclei, hippocampus, cerebellar cortex, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and retinal horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells) and in peripheral organs (blood vessels, mammary gland, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney and bladder, ovary, testis, prostate, skin and the immune system). Melatonin receptors mediate a plethora of intracellular effects depending on the cellular milieu. These effects comprise changes in intracellular cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP) and calcium levels, activation of certain protein kinase C subtypes, intracellular localization of steroid hormone receptors and regulation of G protein signaling proteins. There are circadian variations in melatonin receptors and responses. Alterations in melatonin receptor expression as well as changes in endogenous melatonin production have been shown in circadian rhythm sleep disorders, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, glaucoma, depressive disorder, breast and prostate cancer, hepatoma and melanoma. This paper reviews the evidence concerning melatonin receptors and signal transduction pathways in various organs. It further considers their relevance to circadian physiology and pathogenesis of certain human diseases, with a focus on the brain, the cardiovascular and immune systems, and cancer.

AB  - Background: Depression in older adults is a serious health problem with a poor prognosis. There is a need for indicated preventive psychological interventions for older adults, that show to be promising in preventing depressive disorders.
   Methods/design: This manuscript describes the design of a study evaluating 'Looking for Meaning', a newly developed prevention course for older adults with depressive symptoms, based on lifereview. Both clinical and economic effectiveness are evaluated in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. The control condition of this 12-session preventive intervention is a 20-minute video movie. The primary outcome is symptoms of depression at post-treatment and follow-up (6 months after post-treatment). Secondary outcomes are symptoms of anxiety, satisfaction with life, mastery, reminiscence styles, quality of life, and health care costs. An additional result of this study is the insight into the working elements of the course, provided by the qualitative study. The qualitative data, mainly based on 20 open-ended interviews with participants, are to be analyzed with an emphasis on newly emerging insight.
   Discussion: This study will add to the existing scientific knowledge in several ways, especially by also including an economic evaluation and a qualitative study to gain insight into the working mechanisms of the course, both rather new in the field of life review. Positive results of this study will make an evidence-based intervention to improve public health among older people available.

AB  - Majority of the brain dopamine (DA) neurons reside in a distinct area in the midbrain and project axons into the striatum and frontal cortex to control central nervous system (CNS) functions such as movement, motivation and mood. Age-associated specific loss of DA neurons particularly in the midbrain region substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) causes Parkinson disease (PD), an incurable condition characterized by rigidity, involuntary and slowed movement affecting about 1% of people over the age of 60 years. Dopamine neurons appear to be one of the most sensitive types of neurons to both intrinsic and extrinsic stressors in the brain. Here we summarize how transcription factors, growth factors and in particular neurotrophic factors are used to make and maintain DA neurons. We also discuss mechanisms that underlie their specific vulnerability and highlight current state of art in drug development.

AB  - How can we best develop explanatory models for psychiatric disorders? Because causal factors have an impact on psychiatric illness both at micro levels and macro levels, both within and outside of the individual, and involving processes best understood from biological, psychological, and sociocultural perspectives, traditional models of science that strive for single broadly applicable explanatory laws are ill suited for our field. Such models are based on the incorrect assumption that psychiatric illnesses can be understood from a single perspective. A more appropriate scientific model for psychiatry emphasizes the understanding of mechanisms, an approach that fits naturally with a multicausal framework and provides a realistic paradigm for scientific progress, that is, understanding mechanisms through decomposition and reassembly. Simple subunits of complicated mechanisms can be usefully studied in isolation. Reassembling these constituent parts into a functioning whole, which is straightforward for simple additive mechanisms, will be far more challenging in psychiatry where causal networks contain multiple nonlinear interactions and causal loops. Our field has long struggled with the interrelationship between biological and psychological explanatory perspectives. Building from the seminal work of the neuronal modeler and philosopher David Marr, the author suggests that biology will implement but not replace psychology within our explanatory systems. The iterative process of interactions between biology and psychology needed to achieve this implementation will deepen our understanding of both classes of processes.

AB  - Introduction. The objective is to assess the prevalence and treatment patterns of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in Spain as well as the cost associated to this disorder in different countries.
   Methods. A search in the literature of health and economics databases was conducted.
   Results. In regards to the 32 references selected, 6 studies had data on the prevalence of GAD and 3 on treatment patterns in Spain and 11 studies on the costs associated to the disease on an international level. The remaining 20 studies were of general interest for methodological or contextual reasons.
   Conclusions. GAD is a mental disorder with high prevalence. According to some authors, it is probably underdiagnosed. No appropriate long term treatment is available. High health care and social costs are associated to GAD. The frequent presence of comorbidity, different definitions and methodologies used in the studies limits the comparability and synthesis of the results. It also makes it difficult to obtain valid estimations of prevalence and costs.

AB  - Given the array of biological changes induced by stressors, it is not surprising that these experiences may provoke a variety of illnesses. Among others things, stressors promote functional changes of neuropeptide and classical neurotransmitter systems. The peptidergic changes, for instance, include alterations of corticotropin releasing hormone, arginine vasopressin, and bombesin-like peptides at specific brain sites. Similarly some of the neurotransmitter systems influenced by stressors include GABAergic and monoamine functioning. Variations of these processes may limit neurogenesis (and dysregulation of growth factors such as BDNF) and influence cellular viability (through NF kappa B and MAP kinase pathways). As well, stressors activate the inflammatory immune system, notably the release of signaling molecules (cytokines), which may provoke many of the same neuropeptide (and other neurotransmitter) changes. By virtue of their actions on neuronal functioning, inflammatory processes may influence stress-related illness, such as depression, and may be a common denominator for the comorbidity that exists between depression and neurological conditions, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, as well as cardiovascular-related pathology. The present report provides an overview of biological endophenotypes associated with stressors that are thought to be related to major depressive disorder and related comorbid conditions. The view is taken that synergy between stressors and inflammatory factors may promote pathological outcomes through their actions on neuropeptides and several neurotransmitters. As well, stressful events may result in the sensitization of neurochemical and cytokine processes, so that later re-exposure to these stimuli may promote rapid and exaggerated responses that favor illness recurrence.

AB  - Objective: To summarize current evidence on the effectiveness of different knowledge transfer and change interventions for improving primary and ambulatory anxiety care to provide guidance to professionals and policy-makers in mental health care.
   Method: We searched electronic medical and psychological databases, conducted correspondence with authors, and checked reference lists. Studies examining the effectiveness of knowledge transfer and interventions targeted at improvement of the recognition or management of anxiety in primary and ambulatory health care settings were included. Methodological details and outcomes were independently extracted and checked by 2 reviewers. Where appropriate, data concerning the impact of interventions on symptoms of anxiety were pooled using metaanalytical procedures.
   Results: We identified 24 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Seven professional-directed interventions and 17 organizational interventions (including patient-oriented interventions) were identified. The methodological quality of studies was variable. Professional-directed interventions only impact the process and outcome of care when embedded in some sort of organizational intervention. Metaanalysis (n = 8 studies) showed no effect of diverse organizational interventions on patients' anxiety symptoms (effect size, -0.08; 95% confidence interval, -0.31 to 0.15; P = 0.50). Collaborative care interventions proved to be the most effective organizational intervention strategies. Six studies reported economic results: 4 studies showed that intervention had a high probability of being cost-effective.
   Conclusions: Collaborative care seems to be very promising for improving primary and ambulatory care for anxiety. At the level of management and policy, the results of this review mandate the need to offer fair and reasonable reimbursement for collaborative care programs.

AB  - Nicotine can both activate and desensitize/inactivate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). An ongoing controversy in the field is to what extent the behavioral effects of nicotine result from activation of nAChRs, and to what extent receptor desensitization is involved in these behavioral processes. Recent electrophysiological studies have shown that both nAChR activation and desensitization contribute to the effects of nicotine in the brain, and these experiments have provided cellular mechanisms that could underlie the contribution of both these processes to nicotine-mediated behaviors. For instance, desensitization of nAChRs may contribute to the salience of environmental cues associated with smoking behavior and activation and desensitization of nAChRs may contribute to both primary and conditioned drug reward. Similarly, studies of the antidepressant-like effects of nicotinic agents have revealed a balance between activation and desensitization of nAChRs. This review will examine the evidence for the contribution of these two very different consequences of nicotine administration to behaviors related to nicotine addiction, including processes related to drug reinforcement and affective modulation. We conclude that there are effects of nAChR activation and desensitization on drug reinforcement and affective behavior, and that both processes are important in the behavioral consequences of nicotine in tobacco smoking.

AB  - Hydrogen peroxide concentrations [H2O2] have been measured over the last two decades in multiple studies in surface waters in coastal, estuarine and oceanic systems. Diurnal cycles consistent with a photochemical production process have frequently being observed, with [H2O2] increasing by two orders of magnitude over the course of the day, from low nM levels in the early morning to 102 nM in late afternoon. Production rates range from <10 for off-shore ocean waters to 20-60 nM h(-1) for near-shore coastal and estuarine environments. Slow night-time loss rates (<10 nM h(-1)) have been attributed to biological and particle mediated processes. Diurnal cycles have also frequently been observed in fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) levels in surf zone waters monitored for microbial water quality. Measured peak peroxide concentrations in surface coastal seawaters are too low to directly cause FIB mortality based on laboratory studies, but likely contribute to oxidative stress and diurnal cycling. Peroxide levels in the surf zone may be increased by additional peroxide production mechanisms such as deposition, sediments and stressed marine biota, further enhancing impacts on FIB in marine bathing waters.

AB  - Objective: Converging evidence suggests that the subgenual cingulate (SGC) is implicated in regulation of mood and in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Our objective was to carry out the first meta-analysis of SGC volumes in patients with mood disorders. Methods: We reviewed 10 volumetric magnetic resonance imaging studies of SGC volumes in patients with unipolar depression and bipolar disorders. For meta-analysis, we used standardized differences between means (SDMs) and random effects models. In the search for sources of heterogeneity, we subdivided the studies on the basis of diagnosis and presence of family history. Results: The volumes of left and right SGC in patients with mood disorders were significantly reduced relative to healthy control subjects (SDM-0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.67 to -0.1 and SDM -0.2, 95% CI -0.4 to -0.007, respectively). There were significant SGC volume reductions in patients with unipolar (left SGC SDM -0.5, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.07; right SGC SDM -0.33, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.02,), but not bipolar, disorder. Patients with a positive family history of mood disorders showed significant left SGC volume decrease (SDM -0.52, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.07), which was not present among subjects without family history of mood disorders. There was no association between age and SGC volumes. Conclusion: The available evidence suggests the existence of left and less robust right SGC volumetric reductions in patients with mood disorders, predominantly in those with unipolar depression. The effect size of this difference was moderate and increased in more homogeneous subgroups of patients with a positive family history. The clustering of SGC abnormalities in patients with a family history, their presence early in the illness course and their lack of progression with age make SGC a candidate for a primary vulnerability marker, although studies in unaffected high-risk subjects are missing.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Irreversible airflow limitation, both progressive and associated with an inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, is a hallmark of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the most important environmental risk factor for COPD, nevertheless, only approximately 20-30% of smokers develop symptomatic disease. Epidemiological studies, case-control studies in relatives of patients with COPD, and twin studies suggest that COPD is a genetically complex disease with environmental factors and many involved genes interacting together. Two major strategies have been employed to identify the genes and the polymorphisms that likely contribute to the development of complex diseases: association studies and linkage analyses. Biologically plausible pathogenetic mechanisms are prerequisites to focus the search for genes of known function in association studies. Protease-antiprotease imbalance, generation of oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation are recognized as the principal mechanisms leading to irreversible airflow obstruction and parenchymal destruction in the lung. Therefore, genes which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD are involved in antiproteolysis, antioxidant barrier and metabolism of xenobiotic substances, inflammatory response to cigarette smoke, airway hyperresponsiveness, and pulmonary vascular remodelling. Significant associations with COPD-related phenotypes have been reported for polymorphisms in genes coding for matrix metalloproteinases, microsomal epoxide hydrolase, glutathione-S-transferases, heme oxygenase, tumor necrosis factor, interleukines 1, 8, and 13, vitamin D-binding protein and beta-2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), whereas adequately powered replication studies failed to confirm most of the previously observed associations. Genome-wide linkage analyses provide us with a novel tool to identify the general locations of COPD susceptibility genes, and should be followed by association analyses of positional candidate genes from COPD pathophysiology, positional candidate genes selected from gene expression studies, or dense single nucleotide polymorphism panels across regions of linkage. Haplotype analyses of genes with multiple polymorphic sites in linkage disequilibrium, such as the ADRB2 gene, provide another promising field that has yet to be explored in patients with COPD. In the present article we review the current knowledge about gene polymorphisms that have been recently linked to the risk of developing COPD and/or may account for variations in the disease course.

   Methods. -PubMed search of all English-language papers published between January 1966 and December 2006 using and cross-listing key words: bipolar disorder, mixed states, criteria, utility, validation, gender, temperament, depression-mixed states, mixed depression, depressive mixed state/s, dysphoric hypomania, mixed hypomania, mixed/dysphoric mania, agitated depression, anxiety disorders, neuroimaging, pathophysiology, and genetics. A manual review of paper reference lists was also conducted.
   Results. -By classic diagnostic validators, the diagnostic validity of categorically-defined mixed depression (i.e. at least 2-3 manic/hypomanic symptoms) is mainly supported by family history (the current strongest diagnostic validator). Its diagnostic utility is supported by treatment response (negative effects of antidepressants). A dimensionally-defined mixed depression is instead supported by a non-bi-modal distribution of its intradepression manic/hypomanic symptoms.
   Discussion. -Categorically-defined mixed depression may have some diagnostic validity (family history is the current strongest validator). Its diagnostic utility seems supported by treatment response. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - As a consequence of human activity, the variability and range of environmental conditions is increasing. We review how the interactions between toxic chemicals and environmental change may affect exposure of aquatic organisms to stressful conditions and therefore alter the risk of deleterious impacts. Even in the absence of new inputs of contaminants, changing environmental conditions alters the transport, transformation and distribution of contaminants and their bioavailability. Conversely, some toxic chemicals modify the exposure of aquatic species to other stressors by affecting species distribution, behaviour or habitat. Across Canada there are a number of specific examples where interactions between contaminants and environmental change are probably harming aquatic species. In the Arctic, change in foraging brought on by change in ice regime, is a plausible mechanism to explain the marked recent increase in mercury concentrations in Beaufort Sea beluga whales. On the Pacific coast, chemical exposure by itself or in combination with other environmental factors, is a leading suspect for altered migration timing of some salmon stocks in the Fraser River leading to massive pre-spawning mortality. In the North Atlantic, short-term exposure of Atlantic salmon to endocrine-disrupting substances in their freshwater natal environments later leads to detectable effects at the time of their migration to saltwater. In Alberta, biotic and abiotic characteristics of the habitat dramatically affect exposure pathways and the risk of toxic effects of selenium in early life stages of trout. A better understanding of the interactions between toxic chemicals and environmental factors is a fundamental requirement for efficient management and protection of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Environmental change can increase the vulnerability of aquatic species to toxic chemicals by challenging an organism's aptitude to respond to chemicals or to repair toxic injury or by modifying animal behaviours like migration or predation. On the other hand, xenobiotics may affect the capacity of aquatic species to adapt to environmental challenges that come with change (e.g., pathogens, temperature). Across Canada we have identified a number of circumstances where chemicals and environmental variability have likely worked together to affect vulnerability of aquatic organisms. For example in the Maritimes, exposure to municipal wastewater or bleached kraft pulp mill effluent altered immune function in bivalves and increased their risk of developing haemocytic neoplasia, a disease known to cause high mortality. Northwest Atlantic cod stocks have experienced large-scale changes in environment and exhibit marked seasonal cycles in energy reserves. The risk associated with subsequent redistribution of persistent chemicals in the body together with nutritional deficiency is presently under evaluation since it could affect the recovery of these endangered stocks. In the Great Lakes, the introduction of an invasive fish species, the alewife, modified the diet of salmonids, which led to a deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in eggs causing early mortality. Contaminants may interact with thiamine deficiency and thus critically impair recruitment of salmonids. Viewing the risks presented by toxic chemicals from the point of view of species vulnerability, offers managers opportunities to mitigate such risks, for example, through habitat, ocean and fisheries management. Further research is needed to develop biomarkers of vulnerability, identify most vulnerable life stages and populations, to understand the interactions between global environmental changes, nutritional status, pathogens and toxic chemicals, and to develop integrated approaches to manage vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to toxic chemicals.

AB  - Background: The use of the term 'recovered' in outcome studies of schizophrenia has for a long time been problematic because of the many different definitions in use. In the present study different definitions of recovered in schizophrenia are reviewed and compared with similar definitions in other fields of medicine. Sampling and Methods: A literature search was done for criteria-based definitions of recovered as used in follow-up studies of patients with schizophrenia during the last 50 years and the current use of the term in other fields of medicine. Results: In medicine, only the field of psychiatry defines the term recovered to be synonymous with no or minimal signs of illness. Other fields only apply the term when studying the outcome of a specific function. In psychiatry, only the field of schizophrenia includes both symptoms and functioning in the definition. All but 1 of the 18 definitions found in use in the field of schizophrenia required minimal or no symptoms, while all differed in defining functional recovery. Recovered was seldom defined as following from a state of remission, and studies varied in requiring a stable phase. Conclusion: When using the term in the field of schizophrenia, a distinction should be made between symptomatic and functional recovery in order to place it in line with other fields of medicine. To avoid confusing the process of recovery from the state of being recovered, the term recovered should be reserved for use in outcome studies, following from a time in remission. We suggest 2 years.

AB  - Background: Depressive disorders are common and associated risks include the onset of secondary disorders, substance use disorders, impairment in social and occupational functioning, and an increase in suicidality. As the onset often occurs in youth, there is a clear imperative for early identification and intervention to ameliorate, if not prevent, associated distress. Methods: An extensive search of relevant databases and an ancestry search was undertaken. Results: There is a limited but growing body of literature on this topic that is discussed in relation to a clinical staging model, which may prove to be a useful framework for identifying where an individual lies along the continuum of the course of a depressive illness thus allowing interventions to be matched for that stage. The identification of a subsyndromal and prodromal stage of depressive disorders provides early intervention opportunities. Conclusions: It is argued that a clinical staging heuristic may increase the number of those treated early, which may in turn delay or prevent onset, reduce severity, or prevent progression in the course of depressive disorders.

AB  - Objectives: Conventional pesticides comprise a diverse group of substances intended to destroy, repel or control organisms identified as pests. Compared to the studies on lead, mercury, and PCBs, few epidemiological studies have assessed the developmental neurotoxicity of pesticides. Materials and Methods: Epidemiological studies focused on the neurobehavioural development of children exposed to pesticides were identified by searching the PubMed, Medline, EBSCO, Agricola and TOXNET databases. Results: The findings of the studies reviewed imply that children's exposure to pesticides may bring about impairments in their neurobehavioral development. Children exposed to organophosphate pesticides (OP), both prenatally and during childhood, may have difficulties performing tasks that involve short-term memory, and may show increased reaction time, impaired mental development or pervasive developmental problems. In newborns, the effects of OP exposure are manifested mainly by an increased number of abnormal reflexes, while in adolescents, by mental and emotional problems. The studies investigating association between exposure to organochlorine pesticides and neurodevelopmental effects show inconsistent results. While some studies report impairments in mental and psychomotor functions, other studies do not confirm the above. Conclusion: The information deriving from epidemiological studies indicate a need to increase awareness among people and children exposed to pesticides about the association between the use of pesticides and neurodevelopmental impairments. Therefore, the principle of prudence should become a rule.

AB  - Etiology and classification: Causal factors related with cognitive disability are multiples and can be classified as follows: Genetic, acquired (congenital and developmental), environmental and sociocultural. Likewise, in relation to the classification, cognitive disability has as a common denominator a subnormal intellectual functioning level; nevertheless, the extent to which an individual is unable to face the demands established by society for the individual's age group has brought about four degrees of severity: Mild, moderate, severe and profound. Diagnostic: The clinical history must put an emphasis on healthcare during the prenatal, perinatal and postnatal period and include the results of all previous studies, including a genealogical tree for at least three generations and an intentional search for family antecedents of mental delay, psychiatric illnesses and congenital abnormalities. The physical exam should focus on secondary abnormalities and congenital malformations, somatometric measurements and neurological and behavioral phenotype evaluations. If it is not feasible to establish a clinical diagnosis, it is necessary to conduct high-resolution cytogenetic studies in addition to metabolic clinical evaluations. In the next step, if no abnormal data are identified, submicroscopic chromosomal disorders are evaluated. Prognosis: Intellectual disability is not curable; and yet, the prognostic in general terms is good when using the emotional wellbeing of the individual as a parameter. Conclusions: Intellectual disability should be treated in a comprehensive manner. Nevertheless, currently, the fundamental task and perhaps the only one that applies is the detection of the limitation and abilities as a function of subjects' age and expectations for the future, with the only goal being to provide the support necessary for each one of the dimensions or areas in which the person's life is expressed and exposed.

It also describes major social constructs in theories of suicide and the extent to which studies support their importance to adolescent suicidality. PsychINFO and PubMed searches were conducted for empirical studies focused on family and friend support, social isolation, peer victimization, physical/sexual abuse, or emotional neglect as these relate to adolescent suicidality. Empirical findings converge in documenting the importance of multiple social and interpersonal factors to adolescent suicidality. Research support for the social constructs in several major theories of suicide is summarized and research challenges are discussed.

AB  - Neuroendocrine responses to an emotional or arousing experience modulate memory for the event. Extensive evidence suggests that epinephrine plays an important role in the regulation of memory formation by emotions and arousal. Some forms of synaptic plasticity are similarly responsive to modulation by stress and arousal. The present experiment examined the effects of epinephrine on induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in awake rats. Rats were prepared with bilaterally implanted electrodes for recording evoked field potentials in dentate granule cells following perforant pathway stimulation. LTP was induced with high-frequency stimulation parameters that resulted in modest early potentiation of the EPSP that decayed within 20 min. Epinephrine enhanced the magnitude of early LTP induction and also extended the durability of LTP from minutes to at least several days. Epinephrine did not alter baseline responses or modulate pre-LTP input-output curves. The enhancement of LTP by epinephrine was dose-dependent, following an inverted-U dose-response curve similar to that seen in memory enhancement experiments, suggesting considerable convergence of epinephrine modulation of memory and LTP. In extending substantially the maintenance of LTP after induction, the present finding offer potential means to study the neurobiology of rapid forgetting seen in aged rodents and other animals and the neurobiology of the impaired forgetting seen in post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Negative symptoms refer to the weakening or lack of normal thoughts, emotions or behaviour in schizophrenia patients. Their prevalence in first-episode psychosis is high, 50-90%, and 20-40% of schizophrenia patients have persisting negative symptoms. Severe negative symptoms during the early stages of treatment predict poor prognosis. The aim of the study was to review the current literature on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In June 2007, the following databases were searched: Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline (Ovid) and Scopus. The search included articles written in English and no time limit was determined. The studies were manually screened by one of the authors according to the title and abstract. About one in three schizophrenia patients suffer from significant negative symptoms. In these patients, negative symptoms constitute a key element of overall symptoms, weakening their ability to cope with everyday activities, affecting their quality of life and their ability to manage without significant outside help. About one in three schizophrenia patients suffer from significant negative symptoms. Attention should be focused on negative symptoms during the early phase of treatment, because they cause significant impairment to patients' quality of life. So far, no treatment appears to substantially improve negative symptoms narrowly defined. However, according to clinical experience, when treating negative symptoms, the best effect is achieved by optimizing the dose of medication and by complementing it with psychosocial therapies.

AB  - A considerable body of evidence suggests the involvement of serotonin neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of panic disorder. Research on pathways and functions of tryptophan, an essential amino acid converted into serotonin, may advance our understanding of serotonergic actions in panic disorder and related phenomena. The investigative approaches in this field include manipulations of tryptophan availability as well as genetic association and functional brain imaging studies. In this review we examine the principle findings of these studies and propose further research directions.

AB  - Goals, Scope and Background. Changing environmental conditions and handling stress are well known to cause chronic or acute stress situations in fish with subsequent infections. These requires a therapy by means of antibiotics and chemicals. In contrast to the huge number of pathogens, only a few substances are permitted for application as therapeutics in German aquaculture. Hence, there emerges an urgent need for highly effective and residueless alternatives.
   Main Features. The prophylactic stimulation and training of the defense system of fish by alternative approaches becomes increasingly necessary. One approach is the application of dissolved humic substances (HS) of natural or artificial origin. For example, there exist several reports on the positive effect of HS to fishes. These effects shall be considered in detail. Furthermore, the impact of HS on the constitution of parasites and pathogens will be displayed. The reports on this issue are diverse, if not inconsistent. We try to shed some light on these discrepancies. The last aspect covered by this review is the outdated paradigm that calcium ions act as antidotes. In the presence of HS, even the opposite effect may occur.
   Approach. To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential interactions with fish and fish parasites, we reviewed recent international literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own former and ongoing studies.
   Results and Discussion. HS are able to increase the physiological condition of the individuals and to reduce adverse physiological and histological consequences caused by stress; the mechanism behind remains obscure. HS detoxify heavy metals and organic pollutants. Damages caused by several fish pathogens, such as bacteria and parasites, can be repaired more quickly in the presence of HS. Some parasites - mainly fungi - appear to be directly affected by HS. Comparing the fungicidal effects of HS from various sources, evidence is increasing that the aliphatic moiety may be the effective structures. However, further research is necessary to relate more physiological and anti-pathogenic effects to the chemical characteristics of HS.
   Conclusions. HS are not real alternatives to strong traditional therapeutics. However, they show different advantages in repairing secondary, stress induced damages in fish. The ecophysiological relevance of HS in either aquatic systems or aquaculture is getting conspicuously.
   Perspectives. The lack of therapeutic and antiparasitic substances in aquaculture requires new strategies and ways of thinking. The search for alternatives to the 'traditional' chemical therapeutics calls for the intensive research. Inevitably, this search will lead to an intensive contemplation on HS as 'health promoting substances' and/or even therapeutics. Basic research is needed to detect the functional groups of the HS responsible for the effects observed. Health promoting effects of first investigations made in vitro to affect pathogens via application of HS and several field studies with HS raises hopes for a broader utilisation of HS to reduce stress consequences in fish and fish pathogens residuelessly.

AB  - For more than 50 years, Parkinson's disease (PD) has been conceptualized as a product of nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) system degeneration. In spite of a growing body of evidence depicting the mammalian brain as an interrelated complexity of circuitous systems, dopamine (DA) deficiency of the NSD is still regarded as the main problem, with DA replacement being the purpose of therapeutic intervention. For at least 191 years circadian involvement in various aspects of PD, including depression and insomnia, has been recognized as an integral part of the symptom matrix of PD and yet attempts to elucidate the involvement of this system is uncharted territory. The present review attempts a major reorganization of mammalian brain into a coordinated complex involving the NSD and the retinal hypothalamic tract (RHT) as the primary systems involved in the retino-diencephalic/mesencephalic-pineal (RDMP) axis. Secondary systems including the lateral hypothalamus (LH), the area postraema (AP) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) also form an integral part of this system as they have been shown to be either intimately related to the primary systems of the RDMP axis or have been shown to be significantly involved in the expression and treatment of PD. A large volume of evidence suggests that the RDMP axis is activated during the course of PD and during therapeutic intervention. Four types of neurotoxicity associated with melatonin are identified and the susceptibility of various parts of the RDMP axis to undergo neuropathological change, the tendency for melatonin to induce PD-like behavioural toxicity, and the relationship of this to PD symptomotology are described. This includes adverse effects of melatonin on motor function, hypotension, the adjuvant use of benzodiazepines, depression, insomnia, body weight regulation and various biochemical effects of melatonin administration: all problems currently facing the proposal to introduce melatonin as an adjuvant. It is suggested further that traditional DA replacement may well work by exerting its effect upon the circadian system, rather than simply replacing deficient DA. Activation of the circadian function by antagonizing melatonin with bright light not only has therapeutic value in treating the primary symptoms of PD but it shares a common mechanism with L-dopa in reducing the occurrence of seborrheic dermatitis. Concepts at the centre of understanding pineal function in PD, including pineal calcification, melatonin deficiency, symptomatic versus protective features of melatonin and antioxidative effects, are explained in a counterintuitive context. Intriguing propositions including the role of the retina in the aetiology of PD and that the nigra functions as a retina in this disorder are presented with the intention to provide a new understanding of the underlying compromised function in PD and to provide new treatment strategies. For the first time, abundant evidence is presented describing PD as an endocrine disorder of melatonin hyperplasia. The role of circadian interventive therapies and internal desynchrony in the aetiology and progression of PD provides a new direction for understanding the underlying physiology of a disease which is currently in a state of impasse and provides new hope for those who suffer from its debilitating effects.

AB  - Forensic psychiatry is concerned with the relationship between psychiatric abnormalities and legal violations and crimes. Due to the lack of available biological criteria, evaluation and therapy in forensic psychiatry have so far been restricted to psychosocial and mental criteria of offenders' personalities. Recent advances in neurosciences allow a closer approach to the neural correlates of personality, moral judgments and decision-making. We propose to discuss the introduction of biological criteria in the field of forensic psychiatry and to establish rules as to what extent such biological criteria will be a better and more reliable choice in judging mentally ill criminals by using all available information that can be obtained by biological means.
   Psychosocial and subjective criteria in forensic evaluation will be more and more accomplished by biopsychosocial and objective criteria. The responsibility of having committed a criminal act will no longer be exclusively defined by judging free and voluntary decision-making, but rather by brain-behavior relationships. What is often referred to as psychosocially determined mental processes thus could be complemented by estimating the degree of biopsychosocially determined neural processes. We conclude that such a process could contribute to a paradigm shift in forensic psychiatry, which will have profound implications for offenders, forensic psychologists and psychiatrists, the law and society in general.

AB  - This paper reviews the growing literature dealing with the antagonistic effect of selenium (Se) compounds on the toxicity of mercury (Hg) compounds in higher animals and organisms present in the aquatic environment. It covers both laboratory and field studies and summarizes the possible mechanisms that explain the protective action of Se compounds on mercuric mercury (Hg2+) and methylmercury (CH3Hg+) toxicity. The review is subdivided according to the molecular form of Hg and the organisms in which the antagonism has been studied. Many authors suggest that the protective effect of selenite on the toxicity of Hg2+ in mammals is due mainly to the in vivo formation of mercuric selenide (HgSe), a stable and biologically inert complex. The detection of HgSe has been confirmed in several studies in support of this mechanism. Possible mechanisms that may be involved in the antagonism between Se compounds and CH3Hg+ in mammals and aquatic organisms are also presented. The possibility of adding Se compounds to contaminated lakes and reservoirs as a remediation technique to limit the bioaccumulation of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ is critically discussed.

AB  - Background: Alpine skiing and snowboarding are popular winter activities worldwide, enjoyed by participants of all ages and skill levels. There is some evidence that the incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) in these activities may be increasing. These injuries can cause death or severe debilitation, both physically and emotionally, and also result in enormous financial burden to society. Indeed, TBI is the leading cause of death and catastrophic injury in the skiing and snowboarding population. Furthermore, there are severe limitations to therapeutic interventions to restore neurological function after TBI and SCI, and thus the emphasis must be on prevention.
   Objectives: (1) To examine the worldwide epidemiology of TBI and SCI in skiing and snowboarding; (2) to describe and examine the effectiveness of prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of TBI and SCI in skiing and snowboarding.
   Search strategy: Searches were performed on a variety of databases to identify articles relevant to catastrophic central nervous system injury in skiing and snowboarding. The databases included PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CDSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CCTR, SportDiscus, CINAHL, and Advanced Google searches.
   Selection criteria and data collection: After initial prescreening, articles included in the review required epidemiological data on SCI, TBI, or both. Articles had to be directly associated with the topic of skiing and/ or snowboarding and published between January 1990 and December 2004.
   Results: 24 relevant articles, from 10 different countries, were identified. They indicate that the incidence of TBI and SCI in skiing and snowboarding is increasing. The increases coincide with the development and acceptance of acrobatic and high-speed activities on the mountains. There is evidence that helmets reduce the risk of head injury by 22 -60%. Head injuries are the most common cause of death among skiers and snowboarders, and young male snowboarders are especially at risk of death from head injury.
   Conclusions: There should be enhanced promotion of injury prevention that includes the use of helmets and emphasizes the skier's and snowboarder's responsibility code.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) are safe methods for selectively modulating cortical excitability and activation, respectively, which have recently received increased interest regarding possible clinical applications. tDCS involves the application of low currents to the scalp via cathodal and anodal electrodes and has been shown to affect a range of motor, somatosensory, visual, affective and cognitive functions. Therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in clinical trials of tDCS for a variety of conditions including tinnitus, post-stroke motor deficits, fibromyalgia, depression, epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Its effects can be modulated by combination with pharmacological treatment and it may influence the efficacy of other neurostimulatory techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. CVS involves irrigating the auditory canal with cold water which induces a temperature gradient across the semicircular canals of the vestibular apparatus. This has been shown in functional brain-imaging studies to result in activation in several contralateral cortical and subcortical brain regions. CVS has also been shown to have effects on a wide range of visual and cognitive phenomena, as well as on post-stroke conditions, mania and chronic pain states. Both these techniques have been shown to modulate a range of brain functions, and display potential as clinical treatments. Importantly, they are both inexpensive relative to other brain stimulation techniques such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Run-off containing increased concentrations of sediment, nutrients, and pesticides from land-based anthropogenic activities is a significant influence on water quality and the ecologic conditions of nearshore areas of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Australia. The potential and actual impacts of increased pollutant concentrations range from bioaccumulation of contaminants and decreased photosynthetic capacity to major shifts in community structure and health of mangrove, coral reef, and seagrass ecosystems. A detailed conceptual model underpins and illustrates the links between the main anthropogenic pressures or threats (dry-land cattle grazing and intensive sugar cane cropping) and the production of key contaminants or stressors of Great Barrier Reef water quality. The conceptual model also includes longer-term threats to Great Barrier Reef water quality and ecosystem health, such as global climate change, that will potentially confound direct model interrelationships. The model recognises that system-specific attributes, such as monsoonal wind direction, rainfall intensity, and flood plume residence times, will act as system filters to modify the effects of any water-quality system stressor. The model also summarises key ecosystem responses in ecosystem health that can be monitored through indicators at catchment, riverine, and marine scales. Selected indicators include riverine and marine water quality, inshore coral reef and seagrass status, and biota pollutant burdens. These indicators have been adopted as components of a long-term monitoring program to enable assessment of the effectiveness of change in catchment-management practices in improving Great Barrier Reef (and adjacent catchment) water quality under the Queensland and Australian Governments' Reef Water Quality Protection Plan.

AB  - Objective: Converging lines of evidence indicate that defects in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) are associated with bipolar disorder (BD), and that mood-stabilizing drugs produce neuroprotective effects. Our objective is to review the most recent findings regarding this research.
   Method: We searched MEDLINE and have reviewed here the most recently published articles.
   Results: There are deletions, mutation, and decreased expression of mitochondrial ETC complexes in BD. Because ETC is a major source of reactive oxygen species, these factors, along with decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes in BD, suggest the presence of oxidative damage in this disorder. Numerous recent studies have shown that mood- stabilizing drugs produce neuroprotective effects against oxidative damage and increase expression and activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes in the rat brain.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that the process of oxidative damage could be a significant therapeutic target for the treatment of BD with mood-stabilizing drugs.

AB  - The purpose of the present review is to describe the neuropsychological correlates of long-term substance abuse and to discuss the findings within the context of premorbid vulnerabilities, comorbidity and adolescent neurodevelopment. The authors critically review key findings from the neuropsychological literature related to the long-term sequelae of alcohol, cannabis, inhalant, opiates, psychostimulants and ecstasy use. Leading electronic databases such as PubMed were searched to identify relevant studies published in the past 20 years. References identified from bibliographies of pertinent articles and books in the field were also collected and selectively reviewed. Across substances, individuals with long-term abuse consistently demonstrate neuropsychological impairments of executive (inhibitory) control, working memory and decision making, together with neurobiological abnormalities involving frontotemporal and basal ganglia circuits. In some instances these deficits are dose dependent, implying that they are a direct consequence of prolonged drug exposure. However, comorbid behavioural, personality and mental health problems are common among drug-using populations and are associated with similar neuropsychological deficits. Presented herein is a neuropsychological model of addictive behaviour that highlights the complex interplay between cognition, brain maturation, psychopathology and drug exposure.

AB  - Given the devastation caused by disasters and mass violence, it is critical that intervention policy be based on the most updated research findings. However, to date, no evidence-based consensus has been reached supporting a clear set of recommendations for intervention during the immediate and the mid-term post mass trauma phases. Because it is unlikely that there will be evidence in the near or mid-term future from clinical trials that cover the diversity of disaster and mass violence circumstances, we assembled a worldwide panel of experts on the study and treatment of those exposed to disaster and mass violence to extrapolate from related fields of research, and to gain consensus on intervention principles. We identified five empirically supported intervention principles that should be used to guide and inform intervention and prevention efforts at the early to mid-term stages. These are promoting: 1) a sense of safety, 2) calming, 3) a sense of self- and community efficacy, 4) connectedness, and 5) hope.

AB  - A developmental-contextual model of couples coping with chronic illness is presented that views chronic illness as affecting the adjustment of both the patient and the spouse such that coping strategies enacted by the patient are examined in relation to those enacted by the spouse, and vice versa. The developmental model emphasizes that dyadic coping may be different at various phases of the life span, changing temporally at different stages of dealing with the illness as well as unfolding daily as spouses interact around dyadic stressors. In addition, couples engaged in dyadic coping are affected by broad sociocultural factors (culture and gender) as well as more proximal contextual factors (quality of the marital relationship and the specific demands of the chronic illness). The model provides a framework for understanding how couples coping with chronic illness may together appraise and cope with illness during adulthood and for determining when spousal involvement is beneficial or harmful to both patient and spousal adjustment. The developmental-contextual model to dyadic appraisal and coping has numerous research implications for the field, and the authors conclude with specific recommendations for future research.

AB  - Background Postnatal depression has detrimental effects on the child's cognitive and emotional development. Aims To assess the benefits of treating postnatal depression for mother-infant interaction and child development.
   Method A systematic search was made of 12 electronic bibliographic databases for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials on treatment of mothers with postnatal depression, where outcomes were assessed in children; findings were assessed.
   Results Only eight trials met the inclusion criteria. Of those included, interventions varied widely but all involved therapies directed at the mother-infant relationship. One study with intensive and prolonged therapy showed cognitive improvement, whereas two others with briefer interventions improved maternal infant relationships but did not affect the child's cognitive or behavioural development. All five studies assessing only mother-infant relationships showed improvements.
   Conclusions Cognitive development in children of depressed mothers, along with better mother-infant relationships, might be improved with sustained interventions. Trials assessing treatments for postnatal depression would benefit from looking more closely at benefits for children as well as mothers, using validated objective measures.

AB  - The examination of correlates of diatom community structure has long been centred on local environmental factors instead of broad-scale biogeographical factors largely because diatom distribution has been considered cosmopolitan. However, a number of recent publications have stressed the role of regional constraints such as historical factors, evolution and variability in modem day dispersal ability in determining the diatom community structure. This study aims to review the literature examining freshwater diatom community structure in relation to environmental and spatial gradients, and to consider the results in a wider ecological context. Diatom literature stresses the importance of ion concentration and trophic status as major environmental drivers of diatom distribution in lakes and streams, while physical factors typically have a lesser effect on community structure. Moreover, studies where spatial configuration accounted for a significant proportion of the community variance clearly outnumbered the studies suggesting strict local environmental control. Freshwater diatom communities seem also to be strongly spatially structured. According to studies from both lakes and streams, pure spatial factors account for about 20-30% of the total explainable community variation, and thereby suggest that diatoms lack strict ubiquitous dispersal. For the studies conducted in lakes, a meta-analysis showed that the proportion of variance explained by local environmental factors decreased, though non-significantly, as study extent increased. Although the pattern was relatively weak, this may imply that the role of spatial factors increased with increasing study area. These results suggest that bioassessment programs utilising diatoms should consider spatial factors explicitly using, for example, regional stratification as diatom communities are strongly spatially structured.

AB  - Substance abuse is highly prevalent in schizophrenia and associated with numerous negative consequences. While studies have regularly reported more severe depressive symptoms in addicted schizophrenia patients relative to non-abusing patients, some studies have not corroborated this finding. The current meta-analysis was performed to quantify the relative severity of depressive symptoms in dual-diagnosis schizophrenia. A search of the literature using computerized engines was undertaken. Studies were retained in the analysis if (i) they assessed depressive symptoms using validated scales specific to depression (e.g. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale); and (ii) groups of schizophrenia patients were divided according to substance use disorders (alcohol, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin and/or phencyclidine). According to the inclusion criteria, 20 studies were available for mathematical analysis. A small, positive and significant effect size estimate (n = 3283; 1680 dual diagnosis; 1603 single diagnosis; adjusted Hedges's g = 0.292; p = 0.003) was obtained, within a random-effect model, suggesting that some dual-diagnosis patients experience more severe depressive symptoms than single-diagnosis patients. This significant difference was found only for studies using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale but not for other depression scales. The results of the present meta-analysis suggest that addicted schizophrenia patients experience more severe depressive symptoms compared to non-abusing patients, but that the difference is smaller than commonly assumed. The meta-analysis also shows that the significance of results is related to the scale used to measure depressive symptoms. These results have methodological implications for future studies of depressive symptoms in dual-diagnosis patients, and potential implications for the prevention and treatment of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia.

AB  - Quality of life (QoL) has been recognized as an important outcome of schizophrenia treatment, yet the determinants of QoL for individuals with schizophrenia are not well known. Research has consistently found psychiatric symptoms to be negatively related to QoL, however, findings concerning the strength of these relationships have been mixed, making it difficult to determine the degree to which such symptoms are related to poor QoL. This research presents a systematic meta-analysis of studies examining the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and QoL in schizophrenia, in an effort to elucidate the determinants of QoL for this population. A total of 56 studies were extracted from literature searches of relevant databases for empirical reports published between 1966 and 2005 examining the relationship between positive, negative, and/or general psychiatric symptoms and QoL. Weighted effect size analyses revealed small relationships between psychiatric symptoms and QoL, with general psychopathology showing the strongest negative associations across all QoL indicators. Moderator analyses indicated that variation in effect sizes could be accounted for by differing operationalizations of QoL, study design, sample, and participant treatment setting. In particular, positive and negative symptoms were more strongly related to poor QoL among studies of schizophrenia outpatients, whereas general psychopathology showed a consistent negative relationship with QoL across all study samples and treatment settings. Implications for future research and treatment development are discussed.

AB  - According to Beck's cognitive theory of depression, the concept of the schema is an important cognitive construct to aid the understanding of depression. Since then, the schema has been accepted as an important construct in other disorders. However, the measurement of schemas remains inconclusive. In 1990, the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ) was developed. A number of studies have reported on the psychometric properties of the long and short forms of the YSQ scale. Thus, an aim of the current paper was to review the empirical evidence of psychometric validity, reliability and predictive validity of the YSQ scale for depression. A literature review was undertaken with PsycINFO and Medline from 1990 to 2006, searching for articles reporting the psychometric properties of the YSQ. The YSQ was developed from a clinical perspective for the assessment of early maladaptive schema. At present, although the YSQ-Long Form (YSQ-LF) has been subjected to psychometric evaluation, no consistent factor structures have emerged. The YSQ-Short Form (YSQ-SF) has endured comparatively fewer investigations, although similar findings have been yielded. In addition, it appears that specific schemas possess predictive validity for depression, for example, Shame, Defectiveness, Insufficient Self-Control, Failure to Achieve, and Social Isolation. At present, the YSQ-LF and YSQ-SF are primarily research tools, and further work needs to be conducted on their psychometric properties. Thus, they should be utilised with caution and their relevance to the specific emotional disorder must be considered.

AB  - In the spirit of Adolf Mayer's medico-biological approach to the understanding of mental illnesses the article describes the advantages that neuropsychiatric approach brings to the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of psychiatric patients in a state hospital. Our review discusses the neuropsychiatric approach to the evaluation of state hospital patients with mild, moderate, and severe cognitive disturbances showing the role of neuropsychological testing, electroencephalography (EEG), and brain imaging in the neuropsychiatric assessment of primary and secondary mental illnesses. Neuropsychiatric evaluation helps to assess the peculiarities of movement disorder as a of side effects of regular psychiatric medications, e.g. the differences in diagnostic signs and treatment implication between Parkinson's disease and exrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) as a side effect of neuroleptics as well as the development of abnormal reflexes as a sign of tardive dyskinesia (TD) not directly related to the lesion of upper motor neuron. The article also discusses the development of hypokinetic delirium in the course of treatment of psychiatric patients not only as a side effect of neuroleptics but also of anticonvulsants, increasingly used as the mood stabilizers in modern psychiatry. Since aggressive behavior of psychiatric patients represents one of the major criteria for admission and often long term treatment in a state hospital, special consideration is given to the role of brain paroxysmal activity in the development of aggressive behavior, especially rage attacks, one of the main manifestations of aggressive behavior in a state hospital patients. Correspondingly, the use of anticonvulsants in the treatment of rage attacks is discussed. This article may serve as a model for the use of neuropsychiatric service in improvement of diagnostic evaluation and treatment of psychiatric patients in a state hospital.

AB  - Aim The article aims at describing and summarizing specific risk factors and occupational adverse health effects of agriculture related to typical European crops.
   Subjects and conclusion A systematic literature review applying a standardized electronic literature search strategy (Medline, Toxnet, EMBASE, AGRICOLA, Science Citation Index) was conducted until February 2007. Studies on specific work-related health risks were included as well as comprehensive reviews summarizing specific adverse health effects on organ systems. Studies that describe adverse health effects of agriculture outside of Europe but deal with typical crops of the European region were also included. The overview includes studies that provide epidemiological descriptions on the association of risk factors and special diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, hearing loss, infections, injuries, mental health disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, reproductive and developmental health, respiratory disorders and diseases of the skin.
   Results Concerning adverse health effects and risk factors, farming is mostly related to numerous risks. Various studies were mainly carried out to depict an epidemiologic description of risk factors of pesticide exposure and the occurrence of cancer. Possible health problems due to pesticide exposure, physical hazards as well as strong mental stress in agricultural settings especially in farming have also been shown.
   Conclusion There is a growing awareness of farmers' needs among providers of occupational health and safety services. In the future, the farming community will require better information on health risks in special production types like crop production to give them suitable information for avoiding health risks.

This encompasses the perception of gaze direction and its influence on perception of the other person, as well as gaze-following behavior such as joint attention, in infant, adult, and clinical populations. Particular focus is given to the gaze-cueing paradigm that has been used to investigate the mechanisms of joint attention. The contribution of this paradigm has been significant and will likely continue to advance knowledge across diverse fields within psychology and neuroscience.

As a result, there has been a recent explosion of research on chronic pain, with significant advances in better understanding its etiology, assessment, and treatment. The purpose of the present article is to provide a review of the most noteworthy developments in the field. The biopsychosocial model is now widely accepted as the most heuristic approach to chronic pain. With this model in mind, a review of the basic neuroscience processes of pain (the bio part of biopsychosocial), as well as the psychosocial factors, is presented. This spans research on how psychological and social factors can interact with brain processes to influence health and illness as well as on the development of new technologies, such as brain imaging, that provide new insights into brain-pain mechanisms.

AB  - Despite prompts from the field of family therapy since its inception, contemporary infant mental health theory and practice remain firmly rooted in and guided by dyadic-based models. Over the past 10 years, a groundswell of new empirical studies of triadic and family group dynamics during infancy have substantiated that which family theory has contended for decades: looking beyond mother-infant or father-infant dyads reveals a myriad of critically important socialization influences and dynamics that are missed altogether when relying on informant reports or dyad-based interactions. Such family-level dynamics emerge within months after infants are born, show coherence through time, and influence the social and emotional adjustment of children as early as the toddler and preschool years. This report summarizes key findings from the past decade of empirical family studies, highlights several areas in need of further conceptual development and empirical study by those who work with infants and their families, and outlines important implications of this body of work for all practicing infant mental health professionals.

   Recent findings We conducted a MEDLINE search of all English-language articles published between January 2004 and November 2006. Most studies,, report on medical comorbidity in bipolar samples; relatively fewer studies report the reciprocal association: Individuals with bipolar disorder are differentially affected by several 'stress-sensitive' medical disorders notably circulatory disorders, obesity and l diabetes mellitus. Neurological disorders (e.g. migraine), respiratory disorders and infectious diseases are also prevalent. Although relatively few studies have scrutinized the co-occurrence of bipolar disorder in medical settings, individuals with epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, migraine and circulatory disorders may have a higher prevalence of bipolar disorder. A clustering of traditional and emerging (e.g. immunoinflammatory activation) risk factors presage somatic health issues in the bipolar disorder population. latrogenic factors and insufficient access to primary, preventive and integrated healthcare systems are also contributory.
   Summary Somatic health issues in individuals with bipolar disorder are ubiquitous, under-recognized and suboptimally treated, Facile screening for risk factors and laboratory abnormalities along with behavioral modification for reducing medical comorbidity are warranted.

AB  - The nocebo effect is a phenomenon that is opposite to the placebo effect, whereby expectation of a negative outcome may lead to the worsening of a symptom. Thus far, its study has been limited by ethical constraints, particularly in patients, as a nocebo procedure is per se stressful and anxiogenic. It basically consists in delivering verbal suggestions of negative outcomes so that the subject expects clinical worsening. Although some natural nocebo situations do exist, such as the impact of negative diagnoses upon the patient and the patient's distrust in a therapy, the neurobiological mechanisms have been understood in the experimental setting under strictly controlled conditions. As for the placebo counterpart, the study of pain has been fruitful in recent years to understand both the neuroanatomical and the neurochemical bases of the nocebo effect. Recent experimental evidence indicates that negative verbal suggestions induce anticipatory anxiety about the impending pain increase, and this verbally-induced anxiety triggers the activation of cholecystokinin (CCK) which, in turn, facilitates pain transmission. CCK-antagonists have been found to block this anxiety-induced hyperalgesia, thus opening up the possibility of new therapeutic strategies whenever pain has an important anxiety component. Other conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, although less studied, have been found to be affected by nocebo suggestions as well. All these findings underscore the important role of cognition in the therapeutic outcome, and suggest that nocebo and nocebo-related effects might represent a point of vulnerability both in the course of a disease and in the response to a therapy.

AB  - Mental localization efforts tend to stress the where more than the what. We argue that the proper targets for localization are well-specified cognitive models. We make this case by relating an existing cognitive model of category learning to a learning circuit involving the hippocampus, perirhinal, and prefrontal cortices. Results from groups varying in function along this circuit (e.g., infants, amnesics, and older adults) are successfully simulated by reducing the model's ability to form new clusters in response to surprising events, such as an error in supervised learning or an unfamiliar stimulus in unsupervised learning. Clusters in the model are akin to conjunctive codes that are rooted in an episodic experience (the surprising event) yet can develop to resemble abstract codes as they are updated by subsequent experiences. Thus, the model holds that the line separating episodic and semantic information can become blurred. Dissociations (categorization vs. recognition) are explained in terms of cluster recruitment demands.

AB  - Aim: This article reviews research centred around juvenile bipolar disorder with particular reference to diagnostic difficulties. Putative deficits are scrutinized with respect to trait likelihood and the roles of neuropsychology and neuroimaging in enhancing our understanding of juvenile bipolar disorder are discussed.
   Methods: Search terms including childhood, adolescent, youth and juvenile combined with the terms 'bipolar disorder', mania, depression and hypomania were used to identify relevant studies in MEDLINE and PsychLit.
   Results: Over recent years research into this relatively new disorder has increased phenomenally. Key issues within the field include diagnostic specificity, the heritability of the disorder, the impact of comorbidity and the implications of neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings.
   Conclusion: Despite concerning controversies in literature the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents as compared with adults, promising future research directions include better neurological characterization of the disorder through the application of findings from clinical populations, neuropsychological and neuroimaging research.

AB  - Attentional control theory is an approach to anxiety and cognition representing a major development of Eysenck and Calvo's (1992) processing efficiency theory. It is assumed that anxiety impairs efficient functioning of the goal-directed attentional system and increases the extent to which processing is influenced by the stimulus-driven attentional system. In addition to decreasing attentional control, anxiety increases attention to threat-related stimuli. Adverse effects of anxiety on processing efficiency depend on two central executive functions involving attentional control: inhibition and shifting. However, anxiety may not impair performance effectiveness (quality of performance) when it leads to the use of compensatory strategies (e.g., enhanced effort; increased use of processing resources). Directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Objective: While Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) have been positioned as first-line evidence-based treatments for depression, we suggest that limitations to the 'evidence' deserve wider appreciation.
   Method: A systematic literature search was undertaken, and limitations to the evidence base discussed.
   Results: The review suggests that the specificity of CBT and IPT treatments for depression has yet to be demonstrated and details likely reasons.
   Conclusion: The superiority of CBT and IPT may well be able to be demonstrated across defined rather than universal circumstances. To achieve this aim, outcome research should move away from testing treatments as if they have universal application for heterogeneous disorder categories. Findings have distinct implications for the clinical management of depressive disorders, and particularly in relation to the utility of psychotherapy.

AB  - The striatum is thought to be an essential region for integrating diverse information in the brain. Rapid inhibitory gating (IG) of sensory input is most likely an early factor necessary for appropriate integration to be completed. Gating is currently evaluated in clinical settings and is dramatically altered in a variety of psychiatric illnesses. Basic neuroscience research using animals has revealed specific neural sites involved in IG including the hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem, amygdala and media[ prefrontal cortex. The present study investigated local IG in the basal ganglia structure of the striatum using chronic recording microwires. We obtained both single unit activations and local field potentials (LFPs) in awake behaving rats from each wire during the standard two-tone paradigm. Single units responded with different types of activations including a phasic and sustained excitation, an inhibitory response and a combination response that contained both excitatory and inhibitory components. IG was observed in all the response types; however, non-gating was observed in a large proportion of responses as well. Positive wave field potentials at 50-60 ms post-stimulus (P60) showed consistent gating across the wire arrays. No significant correlations were found between single unit and LFP measures of gating during the initial baseline session. Gating was strengthened (T-amp/C-amp ratios approaching 0) following acute stress (saline injection) at both the single unit and LFP level due to the reduction in the response to the second tone. Alterations in sensory responding reflected by changes in the neural response to the initial tone were primarily observed following long-term internal state deviation (food deprivation) and during general locomotion. Overall, our results support local IG by single neurons in striatum but also suggest that rapid inhibition is not the dominant activation profile observed in other brain regions. (c) 2007 IBRO.

AB  - Objective: This review aimed to examine evidence for the role of hormonal changes in the onset and course of depressive symptomatology and to assess the possible future role of hormonal therapies in the treatment of depression. Methods: A Medline and PsycINFO search of the literature published between 1965 and 2006 was made of studies of depressive symptoms and hormonal treatment in women at all stages of reproductive life. Results: The cyclic fluctuation of gonadal steroids at menarche coincides with the beginning of gender-based differences in depression rates, which continue throughout reproductive life until menopause. Modifications in hormonal status, whether related to endogenous or exogenous exposure or to hormone deprivation, appear to be associated with affective disorder in a subgroup of women. For these women, a growing body of evidence indicates a biological pattern of vulnerability to mood disorders in response to hormonal fluctuations. This could have three major implications: that women vary in vulnerability to mood disorder when abrupt change in steroid levels occur, that these effects could be cumulative across the female life span, and that women do not arrive at menopause with equal risk of mood disorders or equal susceptibility to the effects of hormonal replacement therapy as has been assumed by current clinical research and practice. Conclusion: While hormonal therapies could have positive effects in the treatment and prevention of depressive disorders, further research is required to differentiate hormone-responsive subgroups of women for whom specific hormonal treatments may be most beneficial. To this end, we suggest that a multifactorial model of cumulative vulnerability, which takes into account hormonal exposure throughout life, genetic vulnerability, and environmental factors, may provide better prediction of treatment response.

AB  - Development represents a critical moment for shaping adult behavior and may set the stage to disease vulnerability later in life. There is now compelling evidence that stressful experiences during gestation or early in life can lead to enhanced susceptibility for mental illness. In this paper we review the data from experimental studies aimed at investigating behavioral, hormonal, functional and molecular consequences of exposure to stressful events during prenatal or early postnatal life that might contribute to later psychopathology. The use of the newest methodology in the field and the intensive efforts produced by researchers have opened the possibility to reveal the complex, finely tuned and previously unappreciated sets of molecular interactions between different factors that are critical for neurodevelopment thus leading to important discoveries regarding perinatal life. The major focus of our work has been to revise and discuss data from animal studies supporting the role of neuronal plasticity in the long-term effects produced by developmental adversities on brain function as well as the possible implications for disease vulnerability. We believe these studies might prove useful for the identification of novel targets for more effective pharmacological treatments of mental illnesses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Depression is a prevalent high-impact illness with poor outcomes in primary care settings. We performed a systematic review to determine to what extent multifaceted interventions improve depression outcomes in primary care and to define key elements, patients who are likely to benefit and resources required for these interventions.
   Method: We searched Medline, HealthSTAR, CINAHL, PsycINFO and a specialized registry of depression trials from 1966 to February 2006; reviewed bibliographies of pertinent articles; and consulted experts. Searches were limited to the English language. We included 28 randomized controlled trials that: (a) involved primary care patients receiving acute-phase treatment; (b) tested a multicomponent intervention involving a patient-directed component; and (c) reported effects on depression severity. Pairs of investigators independently abstracted information regarding (a) setting and subjects, (b) components of the intervention and (c) outcomes.
   Results: Twenty of 28 interventions improved depression outcomes over 3-12 months (an 18.4% median absolute increase in patients with 50% improvement in symptoms; range, 8.3-46%). Sustained improvements at 24-57 months were demonstrated in three studies addressing acute-phase and continuation-phase treatments. All interventions involved care management and required additional resources or staff reassignment to implement; interventions were delivered exclusively or predominantly by telephone in 16 studies. The most commonly used intervention features were: patient education and self-management, monitoring of depressive symptoms and treatment adherence, decision support for medication management, a patient registry and mental health supervision of care managers. Other intervention features were highly variable.
   Conclusion: There is strong evidence supporting the short-term benefits of care management for depression; critical elements for successful programs are emerging. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mounting evidence for neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has fundamentally challenged the traditional view of brain development. The intense search for clues as to the functional significance of the new neurons has uncovered a surprising connection between neurogenesis and depression. In animal models of depression, neurogenesis is reduced, whereas many treatments for depression promote neurogenesis. We speculate on why the hippocampus, traditionally viewed as a memory structure, might be involved in mood disorders, and what specific,role the new neurons might have in the pathogenesis of and recovery from depression. The proposed role of neurogenesis in contextual-memory formation predicts a specific pattern of cognitive deficits in depression and has important implications for treatment of this highly prevalent and debilitating disorder.

AB  - Research on heart rate variability (HRV), cardiac vagal tone, and their relationship to anxiety is reviewed in the context of the autonomic flexibility and neurovisceral integration models of adaptive functioning. These perspectives address the qualities of response flexibility and inhibition across multiple levels, incorporating central and autonomic nervous system mechanisms of environmental engagement, as well as principles derived from non-linear dynamics. These models predict reduced HRV and vagal tone in anxiety, and the literature has generally supported this prediction, with exceptions as are noted. State, trait, and clinical expressions of anxiety are considered, along with the clinical, methodological, and theoretical implications of this research. A portrayal of anxiety as a restricted response range across biological and behavioral realms of functioning is drawn from the literature on anxiety and HRV. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating chronic disease management models for depression in primary care and to look at the implications for clinical practice in Canada.
   Methods: We reviewed all RCTs conducted between 1992 and 2006, including other reviews and analyses of pooled data. Using various search terms, we searched PsycINFO, Cinahl (1982 to May 2005), MEDLINE (1995 to 2005), EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and PubMed.
   Results: There is conclusive evidence for the benefits of changing systems of care delivery to support the more effective management of depression in primary care. Most studies have demonstrated improved outcomes in terms of symptom reduction, relapse prevention, functioning in the community, adherence to treatment, community and workplace involvement, and satisfaction with care received.
   Conclusions: Primary care practices need to examine how they can incorporate different concepts and models for managing depression. Components to consider include case registries, care managers or coordinators, treatment algorithms, follow-up and monitoring after a treated episode, care and relapse prevention plans, visits by psychiatrists, and training and ongoing education for all providers.

AB  - Background: Recent studies questioned the current categorical split of mood disorders into bipolar disorders ( BP) and depressive disorders (MDD). Methods: Medline database search of papers from the last 10 years on the categorical-dimensional classifcation of mood disorders. Various combinations of the following key words were used: mood disorders, bipolar, unipolar, major depressive disorder, spectrum, category/categorical, classifcation, continuity. Only English language clinical papers were included, review papers were excluded, similar papers selected by quality. The number of papers found was 1,141. The number of papers selected was 109. Results: The continuity/spectrum between BP (mainly BP-II) and MDD was supported by the following findings: (1) high frequency of mixed states (mixed mania, mixed hypomania, mixed depression, i.e. co-occurring depression and noneuphoric manic/hypomanic symptoms) because opposite polarity symptoms in the same episode do not support a hypomania/mania-depression splitting; (2) MDD was the most common mood disorder in BP probands' relatives; (3) no bimodal distribution of distinguishing symptoms between BP and MDD; (4) bipolar signs not uncommon in MDD; (5) many MDD shifting to BP; (6) many lifetime manic/hypomanic symptoms in MDD; (7) correlation between lifetime manic/hypomanic symptoms and MDD symptoms; (8) hypomania factors in MDD; (9) MDD often recurrent; (10) similar cognitive style. The categorical distinction between BP (mainly BP-I) and MDD was supported by the following findings: (1) BP more common in BP probands' relatives; (2) lower age at BP onset; (3) females as common as males in BPI, more common than males in MDD; (4) BP-I depression more atypical and retarded, MDD depression more sleepless and agitated; (5) BP more recurrent. Conclusions: Focusing on mood spectrum's extremes (BP-I vs. MDD), a categorical distinction seems supported. Focusing on midway disorders (BP-II and MDD plus bipolar signs), a continuity/spectrum seems supported. Results seem to support both a categorical and a dimensional view of mood disorders.

AB  - Objective: Prostate cancer (PCA) is the most common malignancy and a major cause of death in men but, importantly, a substantial proportion will live for several years following diagnosis. However, they face the prospect of experiencing symptoms, side-effects of treatment and diminished quality of life. The patient's psychological adjustment is particularly complex, given the potential trajectory of the disease, from the point of diagnosis, with its immediate impact, to the phase of palliative care, with its attendant issue of facing mortality. Since a comprehensive review of the literature on psychological adjustment of men with PCA has not yet been done, we have documented relevant research, integrated findings and drawn conclusions, where possible, in order to map out clinical and research implications.
   Method: We searched 5 databases for the period 1994 - July 2006, during which most of the work in the field has been done.
   Results: We found few studies of substance among the 60 we examined to draw conclusions about psychological adjustment to prostate cancer and its treatment. This is in marked contrast to the picture in breast cancer. While some patterns have emerged, many gaps remain to be filled.
   Discussion: Aspects of methodology need attention, particularly longitudinal, prospective designs, incorporation of control groups and the use of valid and reliable measures. There is scope for qualitative studies as a complement to quantitative research.

AB  - Aged rats display a broad range of behavioral performance in spatial learning. The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes that are associated with learning and memory impairments. We first categorized aged-superior learners and age learning-impaired rats based on their performance in the Morris water maze (MWM) and then isolated messenger RNA from the CA1 hippocampal region of each animal to interrogate Affymetrix microarrays. Microarray analysis identified a set of 50 genes that was transcribed differently in aged-superior learners that had successfully learned the spatial strategy in the MWM compared to aged learning-impaired animals that were unable to learn and a variety of groups designed to control for all non-learning aspects of exposure to the water maze paradigm. A detailed analysis of the navigation patterns of the different groups of animals during acquisition and probe trials of the MWM task was performed. Young animals used predominantly an allocentric (spatial) search strategy and aged-superior learners appeared to use a combination of allocentric and egocentric (response) strategies, whereas aged-learning impaired animals displayed thiginotactic behavior. The significant 50 genes that we identified were tentatively classified into four groups based on their putative role in learning: transcription, synaptic morphology, ion conductivity and protein modification. Thus, this study has potentially identified a set of genes that are responsible for the learning impairments in aged rats. The role of these genes in the learning impairments associated with aging will ultimately have to be validated by manipulating gene expression in aged rats. Finally, these 50 genes were functioning in the context of an aging CA1 region where over 200 genes was found to be differentially expressed compared to a young CA1. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There is a constant stream of information emanating from psychiatric research. The challenge for the clinician to keep abreast of the latest research findings is huge. However, even more daunting is the task of making sense of the sometimes conflicting data. In this paper, we provide some examples of evidence that seemed to have been accepted with relatively little critical examination. We discuss how evidence may look plausible on the surface either because contextual factors have not been considered or because they fit into a pre-determined world view. We argue that, in the end, the process of making sense of evidence is not straightforward and that professional biases and social prejudices often influence decisions.

AB  - Background: We evaluate the evidence that depression, anger, hostility, and anxiety are related to risk for the metabolic syndrome, focusing as well on its components of central adiposity and insulin resistance. In addition, we identify possible moderators of these associations and summarize plausible underlying biobehavioral pathways. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science searches were conducted using the keywords metabolic syndrome, syndrome x, central adiposity/obesity, visceral adiposity/obesity, body fat distribution, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, insulin resistance/sensitivity, glucose tolerance, psychological, depression, hostility, anger, cynicism, and anxiety. Results: The current literature provides cross-sectional evidence for an association between psychological characteristics and the metabolic syndrome. Prospective data, though limited, suggest that depression, hostility, and anger predict increased risk for the metabolic syndrome. Data on modifiers are too limited to permit definitive conclusions. Negative health behaviors and hypothalamic and sympathetic dysregulation are identified as plausible underlying pathways. Conclusions: More prospective studies, conducted with diverse samples, are needed to delineate the direction of this relationship and the proposed biobehavioral mechanisms; experimental investigations are needed to test for causality. Nevertheless, findings suggest that psychological characteristics, especially depression, hostility, and anger, may increase risk for the metabolic syndrome, providing a novel direction for prevention and treatment interventions.

AB  - The limited number of suitable animal models of bipolar disorder available for in-depth behavioral, biochemical, histological, and pharmacological analysis is a rate-limiting step in the process of understanding the relevant neurobiology of the disorder, as well as the development of novel medications. In the search for new models, both new and old approaches hold promise for future discoveries. Clinical studies regarding the underlying genetics and pathophysiology of bipolar disorder are providing important clues. In particular, the identification of susceptibility genes for bipolar disorder will help to define specific neurobiological processes, and associated behaviors, that are unquestionably involved in the pathways connecting genes and distal symptoms. These endophenotypes will hold great value in further enhancing the validity of animal models and will strongly complement symptom-based models and models of medication efficacy. Regardless of the path taken by different researchers to develop better models, we believe that this area of work requires additional attention not only from researchers but also from funding agencies.

AB  - These practical guidelines for the biological treatment of personality disorders in primary care settings were developed by an international Task Force of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP). They embody the results of a systematic review of all available clinical and scientific evidence pertaining to the biological treatment of three specific personality disorders, namely borderline, schizotypal and anxious/avoidant personality disorder in addition to some general recommendations for the whole field. The guidelines cover disease definition, classification, epidemiology, course and current knowledge on biological underpinnings, and provide a detailed overview on the state of the art of clinical management. They deal primarily with biological treatment (including antidepressants, neuroleptics, mood stabilizers and some further pharmacological agents) and discuss the relative significance of medication within the spectrum of treatment strategies that have been tested for patients with personality disorders, up to now. The recommendations should help the clinician to evaluate the efficacy spectrum of psychotropic drugs and therefore to select the drug best suited to the specific psychopathology of an individual patient diagnosed for a personality disorder.

AB  - Using GABAergic outputs from the SNr or GP(i), the basal ganglia exert inhibitory control over several motor areas in the brainstem which in turn control the central pattern generators for the basic motor repertoire including eye-head orientation, locomotion, mouth movements, and vocalization. These movements are by default kept suppressed by tonic rapid firing of SNr/GP(i) neurons, but can be released by a selective removal of the tonic inhibition. Derangement of the SNr/GP(i) outputs leads to either an inability to initiate movements (akinesia) or an inability to suppress movements (involuntary movements). Although the spatio-temporal patterns of individual movements are largely innate and fixed, it is essential for survival to select appropriate movements and arrange them in an appropriate order depending on the context, and this is what the basal ganglia presumably do. To achieve such a goal, however, the basal ganglia need to be trained to optimize their outputs with the aid of cortical inputs carrying sensorimotor and cognitive information and dopaminergic inputs carrying reward-related information. The basal ganglia output to the thalamus, which is particularly developed in primates, provides the basal ganglia with an advanced ability to organize behavior by including the motor skill mechanisms in which new movement patterns can be created by practice. To summarize, an essential function of the basal ganglia is to select, sort, and integrate innate movements and learned movements, together with cognitive and emotional mental operations, to achieve purposeful behaviors. Intricate hand-finger movements do not occur in isolation; they are always associated with appropriate motor sets, such as eye-head orientation and posture.

AB  - Melatonin is the pineal hormone and its activity is associated with the two known receptors-ML1 and ML2. Melatonin is an indoleamine and has found potent role in the biological regulation of circadian rhythms, sleep-mood disorders, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and aging. Melatonin passively diffuses into bloodstream showing its maximum effectiveness. Melatonin preserves mitochondrial homeostasis, increases gene expression for antioxidant enzymes and enhances quality of life. It has proved to be a powerful antioxidant and its efficacy is particularly exhibited in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease whose pathogenesis is associated with the cytotoxic effect of oxygen free radicals. Therapeutic trials with melatonin have been effective in slowing down the progression of some neurodegenerative disorders. Studies suggest that melatonin may have a clinical potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and many other incurable ailments.

AB  - We present here a pilot study of child-robot interactions, in which we discuss developmental origins of human interpersonal communication. For the past few years, we have been observing 2- to 4-year-old children with autism interacting with Keepon, a creature-like robot that is only capable of expressing its attention (directing its gaze) and emotions (pleasure and excitement). While controlled by a remote experimenter, Keepon interacted with the children with its simple appearance and actions. With a sense of curiosity and security, the children spontaneously approached Keepon and engaged in dyadic interaction with it, which then extended to triadic interactions where they exchanged with adult caregivers pleasure and surprise they found in Keepon. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of these unfolding interactions suggests that autistic children possess the motivation to share mental states with others, which is contrary to the commonly held position that this motivation is impaired in autism. We assume Keepon's minimal expressiveness helped the children understand socially meaningful information, which then activated their intact motivation to share interests and feelings with others. We conclude that simple robots like Keepon would facilitate social interaction and its development in autistic children.

AB  - We have previously reported that acute dopaminergic blockade in healthy volunteers results in a transient disruption of the recognition of facial expressions of anger, whilst leaving intact the recognition of other facial expressions (including fear and disgust) and facial identity processing. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by cell loss in dopaminergic neuronal populations, and hence we predicted that PD would be associated with impaired anger recognition. We reasoned that treatment with dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) could mask any deficit present in PD, and therefore studied facial expression recognition in a group of PD patients transiently withdrawn from DRT. Seventeen PD patients were compared to 21 age- and IQ-matched controls on the Ekman 60 task, which required the forced-choice labelling of 10 exemplars of each of six facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise). In line with our predictions, PD patients showed a selective impairment in the recognition of facial expressions of anger. This deficit was not related to the PD patients' performance on the Benton unfamiliar-face matching task, which was normal, nor was the deficit related to overall disease severity, or to depression symptoms. However, as predicted by simulation theories, impaired anger recognition in PD was related to reduced levels of the anger-linked temperament trait, exploratory excitability. The results extend our previous findings of a role for dopamine in the processing of facial expressions of anger, and demonstrate the power of adopting a phylogenetic, comparative perspective on emotions.

AB  - In this review we evaluate the cognitive and neural effects of positive and negative mood on executive function. Mild manipulations of negative mood appear to have little effect on cognitive control processes, whereas positive mood impairs aspects of updating, planning and switching. These cognitive effects may be linked to neurochemistry: with positive mood effects mediated by dopamine while negative mood effects may be mediated by serotonin levels. Current evidence on the effects of mood on regional brain activity during executive functions, indicates that the prefrontal cortex is a recurrent site of integration between mood and cognition. We conclude that there is a disparity between the importance of this topic and awareness of how mood affects, executive functions in the brain. Most behavioural and neuroimaging studies of executive function in normal samples do not explore the potential role of variations in mood, yet the evidence we outline indicates that even mild fluctuations in mood can have a significant influence on neural activation and cognition.

AB  - For nearly as long as lithium has been in clinical use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, depression, and other conditions, investigators have attempted to characterize its effects on behaviors in rodents. Lithium consistently decreases exploratory activity, rearing, aggression, and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion; and it increases the sensitivity to pilocarpine-induced seizures, decreases immobility time in the forced swim test, and attenuates reserpine-induced hypolocomotion. Lithium also predictably induces conditioned taste aversion and alterations in circadian rhythms. The modulation of stereotypy, sensitization, and reward behavior are less consistent actions of the drug. These behavioral models may be relevant to human symptoms and to clinical endophenotypes. It is likely that the actions of lithium in a subset of these animal models are related to the therapeutic efficacy, as well the side effects, of the drug. We conclude with a brief discussion of various molecular mechanisms by which these lithium-sensitive behaviors may be mediated, and comment on the ways in which rat and mouse models can be used more effectively in the future to address persistent questions about the therapeutically relevant molecular actions of lithium.

AB  - Animal models that are characterised by long-lasting conditioned fear responses as well as generalised behavioural sensitisation to novel stimuli following short-lasting but intense stress have a phenomenology that resembles that of PTSD in humans. These models include brief sessions of shocks, social confrontations, and a short sequence of different stressors. Subgroups of animals with different behavioural traits or coping styles during stress exposure show a different degree or pattern of long-term sensitisation. Weeks to months after the trauma, treated animals on average also show a sensitisation to novel stressful stimuli of neuroendocrine, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal motility responses as well as altered pain sensitivity and immune function. Functional neuroanatomical and pharmacological studies in these animal models have provided evidence for involvement of amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, and of brain stem areas regulating neuroendocrine and autonomic function and pain processing. They have also generated a number of neurotransmitter and neuropeptide targets that could provide novel avenues for treatment in PTSD. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Migration is a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia.
   Aims To examine whether migration is also a risk factor for bipolar affective disorder, unipolar depressive disorder and mood disorders in general.
   Method Medline was searched for population-based incidence studies concerning mood disorders among migrants and mean relative risks were computed using a mixed-effects statistical model.
   Results Only a few studies of unipolar depressive disorder were retrieved. The mean relative risk of developing bipolar affective disorder among migrants was 2.47 (95% Cl 1.33-4.59). However, after excluding people of African-Caribbean origin in the UK this risk was no longer significantly increased. The mean relative risk of mood disorders of unspecified polarity was 1.25 (95% Cl 1.04-1.49) and that of any mood disorder was 1.38 (95% Cl 1.17-1.62).
   Conclusions There is no conclusive evidence for a large increase in the risk of mood disorders associated with migration.

AB  - This study presents a new theory to explain the neural origins of human mind. This is the psychomotor theory. The author briefly analyzed the historical development of the mind-brain theories. The close relations between psychological and motor systems were subjected to a rather detailed analysis, using psychiatric and neurological examples. The feedback circuits between mind, brain, and body were shown to occur within the mind-brain-body triad, in normal states, and psycho-neural diseases. It was stated that psychiatric signs and symptoms are coupled with motor disturbances; neurological diseases are coupled with psychological disturbances; changes in cortico-spinal motor-system activity may influence mind-brain-body triad, and vice versa. Accordingly, a psychomotor theory was created to explain the psychomotor coupling in health and disease, stating that, not the mind-brain duality or unity, but the mind-brain-body triad as a functional unit may be essential in health and disease, because mind does not end in the brain, but further controls movements, in a reciprocal manner; mental and motor events share the same neural substrate, cortical, and spinal motoneurons; mental events emerging from the motoneuronal system expressed by the human language may be closely coupled with the unity of the mind-brain-body triad. So, the psychomotor theory rejects the mind-brain duality and instead advances the unity of the psychomotor system, which will have important consequences in understanding and improving the human mind, brain, and body in health and disease.

   Aims To use meta-regression to identify 'active ingredients' in collaborative care models for depression in primary care.
   Method Studies were identified using systematic searches of electronic clatabases. The content of collaborative care interventions was coded, together with outcome data on antidepressant use and depressive symptoms. Meta-regression was used to examine relationships between intervention content and outcomes.
   Results There was no significant predictor of the effect of collaborative care on antidepressant use. Key predictors of depressive symptom outcomes included systematic identification of patients, professional background of staff and specialist supervision.

AB  - Infant temperament is theorized to have a strong genetic basis. Yet, studies of the stability of temperament and molecular genetics research on temperament have revealed inconsistent findings. One reason may be because research has not taken into account the influence of early social experiences. We review research on aspects of infant emotionality presumed to be temperamental in origin, emotion reactivity and emotion regulation, and integrate research addressing parenting influences on physiology and genetics of infant emotionality with traditional research on behavioral expression of emotionality. Empirical research supports the theory that sensitive and appropriately responsive parenting in infancy is related to more optimal patterns of behavioral and physiological reactivity and regulation. Molecular genetics research with both animal and human populations has produced consistent results when environmental experiences are taken into account. Findings suggest that the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene and the long allele of the DRD4 dopamine receptor gene may be related to distinct patterns of infant emotionality and to later problems with depression, impulse control problems, and externalizing/ antisocial behaviors, primarily when paired with insensitive parenting, abuse or neglect, or other adverse family environments. Future directions and limitations in the field are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Behavior, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging suggest that episodic memories are constructed from interactions among the following basic systems: vision, audition, olfaction, other senses, spatial imagery, language, emotion, narrative, motor output, explicit memory, and search and retrieval. Each system has its own well-documented functions, neural substrates, processes, structures, and kinds of schemata. However, the systems have not been considered as interacting components of episodic memory, as is proposed here. Autobiographical memory and oral traditions are used to demonstrate the usefulness of the basic-systems model in accounting for existing data and predicting novel findings, and to argue that the model, or one similar to it, is the only way to understand episodic memory for complex stimuli routinely encountered outside the laboratory.

   Method: An electronic search was performed by using Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Psyndex and the Cochrane library. The selection and examination of papers were performed by two reviewers independently.
   Results: Among the 42 papers included, important methodological aspects such as sampling methods or blinding of research workers often were not reported. For both GDS versions, similar validity indices were found (GDS-30: sensitivity 0.753, specificity 0.770; GDS-15: sensitivity 0.805, specificity 0.750). Using comparative studies based on the identical samples, both GDS versions showed significantly better validity indices than the 'Yale-1-question' screen, but were similar to the 'Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale' (CES-D).
   Conclusion: The GDS does not show a better criterion validity than the CES-D, but methodological limitations of primary studies hamper the generalizability of pooled analyses.

AB  - This article offers an overview of prominent general trends in the field of psychotherapy research. We consider 3 areas of the literature: metaanalytic reviews addressing the effectiveness of, psychotherapy, the movement to identify empirically supported treatments (EST), and research on the "common factor" or "contextual" models of psychotherapy. We present narrative reviews of selected literature associated with each area. The reviews highlight several issues currently confronting the field. Metaanalytic reviews underscore 2 conclusions: psychotherapy is superior to the absence of treatment, and different approaches to psychotherapy yield equivalent effects. In counterpoint to these findings, the EST movement emphasizes the empirical demonstration that specific psychotherapies have efficacy for specific disorders. Misinterpretation of EST findings has led to considerable controversy. Although EST research can identify causal effects of therapy, it has less capacity to explain how these effects come about. We suggest an appropriate perspective on EST findings. Considerable evidence supports the importance of common factors as mechanisms of change; at present, however, this evidence is predominantly correlational. We conclude that a blending of EST studies and research on the common factors represents the greatest potential for advancing the field. Studies to identify specific ESTs are key to validating the efficacy of psychotherapy approaches and need to be undertaken with the psychodynamic and experiential therapies. Greater emphasis on common factors in research, training, and practice can advance understanding about change processes in efficacious therapies, facilitate the development of sensitive clinicians, and increase the effectiveness of mental health services.

AB  - Protocols for bioassessment often relate changes in summary metrics that describe aspects of biotic assemblage structure and function to environmental stress. Biotic assessment using multimetric indices now forms the basis for setting regulatory standards for stream quality and a range of other goals related to water resource management in the USA and elsewhere. Biotic metrics are typically interpreted with reference to the expected natural state to evaluate whether a site is degraded. It is critical that natural variation in biotic metrics along environmental gradients is adequately accounted for, in order to quantify human disturbance-induced change. A common approach used in the IBI is to examine scatter plots of variation in a given metric along a single stream size surrogate and a fit a line (drawn by eye) to form the upper bound, and hence define the maximum likely value of a given metric in a site of a given environmental characteristic (termed the 'maximum species richness line' - MSRL). In this paper we examine whether the use of a single environmental descriptor and the MSRL is appropriate for defining the reference condition for a biotic metric (fish species richness) and for detecting human disturbance gradients in rivers of south-eastern Queensland, Australia. We compare the accuracy and precision of the MSRL approach based on single environmental predictors, with three regression-based prediction methods (Simple Linear Regression, Generalised Linear Modelling and Regression Tree modelling) that use (either singly or in combination) a set of landscape and local scale environmental variables as predictors of species richness. We compared the frequency of classification errors from each method against set biocriteria and contrast the ability of each method to accurately reflect human disturbance gradients at a large set of test sites. The results of this study suggest that the MSRL based upon variation in a single environmental descriptor could not accurately predict species richness at minimally disturbed sites when compared with SLR's based on equivalent environmental variables. Regression-based modelling incorporating multiple environmental variables as predictors more accurately explained natural variation in species richness than did simple models using single environmental predictors. Prediction error arising from the MSRL was substantially higher than for the regression methods and led to an increased frequency of Type I errors (incorrectly classing a site as disturbed). We suggest that problems with the MSRL arise from the inherent scoring procedure used and that it is limited to predicting variation in the dependent variable along a single environmental gradient.

AB  - Trust, choice and empowerment of patients are emerging as important issues in mental health care. This may be due to an increasingly consumerist attitude amongst patients and as a consequence of postmodern cultural changes in society. This study aimed to find evidence for the influence of trust, patient choice and patient empowerment in mental health care. A literature review was undertaken. Six searches of PubMed were made using the key terms trust, patient choice and power combined separately with psychiatry and mental health. The literature search found substantial research evidence in the areas of trust, choice and power including validated scales measuring these concepts and evidence that they are important to patients. Trust in general health clinicians was found to be high and continuity of care increases patients' trust in their clinician. However, only qualitative research has been found on trust in mental health settings and further quantitative studies are needed. Patient choice is important to patients and improves engagement with services, although studies on outcome show varying results. Empowerment has impacted more at an organisational level than on individual care. Innovative research methodologies are needed to expand on the present significant body of research, utilising qualitative and quantitative techniques.

AB  - The last few decades have seen a rapid change in our understanding of the epidemiology of bipolar disorder, which has only recently started to achieve major research attention. This article reviews recent developments. In addition to electronic searches using MEDLINE and PsycLIT, references from articles were identified, major journals hand searched, and major textbooks of psychiatry and epidemiology reviewed. Studies may have overestimated the prevalence of mania, and underestimated incidence. The incidence of mania may be increasing in recent generations, but the data remain inconclusive. Age at onset of mania is earlier than previously believed, and there are gender differences in epidemiology and clinical course. Ethnic differences in epidemiology and clinical course of bipolar disorder are highlighted. Comorbid alcohol and substance abuse are common in patients suffering from bipolar disorder and are associated with a more severe clinical course and a worse outcome. Urban living and lower socioeconomic and single marital status may be risk factors for developing bipolar disorder.

AB  - Negative symptoms generally refer to a reduction in normal functioning. In schizophrenia they encompass apathy, anhedonia, flat affect, avolition, social withdrawal and, on some accounts, psychomotor retardation. Negative symptoms have been identified in other psychiatric disorders, including melancholic depression, and also in neurological disorders, such Parkinson's disease. Achieving a better understanding of negative symptoms constitutes a priority in mental health. Primarily, negative symptoms represent an unrelenting, intractable and disabling feature for patients, often amounting to a severe burden on families, carers and the patients themselves. Identifying and understanding subgroups within disorders may also contribute to the clinical care and scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders. The purpose of this paper is to review the current literature on negative symptoms in schizophrenia and explore the idea that negative symptoms may play an important role not only in other psychiatric disorders such as melancholic depression, but also in neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. In each disorder negative symptoms manifest with similar motor and cognitive impairments and are associated with comparable neuropathological and biochemical findings, possibly reflecting analogous impairments in the functioning of frontostriatal-limbic circuits.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that high levels of burnout lead to impaired functioning on the job. However, as this research has usually relied on self-reported performance, it is imperative to examine whether this association is also confirmed when using "objective" performance data (e.g., supervisor reports). This study reviewed previous research on the associations between burnout (exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment) and various types of objective performance. A systematic literature search identified 16 studies dealing with the burnout-performance relationship. These studies showed the wide variety of approaches that are used to study burnout and objective performance. Using data from these 16 studies, a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain mean correlations. The meta-analytical correlations between exhaustion and in-role behaviour (based on five studies), organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB; five studies), and customer satisfaction (two studies) were -.22, -.19, and -.55, respectively, underlining the practical relevance of burnout research for organizational performance. The evidence for the relationships between depersonalization, personal accomplishment, and performance was inconclusive. Future research should focus on valid indicators of job performance, should more often employ longitudinal designs and large samples, and should consider the theoretical basis for the study expectations more extensively.

AB  - The definition and assessment of adherence vary considerably across studies. Increasing consensus regarding these issues is necessary to improve our understanding of adherence and the development of more effective treatments. We review the adherence literature over the past 3 decades to explore the definitions and assessment of adherence to oral antipsychotics in schizophrenia patients. A total of 161 articles were identified through MEDLINE and PsycINFO searches. The most common method used to assess adherence was the report of the patient. Subjective and indirect methods including self-report, provider report, significant other report, and chart review were the only methods used to assess adherence in over 77% (124/161) of studies reviewed. Direct or objective measures including pill count, blood or urine analysis, electronic monitoring, and electronic refill records were used in less than 23% (37/161) of studies. Even in studies utilizing the same methodology to assess adherence, definitions of an adherent subject varied broadly from agreeing to take any medication to taking at least 90% of medication as prescribed. We make suggestions for consensus development, including the use of recommended terminology for different subject samples, the increased use of objective or direct measures, and the inclusion in all studies of an estimate of the percentage of medication taken as prescribed in an effort to increase comparability among studies. The suggestions are designed to advance the field with respect to both understanding predictors of adherence and developing interventions to improve adherence to oral antipsychotic medications.

AB  - How important is endocrine disruption as a threat to wildlife populations? This review applies causal criteria to existing studies of wild populations of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals to answer three questions: (1) Have endocrine-mediated effects of contaminant exposure been documented? (2) Have individual adverse effects that could lead to population effects been documented? (3) Have population level effects been documented? In fish, the possibility of population level effects is inferred from impaired individual fertility. Substantial evidence directly links fertility impairment to endocrine disruption. In amphibians, population declines are occurring worldwide and causes may vary among regions, with contaminant-induced sexual disruption being one of many insults that stymie population growth. In reptiles, local populations of alligators have been dramatically reduced by direct toxicity and recovery has probably been slowed by sexual disruption, particularly feminization induced by chronic contaminant exposure. In contrast, heavily contaminated snapping turtles display feminized secondary sex characteristics, evidence of disrupted sexual development, but populations are densest at the most heavily contaminated site. In birds, population decline and recovery have been directly linked to p,p'-DDE-mediated eggshell thinning and subsequent banning of the parent compound DDT in the US and Europe. Regional populations of predatory birds still suffer chick mortality related to PCB and DDT burdens, but no causal link with endocrine-mediated processes has been demonstrated. In mammals, contaminant-induced hormonal derangements in seals and polar bears have been documented, but no clear evidence links endocrine effects to population declines. Although endocrine disruption will rarely be the sole cause of failing recruitment or decreased abundance, it may subtly sabotage sexual development, sex ratio, and metabolic compensation for environmental stress. Endocrine disruption is unlikely to extirpate a species over its entire range, but in combination with other stressors such as habitat loss, over-harvesting, and global climate change, may contribute to local extinctions.

AB  - Objective: The presence of painful physical symptoms may confound the diagnosis of major depressive disorder and may worsen patient prognosis. Epidemiological literature was reviewed to investigate the association between depression and painful physical symptoms.
   Method: MEDLINE and EMBASE database searches were conducted. Studies where a definable organic basis for pain was given were excluded. The search was unrestricted by language but limited to European studies and countries. After filters were applied, 70 eligible studies were reviewed.
   Results: The majority of studies reviewed showed an association between depression and painful physical symptoms. Over 40% of all studies examining the association between pain and depression were carried out in pain clinics in secondary care. Very few studies were conducted in psychiatric settings.
   Conclusion: The findings of this review suggest that painful physical symptoms may be an important part of the depressive syndrome. Although the relationship between depression and painful physical symptoms is not yet fully understood, findings suggest that diagnosis and treatment of depression should involve investigating and treating the full spectrum of symptoms (emotional and physical). Further research in psychiatric and generalist settings is needed to elucidate the relationship between depression and painful physical symptoms as experienced by patients and at the clinical level.

AB  - Mitochondria play a critical role in several metabolic processes and apoptotic pathways, regulating life cycle from the cradle to the grave. Despite the evidence of morphological, biochemical and molecular abnormalities in mitochondria in various tissues of patients with neurodegenerative disorders, the question "is mitochondrial dysfunction a necessary step in neurodegeneration?" is still unanswered. Moreover, a growing body of evidence seems to indicate that oxidative stress, which is increased in damaged mitochondria, is an earlier event associated with neurodegeneration. Here we examine the current evidences in this field, which indicate a key role of mitochondria and oxidative stress in contributing to the neurodegenerative processes.

KW  - MACARTHUR ADJUDICATIVE COMPETENCE
KW  - LEGAL COMPETENCE
KW  - TRIAL
KW  - BRAIN
KW  - LAW
AB  - Adjudicative competence, more commonly referred to as competence to stand trial, is a highly under-theorized area of law. Though it is well established that, to be competent, a criminal defendant must have a "rational" as well as ''factual" understanding of her situation, the meaning of such "rational understanding" has gone largely undefined. Given the large number of criminal prosecutions in which competence is at issue, the doctrine's instability stands in stark contrast to its importance.
   This Article argues that adjudicative competence, properly understood, asks whether a criminal defendant has capacity to participate meaningfully in the host of decisions potentially required of her. Further, sound assessment of such capacity requires attention to both the cognitive and emotional influences on rational decision-making in situations of personal relevance and risk. The role of emotion has been neglected, both in traditional accounts of decision-making and in assessments of adjudicative competence, and merits particular attention. This Article explores two examples of potentially competence-threatening emotional dysfunction-severe psychiatric mood disorder and organic brain damage-either of which may interfere unreasonably with decision-relevant emotional perception, processing, and expression. Existing legal theory and forensic testing methods, which reflect a predominantly cognitive approach, do not account adequately for such dysfunction. Shifting the adjudicative competence inquiry away from a general search for "rationality" and toward a more finely grained examination of the cognitive and emotional influences on rational decision-making processes offers our best hope for giving meaning to "rational understanding.".

AB  - Objective: Up to 40% of patients with schizophrenic psychosis suffer from symptoms that are resistant to monotherapy with antipsychotic drugs. As a consequence, combined approaches are often used, especially based on clozapine and olanzapine. This review aims to provide a critical overview on olanzapine-augmentations. Methods: A systematic database search including generic and trade names of antipsychotic substances as well as general items such as,augmentation" and,combination" was performed in Medline and BIOSIS (OVID) until May 2005. Results: Amongst a number of 16 reports dealing with 9 different antipsychotic augmentation strategies (85 patients) only sulpiride was tested in a randomized manner. A significant part of the treatments achieved favourable results. In contrast, augmentations of olanzapine with antidepressants or mood stabilizers were evaluated in well-designed clinical trials (9 strategies, 10 publications, 837 patients). Improvements of positive and/or negative symptoms as well as depressed mood were reported. Conclusions: The empirical basis to combine olanzapine with antipsychotic substances has to be improved in order to evaluate benefits and risks. Augmentations with mood stabilizers were successful, for example on hostility, showing that randomized and placebo-controlled trials are feasible.

AB  - Objective: The need to evaluate decisional capacity among patients in treatment settings as well as subjects in clinical research settings has increasingly gained attention. Decisional capacity is generally conceptualized to include not only an understanding of disclosed information but also an appreciation of its significance, the ability to use the information in reasoning, and the ability to express a clear choice. The authors critically reviewed existing measures of decisional capacity for research and treatment.
   Method: Electronic medical and legal databases were searched for articles published from 1980 to 2004 describing structured assessments of adults' capacity to consent to clinical treatment or research protocols. The authors identified 23 decisional capacity assessment instruments and evaluated each in terms of format, content, administration features, and psychometric properties.
   Results: Six instruments focused solely on understanding of disclosed information, and 11 tested for understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expression of a choice. The instruments varied substantially in format, degree of standardization of disclosures, flexibility of item content, and scoring procedures. Reliability and validity also varied widely. All instruments have limitations, ranging from lack of supporting psychometric data to lack of generalizability across contexts.
   Conclusions: Of the instruments reviewed, the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tools for Clinical Research and for Treatment have the most empirical support, although other instruments may be equally or better suited to certain situations. Contextual factors are important but understudied. Capacity assessment tools should undergo further empirically based development and refinement as well as testing with a variety of populations.

AB  - This review aims to summarize and critically evaluate the evidence for recent advances and alternative approaches in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) technique. Novel developments in ECT research are also mentioned. An EMBASE literature search was undertaken of clinical trials, case reports and research updates on novel and alternative approaches in ECT practice and research, including alternative electrode placements, variations in stimulus configuration, and novel developments (magnetic seizure therapy, focal electrical stimulation). The evidence for these approaches is reviewed, and implications for the optimizing of ECT in clinical practice are discussed. Evidence from studies suggests that unilateral ECT be given at substantially suprathreshold doses (at least 6 times seizure threshold) for maximizing efficacy, while bilateral ECT is likely to be effective at doses of 1.5-2.5 times seizure threshold. There is some evidence to support the use of bifrontal ECT, although further research is required to establish its efficacy and side-effects relative to standard unilateral and bilateral electrode placements. Other alternative electrode placements have been minimally studied. More advantageous efficacy side-effect outcomes may be achieved by reducing the pulse width and/or frequency of the ECT stimulus. Lastly, novel developments using alternative means of seizure induction (magnetic fields, focal electrical stimulation) may hold promise for the future. Clinical practice should be guided by a careful appraisal of the available evidence for alternative approaches in ECT technique.

AB  - This paper reviews 138 empirical quantitative population-based studies of self-reported racism and health. These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism. Ensuring the quality of studies in this field will allow future research to reveal the complex role that racism plays as a determinant of population health.

AB  - Turtles are a small taxon that has nevertheless attracted much attention from biologists for centuries. However, a major portion of their life cycle has received relatively little attention until recently - namely what turtles are doing, and how they are doing it, during the winter. In the northern parts of their ranges in North America, turtles may spend more than half of their lives in an overwintering state. In this review, I emphasise the ecological aspects of overwintering among turtles, and consider how overwintering stresses affect the physiology, behaviour, distributions, and life histories of various species.
   Sea turtles are the only group of turtles that migrate extensively, and can therefore avoid northern winters. Nevertheless, each year a number of turtles, largely juveniles, are killed when trapped by cold fronts before they move to safer waters. Evidently this risk is an acceptable trade-off for the benefits to a population of inhabiting northern developmental habitats during the summer.
   Terrestrial turtles pass the winter underground, either in burrows that they excavate or that are preformed. These refugia must provide protection against desiccation and lethal freezing levels. Some burrows Are extensive (tortoise genus Gopherus), while others are shallow, or the turtles may simply dig into the ground to a safe depth (turtle genus Terrapene). In the latter genus, freeze tolerance may play an adaptive role.
   Most non-marine aquatic turtles overwinter underwater, although Clemmys (Actiuemys) mannorata routinely overwinters on land when it occurs in riverine habitats, Kinosternon subrubrum often overwinters on land, and several others may overwinter terrestrially on occasion, especially in more southern climates. For northern species that over-winter underwater, there are two physiological groupings, those that are anoxia-tolerant and those that are relatively anoxia-intolerant. All species fare well physiologically in water with a high partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), A lack of anoxia tolerance limits the types of habitats that a freshwater turtle may live in, since unlik-e sea turtles, they cannot travel long distances to hibernate.
   Hatchlings of some species of turtles spend their first winter in or below the nest cavity, while hatchlings of other species in the same area, including northern areas, emerge in the autumn and presumably hibernate underwater. All hatchlings are relatively anoxia-1 n tolerant, and there are no studies to date of where hatchling turtles that do not overwinter in or below the nest cavity spend their first winter. Equally little is known of the ontogeny of anoxia tolerance, other than that adults of all species are more anoxia-tolerant than their hatchlings, probably because of their better ossified shells, which provide adults with more buffer reserves and a larger site in which to sequester lactate. The northern limits of turtles are most likely determined by reproductive limitations (time for egg-laying, incubation, and hatching) than by the rigors of hibernation., pi I Mortality is ty *cally lower in turtle populations during hibernation than it is during their active periods. However, episodic mortality events do occur during hibernation, due to freezing, prolonged anoxia, or predation.

AB  - The neural circuitry that mediates mood under normal and abnormal conditions remains incompletely understood. Most attention in the field has focused on hippocampal and frontal cortical regions for their role in depression and antidepressant action. While these regions no doubt play important roles in these phenomena, there is compelling evidence that other brain regions are also involved. Here we focus on the potential role of the nucleus accumbens (NAc; ventral striatum) and its dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which form the mesolimbic dopamine system, in depression. The mesolimbic dopamine system is most often associated with the rewarding effects of food, sex, and drugs of abuse. Given the prominence of anhedonia, reduced motivation, and decreased energy level in most individuals with depression, we propose that the NAc and VTA contribute importantly to the pathophysiology and symptomatology of depression and may even be involved in its etiology. We review recent studies showing that manipulations of key proteins (e.g. CREB, dynorphin, BDNF, MCH, or Clock) within the VTA-NAc circuit of rodents produce unique behavioral phenotypes, some of which are directly relevant to depression. Studies of these and other proteins in the mesolimbic dopamine system have established novel approaches to modeling key symptoms of depression in animals, and could enable the development of antidepressant medications with fundamentally new mechanisms of action.

   Method: Relevant published studies are detailed and considered.
   Results: Several epidemiological studies suggest covariation between seafood consumption and rates of mood disorders. Biological marker studies indicate deficits in omega-3 fatty acids in people with depressive disorders, while several treatment studies indicate therapeutic benefits from omega-3 supplementation. A similar contribution of omega-3 fatty acids to coronary artery disease may explain the well-described links between coronary artery disease and depression.
   Conclusions: Deficits in omega-3 fatty acids have been identified as a contributing factor to mood disorders and offer a potential rational treatment approach. This review identifies a number of hypotheses and studies for consideration. In particular, the authors argue for studies clarifying the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation for unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders, both as individual and augmentation treatment strategies, and for studies pursuing which omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is likely to provide the greatest benefit.

AB  - Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can measure striatal dopamine (DA) terminal function in vivo as reflected by DA storage capacity and transporter binding. In Parkinson's disease (PD) posterior dorsal putamen DA terminals are initially targeted, the anterior putamen and head of caudate subsequently becoming affected. In contrast, dopaminergic function in pallidal, amygdala, and cingulate regions is upregulated in early PD and only later becomes reduced. Rigidity and bradykinesia in PD have been shown to correlate with loss of putamen dopaminergic function, whereas performance on executive and working memory tasks correlates with integrity of caudate dopaminergic terminals. C-11-RT132 PET, a marker of noradrenergic and dopaminergic transporter binding, can be used to assess noradrenergic along with dopaminergic terminal function. Serotonergic transporter binding can be assessed with C-11-DASB PET and I-123-beta CIT SPECT, whereas HT1A binding can be measured with C-11-WAY100635 PET. With these modalities, the relationship between mood, noradrenergic and serotonergic function can be examined in PD. The functional effects of focal DA replacement on DA storage capacity and patterns of brain activation via implantation of fetal midbrain cells or glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) infusion into putamen of PD patients has been examined with PET. Both approaches lead to consistently increased levels of putamen F-18-dopa uptake, and cell implantation can restore levels of frontal activation. Clinical outcome, however, has proved to be variable and off-medication dyskinesia are an unwanted side effect in transplanted cases. Dopamine release after pharmacological challenges or during behavioral tasks can be assessed indirectly by studying changes in receptor availability to PET radioligands. Stereotypical sequential movements are associated with striatal DA release, and this increases with more complex behaviors and the presence of financial incentives, which also increase frontal DA levels. Parkinson patients release less putamen DA than healthy control subjects during stereotyped finger movements. Interestingly, those PD patients who develop a dopa dependency syndrome, craving their medication, generate significantly greater levels of ventral striatal DA compared with similarly disabled patients without such a psychological dependency. In the future, functional imaging is likely to throw light on the roles of peptide transmission in regulating mood and behavior as non-peptide analogue ligands become available. Novel markers of amyloid plaque load will also help clarify the etiology of dementia in PD.

AB  - Most drugs are prescribed for several illnesses, but it took several years for psychotropic drugs to have multiple clinical indications. Our search for serotonergic drugs in affective illnesses and related disorders led to new off-label indications for fluoxetine, sertraline, tryptophan, clonazepam, alprazolam, tomoxetine, buproprion, duloxetine, risperidone and gabapentin. Various clinical trial designs were used for these proof-of-concept studies. Novel therapeutic uses of benzodiazepines, such as in panic disorder and mania, were found with the introduction of 2 high-potency benzodiazepines, clonazepam and alprazolam, which were thought to have serotonergic properties. Our initial clinical trials of fluoxetine and sertraline led to their approved indications in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and our trials of gabapentin led to new indications in anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety, panic attack and social phobia) and sleep disorders (insomnia).

   Method: The databases MEDLINE and Psychinfo were searched and relevant literature from 1993 onwards was reviewed.
   Results: The prevalence of major depression ranges from 0.9% to 9.4% in private households, from 14% to 42% in institutional living, and from 1% to 16% among elderly living in private households or in institutions; and clinically relevant depressive symptom 'cases' in similar settings vary between 7.2% and 49%. The main predictors of depressive disorders and depressive symptom cases are: female gender, somatic illness, cognitive impairment, functional impairment, lack or loss of close social contacts, and a history of depression.
   Conclusion: Depression is frequent in populations of elderly. Methodological differences between the studies hinder consistent conclusions about geographical and cross-cultural variations in prevalence and predictors of depression. Improved comparability will provide a basis for consistent conclusions.

AB  - Studies of the biology of music (as of language) are highly interdisciplinary and demand the integration of diverse strands of evidence. In this paper, I present a comparative perspective on the biology and evolution of music, stressing the value of comparisons both with human language, and with those animal communication systems traditionally termed "song". A comparison of the "design features" of music with those of language reveals substantial overlap, along with some important differences. Most of these differences appear to stem from semantic, rather than structural, factors, suggesting a shared formal core of music and language. I next review various animal communication systems that appear related to human music, either by analogy (bird and whale "song") or potential homology (great ape bimanual drumming). A crucial comparative distinction is between learned, complex signals (like language, music and birdsong) and unlearned signals (like laughter, ape calls, or bird calls). While human vocalizations clearly build upon an acoustic and emotional foundation shared with other primates and mammals, vocal learning has evolved independently in our species since our divergence with chimpanzees. The convergent evolution of vocal learning in other species offers a powerful window into psychological and neural constraints influencing the evolution of complex signaling systems (including both song and speech), while ape drumming presents a fascinating potential homology with human instrumental music. I next discuss the archeological data relevant to music evolution, concluding on the basis of prehistoric bone flutes that instrumental music is at least 40,000 years old, and perhaps much older. I end with a brief review of adaptive functions proposed for music, concluding that no one selective force (e.g., sexual selection) is adequate to explaining all aspects of human music. I suggest that questions about the past function of music are unlikely to be answered definitively and are thus a poor choice as a research focus for biomusicology. In contrast, a comparative approach to music promises rich dividends for our future understanding of the biology and evolution of music. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We address the question why fear dominates hope in the life of individuals and collectives on the basis of the accumulated knowledge in the psychology, neurology and sociology of emotions. This knowledge suggests that fear, as primary emotion, is grounded in the experienced present and based on the memorized past, processed both consciously and unconsciously, causes freezing and conservatism, and sometimes leads to pre-emptive aggression. Hope, in contrast, as a secondary emotion, involves cognitive activity, which requires anticipation and the search for new ideas and thus is based on complex processes of creativity and flexibility. Therefore, hope is often preceded and inhibited by spontaneous, automatically activated and faster fear Fear and hope can each become a collective emotional orientation, and as such organize society's views and direct its actions. Societies involved in intractable conflict are dominated by a collective fear orientation. This orientation is functional for society's coping with the stressful and demanding situation-but it may serve as a psychological obstacle to any peace process, once it starts. The case of the collective fear orientation in the Jewish Israeli society is presented as an example. The article ends with a presentation of a particular approach, suggesting that individuals and collectives can overcome their fear with much determination, and establish an orientation of hope which allows change in situations dominated by fear Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: An area of recent interest in psychiatric research is the application of neuroimaging techniques to investigate neural events associated with the development and the treatment of symptoms in a number of psychiatric disorders.
   Objective: To examine whether psychological therapies modulate brain activity and, if so, to examine whether these changes similar to those found with relevant pharmacotherapy in various mental disorders.
   Methods: Relevant data were identified from Pubmed and Psyclnfo searches up to July 2005 using combinations of keywords including 'psychological therapy', 'behaviour therapy', 'depression', 'panic disorder', 'phobia', 'obsessive compulsive disorder', 'schizophrenia', 'psychosis', 'brain activity', 'brain metabolism', 'PET', 'SPECT' and 'fMRI'.
   Results: There was ample evidence to demonstrate that psychological therapies produce changes at the neural level. The data, for example in depression, panic disorder, phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), clearly suggested that a change in patients' symptoms and maladaptive behaviour at the mind level with psychological techniques is accompanied with functional brain changes in relevant brain circuits. In many studies, cognitive therapies and drug therapies achieved therapeutic gains through the same neural pathways although the two forms of treatment may still have different mechanisms of action.
   Conclusions: Empirical research indicates a close association between the 'mind' and the 'brain' in showing that changes made at the mind level in a psychotherapeutic context produce changes at the brain level. The investigation of changes in neural activity with psychological therapies is a novel area which is likely to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms for therapeutic changes across a range of disorders.

AB  - Standard economic theories conceive homo economicus as a rational decision maker capable of maximizing utility. In reality, however, people tend to approximate optimal decision-making strategies through a collection of heuristic routines. Some of these routines are driven by emotional processes, and others are adjusted iteratively through experience. In addition, routines specialized for social decision making, such as inference about the mental states of other decision makers, might share their origins and neural mechanisms with the ability to simulate or imagine outcomes expected from alternative actions that an individual can take. A recent surge of collaborations across economics, psychology and neuroscience has provided new insights into how such multiple elements of decision making interact in the brain.

AB  - Objective: To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of androgen treatment of depressive symptoms in older men.
   Method: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Eric, HealthStar, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for potentially relevant articles. The bibliographies of relevant articles were searched for additional references and experts were consulted. Seventeen reports (8 open and 12 randomized trials; 3 articles reported studies of 2 designs) met the following inclusion criteria: original investigation; published in English or French, use of acknowledged criteria or scale for depression, and open or randomized trial of androgen treatment. Four criteria assessed study validity: randomization, double blinding, comparability of treatment and control groups at baseline, and description of dropouts. We abstracted, tabulated, and compared information from each article.
   Results: Most studies had methodological limitations. With regard to feasibility, there were few reported withdrawals due to adverse events. With regard to effectiveness, 6 of 8 open trials had positive results, and 5 of 12 randomized trials had positive results, although 1 was equivocal. However, testosterone was combined with antidepressant medication in 3 of these positive randomized trials. Only 2 open trials enrolled subjects whose mean age was 60 years or over. One had positive results, and the other had negative results.
   Conclusion: Androgen therapy may be feasible in the short term, but there is little evidence that it is an effective treatment for depressive symptoms in older men.

All studies on cesarean section that evaluated maternal mood between 10 days and 1 year after delivery were reviewed. Nine methodologically superior studies, including the only randomized, controlled trial (RCT), were analyzed separately. The nine studies that provided adequate summary statistics were combined in a meta-analysis. Results: Of the 24 studies that have examined the association between cesarean section and postpartum depression, five found a significant adverse association, 15 found no significant association, and four found mixed results. With only one exception, methodologically superior studies found either no significant association or mixed evidence for an association between cesarean section and postpartum depression. Meta-analyses of suitable studies failed to find evidence for a significant association between cesarean section and postpartum depression. Possible reasons why different studies have obtained different results are critically evaluated. Conclusion: A link between cesarean section and postpartum depression has not been established.

   Method: Literature review based on Medline search and hand search of relevant literature.
   Results: Pharmacological treatment of the early phase of bipolar disorders lacks specific guidelines. Mood stabilizers are often prescribed after many years of illness, antipsychotic medications are frequently prescribed and often for extensive periods of time, and adherence to medication is relatively poor. In addition, mania is frequently misdiagnosed, and there is limited knowledge on which to base identification of bipolar depression and identification of the initial prodrome to bipolar disorders.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need for more research in the early phases of bipolar disorders to develop means to identify patients earlier and to develop approaches that would address the specific needs of this population in a more adequate manner.

AB  - Although the field of pharmacogenetics has existed for nearly 50 years, it has begun to enter mainstream clinical practice only recently. Researchers and clinicians have now demonstrated that a wide assortment of genetic variants influence how individuals respond to medications. Many of these variants are relevant for psychiatry, affecting how patients respond to most antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers. Enthusiasts hope that pharmacogenetics will soon usher in a new era of individualized medicine. However, determining the practical relevance of pharmacogenetic variants remains difficult, in part because of problems with study design and replication, and in part because a host of nongenetic factors (including age, diet, environmental exposures, and comorbid diseases) also influence how individuals respond to medications. Since individualized pharmacogenetic assessment remains difficult, some researchers have argued that race provides a convenient proxy for individual genetic variation, and that clinicians should choose medications and doses differently for different races. This approach remains extremely controversial because of the complexity of the genetic structure of the human population, the complexity of gene-environment interactions, and the complexity of the meanings of race in the United States.

AB  - Quietly, at least beyond the awareness of many psychologists, a relatively new technology based on school-wide behavior management strategies has emerged in special education to answer the call to build healthy communities. The success of these strategies in changing the practices of school systems and creating positive school climates may offer insights for school psychologists interested in preventing mental disorders and promoting health on a broader scale. Spreading the influence of school-wid, behavior supports to ensure that all schools provide the nurturing environment needed to promote academic and life success for all children is an important and immediate goal. Beyond the school, the challenge will be to implement and evaluate the impact of positive behavior supports in other connected communities. The present article reviews the history and present state of school-wide behavior supports and prevention research, limitations of current practice, and opportunities for integrating school-wide programs with psychological science and practice.

AB  - Shortly after John Eccles completed his studies of synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord, for which he was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology/medicine, he opened another chapter of neuroscience with his work on the cerebellum. From 1963 to 1967, Eccles and his colleagues in Canberra successfully dissected the complex neuronal circuitry in the cerebellar cortex. In the 1967 monograph, "The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine", he, in collaboration with Masao Ito and Janos Szentdgothai, presented blue-print-like wiring diagrams of the cerebellar neuronal circuitry. These stimulated worldwide discussions and experimentation on the potential operational mechanisms of the circuitry and spurred theoreticians to develop relevant network models of the machinelike function of the cerebellum. In following decades, the neuronal machine concept of the cerebellum was strengthened by additional knowledge of the modular organization of its structure and memory mechanism, the latter in the form of synaptic plasticity, in particular, long-term depression. Moreover, several types of motor control were established as model systems representing learning mechanisms of the cerebellum. More recently, both the quantitative preciseness of cerebellar analyses and overall knowledge about the cerebellum have advanced considerably at the cellular and molecular levels of analysis. Cerebellar circuitry now includes Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells as additional unique elements. Other new revelations include the operation of the complex glomerulus structure, intricate signal transduction for synaptic plasticity, silent synapses, irregularity of spike discharges, temporal fidelity of synaptic activation, rhythm generators, a Golgi cell clock circuit, and sensory or motor representation by mossy fibers and climbing fibers. Furthermore, it has become evident that the cerebellum has cognitive functions, and probably also emotion, as well as better-known motor and autonomic functions. Further cerebellar research is required for full understanding of the cerebellum as a broad learning machine for neural control of these functions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sir John Eccles' experimental life evolved from the "bottom" up: the synapse to the modular circuitry of the spinal cord, later the cerebellum and, less extensively, also the thalamus and hippocampus. He experimented quantitatively on basic properties of cell membranes, synapses, transmitters, cellular modules, reflexes, and plasticity. In parallel, he was also motivated to consider philosophical problems of mind-brain interactions. It was mostly during Eccles' "Swiss period" (1976-1997) that new experimental work advanced understanding of intentional motor actions and their preparation. For example, early brain imaging work suggested that the so-called "supplementary" motor area was rather a "supramotor" area, concerned with intentional preparation to move. Eccles also closely followed work on cortico-cerebellar integration and learning. His final contribution, in collaboration with the quantum physicist, Friedrich Beck, was a model of how specific neuronal modules interact with the mind. Being a declared dualist, Eccles encountered considerable resistance and skepticism among neuroscientists in accepting his experimentally untestable mind-brain theories. But one can only admire the remarkable continuity of effort in his search for modular operations of identified neurons in the central nervous system and their synaptic actions. This effort was facilitated by collaboration with the eminent anatomist, Janos Szentagothai, who had previously helped Eccles advance understanding of spinal and cerebellar circuitry. This review also includes some personal views on current understanding of the forebrain, with an emphasis on the multiplicity of cortical modules, all of which contribute in the mental preparation for forthcoming intentional actions.

AB  - Many mammals spontaneously rear on their hind legs in response to novelty. The current paper is the first review of rearing behaviour, and is intended to collate findings from different perspectives that are not usually brought together. We suggest that rearing is a useful marker of environmental novelty, that the hippocampal formation is a crucial component of the system controlling rearing in novel environments, and that rearing is one of several ethological measures that can profitably be used to assess hippocampal learning and memory. Consideration is given to the following topics: the possible functions of rearing in information-gathering and escape behaviour; the modulation of rearing by various factors such as anxiety/fear emotionality; comparative perspectives on rearing; neuroanatomical circuits involved in rearing with particular reference to the hippocampal formation and its afferents and efferents; and the role of the hippocampal formation in uncharted and mismatch environmental novelty. The review concludes with testable predictions about rearing, environmental novelty and the hippocampus.

   Results Comorbid personality disorder with depression was associated with a doubling of the risk of a poor outcome for depression compared with no personality disorder (random effects model OR=2.18,95% CI 1.70-2.80), a robust finding maintained with only Hamilton-type depression criteria at outcome (OR=2.20,95% CI 1.61-3.01). All treatments apart from electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) showed this poor outcome, and the ECT group was small.

AB  - This chapter starts with some remarks on the conceptual history of catatonia, which begins with Kahlbaum and continues Kraeplin, Bleuler, and Leonhard. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th ed.,Text Revision, criteria for catatonia and the multicausal origin of the disorder are discussed. So, not only schizophrenia and mood disorders associated with catatonia, which is the primary form, are introduced but also an extensive list of somatic disorders-resulting in secondary catatonia-along with the work of Gelenberg and Wing. Next, two very difficult cases, of boys with autism, catatonia, and one of them with mental retardation as well, are presented. Major textbooks, PubMed, and Medline were used for a select literature search. The results show the main and really relevant but scarce data concerning primary and secondary catatonia. In the discussion the topics are this dearth in knowledge, the concept of catatonia and its similarities with delirium, and the relation catatonia-autism, and where to find the data. The conclusions summarize the main points and end with a gentle reminder, or is it an appeal?

AB  - It has been postulated that spatial working memory operates optimally within a limited range of dopamine transmission and D1 dopamine receptor signaling in prefrontal cortex. Insufficiency in prefrontal dopamine, as in aging, and excessive transmission, as in acute stress, lead to impairments in working memory that can be ameliorated by D1 receptor agonist and antagonist treatment, respectively. lontophoretic investigations of dopamine's influence on the cellular mechanisms of working memory have revealed that moderate D1 blockade can enhance memory fields in primate prefrontal pyramidal neurons while strong blockade abolishes them. The combined behavioral and physiological evidence indicates that there is a normal range of dopamine function in prefrontal cortex that can be described as an "inverted-U" relationship between dopamine transmission and the integrity of working memory. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated a role for dopamine in promoting the excitability of prefrontal pyramidal cells and facilitating their N-methyl-D-aspartate inputs, while simultaneously restraining recurrent excitation and facilitating feedforward inhibition. This evidence indicates that there is a fine balance between the synergistic mechanisms of D1 modulation in working memory. Given the critical role of prefrontal function for cognition, it is not surprising that this balancing act is perturbed by both subtle genetic influences and environmental events. Further, there is evidence for an imbalance in these dopaminergic mechanisms in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia, and in related non-human primate models. Elucidating the orchestration of dopamine signaling in key nodes within prefrontal microcircuitry is therefore pivotal for understanding the influence of dopamine transmission on the dynamics of working memory. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the window of optimal dopamine signaling changes on a behavioral time-scale, dependent upon current cognitive demands and local neuronal activity as well as long-term alterations in signaling pathways and gene expression. If we look under the bell-shaped curve of prefrontal dopamine function, it is the relationship between neuromodulation and cognitive function that promises to bridge our knowledge between molecule and mind.

AB  - Anthropogenic contaminants have been a concern in the Canadian arctic for over 30 years due to relatively high concentrations of bioaccumulating and biomagnifying organochlorine contaminants (OCs) and toxic metals found in some arctic biota and humans. However, few studies have addressed the potential effects of these contaminants in Canadian arctic wildlife. Prior to 1997, biological effects data were minimal and insufficient at any level of biological organization. The present review summarizes recent studies on biological effects related to contaminant exposure, and compares new tissue concentration data to threshold effects levels. Weak relationships between cadmium, mercury and selenium burdens and health biomarkers in common eider ducks (Somateria mollissima borealis) in Nunavut were found but it was concluded that metals were not influencing the health of these birds. Black guillemots (Cepplius grylle) examined near PCB-contaminated Saglek Bay, Labrador, had enlarged livers, elevated EROD and liver lipid levels and reduced retinol (vitamin A) and retinyl palmitate levels, which correlated to PCB levels in the birds. Circulating levels of thyroid hormones in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) were correlated to PCB and HO-PCB plasma concentrations, but the impact at the population level is unknown. High PCB and organochlorine pesticide concentrations were found to be strongly associated with impaired humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in polar bears, implying an increased infection risk that could impact the population. In beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), cytocbromes P450 (phase I) and conjugating (phase II) enzymes have been extensively profiled (immunochemically and catalytically) in liver, demonstrating the importance of contaminants in relation to enzyme induction, metabolism and potential contaminant bioactivation and fate. Concentrations of OCs and metals in arctic terrestrial wildlife, fish and seabirds are generally below effects thresholds, with the possible exception of PCBs in burbot (Lota lota) in some Yukon lakes, Greenland shark (Soniniosus microcephalus), glaucous and great black-backed gulls (Larus hyperboreus and L. marinus), and TEQs of dioxin-like chemicals in seabird eggs. PCB and DDT concentrations in several arctic marine mammal species exceed effects thresholds, although evidence of stress in these populations is lacking. There is little evidence that contaminants are having widespread effects on the health of Canadian arctic organisms, with the possible exception of polar bears. However, further research and better understanding of organolialogen exposure in arctic biota is needed considering factors such as tissue levels that exceed effects thresholds, exposure to "new" organolialogen contaminants of concern, contaminated regions, and climate change.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to review research on psychological characteristics in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and to summarize the findings of associations between psychological variables and various aspects of life, illness, and health in COPD patients. Methods: The following databases were searched: Medline, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. Results: A total of 81 studies, published between 1968 and 2004, was identified. The reviewed studies indicated that patients suffering from CORD have a high prevalence of psychological disorders and may function at a reduced level of efficiency due to neuropsychological impairments. Psychological characteristics also seemed to be associated with functional disability and reduced quality of life. Conclusion: Psychological characteristics are important variables that interact with physical symptoms, and they should be taken into account when treating COPD patients. More studies with rigorous methodological designs are needed to describe the role of psychological variables in COPD accurately and reliably. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid progress in understanding the molecular basis of neurodegeneration has been tightly linked with recent discoveries in the field of programmed cell death (PCD). Analysis of PCD in neuronal demise has led to identification of several associated phenomena, such as re-initiation of the cell cycle and the key role of oxidative stress, although putative causal relationships between these events are still debatable. These issues are reviewed here in the context of acute and chronic neurodegenerative processes. In addition, newly emerging concepts concerning cell-cycle re-initiation are discussed in terms of their potential impact on the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Objective: To review the research addressing the relationship of childhood trauma to psychosis and schizophrenia, and to discuss the theoretical and clinical implications.
   Method: Relevant studies and previous review papers were identified via computer literature searches.
   Results: Symptoms considered indicative of psychosis and schizophrenia, particularly hallucinations, are at least as strongly related to childhood abuse and neglect as many other mental health problems. Recent large-scale general population studies indicate the relationship is a causal one, with a dose-effect.
   Conclusion: Several psychological and biological mechanisms by which childhood trauma increases risk for psychosis merit attention. Integration of these different levels of analysis may stimulate a more genuinely integrated bio-psycho-social model of psychosis than currently prevails. Clinical implications include the need for staff training in asking about abuse and the need to offer appropriate psychosocial treatments to patients who have been abused or neglected as children. Prevention issues are also identified.

AB  - Objective: This paper reviews the findings from 26 international studies that report on the effectiveness of smoking bans in inpatient psychiatric settings. The main aim is to identify which processes contribute to successful implementation of smoking bans and which processes create problems for implementation in these settings.
   Method: After performing an electronic search of the literature, the studies were compared for methods used, subjects involved, type of setting, type of ban, measures and processes used and overall results. Total bans were distinguished from partial bans. All known studies of smoking bans in psychiatric inpatient units from 1988 to the present were included.
   Results: Staff generally anticipated more smoking-related problems than actually occurred. There was no increase in aggression, use of seclusion, discharge against medical advice or increased use of as-needed medication following the ban. Consistency, coordination and full administrative support for the ban were seen as essential to success, with problems occurring where this was not the case. Nicotine replacement therapy was widely used by patients as part of coping with bans. However, many patients continued to smoke post-admission indicating that bans were not necessarily effective in assisting people to quit in the longer term.
   Conclusions: The introduction of smoking bans in psychiatric inpatient settings is possible but would need to be a clearly and carefully planned process involving all parties affected by the bans. Imposing bans in inpatient settings is seen as only part of a much larger strategy needed to overcome the high rates of smoking among mental health populations.

AB  - A systematic review of all available treatment studies for music performance anxiety was undertaken. Interventions were categorised into psychological treatments and pharmacological treatments. Psychological treatments included behavioral, cognitive, cognitive-behavioral, combined treatments and other therapies. Issues such as the number of studies in each treatment modality, their sample sizes and the methodological quality of most of the studies reviewed precluded firm conclusions about the effectiveness of any of the treatments assessed for music performance anxiety. The field is in urgent need of larger scale, methodologically rigorous studies to assist the large minority of musicians who suffer from performance impairing music performance anxiety.

AB  - Context: Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is the time from manifestation of the first psychotic symptom to initiation of adequate treatment. It has been postulated that a longer DUP leads to a poorer prognosis. If so, outcome might be improved through earlier detection and treatment.
   Objectives: To establish whether DUP is associated with prognosis and to determine whether any association is explained by confounding with premorbid adjustment.
   Data Sources: The CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health), EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsychLIT databases were searched from their inception dates to May 2004.
   Study Selection: Eligible studies reported the relationship between DUP and outcome in prospective cohorts recruited during their first episode of psychosis. Twenty-six eligible studies involving 4490 participants were identified from 11458 abstracts, each screened by 2 reviewers.
   Data Extraction: Data were extracted independently and were checked by double entry. Sensitivity analyses were conducted excluding studies that had follow-up rates of less than 80 %, included affective psychoses, or did not use a standardized assessment of DUP.
   Data Synthesis: Independent meta-analyses were conducted of correlational data and of data derived from comparisons of long and short DUP groups. Most data were correlational, and these showed a significant association between DUP and several outcomes at 6 and 12 months (including total symptoms, depression/anxiety, negative symptoms, overall functioning, positive symptoms, and social functioning). Long vs short DUP data showed an association between longer DUP and worse outcome at 6 months in terms of total symptoms, overall functioning, positive symptoms, and quality of life. Patients with a long DUP were significantly less likely to achieve remission. The observed association between DUP and outcome was not explained by premorbid adjustment.
   Conclusions: There is convincing evidence of a modest association between DUP and outcome, which supports the case for clinical trials that examine the effect of reducing DUP.

AB  - Study objective: The concept of social capital has influenced mental health policies of nations and international organisations despite its limited evidence base. This papers aims to systematically review quantitative studies examining the association between social capital and mental illness.
   Design and setting: Twenty electronic databases and the reference sections of papers were searched to identify published studies. Authors of papers were contacted for unpublished work. Anonymised papers were reviewed by the authors of this paper. Papers with a validated mental illness outcome and an exposure variable agreed as measuring social capital were included. No limitations were put on date or language of publication.
   Main results: Twenty one studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Fourteen measured social capital at the individual level and seven at an ecological level. The former offered evidence for an inverse relation between cognitive social capital and common mental disorders. There was moderate evidence for an inverse relation between cognitive social capital and child mental illness, and combined measures of social capital and common mental disorders. The seven ecological studies were diverse in methodology, populations investigated, and mental illness outcomes, making them difficult to summarise.
   Conclusions: Individual and ecological social capital may measure different aspects of the social environment. Current evidence is inadequate to inform the development of specific social capital interventions to combat mental illness.

AB  - Background When planning and delivering a liaison psychiatry service it is important to have an understanding of the research evidence supporting the use of interventions likely to be delivered by the service.
   Aims To identify high-quality systematic reviews for all interventions in three defined areas of liaison psychiatry, to summarise their clinical implications and to highlight areas where more research is needed. The three areas were the psychological effects of physical illness or treatment, somatoform disorders and self-harming behaviour.
   Method Computerised database searching, secondary reference searching hand-searching and expert consultation were used to identify relevant systematic reviews. Studies were reliably selected, and quality-assessed, and data were extracted and interpreted by two reviewers.
   Results We found 64 high-quality systematic reviews. Only 14 reviews included meta-analyses.
   Conclusions Many areas of liaison psychiatry practice are not based on high-quality evidence. More research in this area would help inform development and planning of liaison psychiatry services.

AB  - Background Suicide risk is greatly increased in schizophrenia. Detection of those at risk is clinically important.
   Aims To identify risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia.
   Method The international literature on case-control and cohort studies of patients with schizophrenia or related conditions in which suicide was reported as an outcome was systematically reviewed. Studies were identified through searching electronic databases and reference lists, and by consulting experts.
   Results Twenty-nine eligible studies were identified. Factors with robust evidence of increased risk of suicide were previous depressive disorders (OR=3.03, 95% Cl 2.06-4.46), previous suicide attempts (OR=4.09,95% Cl 2,79-6.0 1), drug misuse (OR=3.21,95% Cl 1.99-5.17), agitation or motor restlessness (OR=2.6 1, 95% Cl 1.54-4.4 1), fear of mental disintegration (OR=12.1,95% Cl 1.8981.3), poor adherence to treatment (OR=3.75,95% CI 2.20-6.37) and recent loss (OR=4.03,95% CI 1.37-11.8). Reduced risk was associated with hallucinations (OR=0.50,95% Cl 0.35-0.71).
   Conclusions Prevention of suicide in schizophrenia is likely to result from treatment of affective symptoms, improving adherence to treatment, and maintaining special vigilance in patients with risk factors, especially after losses.

AB  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are recognized as times of vulnerability to mood disorders, including postpartum depression and psychosis. Recently, changes in sleep physiology and sleep deprivation have been proposed as having roles in perinatal psychiatric disorders. In this article we review what is known about changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum "blues," depression and psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited. Studies that measure both sleep and mood during the perinatal period, particularly those that employ objective measurement tools such as polysomnography and actigraphy, will provide important information about the causes, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders.

AB  - Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved treatment for epilepsy and is currently under investigation as a therapy for other disorders, including depression, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease. This review examines the pre-clinical and clinical literature relating to VNS. A brief historical perspective is given, followed by consideration of the efficacy of the various clinical applications of VNS. Finally, what is known about the mechanism by which VNS exerts clinical benefit is considered. It is concluded that although the precise mechanism of action of VNS is still unknown, the search for the mechanism has the potential to lend new insight into the neuropathology of depression. It is important that prior assumptions about the influence of VNS on particular aspects of brain function do not constrain the investigations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Method: Literature search in Medline and PsychLit databases. Only studies with a prospective design and correction for somatic morbidity were included for review.
   Results: On the most general level of outcomes considered and in the majority of studies, mental disorders were associated with higher service use. This general tendency is not consistently reflected in the use of specific health care services, but is materialized in different patterns of out-patient and in-patient service utilization, which vary from study to study. Findings for the elderly were less clear-cut than for other age groups.
   Conclusion: Mental disorders are related to higher general health care service use on a global, aggregated level. These associations are not specific for certain types of services.

AB  - A coordinated movement is easy to recognize, but we know little about how it is achieved. In search of the neural basis of coordination, we present a model of spinocerebellar interactions in which the structure-functional organizing principle is a division of the cerebellum into discrete microcomplexes. Each microcomplex is the recipient of a specific motor error signal-that is, a signal that conveys information about an inappropriate movement. These signals are encoded by spinal reflex circuits and conveyed to the cerebellar cortex through climbing fibre afferents. This organization reveals salient features of cerebellar information processing, but also highlights the importance of systems level analysis for a fuller understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie behaviour.

AB  - Latent inhibition (LI) is a robust phenomenon that is demonstrated when a previously inconsequential stimulus is less effective in a new learning situation than a novel stimulus. Despite LI's simplicity, there is considerable disagreement as to its theoretical basis. Attentional theories claim that unattended stimulus preexposures reduce stimulus associability. Alternatively, it has been asserted that associability is unaffected and that LI is a result of competition/retrieval processes. The present article reviews a series of visual search studies, some with normal subjects, both undifferentiated and divided into low and high schizotypals, and others with pathologies that entail dysfunctional attention, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and anxiety. The visual search conditions were designed to model those of traditional LI experiments, while tapping attentional processes independently of the learning scores that index LI. A variety of evidence from these and other studies is used to support the involvement of attentional and retrieval processes in LI. A model of the mechanism of action of these processes in LI is presented, together with its application to schizophrenia.

AB  - Actual fields of research in neurobiology are not only aimed at understanding the different aspects of brain aging but also at developing strategies useful to preserve brain compensatory capacity and to prevent the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Consistent with this trend much attention has been addressed to zinc metabolism. In fact, zinc acts as a neuromodulator at excitatory synapses and has a considerable role in the stress response and in the functionality of zinc-dependent enzymes contributing to maintaining brain compensatory capacity. In particular, the mechanisms that modulate the free zinc pool are pivotal for safeguarding brain health and performance. Alterations in zinc homeostasis have been reported in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease as well as in transient forebrain ischemia, seizures and traumatic brain injury, but little is known regarding aged brain. There is much evidence that that age-related changes, frequently associated to a decline in brain functions and impaired cognitive performances, could be related to dysfunctions affecting the intracellular zinc ion availability. A general agreement emerges from studies of humans' and rodents' old brains about an increased expression of metallothionein (NIT) isoforms I and II, but dyshomogenous results are reported for MT-III, and it is still uncertain whether these proteins maintain in aging the protective role, as it occurs in adult/young age. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that amyloid-P deposition in Alzheimer's disease is induced by zinc, but the pathological significance and the causes of this phenomenon are still an open question. The scientific debate on the role of zinc and of some zinc-binding proteins in aging and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as on the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation in aged brain and neurodegeneration, is extensively discussed in this review.

AB  - Evidence suggests that ocular pathology could reduce light-stimulated neuronal signaling to the suprachiasmatic nuclei. This study investigated associations of ambient illumination with moods, while considering the contribution of ophthalmic dysfunctions. Seventy Black (59%) and White (41%) Americans participated in the study. Their average age was 68.27 +/- 5.97 years; 73% were women. Baseline data included: physical health, mood, and sociodemographics. Ophthalmic factors including visual acuity, visual field defects, intraocular pressure, vertical and horizontal cup-to-disk ratios, and nerve-fiber-layer thickness, were assessed at SUNY Downstate's eye clinic. The following week, participants wore the Actiwatch-L at home to monitor ambient illumination and sleep. Cosine analyses were performed on the logarithm of measured illumination, yielding the mesor and acrophase of daily illumination exposure. Sleep was estimated with an automatic scoring algorithm. Of the. sample, 25% reported visual impairment and 85% reported good to excellent health; 27% were visually impaired according to American criteria. Partial correlation analyses showed an inverse correlation of daily illumination levels to depressed mood [r(p)=-0.33, P < 0.05], when age, sex, ethnicity, income, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, respiratory disease, and habitual sleep duration were controlled. With further control for ophthalmic factors, the magnitude and significance of the correlation diminished [r(p)=-0.26, NS]. Individuals receiving daily illumination later in the day reported more depressed moods [r(p)=0.36, P < 0.01]; of note, this correlation was not significant after control for the covariates [r(p)=0.18, NS]. Regression analysis indicated that, the ophthalmic factors explained 13% of the variance in depression. Our results show that both the level and timing of ambient illumination are associated with mood. Furthermore, they suggest that visual impairment has a mediating effect on the associations of ambient illumination with depression, supporting the notion that ocular pathology lessens the efficacy of daily illumination in promoting positive moods.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the literature pertaining to rapid-rate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) compared with sham therapy for the treatment of a major depressive episode in order to arrive at qualitative and quantitative conclusions about the efficacy of rapid-rate rTMS. Methods: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and abstracts from scientific meetings were searched for the years 1966 until July 2003. The search terms "transcranial magnetic stimulation" and "transcranial magnetic stimulation AND depression" were used. Eighty-seven randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of rTMS were referenced on MEDLINE. Nineteen of these involved treatment of a major depressive episode, and these were reviewed. Six met more specific inclusion criteria including the use of rapid-rate stimulation, application to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, evaluation with the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and use of an intent-to-treat analysis. Scores on the 21-item HAM-D after treatment and standard deviations were extracted from each article for treatment and control subjects. A random-effects model was chosen for the meta-analysis, and the weighted mean difference was used as a summary measure. Results: Six studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified and included in the meta-analysis. Two of these reported a significantly greater improvement in mood symptoms in the treatment versus the sham group. When combined in the meta-analysis, the overall weighted mean difference was -1.1 (95% confidence interval -4.5 to 2.3), and the results of a test for heterogeneity were not significant (chi(5)(2) = 5.81, p = 0.33). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that rapid-rate rTMS is no different from sham treatment in major depression; however, the power within these studies to detect a difference was generally low. Randomized controlled trials with sufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful difference are required.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this article is to review some of the basic aspects of the dopaminergic system and its role in reward and pleasure behaviour. We also discuss the association between dopamine and unpleasant symptoms that are commonly found in neuropsychiatric disorders and may also be side-effects of neuroleptic drugs.
   Method: A computer-based search of the literature, augmented by extensive bibliography-guided article reviews, were used to find basic information on the dopamine and the reward systems, and symptoms such as dysphoria, anhedonia and depression.
   Results: Central dopaminergic neurotransmission is complex, having multiple actions at each level of the mesocorticolimbic reward pathway. The role of dopamine in the reward process was classically associated with the ability to experience pleasure; recent data suggest a more motivational role. Dysfunction of the dopamine transmission in the reward circuit is associated with symptoms such as anhedonia, apathy and dysphoria found in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, depression, drug addiction, and neuroleptic-induced dysphoria.
   Conclusion: Viewing the dysfunctions of the reward pathways within a broader spectrum and exploring its complex relations with the dopaminergic transmission may help understand the pathophysiology of these neuropsychiatric disorders and lead to a rational development of novel treatments.

AB  - Objective: The authors synthesize findings of previous studies implicating migration as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia and provide a quantitative index of the associated effect size.
   Method: MEDLINE was searched for population-based incidence studies concerning migrants in English-language publications appearing between the years 1977 and 2003. Article bibliographies and an Australian database were cross-referenced. Studies were included if incidence reports provided numerators and denominators and if age correction was performed or could be performed by the authors. Relative risks for migrant groups were extracted or calculated for each study. Significant heterogeneity across studies indicated the need for a mixed-effects meta-analytic model.
   Results: The mean weighted relative risk for developing schizophrenia among first-generation migrants (40 effect sizes) was 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]= 2.3-3.2). A separate analysis performed for second-generation migrants (seven effect sizes) yielded a relative risk of 4.5 (95% CI=1.5-13.1). An analysis performed for studies concerning both first- and second-generation migrants and studies that did not distinguish between generations (50 effect sizes) yielded a relative risk of 2.9 (95% CI=2.5-3.4). Subgroup comparisons yielded significantly greater effect sizes for migrants from developing versus developed countries (relative risk=3.3, 95% CI=2.8-3.9) and for migrants from areas where the majority of the population is black (relative risk=4.8, 95% CI=3.7-6.2) versus white and neither black nor white.
   Conclusions: A personal or family history of migration is an important risk factor for schizophrenia. The differential risk pattern across subgroups suggests a role for psychosocial adversity in the etiology of schizophrenia.

AB  - The field of "mitochondrial medicine" has advanced rapidly since the first patient with a mitochondrial disorder, a concept primarily used for defects of the respiratory chain, was described in 1962 and the first mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations were described in 1988. Because of the ubiquitous requirement for energy and unique aspects of mtDNA genetics, mtDNA mutations are known to cause a bewildering spectrum of clinical manifestations. However, because of its high-energy requirement, brain is the primary tissue affected in mitochondrial disorders. Using a variety of approaches, mitochondrial function has been shown in numerous studies to be abnormal in patients with schizophrenia and depression. Although less studied, an increase of psychiatric symptoms and disorders, in particular depression, are likely present in patients with mitochondrial disorders. The major categories of drugs used to treat schizophrenia and depression have been demonstrated to exert effects on mitochondria. The authors conclude that an association between energy metabolism and the mental disorders of schizophrenia and depression has been well documented, but that no conclusive evidence as yet demonstrates a causal relationship. A "mitochondrial psychiatry" model is proposed in which a moderate reduction in mitochondrial energy metabolism, genetically determined and/or acquired, is one predisposing factor in the multi-factorial development of certain chronic mental disorders. Clinical implications of our hypothesis, present and future, include the presence of co-morbid somatic symptoms/conditions, and specific treatment at least in highly-selected cases.

AB  - Misclassification, the erroneous measurement of one or several categorical variables, is a major concern in many scientific fields and particularly in psychiatric research. Even in rather simple scenarios, unless the misclassification probabilities are very small, a major bias can arise in estimating the degree of association assessed with common measures like the risk ratio and the odds ratio. Only in very special cases - for example, if misclassification takes place solely in one of two binary variables and is independent of the other variable ('non-differential misclassification') - is it guaranteed that the estimates are biased towards the null value (which is 1 for the risk ratio and the odds ratio). Furthermore, misclassification, if ignored, usually leads to confidence intervals that are too narrow. This paper reviews consequences of in is classification. A numerical example demonstrates the problem's magnitude for the estimation of the risk ratio in the easy case where misclassification takes place in the exposure variable, but not in the outcome. Moreover, uncertainty about misclassification can broaden the confidence intervals dramatically. The best way to overcome misclassification is to avoid it by design, but some statistical methods are useful for reducing bias if misclassification cannot be avoided.

AB  - The Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats were originally selectively bred for increased responses to an anti cholinesterase agent. The FSL rat partially resembles depressed individuals because it exhibits reduced appetite and psychomotor function but exhibits normal hedonic responses and cognitive function. The FSL rat also exhibits sleep and immune abnormalities that are observed in depressed individuals. Neurochemical and/or pharmacological evidence suggests that the FSL rat exhibits changes consistent with the cholinergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, NPY, and circadian rhythm models but not the noradrenergic, HPA axis or GABAergic models of depression. However, evidence for the genetic basis of these changes is lacking and it remains to be determined which, if any, of the neurochemical changes are primary to the behavioral alterations. The FSL rat model has been very useful as a screen for antidepressants because known antidepressants reduced swim test immobility when given chronically and psychomotor stimulants did not. Furthermore, rolipram and a melatonin agonist were shown to have anti-immobility effects in the FSL rats and later to have antidepressant effects in humans. Thus, the FSL rat model of depression exhibits some behavioral, neurochemical, and pharmacological features that have been reported in depressed individuals and has been very effective in detecting antidepressants.

AB  - In spite of a substantial number of suicides in patients with schizophrenia, this area of research has until very recently been the Cinderella of schizophrenia research. Both clinical and research practices have been hampered by a lack of assessment tolls specifically designed to measure suicidality in patients with schizophrenia. This has partly been because of uncertainty about what constitutes reliable risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia. A literature search following evidence-based guidelines was carried out. A number of relevant articles were found, which were then critically reviewed. The majority of rating scales used for patients with schizophrenia were actually based - at least partly - on patients with other diagnoses than schizophrenia (affective conditions, schizoaffective disorder). This procedure could result in misleading conclusions as a result of the heterogeneity of the different mental illnesses. We conclude that, at present, only one rating scale measuring suicidality specifically designed for patients with schizophrenia (the InterSePT-scale) is based on both sound methodology and has clinical relevance. Suicide in patients with schizophrenia remains a pressing problem in the treatment of this high-risk group.

AB  - Background Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a controversial disorder with different case definitions, aetiological models and proposed treatments. An epidemiological approach is likely to bring some clarity to the field.
   Aim The aim of this article is to review the literature on the epidemiology of fatigue, chronic fatigue and CFS.
   Method A literature search was conducted using the databases Medline and Pubmed as well as the reference lists of recent reviews to identify the relevant studies. The aim was not to do a systematic review but to review the key studies in the area to highlight the methodological issues.
   Results The review is organized according to the following areas: the prevalence of fatigue and chronic fatigue, the prevalence and incidence of CFS, epidemiological associations such as gender, social class and psychiatric co-morbidity and CFS in special groups such as those recovering from a viral infection, specific occupational groups and Gulf War veterans.
   Conclusion While fatigue as a symptom is very common, CFS is relatively rare. Many of the epidemiological associations seen in specialist clinics are not found in community samples. It is unlikely that one specific causal factor can explain CFS. Future studies should go beyond estimating the prevalence to testing more complex aetiological models.

AB  - Pediatric functional neuroimaging has finally come into its own in this new century. In this brief review, we focus on functional magnetic resonance Imaging studies of typically developing children and adolescents that have examined executive function, language, and mood along with studies of autism and autism spectrum disorders, dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, Tourette's disorder, anxiety disorders, anorexia, and juvenile bipolar disorder. Studies in autism, anxiety disorders, and dyslexia are beginning to provide replicated observations regarding the role of specific brain structures such as the amygdala, or posterior versus anterior language centers in respective models of pathophysiology. However, as is appropriate, the field is still in its infancy, and most studies cited are still exploratory. The increasing number of investigators and active pediatric imaging centers predicts that functional neuroimaging techniques will open an increasingly wider "window" into brain function of children and adolescents burdened with neuropsychiatric disorders. This may warrant the creation of large pediatric neuroimaging databases that will permit sharing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of normal and pathological human behavior.

AB  - Background. There is a body of literature on metamphetamine psychosis dating back to the 1950' s with a recent resurgence of interest following increase in use worldwide. Distinct similarities appear to exist between metamphetamine psychosis and schizophrenia.
   Aims. The aim of this paper is to critically review the literature on metamphetamine psychosis.
   Method. Searches on Medline, Psycinfo and Cochrane were undertaken, references were followed and recent editions of major journals reviewed. There is a vast array of literature on stimulants and psychosis. I have deliberately limited my data to that on metamphetamines, only citing other data if particularly well known and relevant to distinguish. Data in Japanese has been quoted with reference to where cited.
   Results. Metamphetamine psychosis has been observed as a paranoid hallucinatory state developing gradually with repeated metamphetamine abuse and possibly continueing after metamphetamine withdrawal. Also noted is a lasting susceptibility to recurrence of the paranoid hallucinatory state with neuroleptics preventing this recurrence. Patients with persistent metamphetamine psychosis can develop long lasting residual symptoms resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
   In animals intermittent administration of smaller doses of metamphetamine appears to lead to augmentation of behaviour, and increases in dopamine and seretonin levels. Also it appears that a challenge injection or stress can cause the same responses, which are inhibited by dopamine antagonists. Larger repeated doses of metamphetamine appear to lead to long lasting depletion of dopamine and seretonin.
   Conclusions and clinical importance. There are clear clinical similarities between metamphetamine psychosis and schizophrenia altered in both conditions with the use of antipsychotics. A major as yet unanswered question is whether metamphetamine can cause schizophrenia.
   The literature describes a number of changes in dopamine and seretonin systems. More research in this field could increase our understanding of transmitters and receptors, thereby helping our quest in improved drug development for both illnesses.

AB  - Objective: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale has been the gold standard for the assessment of depression for more than 40 years. Criticism of the instrument has been increasing. The authors review studies published since the last major review of this instrument in 1979 that explicitly examine the psychometric properties of the Hamilton depression scale. The authors' goal is to determine whether continued use of the Hamilton depression scale as a measure of treatment outcome is justified.
   Method: MEDLINE was searched for studies published since 1979 that examine psychometric properties of the Hamilton depression scale. Seventy studies were identified and selected, and then grouped into three categories on the basis of the major psychometric properties examined-reliability, item-response characteristics, and validity.
   Results: The Hamilton depression scale's internal reliability is adequate, but many scale items are poor contributors to the measurement of depression severity; others have poor interrater and retest reliability. For many items, the format for response options is not optimal. Content validity is poor; convergent validity and discriminant validity are adequate. The factor structure of the Hamilton depression scale is multidimensional but with poor replication across samples.
   Conclusions: Evidence suggests that the Hamilton depression scale is psychometrically and conceptually flawed. The breadth and severity of the problems militate against efforts to revise the current instrument. After more than 40 years, it is time to embrace a new gold standard for assessment of depression.

   Design: We searched the electronic data bases: Medline, Psych LIT, between 1966 and March 2003 looking for articles on ADHD, attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity and suicide.
   Results: An association of ADHD and completed suicide was found, especially for younger males. However, the evidence for any direct or independent link was modest with an overall suicide rate from long-term follow-up studies of ADHD of 0.63-0.78%. The estimated relative risk ratio, compared with US national suicide rates (males 5-24 years) is 2.91 (95% confidence interval 1.47-5.7, chi(2) = 9.3, d.f. = 1, P = 0.002). ADHD appears to increase the risk of suicide in males via increasing severity of comorbid conditions, particularly conduct disorder (CD) and depression.
   Conclusion: Identification of those at risk, particularly males with comorbid ADHD, depression and CD, may represent a useful clinical means of reducing completed suicide.

AB  - Objective: To provide an overview of the literature relevant to, and describing, parenting programs for women with mental illness who have young children.
   Method: A literature search was undertaken, including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and EMBASE: Psychiatry. Searches were limited to English journals and books and to the last five years in the first instance, with earlier literature considered where appropriate.
   Results: Maternal mental illness can impact negatively on a child's life, especially where an insecure attachment is formed between mother and baby during the important early developmental years. The potential sequelae of maternal mental illness for children include impaired cognitive development, behavioural difficulties and increased risk of psychiatric disorder. Effective parenting skills are suggested to be a protective factor against these sequelae. However, the effects of parenting programs for women with mental illness have not been empirically tested, so that the potential long-term benefits of such interventions are not known.
   Conclusions: Parenting skills training for women with mental illness may be a useful selective preventive intervention. It is unlikely generic programs will be suitable. Rather, interventions for women with a mental illness will need to address the commonly experienced parenting problems as well as the more specific needs of women with mental illness.

AB  - Alterations of central serotonergic neurotransmission, particularly changes in the presynaptically located serotonin transporter (SERT) availability, are thought to be one of the major pathomechanisms of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Modem neuroimaging techniques such as single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography employ radiolabeled tracers, which bind to SERT, and thus, allow detection of cerebral SERT availability in vivo. We review SERT imaging studies in patients with depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and patients with neurological diseases. We furthermore elucidate the potential of SERT imaging techniques in estimating the effect of selective serotonin reuptake-inhibitors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the great technical advancement of mass spectrometry, this technique has contributed in a limited way to the discovery and quantitation of specific/precocious markers linked to free radical-mediated diseases. Unsaturated aldehydes generated by free radical-induced lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and in particular 4-hydroxy-trans-2 nonenal (HNE), are involved in the onset and progression of many pathologies such as cardiovascular (atherosclerosis, long-term complications of diabetes) and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia). Most of the biological effects of HNE are attributed to the capacity of HNE to react with the nucleophilic sites of proteins and peptides (other than nucleic acids), to form covalently modified biomolecules that can disrupt important cellular functions and induce mutations. By considering the emerging role of HNE in several human diseases, an unequivocal analytical approach as mass spectrometry to detect/elucidate the structure of protein-HNE adducts in biological matrices is strictly needed not only to understand the reaction mechanism of HNE, but also to gain a deeper insight into the pathological role of HNE. This with the aim to provide intermediate diagnostic biomarkers for human diseases. This review sheds focus on the. "state-of-the-art" of mass spectrometric applications in the field of HNE-protein adducts characterization, starting from the fundamental early studies and discussing the different MS-based approaches that can provide detailed information on the mechanistic aspects of HNE-protein interaction. In the last decade, the increases in the accessible mass ranges of modem instruments and advances in ionization methods have made possible a fundamental improvement in the analysis of protein-HNE adducts by mass spectrometry, and in particular by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry. The recent developments and uses of combined analytical approaches to detect and characterize the type/site of interaction have been highlighted, and several other aspects, including sample preparation methodologies, structure elucidation, and data analysis have also been considered.

   Methods: The criteria used to evaluate the interventions were derived from the standardized methodology developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Databases searched for this review include Medline, PubMed, Cinahl, PsycINFO, Embase, ProQuest, the Cochrane Library, and the World Health Organization Reproductive Health Library. Studies selected were peer-reviewed English-language articles published between January 1, 1966, and December 31, 2003.
   Results: Seven studies that met criteria were examined. These studies focused on evaluating the preventive effect of antidepressant medication, estrogen and progesterone therapy, thyroid therapy, docosahexanoic acid, and calcium supplementation. Although some of these interventions have been examined rigorously for depression unrelated to childbirth, methodological study limitations render intervention efficacy equivocal for PPD; thus, there is limited strong evidence to guide practice or policy recommendations.
   Conclusions: Despite the recent upsurge of interest in this area, many questions remain unanswered, which has several implications for research.

AB  - Medical and psychological discourse on end-of-life care has steadily shifted over the years from focusing primarily on symptom control and pain management to incorporating more person-centred approaches to patient care. Such approaches underscore the significance of spirituality and meaning making as important resources for coping with emotional and existential suffering as one nears death. Though existential themes are omnipresent in end-of-life care, little has been written about their foundations or import for palliative care practitioners and patients in need. In this article, we explore the existential foundations of meaning and spirituality in light of terminal illness and palliative care. We discuss existential themes in terms of patients' awareness of death and search for meaning and practitioners' promotion of personal agency and responsibility as patients face life-and-death issues. Viktor Frankl's existential logotherapy is discussed in light of emerging psychotherapeutic interventions. Meaning-centred group therapy is one such novel modality that has successfully integrated themes of meaning and spirituality into end-of-life care. We further explore spiritual and existential themes through this meaning-oriented approach that encourages dying patients to find meaning and purpose in living until their death.

This finding has changed the direction of studies on Parkinson's disease by suggesting that abnormal protein turnover might be involved in its pathogenesis. A number of potentially neurotoxic Parkin-specific substrates have been identified. Further investigation of Parkin knockout mice will hopefully provide new evidence in the search for Parkin's substrates and further clarify their role in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Objective To review and critically evaluate research on psychosocial issues in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to provide recommendations for future research. Methods A literature search was conducted using the Medline and PsychInfo computerized databases as well as the bibliographies of relevant articles. Results Most of the existing research has compared children with IBD to healthy populations and other illness populations. Compared to healthy children, children with IBD may be at greater risk for difficulties in behavioral and emotional functioning as well as in family and parent functioning, but all such functioning appears similar to that found in other illness populations. It is unclear if the increased risk reaches clinical significance and what role the severity of the disease plays in adjustment. Conclusions Future research should use a developmental perspective to investigate the process of adaptation to IBD, risk factors of poor adjustment, and the role of psychosocial factors in health outcomes in pediatric IBD.

AB  - Aims: To review the methods and findings from studies of the therapeutic relationship (TR) in the treatment of severe mental illness.
   Method: A literature search was conducted to identify all studies that used an operationalised measurement of the TR in the treatment of severe mental illness.
   Results: Fifteen scales - the majority of which were developed for psychotherapy - and the expressed emotion index have been used. Most scales have acceptable internal, inter-rater and test-retest reliability. As none of the scales has been used in more than five studies, no single scale is widely established in psychiatric research. A more positive relationship consistently predicts a better short- and long-term outcome. It appears that a large global factor accounts for the greatest proportion of the variance in the therapeutic relationship.
   Conclusions: The therapeutic relationship is a reliable predictor of patient outcome in mainstream psychiatric care. Valid assessments may need to take account of different, specific aspects of the relationship in psychiatric settings such as greater heterogeneity of treatment components and goals, increased variability of setting and the statutory responsibility of the clinician. Methodological progress may require conceptual work to ensure valid assessments of this central element of treatment.

   Method: Using cross-references, a computerized search was performed on MEDLINE and EMBASE psychiatry covering the period 1990-2002.
   Results: Olanzapine and risperidone, added to mood stabilizers, and olanzapine as monotherapy enjoy the most evidential support in terms of efficacy and side-effect profile for their use in acute bipolar mania. The use of modern antipsychotics in bipolar prophylaxis and in both the short- and long-term treatment of schizomania has not been widely studied yet.
   Conclusion: More controlled trials are still needed comparing modern antipsychotics as monotherapy and adjunctive to mood stabilizers with conventional antipsychotics, lithium, anticonvulsants and with each other in short-term and, especially, maintenance treatment of (schizo)mania. Partly based on controlled studies, olanzapine, risperidone and other modern antipsychotics could become preferable for these indications.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized pathologically by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra with resultant depletion of striatal dopamine and presence of Lewy bodies in the remaining neurons. The Lewy body contains numerous functional and structural proteins, including alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin; aggregation of alpha-synuclein is thought to be important in Lewy body formation as well as neurodegeneration, although the detailed mechanisms remain to be defined. Increasing evidence has suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system may be involved in alpha-synuclein aggregation, Lewy body formation, and neurodegeneration. However, how these processes are related to each other is not fully understood, given that there are Parkinsonian animal models as well as human diseases with significant nigral neurodegeneration regardless of whether Lewy bodies form or not. This review summarizes the current related research fields and proposes a proteomic approach to investigate the mechanisms that may dictate alpha-synuclein aggregation, Lewy body formation, and neurodegeneration.

AB  - Objective: In order to examine whether the incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is increased in subjects with subthreshold depression, or sD (clinically relevant depressive symptoms, without meeting criteria for a full-blown MDD), we conducted a review of prospective studies examining the incidence of MDD in subjects with sD.
   Method: A systematic literature search was conducted. For all studies, the relative risk of developing MDD was calculated, based on person-years.
   Results: Twenty studies (23 comparisons) were found, based on community samples, general medical patients and high-risk subjects. Most comparisons showed that subjects with sD had a consistently larger chance of developing MDD. The studies differed considerably in the definition of sD, the recency (occurrence of the last sD) and the in-/exclusion of lifetime MDD.
   Conclusion: The incidence of MDD in subjects with sD is larger than in subjects without sD. Otherwise, the concept of sD is too broad to be used. In future studies, some consensus should be reached regarding the definition of sD.

With the advent of molecular mapping techniques it has become possible to test this hypothesis. Here I review the progress that has been made, largely in animal genetic studies, demonstrating that a common set of genes act pleiotropically on measures of emotionality. More recently, evidence has emerged supporting the view that the same genes influence variation in both rodent and human phenotypes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: this article reviewed the child and adult medical literature on the prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders in patients with asthma. Theoretical ideas regarding the relatively high comorbidity rates are presented along with a model describing putative interactions between anxiety disorders and asthma. Method: A search of the literature from the last 2 decades using MEDLINE by pairing the word, "asthma," with the following words: "anxiety," "depression," "panic," and "psychological disorders." We located additional research by screening the bibliographies of articles retrieved in the MEDLINE search. Results: Both adult and child/adolescent populations with asthma appear to have a high prevalence of anxiety disorders. In child/adolescent populations with asthma, up to one third may meet criteria for comorbid anxiety disorders. In adult populations with asthma, the estimated rate of panic disorder ranges from 6.5% to 24%. However, most studies are limited by small samples, nonrepresentative populations, self-reported asthma status, and lack of controlling for important potential confounders such as smoking and asthma medications. There are also limited data on the impact of anxiety comorbidity in patients with asthma on symptom burden, self-care regimens (such as monitoring peak expiratory flow, taking medication, and quitting smoking), functional status, and medical costs. Conclusions: There appears to be a high comorbidity of anxiety disorders in patients with asthma. The prevalence and longitudinal impact of anxiety comorbidity needs to be examined in a large population-based sample of children, adolescents, and adults with asthma. If a high prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorder is documented and if this comorbidity adversely affects the self-efficacy and self-care, symptom burden, and functioning in persons with asthma, then it will be important to develop treatment trials.

AB  - Objective: The present paper reviews the evidence that depression is a risk factor for the development and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: MEDLINE searches and reviews of bibliographies were used to identify relevant articles. Articles were clustered by theme: depression as a risk factor, biobehavioral mechanisms, and treatment outcome studies. Results: Depression confers a relative risk between 1.5 and 2.0 for the onset of CAD in healthy individuals, whereas depression in patients with existing CAD confers a relative risk between 1.5 and 2.5 for cardiac morbidity and mortality. A number of plausible biobehavioral mechanisms linking depression and CAD have been identified, including treatment adherence, lifestyle factors, traditional risk factors, alterations in autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis functioning, platelet activation, and inflammation. Conclusion: There is substantial evidence for a relationship between depression and adverse clinical outcomes. However, despite the availability of effective therapies for depression, there is a paucity of data to support the efficacy of these interventions to improve clinical outcomes for depressed CAD patients. Randomized clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the value of treating depression in CAD patients to improve survival and reduce morbidity.

AB  - We present in this paper a picture of the neural systems controlling defense that updates and simplifies Gray's "Neuropsychology of Anxiety". It is based on two behavioural dimensions: 'defensive distance' as defined by the Blanchards and 'defensive direction'. Defensive direction is a categorical dimension with avoidance of threat corresponding to fear and approach to threat corresponding to anxiety. These two psychological dimensions are mapped to underlying neural dimensions. Defensive distance is mapped to neural level, with the shortest defensive distances involving the lowest neural level (periaqueductal grey) and the largest defensive distances the highest neural level (prefrontal cortex). Defensive direction is mapped to separate parallel streams that run across these levels. A significant departure from prior models is the proposal that both fear and anxiety are represented at all levels. The theory is presented in a simplified form that does not incorporate the interactions that must occur between non-adjacent levels of the system. It also requires expansion to include the dimension of escapability of threat. Our current development and these proposed future extensions do not change the core concepts originally proposed by Gray and, we argue, demonstrate their enduring value. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Service users and providers have stated that delivering continuity of care to people with severe mental illness should be a service priority. We reviewed literature on continuity of care for people with severe mental illness (SMI) in order to identify factors that promote and impede this process. Method A systematic search of electronic databases, sources of grey literature and contact with experts in the field. Two reviewers independently rated all papers for possible inclusion. Data extracted from papers formed the basis of a narrative review. Results We identified 435 papers on continuity of care, of which 60 addressed the study aims. Most did not define continuity of care. Available evidence suggests that assertive community treatment, case management, community mental health teams and crisis intervention reduce the likelihood of patients dropping out of contact with services. Conclusions Evidence on which to base services that enhance continuity of care for people with SMI is limited because previous research has often failed to define continuity of care or consider the patient's perspective.

AB  - Background: The interaction between immune cells; neurotransmitters and the neuroendocrinological systems plays a role in affective disorders, especially depression. Although panic disorder (PD) shares a lot of features with depression, it is clearly a distinct disorder. Reports on immunological parameters in PD don't provide a clear picture of the immunological status of PD patients. This can partly be attributed to methodological differences between studies and small patient groups.
   Objective: The present study alms to assemble all studies on immunological parameters in PD in order to combine all available data to gain a broader perspective on this matter.
   Method: PubMed was searched for studies describing immunological parameters in PD patients without comorbid disorders or medication use. All studies had to include a healthy control group and the outcome measures had to be shared by at least one other study.
   Results: Fourteen articles were found. Although the T-lymphocytic branch and the innate immune system were normal, the B-lymphocytic branch showed some differences between PD patients and healthy controls. B-cell counts were increased in PD patients, which was underlined by increased human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR counts and increased immunoglobulin A levels. However, B-cell activity following mitogen stimulation was normal.
   Conclusions: PD patients show increased B-cell numbers. The finding that B-cell activity is not increased can possibly be attributed to functional exhaustion of these cells. The meaning of this finding remains unclear, although it may be potentially important in affective disorders as the same has been found in depression.

Recently, several mechanisms that are likely to contribute to map plasticity have been directly observed in response to altered experience in vivo. These mechanisms include long-term potentiation and long-term depression at specific excitatory synapses, competition between lemniscal (barrel) and non-lemniscal (septal) processing streams, and regulation of the number of inhibitory synapses.

AB  - A substantial and still growing body of research tries to link different psychological models and chronic diseases, with special emphasis on cardiovascular disease. These efforts have established several conceptual bridges that connect psychological alterations and psychosocial factors to the risks, onset and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. However, several different models have been suggested. Depression and learned helplessness are two central psychological models that have been shown to have major explanatory power in the development of chronic diseases. In this respect the so called Central-Eastern European health paradox, that is the morbidity and mortality crisis in these transforming societies can be regarded as a special experimental model.
   In this review chronic stress is proposed as an integrating theory that can be applied to different psychological models. Chronic stress and allostatic load has been shown to lead to typical pathogenetic results in animal experiments. Chronic stress theory is applicable to the explanation of the suddenly changing patterns of premature mortality rates in transforming societies. Literature and the different models in the field of psychology, behavioural sciences, and epidemiology are reviewed in terms of the chronic stress theory. The applicability of these results are investigated for further research, clinical and policy implications. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Risk for suicide may have heritable contributions. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes strong and consistent findings from more than 20 controlled family studies indicating nearly 5-fold greater relative risk of suicidal acts among relatives of index cases with suicidal behavior compared to relatives of nonsuicidal controls. Relative risk was greater for completed suicide than for attempts. Contributions of genetic instead of environmental factors are indicated by a higher average concordance for suicidal behavior among co-twins of suicidal identical twins compared to fraternal twins or to relatives of other suicidal subjects, in at least seven studies. Three studies indicate significantly greater suicidal risk, particularly for completed suicide, among biological versus adoptive relatives of suicidal or mentally ill persons adopted early in life. Molecular genetics studies have searched inconclusively for associations of suicidal behavior with genes mainly for proteins required for central serotonergic neurotransmission. Complex interactions of environmental with heritable risk and protective factors for suicide and psychiatric illnesses or vulnerability traits are suspected, but specific intervening mechanisms remain elusive. Familial or genetic risks for psychiatric factors strongly associated with suicide, such as major affective illnesses and alcohol abuse, as well as impulsive or aggressive traits, have not consistently been separated from suicidal risk itself.

AB  - The authors consider the extent to which psychotropic medications demonstrate benefits in the prevention of suicidal behavior in psychiatric patients. Results of a MedLine search are critically reviewed for lithium, divalproex and other anticonvulsants, conventional and atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. The existing literature is almost entirely limited to noncontrolled, often retrospective studies that do not control for potential biases in treatment selection, the use of multiple medications, the impact of medication nonadherence, and nonrandomized treatment discontinuations. Nevertheless, an extensive literature has arisen regarding observed reductions in suicidal behavior with lithium for mood disorders and, to a lesser extent, with clozapine for schizophrenia. A substantially smaller literature suggests more negative than positive data with divalproex or carbamazepine in bipolar disorder, while minimal information exists regarding suicidality with atypical antipsychotics other than clozapine. Studies of antidepressants have mostly been short-term and have focused more on whether they induce (rather than ameliorate) suicidal thoughts or behaviors. The sum of existing studies is generally inconclusive about whether antidepressants appreciably reduce risk for suicide completions. Relatively little is known about pharmacotherapy effects on suicidal ideation as distinct from behaviors. Possible mechanistic considerations for understanding antisuicide properties include a therapeutic impact on depression, impulsivity, or aggression, potentially mediated through serotonergic or other neuromodulatory systems. Recommendations are provided to guide future research as well as clinical practice.

The dramatic proliferation of coping research has spawned healthy debate and criticism and offered insight into the question of why some individuals fare better than others do when encountering stress in their lives. We briefly review the history of contemporary coping research with adults. We discuss three primary challenges for coping researchers (measurement, nomenclature, and effectiveness), and highlight recent developments in coping theory and research that hold promise for the field, including previously unaddressed aspects of coping, new measurement approaches, and focus on positive affective outcomes.

AB  - This article presents an overview of those animal studies which so far have been performed with dedicated small animal positron emission tomographs in the field of the neurosciences. In vivo investigations focus on energy metabolism, perfusion and receptor/transporter binding in rat models of reinforcement, learning and memory, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, depression, cardiovascular diseases - such as ischemia and focal stroke - and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. In the majority of studies, important novel aspects arise from the fact that the investigators made use of an option inherent to in vivo studies, namely to conduct longitudinal investigations on the same animals. Relevant findings pertain to the relationship of brain metabolism/perfusion and the cholinergic system, the regulation state of dopamine receptors upon cocaine administration and withdrawal, the regulation state of dopamine receptors and transporters in animal models of Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, and potential treatments of progressive dopaminergic depletion with adenoviral vectors, embryonic grafts, stem cells and nerve growth factors.

AB  - Background: Certain medications may contribute to the etiology of depressive symptoms and disorders. Research in this area, however, has been hampered by methodological and conceptual problems. This review had two objectives: to identify evidence linking medical drugs to depressive symptoms and disorders, and to summarize this evidence in a clinically meaningful way. Methods: Electronic literature searches were performed and studies were reviewed with reference to critical methodological features. Results: No medications causing the typical major depressive syndrome were identified. Evidence was found linking corticosteroids, interferon-alpha, interleukin-2, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, mefloquine, progestin-releasing implanted contraceptives and propranolol to the etiology of atypical depressive syndromes. Conclusions: A small number of drugs have been shown capable of inducing depressive symptoms. Drug-induced depression appears to differ symptomatically from classical major depression.

This review evaluates specific conceptual and technical limits of claims of correspondence between neural events, overt behavior, and hypothesized covert processes examined using data on the neural control of saccadic eye movements.

AB  - Aims: This review presents the background work for developing a set of mental health indicators as part of a comprehensive health monitoring system in the European Union. The review focuses on the appraisal of mental health at population level with special emphasis on assessments that could be useful for mental health promotion. Methods: A functional model of mental health is used to delineate variables important for a set of mental health indicators. Variables that are not possible to monitor at population level are not discussed here. Literature searches were conducted through the MEDLINE, PSYCHLIT, and SOCIOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS databases and available textbooks. Results: The review presents findings from research seeking associations between mental health and ill health and different individual, social, economic, ecological, and service-related characteristics. Specific domains as key starting points in establishing a set of mental health indicators are outlined according to the research findings. Conclusion: A set of mental health indicators can enhance the visibility of mental health issues in the European context. Ultimately the indicators could be used in estimating how the targets set for health policies are met, and whether there has been a measurable decrease in disability, suffering, and disease.

AB  - Background: Mood disorders are related to considerable morbidity and mortality, and although there is little doubt that they are brain-based disorders, their neural correlates still remain elusive. A neuro-anatomic model of mood regulation comprising the prefrontal cortex, amygdalahippocampus complex, thalamus, basal ganglia, and connections among these areas has been proposed.
   Objective: We reviewed the evidence for regional brain abnormalities in bipolar disorder, and attempted to integrate available findings into a comprehensive pathophysiological model of illness.
   Methods: A computerized Medline Ovid search was conducted for the period 1966-2002, and complemented by a manual search of bibliographical references from recent reviews. Articles meeting specified criteria were included.
   Results: Hyperintense lesions in cortical and subcortical regions are the most consistently reported and widely studied structural abnormalities. Smaller prefrontal cortical volume is a common finding in bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. Enlarged amygdala (in bipolar disorder) and smaller hippocampus (in unipolar depression) have been reported by several groups. Decreased volumes (in unipolar depression) and increased or unaltered volumes (in bipolar disorder) of striatal structures have been reported.
   Conclusions: Bipolar and unipolar mood disorders are associated with detectable structural brain abnormalities. The histopathology underlying such anatomical changes remains to be elucidated. To reach more definitive conclusions about neuroanatomical changes that take place during the course of mood disorders, prospective longitudinal studies are needed. Also, integration with functional imaging is necessary in order to elucidate the relevance of identified structural abnormalities.

AB  - Objective: This article reviews the prevalence of anxiety disorders in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as the impact of comorbid anxiety on quality of life in patients with COPD. Published studies on three types of treatments for anxiety are then reviewed: psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, and pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Materials and Methods: A PubMed search was conducted of the literature from 1966 through 2002 using the keywords anxiety, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory diseases, obstructive lung diseases, and pulmonary rehabilitation. Any articles that discussed the prevalence of anxiety symptoms or anxiety disorders among patients with COPD, the impact of anxiety on patients with COPD, or the treatment of anxiety in COPD patients were included in this review. Results: Anxiety disorders, especially generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder, occur at a higher rate in patients with COPD compared with the general population. Not surprisingly, anxiety has a significant and negative impact on quality of life of COPD patients. Nonetheless, few studies have examined pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, or pulmonary rehabilitation treatments for anxiety disorders in the context of COPD. Trials of nortriptyline, buspirone, and sertraline have been found to reduce symptoms of anxiety. Similarly, cognitive-behavioral programs that focus on relaxation and changes in thinking also produced declines in anxious symptoms. Finally, multicomponent pulmonary rehabilitation programs can also result in reductions in anxious symptoms. Conclusions: Studies examining the treatment of anxiety disorders in patients with COPD are promising, yet their efficacy needs to be established. The long-term effects of treatment of anxiety disorders on quality of life of COPD patients have yet to be explored.

However, there has not been adequate discussion about the methodological and statistical issues associated with using academic examinations as a model for short-term stress in the context of psychoneuroimmunology research. Limitations of the model are presented with recommendations for appropriate use. Specific suggestions include use of subjective and objective measures of test difficulty, within-subjects designs including measurements during the examination itself, statistical models for testing interactions of continuous variables, and participants with clinical conditions.

AB  - Objective: Immune dysfunction in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been widely but inconsistently reported. Traditional reviews of the literature have produced a variety of conclusions. We present the results of the first systematic review of the subject. Methods: EMBASE, MEDLINE and PSYCHINFO databases were searched, and leading researchers in the field were contacted. Inclusion criteria were applied, and studies were then divided into groups based on the quality of their methodology. Study results were collated and described. Results: Studies ranged widely in quality. There was an inverse association between study quality and finding low levels of natural killer cells, suggesting that the association may be related to study methodology. On the other hand, reports of abnormalities in T cells and cytokine levels were not related to study quality. Conclusions: The conclusions of this systematic review differ from a recent traditional narrative review of the immunology of CFS. No consistent pattern of immunological abnormalities is identified.

AB  - Several somatic illnesses are associated with psychiatric comorbidity. Evidence is provided that availability of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which is the precursor of serotonin, may cause this phenomenon. Methods: We performed a database search to find relevant articles published between 1966 and 2002. For our search strategy, we combined several diseases from the categories hormonal, gastrointestinal, and inflammatory with the search terms "tryptophan" and "scrotonin." Results: The catabolism of tryptophan is stimulated under the influence of stress, hormones and inflammation by the induction of the enzymes tryptophan pyrrolase (in the liver) and IDO (ubiquitous). Because of the reduction in blood levels of tryptophan under these circumstances the formation of cerebral serotonin is decreased. Conclusions: It is argued that the coupling of peripheral tryptophan levels and cerebral serotonin levels has physiological significance. The clinical implications and therapeutic consequences of changes in tryptophan and consequently serotonin metabolism are discussed.

AB  - Objective: This paper has 3 objectives. First, we review the epidemiologic evidence for the association between suicidal behaviour and suicide in individuals diagnosed with antisocial, borderline, or narcissistic personality disorder. Second, we examine whether any potentially modifiable risk factors are associated with these diagnoses, based on existing empirical evidence. Last, we discuss clinical approaches to assessing youth with antisocial, borderline, or narcissistic personality disorder presenting at risk for suicide.
   Method: We reviewed the English-language literature for the last 12 years (from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2002), using as search terms the names of the 3 disorders, as well as the key words suicide, suicidal behaviour, youth, and adolescents.
   Results: Patients with antisocial or borderline personality disorder are likely to be at increased risk for suicidal behaviour when they demonstrate such comorbid disorders as major depressive episodes or substance abuse disorders, when they experience recent negative life events, or when they have a history of childhood sexual abuse.
   Conclusions: For patients with antisocial personality disorder, the risk of violence has to be judged in addition to the risk of suicide or self-harm. For patients with borderline personality disorder, interventions are determined by differentiating acute-on-chronic from chronic risk of suicidal behaviour. Finally, patients with narcissistic personality disorder can be at high risk for suicide during periods when they are not suffering from clinical depression. These episodes can seem to be unpredictable.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to examine the impact of depression on the perception of experimental pain stimuli. Methods: CD-ROM databases and bibliographies were searched to identify studies comparing the psychophysical responses to experimental pain stimuli of depressed subjects with that of healthy controls. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) and probabilities were combined across studies; positive effect sizes indicated higher thresholds in depressed groups. Results: Six methodologically rigorous, independent studies were found comparing psychophysical responses to experimental pain stimuli in depressed subjects and healthy controls. Pain perception threshold was higher in depressed subjects (6 studies, d = 0.38, p = .001). This finding was not the result of publication bias. Absolute sensory perception threshold was much higher in depressed subjects (2 studies, d = 0.68, p = .002), though the findings for pain tolerance (2 studies) were too heterogeneous to enable us to combine results. Conclusions: Depressed subjects are less likely to perceive a sensory stimulus as being painful compared with nondepressed controls. The influence of depression on attention to the pain stimulus may account for this effect. More studies are required to enable us to determine the impact of depression on absolute sensory perception threshold and pain tolerance. Furthermore, more studies would enable the examination of depression on the perception of different modalities.

AB  - Background Veterans of the Persian Gulf War of 1991 have reported symptoms attributed to their military service.
   Aims To review all studies comparing the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in Gulf War veterans and in a comparison group of service personnel not deployed to the Gulf War.
   Method Studies of military personnel deployed to the Gulf published between 1990 and 2001 were identified from electronic databases. Reference lists and websites were searched and key researchers were contacted for information. A total of 2296 abstracts and 409 complete articles were reviewed and data were extracted independently by two members of the research team.
   Results The prevalence of psychiatric disorder in 20 studies of Gulf War veterans was compared with the prevalence in the comparison group. Prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and common mental disorder were higher in the Gulf War veterans. Heterogeneity between studies was significant, but all reported this increased prevalence.
   Conclusions Veterans of the Persian Gulf War reported an increased prevalence of PTSD and common mental disorder compared with other active service personnel not deployed to the Gulf These findings are attributable to the increase in psychologically traumatic events in wartime.

AB  - Objective: To review the role of essential fatty acids in brain membrane function and in the genesis of psychiatric disease.
   Method: Medline databases were searched for published articles with links among the following key words: essential fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexanoic acid, eicosapentanoic acid, arachidonic acid, neurotransmission, phospholipase A(2), depression, schizophrenia, mental performance, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. Biochemistry textbooks were consulted on the role of fatty acids in membrane function, neurotransmission, and eicosanoid formation. The 3-dimensional structures of fatty acids were obtained from the Web site of the Biochemistry Department, University of Arizona (2001).
   Results: The fatty acid composition of neuronal cell membrane phospholipids reflects their intake in the diet. The degree of a fatty acid's desaturation determines its 3-dimensional structure and, thus, membrane fluidity and function. The ratio between omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in particular, influences various aspects of serotoninergic and catecholaminergic neurotransmission, as shown by studies in animal models. Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) hydrolyzes fatty acids from membrane phospholipids: liberated omega-6 PUFAs are metabolized to prostaglandins with a higher inflammatory potential, compared with those generated from the omega-3 family. Thus the activity of PLA(2) coupled with membrane fatty acid composition may play a central role in the development of neuronal dysfunction. Intervention trials in human subjects show that omega-3 fatty acids have possible positive effects in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, but more data are needed to make conclusive directives in this regard.
   Conclusion: The ratio of membrane omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs can be modulated by dietary intake. This ratio influences neurotransmission and prostaglandin formation, processes that are vital in the maintenance of normal brain function. (Can J Psychiatry 2003;48:195-203)

These distinct stages of stimulus encoding and response preparation support variable but flexible behavior.

   Method: In addition to searches of the main computerized psychiatric databases and review of relevant Commonwealth of Australia publications, the author drew on discussions with national and international colleagues in his role as convenor of the International Organization for Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry.
   Results: Physical/psychiatric comorbidity and somatization, the conditions in which consultation-liaison psychiatry specializes, are the commonest forms of psychiatric presentation in the community. They are as disabling as psychotic disorders, and comorbid depression in particular is a predictor of increased morbidity and mortality. Acknowledging this, the Second Australian National Mental Health Plan called for consultation-liaison psychiatry to be allowed to participate fully in the mental health care system. It stated that failure to define the term 'severe mental health problems and mental disorders' in the First Plan had led to some public mental health systems erroneously equating severity with diagnosis rather than level of need and disability. The call has been largely unheeded. The implication for patient care is both direct and indirect; the context created for psychiatry training by such a restricted focus is helping to perpetuate the neglect of such patients. This is a worldwide problem.
   Conclusions: Proactive involvement with consumers is required if the problem is to be redressed. At a service level, development of a seamless web of pre-admission/admission/post-discharge functions is required if patients with physical/psychiatric comorbidity and somatoform disorders are to receive effective care, and consultation-liaison psychiatry services are to be able to demonstrate efficacy. Focus on comorbidity in the Australian Third National Mental Health Plan may force resolution of the current problems.

AB  - The elucidation of the human genome presents a challenge for psychiatry-determining the impact of thousands of genes on brain functions relevant to mental disorders. For both historical and practical reasons, the mouse has become the mammal of choice for applying molecular genetic approaches to gene function. A working draft of the mouse genome has led to estimates that a mouse version may be identified for 99% of human genes. In accord with their genomic homologies, humans and mice share numerous features of brain organization and behavioral responses to many pharmacological agents. Technologies enabling the precise experimental manipulation of the mouse genome provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring genetic contributions to the regulation of complex behavior and to the pathophysiology and treatment of psychiatric disease. The formidable array of mouse molecular genetic tools are applied for two general strategies: 1) exploring the function of particular genes by generating lines of mice with precise genetic alterations and 2) searching broadly for those genes that regulate a particular biological trait of interest. Essential to the effective use of these technologies is the implementation of sound strategies for discerning the impact of genetic manipulations on mouse behaviors relevant to psychiatric conditions. These approaches are having a major impact-examples relevant to psychiatric disorders are discussed. However, advances in implementing and interpreting behavioral assays have not kept pace with molecular genetic technologies. To maximize the extent to which the revolution in mammalian genetics may be effectively applied to psychiatric research, new technologies and strategies for mouse behavioral assessment must be developed.

   Method: A MEDLINE search from 1996 through spring 2002, including a review of references from relevant published articles and reports, was undertaken to identify available information on concomitant psychotropic medication for youths.
   Results: The data supporting concomitant psychotropic medication for youths are almost exclusively based on case reports and small-scale, nonblind assessments. In the mid-1990s, over 20% of out-patient youths treated in community mental health centers and over 40% of youths treated in inpatient psychiatric facilities were given concomitant psychotropic medication. The rate has since increased. Psychiatrists more than primary care physicians prescribe concomitant psychotropic medication, and they show great variability in their prescribing habits. Youths with aggressive behavior, male gender, severe emotional illness, and disabling social maladjustment are most likely to receive concomitant psychotropic medication.
   Conclusions: Substantive systematic evidence is needed to clarify this increasingly common, inadequately researched child psychopharmacologic practice.

AB  - From analyzing 100 assessments of coping, the authors critiqued strategies and identified best practices for constructing category systems. From current systems, a list of 400 ways of coping was compiled. For constructing lower order categories, the authors concluded that confirmatory factor analysis should replace the 2 most common strategies (exploratory factor analysis and rational sorting). For higher order categories, they recommend that the 3 most common distinctions (problem- vs. emotion-focused, approach vs. avoidance, and cognitive vs. behavioral) no longer be used. Instead, the authors recommend hierarchical systems of action types (e.g., proximity seeking, accommodation). From analysis of 6 such systems, 13 potential core families of coping were identified. Future steps involve deciding how to organize these families, using their functional homogeneity and distinctiveness, and especially their links to adaptive processes.

AB  - Most researchers and clinicians now agree that children and adolescents are able to develop depressive disorders, and there also appears to be consensus that developmental level has relatively little influence on the phenomenology of the depression. The present paper examines the validity of this latter assumption from methodological, theoretical, and empirical perspectives. We first review reasons why there might be developmental differences in the symptoms that define depression, and then discuss the implications and significance if such differences do or do not exist. Next, we highlight methodological and design issues relevant to the appropriate evaluation of this question. Then, we propose that this broad developmental question actually is comprised of two subquestions-one focusing on symptoms and the other focused at the syndrome level-that have not yet been clearly differentiated in the field. Finally, after conducting a meta-analysis of the current empirical literature and reviewing its limitations, recommendations are made regarding future research in this area.

AB  - Low socioeconomic status (SES) is generally associated with high psychiatric morbidity, more disability, and poorer access to health care. Among psychiatric disorders, depression exhibits a more controversial association with SES. The authors carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the magnitude, shape, and modifiers of such an association. The search found 51 prevalence studies, five incidence studies, and four persistence studies meeting the criteria. A random effects model was applied to the odds ratio of the lowest SES group compared with the highest, and meta-regression was used to assess the dose-response relation and the influence of covariates. Results indicated that low-SES individuals had higher odds of being depressed (odds ratio = 1.81, p < 0.001), but the odds of a new episode (odds ratio = 1.24, p = 0.004) were lower than the odds of persisting depression (odds ratio = 2.06, p < 0.001). A dose-response relation was observed for education and income. Socioeconomic inequality in depression is heterogeneous and varies according to the way psychiatric disorder is measured, to the definition and measurement of SES, and to contextual features such as region and time. Nonetheless, the authors found compelling evidence for socioeconomic inequality in depression. Strategies for tackling inequality in depression are needed, especially in relation to the course of the disorder.

Relevant research on race and culture is reviewed because ethnic minority low-SES children are at great risk of poverty. Gender is discussed because low-SES boys have poorer general achievement than girls, while very few low-SES girls pursue careers in math- and science-related fields.

These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In AD, misfolded amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta), a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein metabolism, accumulates in the neuronal endoplasmic reticulum and extracellularly as plaques. In contrast, in PD and DLB cases there is abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein in neuronal cell bodies, axons, and synapses. Furthermore, in DLB, Abeta 1-42 may promote alpha-synuclein accumulation and neurodegeneration. The central event leading to synaptic and neuronal loss in these diseases is not completely clear yet; however, recent advances in the field suggest that nerve damage might result from the conversion of nontoxic monomers to toxic oligomers and protofibrils. The mechanisms by which misfolded Abeta peptide and alpha-synuclein might lead to synapse loss are currently under investigation. Several lines of evidence support the possibility that Abeta peptide and alpha-synuclein might interact to cause mitochondrial and plasma membrane damage upon translocation of protofibrils to the membranes. Accumulation of Abeta and alpha-synuclein oligomers in the mitochondrial membrane might result in the release of cytochrome C with the subsequent activation of the apoptosis cascade. Conversely, the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with AD and PD may also lead to increased membrane permeability and cytochrome C release, which promotes Abeta and alpha-synuclein oligomerization and neurodegeneration. Together, these studies suggest that the translocation of misfolded proteins to the mitochondrial membrane might play an important role in either triggering or perpetuating neurodegeneration. The insights obtained from the characterization of this process may be applied to the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in other neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. New evidence may also provide a rationale for the mitochondrial membrane as a target for therapy in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background There are few publications concerning the psychological reactions of people with learning disabilities to sexual abuse. Most significantly, there are no controlled studies and few which demonstrate a systematic approach to documenting the sequelae of trauma.
   Aims To critically review the published research in this field.
   Method A literature search in peer-reviewed psychiatry, psychology, nursing and social care journals for the years 1974 to 2001 was conducted and 25 studies were reviewed.
   Results Several studies suggest that, following sexual abuse, people with learning disabilities may experience a range of psychopathology similar to that experienced by adults and children in the general population. However, because of methodological limitations, these results are not conclusive.
   Conclusions Whether people with learning disabilities experience reactions to sexual abuse similar to the general population has yet to be explored by systematic research.
   Declaration of interest None.

AB  - This paper presents the findings of a systematic review of the current evidence for the effectiveness of stress management interventions for those working in the mental health field. Research articles from 1966 to 2000 which reported studies undertaken in the United Kingdom and which specifically identified participants as mental health workers were included in the review. Studies from other European countries and from the USA were examined as potential models of good practice. The review demonstrated that a great deal is known about the sources of stress at work, about bow to measure them and about their interaction and impact on a range of outcome indicators. What was found to be lacking was a translation of these results into practice, into research that assessed the impact of interventions that attempted to moderate, minimize or eliminate some of these stressors. Three papers were retrieved which reported. intervention strategies for workers classified as working within the mental health arena. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Cytokines (e.g. various interleukins and subfamily members, tumor necrosis factors, interferons, chemokines and growth factors) act in the brain as immunoregulators and neuromodulators. Over a decade ago, the integrative article 'Immunoregulators in the Nervous System' (Neurosci Biobehav Rev 1991; 15:185-215) provided a comprehensive framework of pivotal issues on cytokines and the nervous system that recently have been extensively studied. Cytokine profiles in the brain, including cytokine generation and action, have been studied in multiple models associated with neuropathophysiological conditions. These include: (1) acute conditions and disorders such as stroke (cerebral ischemia or infarction and intracranial hemorrhage), traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and acute neuropathies; (2) chronic neurodegenerative disorders and chronic conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain, epilepsy and chronic neuropathies; (3) brain infections, including bacterial meningitis and encephalitis; (4) brain tumors; (5) neuroimmunological disorders per se, such as multiple sclerosis; (5) psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and depression; (6) neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with non-central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as peripheral cancer, liver, kidney and metabolic compromise, and peripheral infectious and inflammatory conditions; and (7) cytokine immunotherapy, which can be accompanied by neuropsychiatric manifestations when administered either via peripheral or brain routes. Cytokine profiles have also been studied in multiple animal models challenged with inflammatory, infectious, chemical, malignant and stressor insults. Essentially data show that cytokines play a pivotal role in multiple neuropathophysiological processes associated with different types of disorders and insults. Cytokine expression and action in the brain shows a different profile across conditions, but some similarities exist. Under a defined temporal sequence, cytokine involvement in neuroprotection or the induction of a deleterious pathophysiological cascade and in resolution/healing is proposed depending on the type of cytokine. In the brain, functional interactions among cytokines, balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and functional interactions with neurotransmitters and neuropeptides play a pivotal role in the overall cytokine profile, pattern of neuropathophysiological cascades, and quality and magnitude of neuropsychiatric manifestations. In this brief review various a selected cytokine-related issues with relevance to the brain are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Routine outcome assessment in adult mental health services involves the ongoing assessment of patient-level outcomes. Use of outcomes to inform treatment is widely recommended, but seldom implemented. The goals of this review were (i) to identify principles that have been proposed for implementing routine outcome assessment, (ii) to identify the full range of outcome domains that have been proposed for assessment, and (iii) to synthesize proposals for specific outcome domains into emergent categories.
   Method: A systematic review of published and unpublished research was undertaken, using electronic databases, research registers, conference proceedings, expert informants and the World Wide Web. For goal (i) studies were included that proposed principles for implementing routine outcome assessment. For goal (ii) studies were included that identified at least two patient-level outcome domains for patients using adult mental health services and made some reference to a broader literature base.
   Results: Six thousand four hundred publications matched initial search criteria. Seven distinct sets of principles for choosing patient-level outcomes were located, which showed a fair degree of consensus. Sixteen outcome domain proposals were identified, which were synthesized into seven emergent categories: wellbeing, cognition/emotion, behaviour, physical health, interpersonal, society and services.
   Conclusions: The findings from this review were used to develop a four-step method for adult mental health services wishing to implement routine outcome assessment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate demographic. clinical and symptomatologic features of the following mood disorder subtypes: bipolar disorder I (BP-I): bipolar disorder II (BP-II): major depressive disorder. recurrent (MDR); and major depressive episode. single episode (MDSE). A total of 1832 patients with mood disorders (BP-I=863, BP-II=141. MDR=708, and MDSE=120) were included in our study. The patients were assessed using structured diagnostic interviews and the operational criteria for psychotic illness checklist (n=885), the Hamilton depression rating scale (n=167), and the social adjustment scale (n=305). The BP-I patients were younger had more hospital admissions presented a more severe form of symptomatology in terms of psychotic symptoms, disorganization, and atypical features and showed less insight into their disorder than patients in the other groups. Compared with the major depressive subgroups, BP-I patients were more likely to have an earlier age at onset, an earlier first lifetime psychiatric treatment, and a greater number of illness episodes. BP-II patients had a higher suicide risk than both BP-I and MDSE patients. MDSE patients presented less severe symptomatology. lower age at observation, and a higher number of males. The retrospective approach and the selection constraints due to the inclusion criteria are the main limitations of the study. Our data support the view that BP-I disorder is quite different from the remaining mood disorders from a demographic aid clinical perspective. with BP-II disorder having an intermediate position to MDR and MDSE, that is, as a less severe disorder. This finding may help in the search for the biological basis of mood disorders. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Depression is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and its treatment includes a high percentage of the medications prescribed by physicians. Available antidepressant drugs are safe and effective, but less than half of all patients attain complete remission after therapy with a single antidepressant. Others exhibit partial, refractory or intolerant responses to treatment, emphasizing the need to discover new antidepressants. The mechanisms of action of available medications are directing the field toward new research avenues. This review highlights those areas we believe will influence the field and soon lead to better treatment.

AB  - A statistical review of published data for 37 personality and psychopathology inventories was conducted to determine whether there are dimensional structure differences between clinical and nonclinical respondents. Correlation and factor-loading matrices from multiscale inventories and from specialized measures were tested for structural invariance across populations. There was relatively consistent evidence for high levels of similarity between normal and abnormal populations both in the number of factors that exist in the data matrices and in the factor patterns. The dimensional universes of normality and abnormality are apparently the same, at least according to data derived from contemporary assessment instruments. Categorical-taxonic differences between clinical and nonclinical populations, which were not examined, may nevertheless exist within contexts of dimensional structure similarity.

AB  - Objective: Although nonadherence with the antipsychotic medication regimen is a common barrier to the effective treatment for schizophrenia, knowledge is limited about how to improve medication adherence. This systematic literature review examined psychosocial interventions for improving medication adherence, focusing on promising initiatives, reasonable standards for conducting research in this area, and implications for clinical practice.
   Method: Studies were identified by computerized searches of MEDLINE and Psych-LIT for the years between 1980 and 2000 and by manual searches of relevant bibliographies and conference proceedings. Key articles were summarized.
   Results: Thirteen (33%) of 39 identified studies reported significant intervention effects. Although interventions and family therapy programs relying on psychoeducation were common in clinical practice, they were typically ineffective. Concrete problem solving or motivational techniques were common features of successful programs. Interventions targeted specifically to problems of nonadherence were more likely to be effective (55%) than were more broadly based treatment interventions (26%). One-half (four of eight) of the successful interventions not specifically focused on nonadherence involved an array of supportive and rehabilitative community-based services.
   Conclusions: Psychoeducational interventions without accompanying behavioral components and supportive services are not likely to be effective in medication adherence in schizophrenia. Models of community care such as assertive community treatment and interventions based on principles of motivational interviewing are promising. Providing patients with concrete instructions and problem-solving strategies, such as self-monitoring tools, cues, and reinforcements, is useful. Problems in are recurring, and booster sessions needed to reinforce and consolidate gains.

AB  - A major factor in the context of evaluating depression in the elderly is the role of medical problems. With aging there is a rapid increase in the prevalence of a number of medical disorders, including cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and arthritis. In this article, we hope to bring clarity to the definition of comorbidity and then discuss a number of medical disorders as they relate to depression. We evaluate medical comorbidity as a risk factor for depression as well as the converse, that is, depression as a risk factor for medical illness. Most of the disorders that we focus on occur in the elderly, with the exception of HIV infection. This review focuses exclusively on unipolar disorder. The review summarizes the current state of the art and also makes recommendations for future directions.

AB  - With advancements in the technology of prevention and treatment of childhood anxiety disorders, information regarding our understanding of normal and abnormal child development can be enriched. Typically, research has focused on developing efficacious and effective interventions with less attention devoted to the impact this information may have on the field of developmental psychopathology. By reviewing the results of both treatment and prevention studies, several potential contributions of intervention research to the field can be explored. Results from wait-list or monitoring control groups will be reviewed, providing valuable information regarding the normal trajectory of the anxious child. Outcomes of children receiving the intervention prove that this pathway can be altered and is not impermeable. Furthermore, a review of long-term follow-up studies addresses the question of whether intervention can change the long-term trajectory of an anxiety-disordered child and prevent disorders in later life. Contributions to the etiological understanding of the anxiety disorders will also be reviewed: changes in variables considered important in the etiology and maintenance of disorder can be examined in synchronicity with changes in symptomatology following intervention. An examination of potential developmental predictors of treatment outcome will also contribute to this review, with a focus on the limitations of the current research in gaining a complete understanding of the relationship between developmental level and outcome. Directions regarding future research in the study of interventions for child and adolescent anxiety disorders will be discussed with the aim of promoting further communication between intervention research and the field of developmental psychopathology.

AB  - Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors affecting the physiology of animals. Seasonal fluctuations in temperature are of particular importance in aquatic ectotherms since their body temperature is in equilibrium with their environment. When an organism faces adverse environmental conditions, it can either remain active or enter into metabolic depression, adopting the strategy that maximises its fitness. Physiological responses to environmental stress occur at many different levels of organisation in an animal. Here, we focus on mitochondria, given their central importance in cellular energy metabolism. We contrast the thermal biology of skeletal muscle mitochondria from cold-active species with that of species that spend their winters in a metabolically depressed state. Specifically, we examine the modifications of mitochondrial properties during thermal/seasonal acclimation and examine mechanisms by which these modifications can arise. While compensatory responses to cold acclimation include increases in mitochondrial abundance, in the oxidative capacities of individual mitochondria and adjustments of ADP affinities, metabolic depression can reduce tissue levels of mitochondrial enzymes and mitochondrial proton leak rates.

Methods: A systematic review of the literature concerning transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and neurosurgery for mental disorders (NMD) was conducted using Medline and literature known to the authors. Results: A summary of each procedure is provided giving a succinct overview of efficacy, current applications and possible future indications. Conclusion: Novel and innovative physical interventions are currently being used to study brain function in health and disease. In particular, TMS has quickly established itself as a useful investigational tool and is emerging as a possible antidepressant therapy. Similarly, VNS has been applied successfully in the management of intractable epilepsy and is undergoing evaluation in the management of patients with treatment-resistant depression. DBS has shown significant promise in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and may have use in the management of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Finally, neurosurgical procedures for the treatment of mental disorders have been sufficiently refined to stage a comeback, although rigorous scientific study of their efficacy and indications is still necessary.

AB  - Coral reefs are degrading worldwide at an alarming rate. Nutrient over-enrichment is considered a major cause of this decline because degraded coral reefs generally exhibit a shift from high coral cover (low algal cover) to low coral cover with an accompanying high cover and biomass of fleshy algae. Support for such claims is equivocal at best. Critical examination of both experimental laboratory and field studies of nutrient effects on corals and coral reefs, including the Elevated Nutrient on Coral Reefs Experiment (ENCORE) enrichment experiment conducted on the Great Barrier Reef, does not support the idea that the levels of nutrient enrichment documented at anthropogenically-enriched sites can affect the physiology of corals in a harmful way, or for most cases, be the sole or major cause of shifts in coral-algal abundance. Factors other than nutrient enrichment can be significant causes of coral death and affect algal cover, and include decreased abundance of grazing fishes by fishing, and of grazing sea urchins to disease; grazing preferences of remaining grazers; temperature stress that kills coral (i.e., coral bleaching) and creates more open substrate for algal colonization; sedimentation stress that can weaken adult corals and prevent coral recruitment; coral diseases that may be secondary to coral bleaching; and outbreaks of coral predators and sea urchins that may be secondary effects of overfishing. Any factor that leads to coral death or reduces levels of herbivory will leave more substrate open for algal colonization or make the effects of even low-level enrichment more severe. Factors that contribute to an imbalance between production and consumption will result in community structure changes similar to those expected from over-enrichment. Over-enrichment can be and has been the cause of localized coral reef degradation, but the case for widespread effects is not substantiated.

KW  - PERSISTENCE
AB  - The Plummers Island, Maryland, area has one of the more intensively studied biotas in the world. Abundant historical data on fishes of the Potomac River and tributaries, dating from the late 1800s and vouchered by museum specimens, in combination with sampling conducted in this investigation and by other recent investigators, has facilitated a definitive historical analysis of fish diversity in the region. Extensive changes in the integrity of that fauna through both extirpation of native species and addition of non-natives are documented. Eighty-six species have been recorded from the study area. It had a moderately diverse native fish fauna of 56-61 species of which 40 maintain viable populations today. Up to 30 non-native species were naturalized in the area for a time, or repeatedly introduced, and 22 remain. Enigmatic distribution patterns in the Fall Line ecotonal area may owe to a combination of gradient profiles in tributaries and Pleistocene history. There are indications that the C & O Canal may have played a role in dispersal of lowland species through and beyond the study area. These complex distributions have implications regarding the applicability of regional indices of biotic integrity criteria to studies of these streams. Sampling protocols and indices of biotic integrity, strongly based in historic data and tailored to individual streams, were devised to provide an easily repeatable method for present and future monitoring of fish assemblages and assessing stream health in Potomac tributaries in the study area. Those indices currently indicate depressed biotic integrity in these streams and generally corroborate declines documented in the historical analysis. It is recommended that these sampling procedures be repeated at future dates to monitor trends and to provide guidance for environmental planners.

AB  - The recreational drug "ecstasy" (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA) is widely used by young people throughout the world. Experimental studies indicate that MDMA damages serotonergic neurons in animals and possibly in humans. Repeated use may induce long-term neurotoxic effects, with cognitive and behavioral implications. We reviewed both the preclinical and the clinical literature to assess the evidence for persistent neuropsychiatric sequelae in humans. We focused on studies of chronic recreational use and reports of presence or absence of neurological, psychiatric, and psychological problems related to MDMA exposure. These investigations show repeated use of ecstasy to be associated with sleep, mood, and anxiety disturbances, elevated impulsiveness, memory deficits, and attention problems, which may persist for up to 2 years after cessation. In a subset of humans, particularly adolescents, depletion of serotonin by MDMA use may hasten or enhance vulnerability to a wide array of neuropsychiatric problems. Together, the studies reviewed provide substantial evidence that MDMA causes neuronal damage in animals and humans. Additional research is necessary to determine whether the MDMA-induced destruction of serotonergic neurons can have long-term and possibly permanent neuropsychiatric consequences in humans.

AB  - Objective: The frequency of compulsory admission varies widely across Europe. Although there has been some research on a nation-wide level, no work has been done to compare mental health legislation in different countries in relation to detention rates and to patients' perception of hospital detention.
   Method: Databases and government statistics were searched for regional, national and European data. Legal frameworks were compared and reviewed in relation to patients' and professionals' views.
   Results: Nearly 20-fold variations in detention rates were found in different parts of Europe. Criteria for detention of the mentally ill are broadly similar when it comes to patients at risk to themselves or others. However different rules apply for involuntary treatment in the interest of the patient's health.
   Conclusion: Variations in detention rates across Europe appear to be influenced by professionals' ethics and attitudes, sociodemographic variables, the public's preoccupation about risk arising from mental illness and the respective legal framework.

AB  - This paper is a research and journalistic work that summarizes and synthesizes the scientific development of the physiology of plants in the American tropics, also known as the Neotropics. It contains the contributions of numerous biologists interested in the physiology of tropical plants. The fabulous structural and functional diversity of tropical forests is still the major driver of research in this field. Classical physiological work involving tropical plants, such as the discovery of C4 photosynthesis in sugarcane, is invoked to exemplify the historical and current importance of physiological research in the tropics, and its applications in agriculture, forestry and conservation. An historical background describing the early and more recent development of a tradition on the physiological study of tropical plants is followed by a summary of the research conducted on the physiology of tropical crops. Common areas of interest and influence between the fields of crop physiology and plant ecophysiology are identified and exemplified with problems on the environmental physiology of crops like coffee and cassava. The physiology of tropical forest plants is discussed in terms of its contributions to general plant physiological knowledge in areas such as photosynthetic metabolism and plant water relations. Despite the impressive technical advances achieved during the past decade, the importance of continuous development of appropriate instrumentation to study and measure the physiology of plants in situ is stressed. Although the basic metabolic processes that underlie the mechanisms of plant responses to the environment are probably highly conserved and qualitatively similar among tropical and temperate plants, it is also apparent that tropical plants exhibit metabolic peculiarities. These include aspects of photosynthetic metabolism, phloem transport physiology, sensitivity to low temperatures, reproduction, responses to climatic seasonality, and a large variety of biotic interactions. Old and new paradigms are examined in light of recent evidence and comparative studies, and the conceptual and technical advances needed to foster the development of tropical plant ecophysiology are identified.

AB  - Dopaminergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic nuclei form the trimonoamine modulating system (TMMS). This system modulates emotional/motivational activities mediated by the limbic circuitry, where glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Two main concepts are the basis of this review. First, since 1950 and the discovery of the antipsychotic activity of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist chlorpromazine, it appears that drugs that can modulate the TMMS possess therapeutic psychiatric properties. Second, the concept of glutamate/trimonoamine imbalance in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop that has been so successful in explaining the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease has been applied in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This review will focus on the complex interactions between the fast synaptic glutamatergic transmission and the TMMS in specific parts of the limbic lobe and we will try to link these interactions to some psychiatric disorders, mainly depression, schizophrenia and drug addiction.

AB  - Objective: Over recent years transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become widely applied in the study of neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this article is to review the application of TMS as an investigative tool and as a potential therapeutic modality in psychiatric disorders.
   Method: A comprehensive literature review.
   Results: When applied as an investigative tool, TMS provides innovative ways to directly study the excitability of the cortex, cortical regional connectivity, the plasticity of brain responses and cognitive functioning in illness and disease states. A number of studies suggest the potential of treatment with TMS in disease states. especially in patients with depression, although difficulties exist with the interpretation of the published literature.
   Conclusion: TMS has a considerable role in neuro psychiatric research. It appears to have considerable potential as a therapeutic tool in depression, and perhaps a role in several other disorders, although widespread application requires larger trials and establishment of sustained response.

AB  - Anxiety disorders among children are quite common with prevalence rates estimated at up to 20%. Although somewhat neglected in the past, recent empirical studies have increased our understanding of childhood anxiety significantly. Along with the development of empirically supported treatments, the assessment of anxiety among youth has been refined, with more sophisticated and methodologically sound measures developed and revised within the last decade. In addition, the field has benefited from an increased awareness of the importance of systematic and standardized assessment procedures for both diagnosis and treatment of anxiety in children. The primary aims of this article are to review several important considerations particular to the assessment of child anxiety, and to describe and review the most commonly used procedures and instruments for the assessment of anxiety in children.

AB  - Objective: While first-episode (FE) psychosis has become an important field of research, FE affective psychoses, and mania in particular, have been relatively neglected. This paper summarizes current knowledge about FE mania and explores the potential for early intervention.
   Method: The main computerized psychiatric literature databases were accessed.
   Results: When functional as well as symptomatic variables are considered, the outcome of mania is not as good as was formerly believed, a characteristic which is already present from the first episode. Various factors (lower socio-economic status, younger age at onset of illness, poor adherence to treatment, presence of comorbidity) have been identified as possible predictors of poor outcome. The prognostic value of the presence of psychotic symptoms and their congruence to mood, as well as the diagnostic subgroup, is less well established. This literature review also reveals striking similarities between manic and schizophreniform first episodes. Poor functional outcome in a significant proportion of patients following the first episode, high risk of suicide, high prevalence of comorbid diagnoses, worse outcome with a younger age at onset and with longer delay until treatment is initiated, and finally early presence of neuro-anatomical changes, are observed in both syndromes.
   Conclusions: This pattern justifies the development of early intervention strategies for FE manic patients and supports more exploratory research to identify prodromal symptoms, which might ultimately lead to even earlier focus on preventive interventions.

   Method: A systematic literature search focusing on predictive studies was carried out from 1980 to early 2001 using Medline, Embase and PsychInfo .
   Results: The empirical findings for the most part support clinical impressions of the relation of stressors to depression but at the same time provide some clearer understanding in relation to differences of stressor impact on depression type and on index episode, relapse or recurrence. Twin studies now provide the strongest evidence of the relative magnitude of effect of environmental stressors and genetic factors: the former explains at least as much of the variance in depression as our genes.
   Conclusions: Continuing research into life events and depression have been fruitful especially those studies assessing the effect of stressors in combination with other aetio-logical variables such as genetic factors.

AB  - Objective: A longstanding belief among many clinicians is that patients with depression and comorbid personality pathology have a worse response to standard depression treatment. This presents potentially significant treatment implications, since personality pathology in depressed patients appears to be common.
   Method: PsyclNFO and MEDLINE were systematically searched for studies relating personality to treatment outcome. Over 50 studies were obtained and grouped according to the method used to assess personality pathology.
   Results: High neuroticism scores generally predicted worse outcome, especially over long term follow-up. Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire scores did not have a consistent relationship to treatment outcome despite some promising initial findings. Most studies involved patients with comorbid personality disorders; these studies produced conflicting results. Other measures of personality pathology produced an array of findings ranging from a moderately worse outcome to no difference.
   Conclusions: Whether or not personality pathology significantly worsens outcome in patients with major depression appears to depend on study design, since the rate of personality pathology varies markedly depending on how it is measured. In addition, depressed patients with personality pathology appear less likely to receive adequate treatment in uncontrolled studies. Finally, studies rarely control for depression characteristics (e.g., chronicity, severity) that may influence outcome and be related to personality pathology. Overall, the best-designed studies reported the least effect of personality pathology on depression treatment outcome. Clinically, this suggests that comorbid personality pathology should not be seen as an impediment to good treatment response.

AB  - Objective: Social phobia has in recent years been recognized as a considerable public health concern. This paper presents an overview of community studies that have estimated the prevalence of social phobia, its subtypes, and specific social fears in the adult general population. Sociodemographic findings are also summarized.
   Method: Forty-three epidemiological studies from 1980 to the present were located in electronic databases and by complementary searches of citations in journal articles and book chapters.
   Results: Recent surveys estimate the lifetime prevalence of social phobia at about 7-13% in Western countries. However, prevalence rates vary considerably and are prone to several influencing methodological variables such as the diagnostic criteria, diagnostic threshold, assessment method, number of situational probes, and prevalence period selected by the researcher.
   Conclusion: Although there are difficulties in delineating social phobia from subsyndromal social anxiety or shyness, social phobia is even when narrowly defined remarkably common in the general population.

AB  - Objective: Antidepressant efficacy trials use multiple exclusion criteria that are intended primarily to maximize differences between the drug and placebo. These exclusion criteria were implemented prior to having undergone rigorous testing, however, and it is unclear whether they accomplish their intended goal. The authors review the current state of knowledge about treatment response rates in individuals who are typically excluded from antidepressant efficacy trials.
   Method: After reviewing 31 antidepressant efficacy trials published between 1994 and 1998, the authors identified 10 commonly used exclusion criteria. A computerized MEDLINE search and a manual search were used to identify studies evaluating the efficacy of antidepressant medications in populations of subjects typically excluded from antidepressant efficacy trials.
   Results: Three exclusion criteria-short episode duration, mild severity of illness, and positive response during the placebo lead-in phase-are used primarily to reduce placebo response rates. Preliminary evidence suggests that, of those three criteria, only a short episode duration has been associated with less robust differences between drug and placebo response rates. The seven other exclusion criteria, including various psychiatric comorbidities, Iona. duration of illness, medical comorbidity, and prior nonresponse to treatment, are used because individuals who meet those criteria are believed to have lower response rates to somatic therapy. Although such individuals are often found to have lower response rates to somatic therapy, they also appear to have lower response rates to placebo, and there is little evidence to suggest that drug-placebo differences are any less robust in these individuals.
   Conclusions: Many of the standard exclusion criteria currently used in antidepressant efficacy trials may not be achieving their intended goal of maximizing drug-placebo differences. The practice of excluding subjects with particular clinical profiles, which greatly reduces the generalizability of antidepressant efficacy trials, appears to lack empirical support.

AB  - There has been substantial evidence for more than three decades that the major psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and alcoholism have a strong genetic basis. During the past 15 years considerable effort has been expended in trying to establish the genetic loci associated with susceptibility to these and other mental disorders using principally linkage analysis. Despite this, only a handful of specific genes have been identified, and it is now generally recognized that further advances along these lines will require the analysis of literally hundreds of affected individuals and their families. Fortunately, the emergence in the past three years of a number of new approaches and more effective tools has given new hope to those engaged in the search for the underlying genetic and environmental factors involved in causing these illnesses, which collectively are among the most serious in all societies. Chief among these new tools is the availability of the entire human genome sequence and the prospect that within the next several years the entire complement of human genes will be known and the functions of most of their protein products elucidated. In the meantime the search for susceptibility loci is being facilitated by the availability of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and by the beginning of haplotype mapping, which tracks the distribution of clusters of SNPs that segregate as a group. Together with high throughput DNA sequencing, microarrays for whole genome scanning, advances in proteomics, and the development of more sophisticated computer programs for analyzing sequence and association data, these advances hold promise of greatly accelerating the search for the genetic basis of most mental illnesses while, at the same time, providing molecular targets for the development of new and more effective therapies.

AB  - Studying the behavior of genetic background strains provides important information for the design and interpretation of cognitive phenotypes in mutant mice. Our experiments examined the performance of three commonly used strains (C57BL/6J, 129S6, DBA/2J) on three behavioral tests for learning and memory that measure very different forms of memory, and for which there is a lack of data on strain differences. In the social transmission of food preference test (STFP) all three strains demonstrated intact memory for an odorcued food that had been sampled on the breath of a cagemate 24 hours previously. While C57BL/6J and 129S6 mice showed good trace fear conditioning, DBA/2J mice showed a profound deficit on trace fear conditioning. In the Barnes maze test for spatial memory, the 129S6 strain showed poor probe trial performance, relative to C57BL/6J mice. Comparison of strains for open field exploratory activity and anxiety-like behavior suggests that poor Barnes maze performance reflects low exploratory behavior, rather than a true spatial memory deficit, in 129S6 mice. This interpretation is supported by good Morris water maze performance in 129S6 mice. These data support the use of a C57BL/6J background for studying memory deficits in mutant mice using any of these tasks, and the use of a 129S6 background in all but the Barnes maze. A DBA/2J background may be particularly useful for investigating the genetic basis of emotional memory using fear conditioning.

AB  - Background: It is well known that intense and prolonged stress can produce cognitive impairments and hippocampal damage and increase noradrenergic activity in humans. This study investigated the hypothesis that chronic psychosocial stress would affect behavior, drug sensitivity, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, in rats. The work provides a novel connection between animal and human studies by evaluating the effects of stress on a rat's response to Yohimbine, an a, adrenergic receptor antagonist.
   Methods: Rats were exposed to a cat for 5 weeks and randomly housed with a different group of cohorts each day (psychosocial stress). The effects of the stress manipulations were then assessed on open field behavior, spatial learning and memory in the radial ann water maze and the behavioral response to a low dose of yohimbine (1.5 mg/kg).
   Results: Stressed rats displayed impaired habituation to a novel environment, heightened anxiety, and increased sensitivity to yohimbine. In addition, the stressed rats exhibited impaired learning and memory.
   Conclusions: There are commonalities between the current findings on stressed rats and from studies on traumatized people. Thus, psychosocial stress manipulations in rats may yield insight into the basis of cognitive and neuroendocrine disturbances that commonly occur in people with anxiety disorders.

   Methods: A computer-based literature search of PsycINFO and Medline was conducted. Empirical studies were reviewed to document the psychosocial impact of infertility and its treatment on the families involved in terms of quality of parenting, family functioning, and child development.
   Results: Several common findings appeared across the studies reviewed. With regard to quality of parenting and family functioning, mothers of children born using assisted reproduction report less parenting stress and more positive mother- and father-child relationships than mothers of naturally conceived children. In most cases, no statistically significant differences in child functioning in terms of emotions, behavior, self-esteem, or perceptions of family relationship have been reported.
   Conclusions: The summary findings are positive and reassuring for parents and their children born after assisted reproduction. This critique of the published literature provides interpretative and methodological refinements for future research.

AB  - Objective: To review systematically the psychosocial risk factors for poststroke depression.
   Methods: Medline was searched using the key words "poststroke depression" (PSD) for the period January 1, 1966, to June 30, 2000; using the key words "cerebrovascular disease" and "depression" it was searched from June 1, 1996, to June 30, 2000. Corollary articles were obtained from the bibliographies. Inclusion criteria were as follows: original research in French or English; prospective, case-control or cross-sectional study design; assessment of PSD in the first 6 months following the stroke; an acceptable definition of depression; an acceptable definition of stroke; and at least one psychosocial risk factor. Interrater reliability was tested for the selection and quality of the articles. A qualitative risk factor analysis was conducted
   Results: The risk-factors most consistently associated with PSD are a past history of depression, past personal psychiatric history, dysphasia, functional impairments, living alone, and poststroke social isolation. Risk factors not associated with PSD are dementia and cognitive impairment. Controversial risk factors are age, socioeconomic status (SES), prior social distress, dependency in regard to activities of daily living (ADL), and sex.
   Conclusions: Over approximately 30 years, some 25 qualitative studies have addressed psychosocial risk factors for PSD. Further studies should aim for quantitative analysis. The results suggest that identifying psychiatric history and preventing social deterioration and impairment should be part of multidisciplinary efforts to care for poststroke patients.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Agriculture funded the Management Systems Evaluation Area (MSEA) research project in 1990 to evaluate effectiveness of present fanning systems in controlling nitrate N in water resources and to develop improved technologies for farming systems. This paper summarizes published research results of a five-year effort. Most research is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of farming system components (fertilizer, tillage, water control, cropping systems, and soil and weather variability). The research results show that current soil nitrate tests reliably predict fertilizer N needed to control environmental and economic risks for crop production. A corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] rotation usually controls risk better than continuous corn, but both may result in unacceptable nitrate leaching. Reduced tillage, especially ridge-till, is better than clean tillage in reducing risk. The drainage controls nitrate in ground water, but discharge may increase nitrate in surface waters. Sprinkler irrigation systems provide better water control than furrow irrigation because quantity and spatial variability of applied water is reduced. Present farming systems have two major deficiencies: (i) entire fields are managed uniformly, ignoring inherent soil variability within a field; and (ii) N fertilizer rates and many field practices are selected assuming normal weather for the coming season. Both deficiencies can contribute to nitrate leaching in parts of most fields.

AB  - The contribution of the cerebellum to the modulation of cognition and emotion is facilitated by the connections between the cerebellum and brain structures known to be associated with a wide array of non-motor behaviors. The cerebellum has interconnections with brainstem and thalamic reticular systems that subserve arousal. Autonomic activity is supported by the reciprocal interconnections with the hypothalamus. Limbic and paralimbic connections include the hypothalamus, septal region, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus. Associative connections consist of both feedforward and feedback limbs. The basilar pons receives inputs from the prefrontal, posterior parietal, superior temporal, parahippocampal, and cingulate cortices, as well as from the sensorimotor cortices. This information is conveyed from the pons to cerebellum, before it is relayed back via thalamus to the associative and paralimbic regions of the cerebral cortex. The anatomical arrangement of segregated loops of cerebral cortical connections stands in contrast to the cerebellar cortical architecture that is essentially uniform. This has theoretical and clinical ramifications. It is the anatomical basis for the dysmetria of thought hypothesis that postulates a universal cerebellar transform, in which the cerebellum performs its unique computation in a topographically precise manner on diverse streams of information relating to almost all aspects of behavior including cognition and emotion. It provides an anatomic basis for the observations of cerebellar activation by cognitive and affective paradigms in functional neuroimaging experiments. It helps explain the clinical phenomena that characterize the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome, and it provides an anatomic basis for a causal relationship between cerebellar pathology and psychiatric and neurobehavioral conditions. Knowledge of these anatomical pathways is critical to the further development of hypotheses, experimental approaches, and clinical questions that can advance the understanding of the contribution of the cerebellum to cognition and to disorders of intellect and emotion.

AB  - Objective: The authors conducted meta-analyses of data from family and twin studies of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to explore the roles of genetic and environmental factors in their etiology.
   Method: MEDLINE searches were performed to identify potential primary studies of these disorders. Data from studies that met inclusion criteria were incorporated into meta-analyses that estimated summary statistics of aggregate familial risk and heritability for each disorder.
   Results: For family studies, odds ratios predicting association of illness in first-degree relatives with affection status of the proband (disorder present or absent),A,ere homogeneous across studies for all disorders. The calculated summary odds ratios ranged from 4 to 6, depending on the disorder. Only for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder could the authors identify more than one large-scale twin study for meta-analysis. These yielded heritabilities of 0.43 for panic disorder and 0.32 for generalized anxiety disorder. For panic disorder, the remaining variance in liability could be attributed primarily to nonshared environment. For generalized anxiety disorder, this was true for men, but for women, a potentially significant role for common familial environment was also seen.
   Conclusions: Panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, and OCD all have significant familial aggregation. For panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and probably phobias, genes largely explain this familial aggregation; the role of family environment in generalized anxiety disorder is uncertain. The role of nonshared environmental experience is significant, underscoring the importance of identifying putative environmental risk factors that predispose individuals to anxiety.

   Method: They searched the MEDLINE and PsycLIT databases from 1950 to 2000 by using a variety of key words and subjects.
   Results: More than 400 articles were identified, ranging from empirical studies to philosophical articles. Many identified a perceptual gap between primary care and psychiatry as the basis for problems of contextual relevance in psychiatric education for primary care practitioners. There were few empirical studies; most reported only results of satisfaction surveys or simple tests of knowledge. Longterm outcomes were less positive; there were important negative findings.
   Conclusions: An extensive literature published over five decades identified a strong need for ongoing mental health training for primary care physicians. Helpful recommendations exist related to objectives, methods, and evaluation. However, there are organizational and attitudinal issues that may be equally or more important for educators to consider than the selection of educational methods.

AB  - Background. Despite its well-established efficacy and its increasing use, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains a controversial treatment. Lack of clarity in the issues related to its use in special patient populations (for example, in children, in adolescents, in pregnant women, in the elderly, and in the medically ill) often contributes to the debate about the use of ECT.
   Method. The literature on ECT use in special patient populations is reviewed, together with the commonly associated high-risk medical conditions in clinical practice. Specific reference is made in each case to the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the procedure.
   Results: Much of the literature surveyed consists of case studies, although a few controlled trials are available. In general, ECT use in special populations is relatively safe and extremely effective. In small case series, ECT use in children and adolescents is effective but requires further systematic study. In pregnant women, ECT is very effective, and with proper medical care, it is relatively safe in all trimesters of pregnancy, as well as in the postpartum period. The frail elderly are particularly good candidates for ECT because they are often unresponsive to or intolerant of psychotropic medication. Medical conditions that should receive particular attention during a course of ECT are disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and respiratory system. With modern anesthesia techniques and careful medical management of each high-risk patient, most can successfully complete a course of ECT. The process of obtaining informed consent also requires special consideration in this group of patients because their capacity to consent to treatment may be compromised.
   Conclusions: With careful attention to each patient's medical and anesthesia needs, ECT is an effective and relatively safe procedure in high-risk special patient populations.

AB  - The aim of this comprehensive review was to identify and critically review all published studies of the treatment of postnatal depression, including those who would be excluded from systematic reviews because of their stringent inclusion criteria. A search of the electronic databases Medline, PsychLit, Sociofile, CINAHL, COPAC and that of published books held by the British Library was carried out in 2000, using the key words: postnatal depression; postpartum depression; puerperal depression; and treatment. The search strategy was limited to English language references using human subjects from 1964 to 2000. A very broad definition of postnatal depression was used and papers were included if they had clearly defined their main purpose as the treatment, as opposed to the prevention, of postnatal depression. Studies of postpartum blues and puerperal psychosis were excluded. This search strategy identified 30 articles. Copies of relevant papers were obtained and the authors independently read and critiqued the published articles using critical appraisal criteria designed specifically for this narrative review. The reviews were combined, clarification was sought from authors and disagreements were discussed until agreement was reached. Treatment approaches were categorized as: pharmacological; psychological & psychodynamic; pharmacological & psychological; social support & relaxation; and hormonal. The methodological limitations of these studies means that the efficacy of these treatment approaches have not been clearly established and there is very little good evidence available on which to make policy or practice recommendations; thus, further work in this area is warranted.

AB  - At the beginning of the 1970s, different studies reported behavioural disturbances after the intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the rat. Despite the fact that this neurotoxic agent degenerates brain dopaminergic (DA-) cells, its potential utility to produce a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) was never systematically studied because the aphagia and adipsia were often observed. In the present study: a procedure that induces a marked DA-cell degeneration that bypasses these and other undesirable complications of icy injection of 6-OHDA is reported. Lesioned animals (50-500 mug of 6-OHDA) showed a persistent motor syndrome composed of hypokinesia, purposeless chewing and catalepsy. The intensity of motor signs was dose-dependent, and recovered partially after administration of DA-receptor agonists, exposure to sensorial stimuli and stress, three procedures that reduce motor dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease (PD). Lesioned animals showed bilateral and symmetrical midbrain DA-cell degeneration with the highest cell-loss in A9 group (substantia nigra), followed by A8 (retrorubral field) and A10 (ventral tegmental area) groups. The similarity between the behavioural syndrome and the topographical profile of cell-loss after icy injection of 6-OHDA in rats and the clinical and neuropathological features of PD indicates that this may be a convenient animal model of PD particularly useful for checking in rats the possible efficacy of new anti-parkinsonian drugs on specific parameters of motor dysfunctions.

AB  - Childhood abuse is an important public health problem; however, little is known about the effects of abuse on the brain and neurobiological development. This article reviews the behavioral and biological consequences of childhood abuse and places them in a developmental context. Animal studies show that both positive and negative events early in life can influence neurobiological development in unique ways. Early stressors such as maternal separation result in lasting effects on stress-responsive neurobiological systems, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and noradrenergic systems. These studies also implicate a brain area involved in learning and memory, the hippocampus. in the long-term consequences of early stress. Clinical studies of patients with a history of abuse also implicate dysfunction in the HPA axis and the noradrenergic and hippocampal systems however, there are multiple questions related to chronicity of stress, developmental epoch at the time of the stressor, presence of stress-related psychiatric disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, and psychological factors mediating the response to trauma that need to be addressed in this field of research. Understanding the effects of abuse on the development of the brain and neurobiology will nevertheless have important treatment and policy implications.

AB  - Background Over the past 10 years the technique of tryptophan depletion has been used increasingly as a tool for studying brain serotonergic systems.
   Aims To review the technique of tryptophan depletion and its current status as a tool for investigating psychiatric disorders.
   Method Systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies.
   Results Tryptophan depletion produces a marked reduction in plasma tryptophan and consequently brain serotonin (5-HT) synthesis and release. In healthy volunteers the effects of tryptophan depletion are influenced by the characteristics of the subjects and include some mood lowering, some memory impairment and an increase in aggression. In patients with depression tryptophan depletion tends to result in no worsening of depression in untreated subjects but a relapse in those who have responded to antidepressants (particularly serotonergic agents). In panic disorder the results are similar.
   Conclusions The findings that tryptophan depletion produces a relapse of symptoms in patients with depression and panic disorder who have responded to treatment with antidepressants suggests that enhanced 5-HT function is important in maintaining response in these conditions.

AB  - Objective: Emily Dickinson, arguably one of America's foremost poets, is characterized by critics as able to capture extreme emotional states in her greatest work. Recent dating of her poems offers the periodicity of her writing as a behavior that can be examined for patterns of affective illness that may relate to these states.
   Method: The bulk of Dickinson's work was written during a clearly defined 8-year period when she was age 28-35. Poems written during that period, 1858-1865, were grouped by year and examined for annual and seasonal distribution.
   Results: Her 8-year period of productivity was marked by two 4-year phases. The first shows a seasonal pattern characterized by greater creative output in spring and summer and a lesser output during the fall and winter. This pattern was interrupted by an emotional crisis that marked the beginning of the second phase, a 4-year sustained period of greatly heightened productivity and the emergence of a revolutionary poetic style.
   Conclusions: These data, supported by excerpts from letters to friends during this period of Dickinson's Life, demonstrate seasonal changes in mood during the first four years of major productivity, followed by a sustained elevation of creative energy, mood, and cognition during the second. They suggest, as supported by family history, a bipolar pattern previously described in creative artists.

AB  - The possibility of a causal influence of emotional stress, especially of stressful life events, on the course of various skin diseases has long been postulated. Clinical wisdom and experience, as well as many anecdotal observations and uncontrolled case series, support this opinion. We reviewed the available evidence on the role of stressful life events in triggering or exacerbating skin diseases. The role of stressful events in vitiligo, lichen planus, acne, pemphigus and seborrhoeic dermatitis was either controversial or insufficiently explored. The role of stressful events in psoriasis, alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis and urticaria was apparently clearer. However, only a few studies met acceptable methodological standards for stress measurement. Also, few studies considered common potential confounding factors (e.g. age, duration of illness, familial factors), and no study controlled adequately for the influence of other crucial factors (e.g. discontinuation of treatment, seasonal effects). Adding that the large majority of studies were retrospective, it seems wise to conclude that only preliminary evidence has been published so far on the role of stressful life events in bringing on or worsening any dermatological disease. Further research is mandatory, either in the form of prospective studies or, more feasibly, of well-designed case-control studies with adequate statistical power. Future studies should also pay more attention to protective as well as vulnerability factors in stressful events. Further, it would be important to investigate other sources of psychological stress, such as ch ron ic stress and everyday stress. Measuring stress appraisal, although difficult, would also be important. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

   Method: We performed a Medline search to identify the literature data base available on double-blind, open-label studies and case series on the use of lamotrigine to treat BD.
   Results: Three double-blind studies, 3 open-label studies, and 2 case series have been conducted to date (n = 401 patients). Most patients were either nonresponders or partial responders to other mood stabilizers. Overall, 50% to 83% of the patients responded to lamotrigine; doses in the studies ranged from 50 to 400 mg daily. Switching to mania while on 200 mg of lamotrigine or more was extremely rare, and there were no reports of serious adverse effects during the study periods.
   Conclusion: Lamotrigine is proving to be an effective agent in the treatment of BD and may be useful for patients who have not responded to other mood stabilizers.

AB  - Drug-induced psychiatric conditions are a common and severe problem in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease. Psychotic symptoms are the most frequent reason for nursing home placement of patients with Parkinson's disease. The psychotic symptoms seem to present themselves in a continuum where alterations in dreaming patterns often precede visual hallucinations, which often progress into delusional syndromes and, finally, into confusional organic syndromes. When evaluating a patient on dopaminergic treatment, it is important to inquire systematically about abnormal sleep related phenomena, for these are important clues in the early detection of psychotic symptoms. The pathogenesis of the psychotic symptoms is not yet fully understood but complex adaptations of various neurotransmitter systems seem to be involved. In the treatment of these drug-induced psychotic symptoms, the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine plays an important role. Drug-induced mania, hypersexuality and anxiety although less frequent than the psychotic symptoms, also occur as a complication of dopaminergic treatment. Depressive symptoms, although common in Parkinson's disease, are less likely to occur as a side effect of the drug treatment.

AB  - Depression is a common illness, frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders or medical illness. Comorbidity is associated with a poorer outcome for the patient, more severe symptoms and risk of suicide. The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor paroxetine has proven efficacy in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder. The paper examines the role of paroxetine monotherapy in the treatment of depressed patients with comorbid anxiety, and reviews the use of paroxetine in the treatment of depression in patients suffering concurrent medical illnesses.

AB  - Objective: In this paper we review critically the current status of neurocognitive studies in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
   Method: CFS literature was monitored as part of a large research project which involved several neuropsychological and psychopathological studies. The literature survey was the result of several consecutive searches on Medline and PsycInfo databases.
   Results: The neurocognitive studies are reviewed in terms of scientificaly accepted aspects of attention and memory. In addition, we review possible explanations for cognitive dysfunction in CFS. This is preceded with a discussion of the methodological limitations that are considered to explain inconcistencies across neuropsychological studies in CFS.
   Conclusion: The current research shows that slowed processing speed, impaired working memory and poor learning of information are the most prominent features of cognitive dysfunctioning in patients with CFS. Furthermore, to this date no specific pattern of cerebral abnormalities has been found that uniquely characterizes CFS patients. There is no overwhelming evidence that fatigue is related to cognitive performance in CFS, and researchers agree that their performance on neuropsychological tasks is unlikely to be accounted solely by the severity of the depression and anxiety.

AB  - Background: Functional brain imaging studies in unipolar lar and secondary depression have generally found decreased prefrontal cortical activity, but in bipolar disorders findings have been more variable.
   Methods: Forty-three medication-free, treatment-resistant, predominantly rapid-cycling bipolar disorder patients and 43 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects had cerebral glucose metabolism assessed using positron emission tomography and fluorine-18-deoxyglucose.
   Results: Depressed bipolar disorder patients compared to control subjects had decreased global, absolute prefrontal and anterior paralimbic cortical, and increased normalized subcortical (ventral striatum, thalamus, right amygdala) metabolism. Degree of depression correlated negatively with absolute prefrontal and paralimbic cortical, and positively with normalized anterior paralimbic subcortical metabolism, Increased normalized cerebello-posterior cortical metabolism,vas seen in all patient subgroups compared to control subjects, independent of mood state, disorder subtype, or cycle frequency.
   Conclusions: In bipolar depression, we observed a pattern of prefrontal hypometabolism, consistent with observations in primary unipolar and secondary depression, suggesting this is part of a common neural substrate for depression independent of etiology, In contrast, the cerebello-posterior cortical normalized hypermetabolism seen in all bipolar subgroups (including euthymic) suggests a possible congenital or acquired trait abnormality. The degree to which these findings in treatment-resistant, predorninantly rapid-cycling patients pertain to community samples remains to be established. (C) 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - Since the early eighties air pollution by SO2 and Pb and, to a lesser degree by NOx and NH3, have been significantly reduced in Europe. This was done in part for the protection of forest ecosystems. The reductions are reflected in the pollutant impacts and inputs and have been verified through the bioindicator Norway spruce. In contrast, ozone concentrations increased at most of the evaluated measuring locations and trends were calculated based on the results of about 100 stations in Austria and Germany.
   Despite reduced emissions, large parts of the forest ecosystems are still affected by air-pollution impacts. Negative effects can be assessed using different legal standards and Critical Levels and Critical Loads, respectively: The legal standard for the evaluation of SO2 impact, as used in Austria, is well suited. The provisional European Critical Level for ozone, the AOT40 must, in order to be a meaningful criterion for field applications, be further refined. Continuing the Critical Load concept, the spatial risk of acid depositions in areas of high geomorphic variability were evaluated using the new parameter of 'critical soil depth'. With the help of the newly defined 'lead accumulation index', the accumulation of Pb from air pollution could be evaluated.
   Air-pollution inputs and the spatial acidification risk is directly related to altitude. Up to altitudes of 1000 m and 1100 m, SO2 impact and acid depositions, respectively were indicated and elevated ozone doses and Pb inputs were observed in the sensitive sub-alpine areas. These results underline the necessity for increased protection of mountain forest ecosystems, among others through a further reduction of emissions or forest-related strategies.

AB  - Depression and parkinsonism constitute two frequent findings in elderly demented patients. A large body of research, including epidemiological, retrospective, and prospective studies have contributed to the understanding of complex and common situations in the elderly, in which depression, parkinsonian signs, and cognitive impairment coexist. Many aspects regarding the "associated syndromes of dementia", however, are still object of debate as well as under current active investigation. The recent dramatic aging of the population is leading to an increasing prevalence of neuropsychiatric comorbidities. This is a problem of great clinical and socio-economical interest, because, when present in the same subject, depression, parkinsonism-related motor impairment and cognitive impairment may not only act additively or synergistically in deteriorating the functional outcome of the patient, but also lead to their institutionalization. We observed that one half of institutionalized subjects in two nursing homes of Central Italy suffer from an associated syndrome dementia/parkinsonism/depression, that these subjects are significantly more dependent than subjects hospitalized for the same reasons, and that their grade of depression or cognitive impairment is independent of which disease is diagnosed first. Depressed mood, memory impairment and motor difficulties, however, are often underestimated in the elderly, being considered as "normal" aspects of the aging process. The aim of this review is to highlight the clinical relevance of the associated syndromes of dementia, in a way that early diagnosis and treatment of these pathologies are attempted.

AB  - Objectives: Psychological coronary-proneness is most probably one of the first recognised risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). The mechanisms by which psychological risk factors might exert their-influence on the cardiovascular system are less clear than those for the more standard biological risk factors. The aim of this review was to classify all possible mechanisms of potentiation of CHD by psychological factors.
   Method: A MEDLINE search was conducted by selecting literature on both standard biological risk factors (eg. dyslipidaemia, hypertension, smoking) and psychological risk factors (eg. personality traits, behavioural characteristics, coping with stress) for CHD.
   Results: It was suggested that six biological mechanisms could mediate psychological influences specifically for CHD, of course, together with the seventh mechanism of general alterations in health-related behaviours. These are: increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle, decreased blood supply to the heart muscle, increased concentration of blood, enhanced blood clotting, increase in cholesterol and other plasma lipids, disturbances of blood sugar level, and alterations in health-related behaviours.
   Coclusions: If more studies of CHD were conducted with both physical and psychological risk factors simultaneously, it would be possible to investigate which of the above suggested mechanisms are important, which could in turn substantially improve both primary and secondary preventive measures.

   Methods: Electronic and library searches were used to identify empirical studies examining the cognitive and psychological effects of pediatric heart transplantation. Only studies investigating cognitive or psychological outcomes, either prospectively or cross-sectionally, were reviewed.
   Results: Preliminary findings suggest that children and adolescents generally functioned within the normal range on most measures of cognitive functioning post-transplant. However, a complicated transplant course caused by infections or rejections may place these recipients at increased risk for cognitive difficulties post-transplant. Studies also suggested that approximately 20%24% of pediatric heart transplant recipients experienced significant symptoms of psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, behavior problems) during the first year post-transplant.
   Conclusions: Research suggests that some recipients are at risk for cognitive and psychological difficulties post-transplant and may require additional academic remediation and/or psychological intervention to address these challenges. Given the limited number of empirical studies available at this time, continued research investigating cognitive and psychological outcomes following pediatric heart transplantation is needed.

   Aims To review the evidence for the involvement of the glucocorticoid receptor in the pathogenesis and treatment of mood disorders.
   Method Medline and hand searches were carried out, selecting literature relevant to psychiatrists and psychopharmacologists.
   Results A dysfunction in glucocorticoid receptors is integral to the HPA abnormalities of mood disorders. Antidepressant and mood-stabilising drugs can up-regulate glucocorticoid receptors, restoring glucocorticoid function. Preliminary clinical studies targeting the glucocorticoid receptor are encouraging.
   Conclusions Drugs designed specifically to up-regulate glucocorticoid receptors may be integral to future strategies in treating mood disorders.

AB  - Both Freud and Wundt had hoped to base psychology on an understanding of the neural basis of mental events. Their efforts were unsuccessful because the structure and function of the human brain was not available for empirical study at the physiological level. Over the last part of this century, there has been amazing growth and vitality in the field of human brain function. In this paper, we trace critical developments in the fields of cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and brain imaging related to the development of cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive Neuroscience has established that the decomposition of mental events can be united with an understanding of the mental and emotional computations carried out by the human brain. Cognitive neuroscience has the capability of influencing psychology in diverse areas from how children develop to how adults age; from how humans learn to how we imagine; from volitional control to psychopathologies.

AB  - The present paper provides an overview of age-related changes in both involuntary and voluntary attention in adult subjects as manifested in scalp-recorded ERPs. A decline in orienting with old age was inferred from a substantial reduction with age in the magnitude of deviance-related ERP components like MMN, target as well as nontarget P3s, novelty P3 and N400. A review of focused attention studies further suggested that old and young subjects do not differ substantially in the quality of attentional operations. In old subjects early selection processes, as reflected in their selection potentials, have a somewhat slower onset than in young subjects, especially in conditions in which selection is based upon complex discrimination of stimulus features. Futhermore, the global pattern emerging from visual and memory search studies is that search-related negativities in the ERPs are smaller and of longer duration in old than in young subjects over the central and anterior scalp sites. These effects could indicate that controlled search is less intense or takes more time per search operation in old than in young subjects. At more posterior scalp sites there was tendency towards an enhanced search-related negativity that could reflect a specific difficulty (or compensatory increase in mental effort) of old subjects in spatially locating targets in complex visual fields.

AB  - In many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, symptoms are present that appear to reflect an essential absence of normal movement, cognition and emotional states,These negative symptoms might reflect fundamental impairments in basic brain mechanisms that underlie goal-directed behaviour. Knowledge of the pathology and pathophysiology of these diseases, combined with evidence from basic science, offers opportunities for understanding the neurobiological basis of goal-directed behaviour, particularly the interaction between limbic structures and striato-thalamo-cortical circuits,The study of patients with negative symptoms also provides opportunities for testing cognitive models of goal-directed behaviour, and eventually to map such models onto the neurobiology of both normal and abnormal behaviour.

AB  - Objective: Bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is less well studied than bipolar disorder in adults. This review addresses issues related to its underdiagnosis, precursors of bipolarity, comorbidity, natural course and treatment.
   Method: Literature from Medline and other searches, and earlier relevant articles including references from recent review articles on juvenile bipolarity were reviewed.
   Results: Bipolar disorder in juveniles is underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed on various counts. Few recent studies have reported high rates of comorbid attention deficit and disruptive disorders, prompting some researchers to consider them as probable developmental precursors of juvenile bipolarity. There is also evidence to suggest that some juvenile depression could be pre-bipolar, and that certain temperamental predispositions are probable precursors to bipolarity. Limited data on the natural course and outcome suggest that juvenile bipolar disorder is a highly recurring illness as in adults, and that it is associated with significant functional impairment. The psychopharmacological treatment of juvenile bipolar disorder is remarkably understudied, and treatment is often based on studies of adults.
   Conclusion: There is a need for epidemiological studies of juvenile bipolar disorder. Similarly, there is an urgent need for the methodologically rigorous studies to establish the efficacy of various antimanic drugs. Finally, issues related to comorbidity and temperamental predispositions to juvenile bipolarity need greater clarity, as they may have important treatment and research implications.

AB  - Psychiatric epidemiology is considered one of the main scientific foundations of psychiatry. This article reviews methodological issues and major studies in psychiatric epidemiology. Methods such as measures of frequency and association are discussed. Selection, observation, and confounding, the main sources of bias in epidemiological studies, are described. Types of study designs, such as cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control, are detailed. A historical perspective of major population-based and clinical studies is presented. Major findings of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study and the National Comorbidity Survey are also included. Finally, future directions in the field are discussed.

AB  - This paper reviews research in mental health geography that has examined landscapes of deinstitutionalisation, community care and everyday social life. It complements Philo's (1997, Across the water: reviewing geographical studies of asylums and other mental health facilities. Health and Place 3, 73-89) review of geographical studies concerned with asylums and other mental health facilities. Offering an interpretation of developments in this research sub-field, it charts a 'first wave' and a 'second wave' of inquiries, identifying shifts of substantive emphasis, theoretical approach and methodological practice, The gains and drawbacks of both 'waves' are discussed, with particular attention to absences both in what is researched and in the extent of political and policy engagement. The possible contours of a 'third wave' mental health geography, building on the strengths of earlier research but addressing new questions in new ways, are outlined in conclusion.

AB  - This paper presents an integrative approach to suicidal behavior in terms of search activity concept. Search activity concept displays a broad and holistic approach to behavior, adaptation to environment, body resistance, brain amine metabolism, and REM-sleep functions. Search activity is defined as activity that is oriented to change the situation (or at least the subject's attitude to it) in the absence of a precise prediction of the outcome of such activity, but taking into consideration outcomes at all previous stages of activity. According to the proposed hypothesis, renunciation of search (a state opposed to search activity) leads to a feeling of helplessness, problem-solution deficits, inefficient coping, dreams that represent renunciation of search, and a drop in the activity of amines. All these factors further exacerbate the state of renunciation of search and elevate suicidal risk. In addition, the remnants of search activity are misdirected to self-defeating behaviors that increase mental pain and contribute to renunciation of search. This hypothesis integrates findings from a number of fields of study of suicidal behavior, resolves some paradoxes, suggests new lines of research, and raises suggestions for assessment and treatment of suicidal behavior.

AB  - Job burnout continues to plague organizations and individuals, resulting in costly consequences. In examining the antecedents to job burnout, prior research has primarily focused on role stressors present in the job environment, with little attention given to individual characteristics. The purpose of this field study was to examine the extent to which dimensions of an individual's personality have differential effects on the 3 components of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment) among nurses working in a hospital. After controlling for several demographic variables and 3 role stressors, findings indicate that specific dimensions of personality do significantly and differentially impact the experience of the 3 components of burnout.

AB  - To assess the validity of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), we reviewed clinical, family, psychopharmacologic, neurobiological, and outcome studies. We found multiple reports describing adults with clinical features highly reminiscent of the childhood ADHD. These adults, who are impulsive, inattentive, and restless, have the clinical "look and feel" of ADHD children. As with their childhood counterparts, many adults with ADHD suffer from antisocial, depressive, and anxiety disorders. They also show clinically significant impairments-histories of school failure, occupational problems, and traffic accidents. Studies of biological features show correspondences between child and adult cases of ADHD, Both show familial aggregation and a characteristic profile of neuropsychologic deficits; an emerging neuroimaging literature suggests that abnormalities in the same brain regions underlie both the child and adult forms of the disorder, Although these converging lines of evidence support the validity of ADHD in adults, follow-up studies of ADHD children have yielded ambiguous results, This ambiguity is in part due to differences in how researchers define the persistence of ADHD, a problem that suggests future research focus on how best to diagnose ADHD in adulthood (C) 2000 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Three types of interventions are considered: psychotherapy and counselling services, stress management training, and organizational level interventions. The review concludes that there is good evidence that, for specific mental health problems, formal psychotherapy is effective in terms of reducing individual symptoms. Other forms of intervention have been less well evaluated. The evidence that exists indicates that counselling services and stress management training have modest but short-term effects on individual well-being. Organizational interventions have insignificant effects on individual well-being and on organizational outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are commonly associated with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, its sequelae, and its treatment. In particular, interferon, a primary component of treatment for chronic hepatitis C, has been strongly associated with depressive symptoms. This review summarizes current knowledge about the etiology, course, and treatment of neuropsychiatric problems associated with hepatitis C and interferon alpha (IFN-a) treatment.
   Method: Studies were identified by computerized searches, and further references were obtained from bibliographies of the reviewed articles.
   Results: Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus is a common and growing problem, often affecting persons with psychiatric and substance use problems. Although changes in cognition, mood, and personality have been described in association with hepatitis C and with IFN-a treatment, there has been little systematic study of these changes.
   Conclusions: Psychiatrists should become familiar with the clinical spectrum associated with hepatitis C virus infection as well as the neuropsychiatric symptoms related to hepatitis C and IFN-alpha treatment. More studies are necessary to define the neuropsychiatric syndromes associated with this population and to find possible effective treatments. Furthermore, research is needed so that patients with psychiatric problems are not excluded from effective treatments for this growing medical problem.

AB  - This essay explores implications of current trends in developmental science for understanding psychopathology at the dawn of the new millennium. Over the past half century, it has become clear that uniform and general principles of development (i.e., those that are applicable at all times, to all people, and in all places) will be of limited utility in understanding the processes of greatest interest in development and psychopathology. Instead, such processes are characterized by complexly organized individuals engaged in developmental transactions within multiple contexts (ranging from the biological environment of neurons to the cultural systems of meaning that shape people's lives). These transactions in turn often yield variable outcomes. In order to portray how we have come to this conclusion, we first provide a view of contemporary research in three areas of early development: the biology of the developing brain, the complexities of early emotional development, and the cultural contexts of child development. We then trace how an increasing appreciation of organized complexity, developmental transactions, and the meaning of context have played out in the emerging field of infant mental health before closing with our vision of new opportunities for the study of experience in the midst of variation.

AB  - This article describes a number of studies by our research group to find brain structures that may be involved in the symptoms of idiopathic depression, depression in Alzheimer's disease and depression in Parkinson's disease. Until recently, idiopathic depression has generally been related to deficiencies of aminergic systems. In Alzheimer patients we found a strong decrease in the number of neurons in the locus coeruleus and brain noradrenaline concentrations, but in depressed Alzheimer patients we did not find an extra de crease. This is in agreement with the finding that there is no cell loss in the locus coeruleus in idiopathic depression. We did find, however, that the number of corticotropin-releasing hormone-, vasopressin- and oxytocin expressing neurons, the number of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons coexpressing vasopressin and the amount of corticotropin-releasing hormone-mRNA in idiopathic depression were strongly increased in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. This result supports the hypothesis on the pathogenetic involvement of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in depression and is of clinical relevance, since it may provide a theoretical rationale for antidepressive therapy with CRH antagonists.

AB  - Objective: To provide clinicians with a critical evaluation of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been available in Canada since March 1999. Data sources: Commercial searches (MEDLINE and BiblioTech) and an "in-house" search (InfoDrug) were used to find published English-language references for clinical and preclinical publications. There was no restriction of publication dates. Primary index terms used were: pharmacological properties, receptors, pharmacological selectivity, pharmacokinetics, age-related pharmacokinetics, sex-related pharmacokinetics, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, cytochrome activity, drug interactions, adverse reactions, antidepressant switching, precautions, overdose, drug discontinuation, children, geriatric, depression, combination therapy, placebo control, refractory depression, anxiety disorders and medical disorders. Study selection: A total of 74 studies were reviewed. Twenty-one of these studies specifically examined the clinical efficacy and tolerability of citalopram in depressive disorders as well as other disorders. In depressive disorders, clinical studies were required to have either placebo or active comparison controls for a minimum of 3 weeks. For other disorders, in the absence of double-blind trials, open-label studies were included. Pharmacological studies were limited to animal studies focusing on citalopram's selectivity and receptor specificity, and positron emission tomography studies were incorporated to include human pharmacological data. Pharmacokinetic studies focused on the metabolism, safety and tolerability of citalopram, specifically with reference to adverse reactions, drug interactions and overdose in addition to citalopram's effect on vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. Data extraction: Data on clinical studies were summarized according to test measures, study duration and outcome of study. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were summarized according to properties and interactions. Adverse reactions were extracted to outline citalopram's safety profile. Data synthesis: Citalopram is an SSRI antidepressant with a more specific and selective pharmacological profile than other antidepressants of its class. It is well tolerated, and drug interactions are not a significant concern. It is also reasonably safe for populations vulnerable to pharmacokinetic effects, such as the elderly and patients with metabolic diseases. In addition to its tolerability, citalopram is effective in the treatment of major depression, other depressive disorders and panic disorder. It has the potential to effectively treat other anxiety disorders and substance-use disorders; in addition, it may be useful in several medical conditions. Conclusions: There is evidence to support the role of citalopram as a well-tolerated and effective SSRI antidepressant. There is a need for further evaluation of its role in psychiatric disorders other than major depressive disorder.

   Methods-A systematic literature search was performed in eight databases. Studies with catecholamines or cortisol as effect variables measured in blood, urine, or saliva were included.
   Results-After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 77 studies from the initial 559 identified were taken into account. In occupational settings it was found that relatively few studies were conclusive about recovery, which formed a contrast with sports research. For reactivity and recovery up to 1 hour after performing the task, half of the studies considered physical tasks and more than two thirds showed incomplete recovery compared with baseline excretion of catecholamines and cortisol. Recovery extending to 3 days after the task was performed was often incomplete for cortisol after combined mentally and physically demanding tasks, and less often after solely mental or physical tasks. This type of recovery was more often incomplete for adrenaline (epinephrine) than for noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which was the case after mental as well as combined mental and physical tasks.
   Conclusions-The results from lab oratory and sports research may be transferable to some occupations, but more research is needed on the course of recovery relative to health effects in occupational settings.

AB  - Objective: The measurement of quality of life has become important in evaluating new treatments of cardiac disease. This review focuses on definition and general concepts underlying quality of life in patients with cardiac disease, the ways in which it is measured, and the uses and limitations of quality of-life measurement. Methods: A Medline search, from 1988 to 1998, was undertaken using the search terms "cardiovascular disease and quality of life" and "cardiovascular disease and health status." Results of clinical trials of cardiovascular therapies using quality-of-life instruments were not reviewed. Results: Quality of life is defined as" ... the functional effect of an illness and its consequent therapy upon a patient, as perceived by the patient." Domains of quality of life include physical, mental, social, and occupational function; health perceptions; and symptoms of disease. Conclusion: Psychosomatic medicine contributions to understanding patients' reactions to physical illness and injury may offer enhanced insight into assessment of health perceptions. Generic health profiles and cardiac-disease-specific quality-of-life measures would also be useful in psychosomatic investigations of personality, hostility, depression, and social isolation in patients with cardiac disease.

Although many reports suggest health benefits front individual MVM techniques, reports on integrated holistic approaches are rare. This case series, designed to investigate the effectiveness of art integrated, multi-modality MVM program in an ideal clinical setting, describes the outcomes in four patients: one with sarcoidosis; one with Parkinson's disease; a third with renal hypertension; and a fourth with diabetes/essential hypertension/anxiety disorder. Standard symptom reports and objective markers of disease were evaluated before, during, and after the treatment period. Results suggested substantial improvements as indicated by reductions in major signs, symptoms, and use of conventional medications in the four. patients during the 3-week in-residence treatment phase and continuing through the home follow-up program.

   Method: Articles were selected from the alexithymia literature published over the past decade that describe advances in the theoretical understanding of alexithymia or report empirical investigations of the relationships of the construct with emotion regulation and with somatic illness and disease. Empirical investigations of the neural correlates of alexithymia were reviewed also, as were studies that explore therapeutic attempts to modify alexithymic characteristics.
   Results: The salient features of the alexithymia construct are now thought to reflect deficits in the cognative processing and regulation of emotions. This is supported by studies showing that alexithymia is associated with adaptive styles of emotion regulation, low emotional intelligence, a bidirectional interhemispheric transfer deficit, and reduced rapid eye movement (REM) density (number of eye movements divided by number of REM periods). Although empirical evidence demonstrates that alexithymia is associated with several somatic disorders, more prospective studies are required to establish the direction of causality. Preliminary data suggest that psychotherapies involving specific techniques to enhance emotional awareness and integrate symbolic and subsymbolic elements of emotion schemas may be Effective in reducing alexithymic characteristics.
   Conclusion: Alexithymia is proving to be a heuristically useful construct for exploring the role of personality and emotions in the pathogenesis of certain somatic illnesses and diseases.

AB  - The loss of pigmentation, or 'bleaching', in tropical reef organisms such as corals and symbiotic sea anemones has been extensively reported around the world over the last 15 years. The widespread bleaching of corals has generally been associated with seawater warming; increased sea surface temperatures and irradiance both play a part in eliciting the bleaching response. At the same time, it is recognized that bleaching is a generalized stress response in symbiotic cnidarians, being elicited also by exposure to pollutants such as heavy metals, oil, pesticides and increased sedimentation. However, reported occurrences of bleaching in response to pollutants in the field are extremely limited. Such events, unlike seawater warming-induced bleaching, are usually extremely localized. Nevertheless, there exists the possibility that seawater warming and pollutant discharges may act additively or synergistically to produce severe bleaching. Recovery of coral communities following bleaching-induced mortality is affected by pollution, which may either delay (or halt) recovery and/or cause a shift in species dominance so that branching coral species become replaced by more physically rigorous massive corals, with resultant loss in ecosystem biodiversity. As a generalized stress response, bleaching has much to offer in the development of toxicological bioassays. Measurements of symbiotic algal loss, algal division rates and alterations in synchronous algal division patterns in selected hosts offer sensitive tools for the assessment of the effects of pollutants, which in some cases have shown greater resolution than molecular assays.

AB  - Worldwide, more than one million children are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and in the United States it has become the sixth leading cause of death among 15-24-year-olds. Despite the trend of increasing rates of infection, advances in therapies have led to survival past 5 years of age for more than 65% of infected children. This global health threat will therefore continue to have a significant impact on child and adolescent psychiatry and psychology. This paper reviews current studies and reports on the consequences of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in the psychiatric care and development of children and adolescents infected by HIV. From a search of all the English-language-based literature on pediatric AIDS, 140 studies are reviewed which address HIV infection and its psychological and social implications. Several topics of mental health significance are examined: (1) the epidemiology of HIV, (2) neurocognitive development among those infected, (3) psychological impact of infection, and (4) the family and social context of HIV. The transition of HIV from an acute, lethal disease to a subacute, chronic disease has enormous implications for the neurocognitive and psychosocial development of children and families. As children and adolescents infected with HIV continue to live longer, normal developmental milestones and educational needs will take on new significance. Many children will continue to be adversely impacted by non-HIV factors such as poverty, inadequate medical services, and a lack of social support. This review outlines recent developments that hold promise to effectively reduce the treatment burden on the infected, their families, and health care providers and to decrease the incidence of transmission to the uninfected.

AB  - One of the most significant developments in biology in the past half century was the emergence, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, of neuroscience as a distinct discipline. We review here factors that led to the convergence into a common discipline of the traditional fields of neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, and behavior, and we emphasize the seminal roles played by David McKenzie Rioch, Francis O Schmitt, and especially Stephen W Kuffler in creating neuroscience as we now know it. The application of the techniques of molecular and cellular biology to the study of the nervous system has greatly accelerated our understanding of the mechanisms involved in neuronal signaling, neural development, and the function of the major sensory and motor systems of the brain. The elucidation of the underlying causes of most neurological and psychiatric disorders has proved to be more difficult; but striking progress is now being made in determining the genetic basis of such disorders as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and a number of ion channel and mitochondrial disorders, and a significant start has been made in identifying genetic factors in the etiology of such disorders as manic depressive illness and schizophrenia. These developments presage the emergence in the coming decades of a new nosology, certainly in neurology and perhaps also in psychiatry, based not on symptomatology but on the dysfunction of specific genes, molecules, neuronal organelles and particular neural systems.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this review is to highlight some of the psychological issues associated with migraine, and to discuss various theoretical approaches for the psychological treatment of migraine headaches.
   Data sources: PsychLit and PsychInfo databases were utilized for the literature search.
   Study selection: Articles with a clear, theoretical basis for the treatment interventions were selected for inclusion in this review.
   Data synthesis: Psychological factors may play a role in the etiology of chronic headaches for many people. To determine effective psychological treatment, it is important to operate from a theoretical perspective that has been researched, and that most closely fits the patients' issues and needs.
   Conclusion: Psychological interventions for the treatment of migraine can be applied based on a number of theoretical approaches - namely, psychodynamic, behavioral, and family systems. The importance of finding a theory-based intervention can lead to a more informed application of psychological interventions for the patient.

AB  - Prevention science is a rapidly advancing field and is at the point where a number of preventive interventions have documented the ability to change developmental trajectories and reduce negative outcomes. Recently, reports sum marizing these "effective" programs have circulated among researchers and practitioners. Surprisingly, many of the highest-quality programs fail to take adequate steps to monitor and verify program integrity. This weakens the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the program outcomes and reduces the likelihood that replications will resemble the original program. The next challenge facing the prevention field is to help consumers who are implementing effective programs in naturalistic settings do so with quality and fidelity to the original program so that they achieve similarly successful outcomes.
   This article reviews implementation issues in prevention trials and specifically highlights the study of implementation in the 34 programs determined to be effective in a recent review conducted by the Prevention Research Center for the Center for Mental Health Services. Reasons for the lack of attention to implementation and suggestions for way to incorporate implementation measurement into prevention initiatives are discussed.

AB  - Understanding the biology of the pharmacological stabilization of mood will undoubtedly serve to provide significant insight into the pathophysiology of manic-depressive illness (MDI). Accumulating evidence from our laboratories and those of other researchers has identified the family of protein kinase C isozymes as a shared target in the brain for the long-term action of both lithium and valproate. In rats chronically treated with lithium, there is a reduction in the hippocampus of the expression of two protein kinase isozymes, alpha and epsilon, as well as a reduction in the expression of a major PKC substrate, MARCKS, which has been implicated in long-term neuroplastic events in the developing and adult brain. In addition, we have been invesigating the down-stream impact of these mood stabilzizers on another kinase system, GSK-3 beta and on the AP-1 family of transcription factors. Further studies have generated promising preliminary data in support of the antimanic action of tamoxifen, and antiestrogen that is also a PKC inhibitor. Future studies must address the therapuetic relevance of these protein targets in the brain using innovative strategies in both animal and clinical investigations to ultimately create opportunities for the discovery of the next generations of mood stabilizers for the treatment of MDI.

AB  - The aim of this review was to survey the available literature on prodromal and residual symptoms of panic disorder. Both a computerized (Medline) and a manual search of the literature were performed. In a substantial proportion of patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia a prodromal phase can be identified. Most patients report residua I symptoms despite successful treatment. Residual symptoms upon remission have a prognostic value. There appears to be a relationship between residual and prodromal symptomatology (the rollback phenomenon). Appraisal of subclinical symptomatology in panic disorder has important implications as to the pathophysiological model of disease, its conceptualization and treatment.

AB  - The sequence of neurophysiological processes elicited in the auditory system by a sound is analyzed in search of the stage at which the processes carrying sensory information cross the borderline beyond which they directly underlie sound perception. Neurophysiological data suggest that this transition occurs when the sensory input is mapped onto the physiological basis of sensory memory in the auditory cortex. At this point, the sensory information carried by the stimulus-elicited process corresponds, for the first time, to that contained by the actual sound percept. Before this stage, the sensory stimulus code is fragmentary, lacks the time dimension, cannot enter conscious perception, and is not accessible to tap-down processes (voluntary mental operations). On these grounds, 2 distinct stages of auditory sensory processing, prerepresentational and representational, can be distinguished.

AB  - Objective: To review the scientific literature on the imaging of autism with a view to understanding how imaging can contribute to future studies.
   Methods: Medline was searched, and bibliographies from retrieved articles were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of autism according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria, third edition or later and a control group without autism.
   Results: The field suffers from a lack of replication studies and poor methodology in terms of not controlling for confounding variables. Enlarged brain size, particularly in the temporoparietal brain region, and decreased size of the posterior corpus callosum are the only findings that have been independently replicated.
   Conclusion: Future imaging studies should attempt to investigate more homogeneous subgroups of patients such as those with "the lesser variant of PDD" and high-functioning patients with PDD who do not have comorbid medical conditions. A different approach, examining the individual behaviours that constitute the PDD spectrum and exploring these separately along with other associated variables such as neuropsychological deficits, structural and functional brain abnormalities, and genetic information could help identify biological mechanisms that do not follow diagnostic boundaries.

AB  - Since the discovery and successful treatment of sleep apnea. researchers seem to believe that the association between sleep disturbance and coronary heart disease (CHD) has been explained. To determine whether subjective nighttime sleep complaints (trouble sleeping, trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep), exclusive of apnea, predicted myocardial infarction and other coronary events, a MEDLINE search was conducted for articles published between January 1976 through August 1997. Ten studies with an explicit measure of association between an insomniac complaint and CHD were identified. Reported risk ratios for various sleep complaints and CHD events ranged from 1.0 for waking too early and CHD death in an elderly North Carolina community to 8.0 for the highest versus lowest quintile of a sleep scale in Finnish men. Higher quality studies showed risk ratios of 1.47-3.90 between trouble falling asleep and coronary events after adjusting for age and various coronary risk factors (combined effect = 1.7, p<0.0001). While alternative explanations such as medication use still need to be ruled out, we theorize that a subjective insomniac complaint either may be part of a larger syndrome that includes poor health and depression, or it may be related to continual stressors, reduced slow-wave sleep, and autonomic dysfunction, which increase the risk of heart problems.

AB  - The relation between fear and anxiety remains unclear, though psychometric data strongly suggest they are independent emotional systems. Because central norepinephrine (NE) projection systems are at the core of models of both fear and anxiety, the present experiment explored whether this independence extends to NE functioning. Two different aspects of NE functioning were assessed in a healthy young adult sample (N = 18): pupillary reactivity to (a) a specific NE alpha-1 agonist challenge to assess receptor reactivity and (b) a darkness challenge to assess contributions of central NE. Pupillary reactivity to the former was strongly and specifically related to A. Tellegen's (1982) Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) Harm Avoidance scale (i.e., trait fear), whereas the latter was strongly and specifically related to MPQ Negative Emotionality (i.e., trait anxiety). Implications for conceptualizing fear and anxiety as emotional systems are discussed.

AB  - Especially in the field of memory encoding and retrieval, the results of functional neuroimaging have provided new insights in anatomico-functional interactions. In particular this holds true for the role of the prefrontal cortex in mnestic information processing, for the contribution and participation of the two hemispheres in various processes of information transmission, and for views on disturbed information processing after organically obvious and so-called psychogenic forms of memory impairments. This report particularly stresses the insights obtained by functional neuroimaging for probably environmentally triggered deficiencies in memory processing and discusses possible subtle neuroanatomical correlates of functional amnesias. It is especially emphasised that stress conditions and depressive states may modify the release of steroids (glucocorticoids) and transmitter agonists at the brain level with the consequence of selective memory disturbances which may manifest as a "mnestic block syndrome".

AB  - Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and citalopram, represent an important advance in the pharmacotherapy of mood and ct her disorders. They are chemically unrelated to tricyclic, heterocyclic, and other first-generation antidepressants. SSRIs are the treatment of choice for many indications, including major depression, dysthymia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, because of their efficacy, good side-effect profile, tolerability, and safety in overdose, as well as patient compliance. A review of the literature was conducted using Medline and the terms "SSRls," "fluoxetine," "sertraline," "paroxetine," "fluvoxamine," and "citalopram." Articles were limited to those published in English within the last 15 yeats. The search revealed that indications for antidepressants include unipolar depression, dysthymia, bipolar depression, treatment-resistant depression, depression in the medically ill, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, social phobia, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. One SSRI, fluoxetine, has demonstrated safety in pregnancy. Side effects of SSRIs include gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, sedation, insomnia, activation, weight gain, impaired memory, excessive perspiration, paresthesia, and sexual dysfunction.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease and depression are intimately related illnesses. Cardiovascular mortality is mote common in persons with depression, and depression following a myocardial infarction is associated with significantly poorer cardiac outcome. Safe and effective simultaneous treatment of depression and cardiovascular illness can be difficult because of the interplay between these conditions. We examine the evidence for cardiovascular effects of depression, as well as the proposed mechanism for these effects. We also review the cardiovascular effects of antidepressant treatments and the mood-altering effects of common cardiovascular medications. Articles reviewed were derived from a Medline search of English-language articles published between 1970 and 1998.

AB  - In the 1990s, it is difficult to open a newspaper or watch television and not find someone claiming that magnets promote healing. Rarely do these claims stem from double-blind, peer-reviewed studies, making it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. The current fads resemble those at the end of the last century, when many were falsely touting the benefits of direct electrical and weak magnetic stimulation. Yet in the midst of this popular interest in magnetic therapy, a new neuroscience field has developed that uses powerful magnetic fields to alter brain activity-transcranial magnetic stimulation. This review examines the basic principles underlying transcranial magnetic stimulation, and describes how it differs; from electrical stimulation or other uses of magnets. Initial studies in this field are critically summarized, particularly as they pertain to the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a promising new research and, perhaps, therapeutic tool, but more work remains before it can be fully integrated in psychiatry's diagnostic and therapeutic armamentarium.

AB  - The relationships between macro-ecological patterns and physiological investigations in insects, especially those dealing with respiratory metabolism, are assessed in an attempt to encourage the development of the interaction between macroecology and physiological ecology. First, we demonstrate that although physiological ecology has been explicitly concerned with a number of issues relating to species boundaries, many questions remain unanswered. We argue that there are essentially two ways in which the relationship between physiological tolerances and species range boundaries have been investigated. The correlational approach involves physiological inference, physiological prediction, isocline analyses and climatic matching, and has often been criticized for a lack of rigour, while the experimental approach seeks to examine experimentally the relationships between physiological variables and range edges. Second, we use the recent debate on processes underlying latitudinal patterns in body size to caution against the conflation of patterns and processes operating at intraspecific and interspecific levels, the dangers inherent in invoking single explanatory variables, and an undue focus on adaptationist (e.g. optimization) rather than nonadaptationist explanations or some combination of the two. We show that both positive and negative relationships between body size and latitude have been found at the intraspecific level and suggest that interactions between temperature-induced heterochrony, and the relationship between habitat durational stability, growing season length, and generation time can be used to explain these differences. Similar variation in documented patterns is demonstrated at the interspecific level, and the mechanisms usually proffered to explain such dines (especially the starvation/desiccation-resistance hypothesis) are discussed. Interactions between various environmental factors, such as host-plant quality, and their effects on size dines are also discussed. Third, we argue that respiratory metabolism, as a measure of ATP cost, and its spatiotemporal variation are critical to many explanations of macroecological patterns. Adaptive changes in metabolism reputedly involve both depression (stress resistance) and elevation of metabolic rate, although recent studies are increasingly calling these ideas into question. In particular, flow-through respirometry is revolutionizing results by allowing careful separation of resting (or standard) and active metabolic rates. These techniques have rarely been applied to studies of metabolic cold adaptation in insects, one of the most polemical adaptations ascribed to high-latitude and high-altitude species. We conclude by arguing that physiological investigations of species tolerances are important in the context of macroecology, especially species distributional patterns and the possible impact of climate change thereon. However, we caution that relationships between abiotic variables, species tolerances, and distributional ranges may be non-linear and subject to considerable modification by the presence of other species, and that many of the pressing questions posed by macroecology have not been addressed by insect physiologists. Nonetheless, we suggest that because an understanding of the dynamics of species distributions is of considerable importance, especially in the context of current conservation problems, insect physiological ecology has much future scope.

AB  - Depression of metabolic rate has been recorded for virtually all major animal phyla in response to environmental stress. The extent of depression is usually measured as the ratio of the depressed metabolic rate to the normal resting metabolic rate. Metabolic rate is sometimes only depressed to approx. 80% of the resting value (i.e. a depression of approx. 20% of resting); it is more commonly 5-40 % of resting (i.e. a depression of approx. 60-95% of resting); extreme depression is to 1 % or less of resting, or even to an unmeasurably low metabolic rate (i.e. a depression of approx. 99-100 % of resting). We have examined the resting and depressed metabolic rate of animals as a function of their body mass, corrected to a common temperature. This allometric approach allows ready comparison of the absolute level of both resting and depressed metabolic rate for various animals, and suggests three general patterns of metabolic depression.
   Firstly, metabolic depression to approx. 0.05-0.4 of rest is a common and remarkably consistent pattern for various non-cryptobiotic animals (e.g. molluscs, earthworms, crustaceans, fishes, amphibians, reptiles). This extent of metabolic depression is typical for dormant animals with 'intrinsic' depression, i.e. reduction of metabolic rate in anticipation of adverse environmental conditions but without substantial changes to their ionic or osmotic status, or state of body water. Some of these types of animal are able to survive anoxia for limited periods, and their anaerobic metabolic depression is also to approx. 0.05-0.4 of resting. Metabolic depression to much less than 0.2 of resting is apparent for some 'resting', 'over-wintering' or diapaused eggs of these animals, but this can be due to early developmental arrest so that the egg has a low 'metabolic mass' of developed tissue (compared to the overall mass of the egg) with no metabolic depression, rather than having metabolic depression of the entire cell mass. A profound decrease in metabolic rate occurs in hibernating (or aestivating) mammals and birds during torpor, e.g. to less than 0.01 of pre-torpor metabolic rate, but there is often no intrinsic metabolic depression in addition to that reduction in metabolic rate due to readjustment of thermoregulatory control and a decrease in body temperature with a concommitant Q(10) effect. There may be a modest intrinsic metabolic depression for some species in shallow torpor (to approx. 0.86) and a more substantial metabolic depression for deep torpor (approx. 0.6), but any energy saving accruing from this intrinsic depression is small compared to the substantial savings accrued from the readjustment of thermoregulation and the Q(10) effect.
   Secondly, a more extreme pattern of metabolic depression (to < 0.05 of rest) is evident for cryptobiotic animals. For these animals there is a profound change in their internal environment - for anoxybiotic animals there is an absence of oxygen and for osmobiotic, anhydrobiotic or cryobiotic animals there is an alteration of the ionic/osmotic balance or state of body water. Some normally aerobic animals can tolerate anoxia for considerable periods, and their duration of tolerance is inversely related to their magnitude of metabolic depression; anaerobic metabolic rate can be less than 0.005 of resting. The metabolic rate of anhydrobiotic animals is often so low as to be unmeasurable, if not zero. Thus, anhydrobiosis is the ultimate strategy for eggs or other stages of the life cycle to survive extended periods of environmental stress.
   Thirdly, a pattern of absence of metabolism when normally hydrated (as opposed to anhydrobiotic or cryobiotic) is apparently unique to diapaused eggs of the brine-shrimp (Artemia spp., an anostracan crustacean) during anoxia. The apparent complete metabolic depression of anoxic yet hydrated cysts (and extreme metabolic depression of normoxic, hypoxic, or osmobiotic, yet hydrated cysts), is an obvious exception to the above patterns.
   In searching for biochemical mechanisms for metabolic depression, it is clear that there are five general characteristics at the molecular level of cells which have a depressed metabolism; a decrease in pH, the presence of latent mRNA, a change in protein phosphorylation state, the maintenance of one particular energy-utilizing process (ion pumping), and the down-regulation of another (protein synthesis). Oxygen sensing is now the focus of intense investigation and obviously plays an important role in many aspects of cell biology. Recent studies show that oxygen sensing is involved in metabolic depression and research is now being directed towards characterising the proteins and mechanisms that comprise this response. As more data accumulate, oxygen sensing as a mechanism will probably become the sixth general characteristic of depressed cells.
   The majority of studies on these general characteristics of metabolically depressed cells come From members of the most common group of animals that depress metabolism, those non-cryptobiotic animals that remain hydrated and depress to 0.05-0.4 of rest.
   These biochemical investigations are becoming more molecular and sophisticated, and directed towards defined processes, but as yet no complete mechanism has been delineated, The consistency of the molecular data within this group of animals suggests similar metabolic strategies and mechanisms associated with metabolic depression. The biochemical 'adaptations' of anhydrobiotic organisms would seem to be related more to surviving the dramatic reduction in cell water content and its physico-chemical state, than to molecular mechanisms for lowering metabolic rate. Metabolic depression would seem to be an almost inevitable consequence of their altered hydration state.
   The unique case of profound metabolic depression of hydrated Artemia spp, cysts under a variety of conditions could reflect unique mechanisms at the molecular level. However, the available data are not consistent with this possibility (with the exception of a uniquely large decrease in ATP concentration of depressed, hydrated Artemia spp. cysts) and the question remains: how do cells of anoxic and hydrated Artemia spp. differ from anoxic goldfish or turtle cells, enabling them so much more completely to depress their metabolism?

AB  - Since bipolar disorder is inherently a longitudinal illness characterized by recurrence and cycling of mood episodes, neurobiological theories involving kindlinglike phenomena appear to possess a certain explanatory power. An approach to understanding kindlinglike phenomena at the molecular level has been made possible by advances in research on second-messenger systems in the brain. The time frame of interest has shifted from the microseconds of presynaptic events to hours, days, months, and even years in the longer duration of events beyond the synapse through second messengers, gene regulation, and synthesis of long-acting trophic factors. These complex interlocking systems may explain how environmental stress could interact over time with genetic vulnerability to produce illness. In its two sections, this paper will review an approach to understanding two major aspects of the neurobiology of bipolar disorder: kindling phenomena and second-messenger mechanisms. We will suggest that these two fields of research together help explain the biology of recurrence. (C) 1999 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - We review recent research on the prevalence, causes, and effects of diagnostic comorbidity among the most common groups of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders; anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, oppositional defiant and conduct disorders, and substance abuse. A meta-analysis of representative general population studies provides estimates of the strength of associations between pairs of disorders with narrower confidence intervals than have previously been available. Current evidence convincingly eliminates methodological factors as a major cause of comorbidity. We review the implications of comorbidity for understanding the development of psychopathology and for nosology.

AB  - This chapter reviews theory and research on the development of children's knowledge about the mental world, focusing especially on work done during the past 15 years under the rubric of theory-of-mind development. The three principal approaches to explaining this development-theory theory, modular theory, and simulation theory-are described first. Next comes a description of infant precursors or protoforms of theory-of-mind knowledge in infancy, including a beginning awareness of the intentionality and goal-directedness of human actions. This discussion is followed by a summary of the postinfancy development of children's understanding of visual perception, attention, desires, emotions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge, pretense, and thinking. Briefly considered next are intracultural, intercultural, and interspecies differences in theory-of-mind development. The chapter then concludes with some guesses about the future of the field.

AB  - Psychotherapy is facing challenges that relate to the emergence of managed health care, the possibility of a national health care system, and advances in biological psychiatry. These situations have created pressure to achieve a more accurate assessment of psychotherapeutic effectiveness. Psychotherapy has been proven to be generally effective; however, there is uncertainty as to why. The field is currently experiencing apparent turmoil in three areas: (a) theory development for psychotherapeutic effectiveness, (b) research design, and (c) treatment technique. This chapter reviews the dynamics within each of the areas and highlights the progress made in treating mental disorders. We conclude that recent advances in research design may provide a transition that will bring psychotherapy closer to becoming a unified paradigm with an acceptable theory of effectiveness.

AB  - A 2-system framework is proposed for understanding the processes that enable-and undermine-self-control or "willpower" as exemplified in the delay of gratification paradigm. A cool, cognitive "know" system and a hot, emotional "go" system are postulated. The cool system is cognitive, emotionally neutral, contemplative, flexible, integrated, coherent, spatiotemporal, slow, episodic, and strategic. It is the seat of self-regulation and self-control. The hot system is the basis of emotionality, fears as well as passions-impulsive and reflexive-initially controlled by innate releasing stimuli (and, thus, literally under "stimulus control"); it is fundamental for emotional (classical) conditioning and undermines efforts at self-control. The balance between the hot and cool systems is determined by stress, developmental level, and the individual's self-regulatory dynamics. The interactions between these systems allow explanation of findings on willpower from 3 decades of research.

AB  - Extensive research within the field of learning and individual differences focuses upon the relationship between general intelligence and process measures derived from elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs). This emphasis has ignored data indicating that cognitive abilities are best described by three levels (or strata). It has also been suggested that mental speed is a unitary construct, although it is more likely to have a complex structure. To address shortcomings evident in this literature, a multivariate investigation (N = 179) was conducted. Factor analysis of 25 psychometric indices gave seven factors postulated under the theory of fluid (G(f)) and crystallized (G(c)) intelligence. Correlations between cognitive abilities and parameters derived from 11 ECTs indicated that Gr (alone) was related to processing speed. This relationship is seemingly dependent upon experimental manipulations of task complexity. Regarding the factorial structure of mental speed, the results were unequivocal: Broad second-order factors may be derived from both ECTs and psychometric tests. These constructs are independent from abilities defined by accuracy scores and collectively define a general cognitive speed factor. Implications of these findings are discussed. It would appear that mental speed is more intricate than proposed, and that cognitive complexity (reflected in stimulus-response compatibility effects) plays a crucial role in its ontogenesis. In addition, several explanatory models linking intelligence to processing speed are untenable. It is likely that the search for a basic process of intelligence by means of mental speed frameworks (alone) is misguided.

AB  - Background: Mood disorder may be a specific complication of stroke. An earlier finding of an association between left anterior lesions and poststroke depression stimulated interest in the significance of stroke lesion characteristics. Subsequent research efforts, however, often failed to replicate this finding.
   Objective: This paper represents a critical appraisal of hemispheric lesion localization studies by computed tomography (CT) scanning in poststroke depression.
   Method: Systematic selection of original studies involved a Medline search and a review of the bibliographies of retrieved articles for additional references. Two sets of inclusion criteria were independently applied to the studies by 2 observers blind to authorship, affiliation, and journal name. Studies that satisfied minimum inclusion criteria, as determined by consensus, were included in the review.
   Results: Twenty-six original articles were retrieved by the search. Thirteen studies satisfied all or nearly all of the minimum criteria for inclusion. Six of those studies found no difference between right-and left-hemisphere lesions leading to depression. Two studies found right-sided lesions more likely to be associated with depression, while 4 studies found depression to be associated more often with left-sided lesions. One study matched subjects with and without depression for lesion location and size to identify nonlesion risk factors. All studies suffered from methodological limitations, and no studies were completely comparable with respect to sample, timing and analysis of CT scan, and psychiatric evaluation.
   Conclusion: Based on a systematic review of the present literature, any definitive statements regarding stroke lesion location and risk for depression ave not yet substantiated. The authors suggest methodologies for future localization studies of poststroke depression.

AB  - Patients' use of alternative and complementary health services has created a need for physicians to become informed about the current literature regarding these treatments. Herbal remedies may be encountered in psychiatric practice when they are used to treat psychiatric symptoms; produce changes in mood, thinking, or behavior as a side effect; or interact with psychiatric medications. English-language articles and translated abstracts or articles (where available) found on MEDLINE and sources from the alternative/complementary health field were reviewed. Each herb was assessed for its safety, side effects, drug interactions, and efficacy in treating target symptoms or diagnoses, A synopsis of the information available for each herb is presented. In many cases the quantity and quality of data were insufficient to make definitive conclusions about efficacy or safety. However, there was good evidence for the efficacy of St John's wort for the treatment of depression and for ginkgo in the treatment of memory impairment caused by dementia. More research is required for most of the herbs reviewed, but the information published to date is still of clinical interest in diagnosing, counseling, and treating patients who may be taking botanical remedies.

AB  - The necessity for understanding normal human cognitive processes and behavior, and the mechanisms which result in dysfunction in these processes are dependant on utilization of a suitable animal model. In order to develop pharmaceutical agents to alleviate mental disturbances and enable the individual to cope within the norms of society, it is incumbent upon investigators to choose a species in which pharmacokinetic principles are established and resemble those of humans. The choice of rats in cognition research studies has specific advantages in that these animals possess similar pharmacodynamic parameters to humans. Further advantages include availability, low cost, ease of breeding, maintenance and an extensive literature database which enable comparisons to present findings. However, there are substantial differences in the performance of various rat strains in tasks of learning, memory, attention, and responses to stress or drugs. In addition to rat strain, quantity of food also exerts profound consequences on animal behavior. The aim of this review is to demonstrate that there are differences in the central nervous system responsivencess of rat strains to chemicals and these could be related to factors such as source of supplier, type and quantity of feed, or season of the year. It is also evident that the genotype differs amongst strains and this may be responsible for the observed differences in CNS sensitivity to chemicals. Strain differences must be identified and taken into consideration in interpretation of assessment of neurobehavioural functions. It is also incumbent upon the investigators to utilize healthy (diet-controlled) animal models.

AB  - Objective: To describe the development, future challenges, and directions of geriatric psychiatry in Canada.
   Method: This review and description of geriatric psychiatry was developed in the context of the criteria established by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada for subspecialization applications. Information from key informants, both nationally and internationally, was combined with a review of relevant literature in the field.
   Results and Conclusions: Canada has provided important contributions to the field of geriatric psychiatry in Canada and abroad. The increased needs of older persons with severe mental illness and their families, combined with a significant body of knowledge and therapeutic options, provide an important foundation for further development. Subspecialization in geriatric psychiatry as part of the overall development of psychiatry in Canada is proposed as critical to meeting the challenges of our aging population.

AB  - Population-based studies have documented that among all patients with major psychiatric disorders, those with bipolar disorder have the highest prevalence of comorbid substance abuse and dependence. The cause of this high comorbidity rate has not been clearly established, and the relationship is probably bidirectional. Articles published in English from 1980 through 1997 containing the terms comorbidity, mania, outcome, and substance use were identified by searching Medline and then the bibliographies of the articles identified in this search. The literature review showed several risk factors to be associated with comorbid substance use disorders in bipolar disorder patients: early age of onset, gender, family history of substance use disorders, and presence of mixed mania. Methodological enhancements that have helped to advance understanding in this area include distinguishing between primary and secondary disorders, between the different subtypes of bipolar disorder, and between first and subsequent episodes of illness. In order to determine the temporal sequence of onset, longitudinal studies initiated at the onset of either illness need to be pursued. Increased understanding of the association between bipolar disorder and comorbid substance use disorder will facilitate improved detection and intervention, as well as more-effective preventive measures that could improve outcome for patients with bipolar disorder.

According to these findings, disruption in the expression of these proteins in the brain is probably one of the important causes of the altered brain iron metabolism in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Further studies on the involvement of LfR, MTf and DCT1 in iron uptake by and CP in iron egress from different types of brain cells as well as control mechanisms of expression of these proteins in the brain are critical for elucidating the causes of excessive accumulation of iron in the brain and neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - his article reviews the burgeoning literature on the relationship of mood disorders and heart disease. Major depression and depressive symptoms, although commonly encountered in medical populations, are frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), This is of particular importance because several studies have shown depression and its associated symptoms to be a major risk factor for both the development of CVD and death after an index myocardial infarction, This review of the extant literature is derived from MEDLINE searches (1966-1997) using the search terms "major depression," "psychiatry," "cardiovascular disease," and "pathophysiology." Studies investigating pathophysiological alterations related to CVD in depressed patients are reviewed. The few studies on treatment of depression in patients with CVD are also described. Treatment of depression in patients with CVD improves their dysphoria and other signs and symptoms of depression, improves quality of life, and perhaps even increases longevity, Recommendations for future research are proposed.

   Method: The literature from 1974-1996 was searched using Psychlit and supplemented by suggestions from senior members of the authors' Department.
   Results: Past history of aggression, psychopathology, extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptic medications, substance abuse, reduced serotonin function, antisocial and impulsive personality traits , neurological/neuropsychological deficits, electroencephalography, neuroimaging abnormalities and environmental factors were all found to be correlated with aggressive behaviour in schizophrenia. However, there are many methodological limitations of previous studies in this field, often leading to inconsistent and inconclusive findings.
   Conclusions: Some tentative conclusions regarding clinically useful predictors of aggression in schizophrenia can be drawn at this stage. There is a need for methodological limitations of previous studies to be overcome before more firm conclusions can be reached.

AB  - Tobacco dependence is a complex phenomenon that is not fully understood. Nicotine is the main alkaloid in tobacco and the addictive compound of tobacco. It can improve both mood and cognitive functioning; these positive effects are strong reinforcements for smokers and contribute to their addiction. Opposite results also have been reported, however, and the effects of nicotine remain controversial. Recent epidemiological and empirical studies have indicated that smoking or nicotine or both may have protective effects against certain diseases. These findings have suggested that nicotine may be used as a therapeutic agent. However, because a variety of nicotinic cholinergic receptors are present in the brain, new agonist compounds may prove to be more effective than nicotine for therapeutic purposes. Studies are reviewed and the suggestion made that nicotine may prove useful as a tool to help us understand normal and pathological brain functioning.

AB  - The search for the cellular processes that underlie information storage within neuronal systems lead to the development of two models of post-activation potentiation, long-term potentiation (LTP) and kindling. Both models give rise to a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength and altered unit discharge patterns. The present paper reviews synaptic plasticity in the neocortex of awake freely moving rats following both single and multiple sessions of activation with high-frequency, tetanic electrical stimulation. The phenomenology of neocortical post-activation potentiation and some possible underlying mechanisms are discussed. We speculate that the functional significance of potentiated responses may reflect a reorganization of the neocortex in a manner similar to those that create and define receptive fields.

   Results: Of 29 studies that evaluated possible associations between creativity and mental illness, 15 found no evidence to link creativity and mental illness, 9 found positive evidence, and 5 had unclear findings. Most studies used flawed methodologies with weak (case series or case control) designs. There were no randomized or prospective cohort studies. Adequate criteria for determining causal association were not met. In 34 selective reviews, despite mixed evidence, many authors asserted that creativity and mental illness were positively or causally associated.

AB  - Over the last decades much of the work on the impact of air pollution on forests in Europe has concentrated on central and northern countries. The southern part of Europe has received far less attention, although air pollutants-especially the photochemical ones-can reach concentrations likely to have adverse effects on forest vegetation. Although international forest condition surveys present serious problems where data consistency is concerned, they reveal considerable year-by-year species-specific fluctuations rather than a large-scale forest decline. Cases of obvious decline related to environmental factors are well circumscribed: (1) the deterioration of some coastal forests due to the action of polluted seaspray; (2) the deterioration of reforestation projects, especially conifers, mainly due to the poor ecological compatibility between species and site; and (3) the decline of deciduous oaks in southern Italy and of evergreen oaks in the Iberian peninsula apparently due to the interaction of climate stresses and pests and diseases. However, besides obvious deterioration, changes in environmental factors can provoke situations of more subtle stress. The most sensitive stands are Mediterranean conifer forests and mesophile forests of the Mediterranean-montane plane growing at the edges of the natural ecological distribution. Evergreen sclerophyllous forests appear less sensitive to variations in climatic parameters, since they can adapt quite well to both drought and the action of UV-B rays. Several experiments were carried out to test the sensitivity of Mediterranean forest species to air pollutants. Most of those experiments used seedlings of different species treated with pollutant concentrations too high to be realistic, so it is difficult to derive adequate information on the response of adult trees in field conditions. Ozone has been proved to cause foliar injury in a variety of native forest species in different Southern European countries, while the effects of other pollutants (e.g. nitrogen, sulphur, acidic deposition) are less obvious and likely to be very localized. In the case of ozone, visible symptoms were almost completely missed by large-scale surveys and-at the same time-non-visible symptoms are suspected to be even more widespread than the visible ones. Owing to this and to the complex relationships existing between species sensitivity, ozone exposure and doses, length of the vegetative periods, influence of climatic and edaphic condition on the tree's response, the impacted areas are yet to be identified. Therefore, the large-scale impact of air pollutants on the forests of Southern Europe remains largely unknown, until more specific investigations are carried out. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To synthesize and reconcile findings in these four areas, we approach the information from a developmental perspective and assume that genetically driven biologic processes play a salient role in the expression of depressive and anxiety disorders in childhood. We also comment on the relevance of findings on children and adolescents to the field of depressive and anxiety disorders in adults and make recommendations for further research.

AB  - The current knowledge on conifer responses to enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is mainly based on greenhouse or growth chamber experiments of one growing season in duration. However, the biomass losses observed in greenhouses do not occur in field-grown trees in their natural habitats. Moreover, the majority of the 20 conifer species studied have been 1-year-old seedlings, and no studies have been undertaken on mature trees. Fully grown needles, with their glaucous waxy surfaces and thick epidermal cells with both soluble and wall-bound UV-B screening metabolites, are well protected against UV-B radiation. However, it is not known whether these are sufficient protectants in young emerging needles or during the early spring period of high W-B levels reflected from snow. In order to understand all the mechanisms that result in the protection of conifer needles against UV-B radiation, future research should focus on the epidermal layer, separating the waxes, cuticle and epidermal and hypodermal cells. Parallel studies should consist of wall-bound and soluble secondary metabolite analysis, antioxidant measurements and microscopic observations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - More than 250 studies, covering 29 Northern and five Southern Hemisphere countries, have been published on the birth seasonality of individuals who develop schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. Despite methodological problems, the studies are remarkably consistent in showing a 5-8% winter-spring excess of births for both schizophrenia and mania/bipolar disorder. This seasonal birth excess is also found in schizoaffective disorder (December-March), major depression (March-May), and autism (March) but not in other psychiatric conditions with the possible exceptions of eating disorders and antisocial personality disorder. The seasonal birth pattern also may shift over time, Attempts to correlate the seasonal birth excess with specific features of schizophrenia suggest that winter-spring births are probably related to urban births and to a negative family history. Possible correlations include lesser severity of illness and neurophysiological measures. There appears to be no correlation with gender, social class, race, measurable pregnancy and birth complications, clinical subtypes, or neurological, neuropsychological, or neuroimaging measures. Virtually no correlation studies have been done for bipolar disorder. Regarding the cause of the birth seasonality, statistical artifact and parental procreational habits are unlikely explanations. Seasonal effects of genes, subtle pregnancy and birth complications, light and internal chemistry, toxins, nutrition, temperature/weather, and infectious agents or a combination of these are all viable possibilities.

AB  - Developmental stability reflects the ability of a genotype to undergo stable development of a phenotype under given environmental conditions. Deviations from developmental stability arise from the disruptive effects of a wide range of environmental and genetic stresses, and such deviations are usually measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry and phenodeviants. Fluctuating asymmetry is the most sensitive indicator of the ability to cope with stresses during ontogeny. There is considerable evidence that developmental stability, and especially fluctuating asymmetry, is a useful measure of phenotypic and genetic quality, because it covaries negatively with performance in multiple fitness domains in many species, including humans. It is proposed that developmental stability is an important marker of human health. Our goal is to initiate formally the integration of the sciences of evolutionary biology, developmental biology and medicine. We believe that this integrative framework provides a significant addition to the growing field of Darwinian medicine. The literature linking developmental stability and disease in humans is reviewed. Recent biological theoretical treatments pertaining to developmental stability are applied to a range of human health issues such as genetic diseases, ageing and survival, subfertility, abortion, child maltreatment by parents, cancer, infectious diseases, physiological and mental health, and physical attractiveness as a health certification.

AB  - Objective: To review the past half century of North American psychiatry from personal experience and to gauge its future prospects.
   Method: An examination of the relevant literature, recollections from a long academic career, and analysis of trends.
   Results: The pendulum of psychiatric theory continues its swing from its psychological to its biological pole; current economic forces are driving it toward reductionistic biology. The very, considerable gains in the psychosocial and neurobiogical knowledge base of our field will ultimately have a potent yield in patient care once the restrictive controls on its application to service provision are lifted.
   Conclusion: The future of research in the sciences basic to psychiatry has never been more promising. How rapidly progress will occur will be a function of the resources society is willing to commit to mental health research. The prognosis for the translation of the new findings to clinical practice will depend on whether professionals can mobilize public support for quality care for the mentally ill.

AB  - There is a common public perception that cancer is at least partly affected by psychological factors. Stress, negative attitudes, and personal crises have been cited as causes of the disease or reasons for its progression, while positive attitudes and relaxation have been suggested as possible cures. In the last two decades, research in the newly emerged field of psyche-oncology has begun to investigate the possibility of such a relationship. There is some evidence that factors such as helplessness, hopelessness, emotional suppression, and social isolation may be associated with a higher incidence of cancer onset and poorer survival outcome. However, the large number of contradictory findings, and frequent methodological weaknesses within the research, make these findings inconclusive.

AB  - Cardiovascular changes in humans exposed to nonionizing radiation [including extremely-low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) and radiofrequency radiation (RFR)] are reviewed. Both acute and long-term effects have been investigated. In general, if heating does not occur during exposure, current flow appears to be necessary for major cardiovascular effects to ensue, such as those due to electric shock. Whereas most studies have revealed no acute effect of static or time-varying ELF EMFs on the blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram waveform, others have reported subtle effects on the heart rate. The possible health consequences of these results are unknown. Regarding long-term effects of ELF EMFs, reports from the former Soviet Union in the early 1960s indicated arrhythmias and tachycardia in high-voltage-switchyard workers. Subsequent studies in Western countries, however, did not confirm these findings. These studies are limited by uncertainties regarding exposure durations and appropriate control groups. Investigations of acute cardiovascular changes in humans purposely exposed to RFR have been limited to studies of magnetic resonance imaging (which, in addition to RFR, involves static and time-varying magnetic fields). It has been concluded that such exposures, as presently performed, are not likely to cause adverse cardiovascular effects. Reports of hypertension in workers potentially exposed to high levels of RFR during accidents are considered to be incidental (due to anxiety and posttraumatic stress). Soviet investigators have also indicated that long-term RFR exposure may result in hypotension and bradycardia or tachycardia. Other researchers, however, have been incapable of replicating these results, and some scientists have attributed the effects to chance variations and mishandling of data. In summary, studies have not yielded any obvious cardiovascular-related hazards of acute or long-term exposures to ELF EMFs or RFR at levels below current exposure standards.

AB  - Practicing psychiatrists frequently encounter elderly patients with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. Unfortunately, the empirical literature regarding the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of these illnesses in older individuals is sparse, despite the attention directed to them in younger patients. In this paper studies of generalized anxiety and panic disorders among the elderly are reviewed and compared to similar investigations among younger adults to assess our current understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions. Articles were selected from those retrieved by Index Medicus (papers in English, published in 1992 or later; search terms ''anxiety,'' ''anxiety disorders,'' ''panic disorder,'' and ''elderly'').

   Method: A Medline and Psych-Lit computerised literature search was supplemented by tracing back through the references from existing review work.
   Results: Over 80 papers were identified which discussed diagnosis and management of rapid cycling.
   Conclusions: DSM-IV provides a useful but narrow definition of rapid cycling. Standard treatment of affective disorder may exacerbate rapid cycling. If a rapid cycling course develops, discontinuation of antidepressants and use of mood stabilisers is recommended.

AB  - Objective: The authors reviewed data involving the impact of providing psychotherapy for psychiatric disorders on costs of care. Method: In a search of the MEDLINE database limited to peer-reviewed papers published from 1984 through 1994, 686 articles were identified. Forty-one articles, covering 35 studies, were found in which the intervention tested was psychotherapeutic and the study included measures of outcome that had some implications for cost. The exclusion criteria for reviewing these studies included absence of a comparison group, a focus on medical disorders instead of psychiatric illnesses, and outcomes that did not include cost data or measures from which costs could be inferred. On this basis, 18 of the 35 studies were selected for analysis. The studies were categorized according to whether or not subjects were randomly assigned to study groups. Two reviewers independently read each study to identify the following characteristics: inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, types of interventions, main outcome variables, sample size, and statistical tests for significant differences between treatments. Outcomes had to include actual cost accounting or data on medical care utilization or work functioning. Results: The findings of eight (80%) of the 10 clinical trials with random assignment and all eight (100%) of the studies without random assignment suggested that psychotherapy reduces total costs. Conclusions: Psychotherapy appears to have a beneficial impact on a variety of costs when used in the treatment of the most severe psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, and borderline personality disorder. Much of that impact accrues from reductions in inpatient treatment and decreases in work impairment.

AB  - Chronic pelvic pain is a common gynecological problem. There has long been an assumption that social and psychological factors play a part in its genesis in a significant subgroup, but their precise role remains unclear. More recently, childhood sexual abuse has been implicated as a specific risk factor. For this review, PSYCHLIT and MEDLINE searches for relevant publications were supplemented by tracing back through the latter's related reference lists. One hundred thirty-one references directly concerning pelvic pain were identified with varying emphasis on social and psychological aspects. A further 449 references were in related fields. Forty-three were considered to be helpful in directly exploring the link between chronic pelvic pain and sociopsychological factors and 22 of these reported specific studies directly relevant. In common with other research into chronic pain conditions, it appears unhelpful to separate this type of pain into ''psychogenic'' and ''organic'' categories. Clear case definition is essential. The specificity of childhood sexual abuse as a risk factor is unclear. It may be helpful to consider clearly defined subgroups with the condition in future studies. An example of such a subgroup with pelvic venous congestion is discussed. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Cognitive deficits are common among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the cognitive impairment in MS are unknown and there is presently no effective therapeutic modality which has shown efficacy in improving cognitive deficits in MS. A 53 year old college professor with a long history of secondary progressive MS experienced, over the preceding year, noticeable deterioration in cognitive functions with difficulties in short and long term memory, word finding in spontaneous speech, attention and concentration span. Unable to pursue his academic activities, he was considering early retirement. Mental examination disclosed features of subcortical and cortical dementia involving frontal lobe, left hemispheric and right hemispheric dysfunction. Almost immediately following the extracerebral application of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 7.5 picotesla intensity and a 4-Hz sinusoidal wave, the patient experienced a heightened sense of well being, which he defined as enhancement of cognitive functions with a feeling ''like a cloud lifted off my head.'' He reported heightened clarity of thinking and during the application of EMFs he felt that words were formed faster and he experienced no difficulty finding the appropriate words. His speech was stronger and well modulated and he felt ''energized'' with resolution of his fatigue. There was improvement in manual dexterity and handwriting and testing of constructional praxis demonstrated improvement in visuospatial, visuoperceptive and visuomotor functions. It is suggested that some of the cognitive deficits associated with MS, which are caused by synaptic disruption of neurotransmitter functions, may he reversed through pulsed applications of picotesla range EMFs.

AB  - Sleep paralysis refers to episodes of inability to move during the onset of sleep or more commonly upon awakening. Patients often describe the sensation of struggling to move and may experience simultaneous frightening vivid hallucinations and dreams. Sleep paralysis and other manifestations of dissociated states of wakefulness and sleep, which reflect deficient monoaminergic regulation of neural modulators of REM sleep, have been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). A 40 year old woman with remitting-progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) experienced episodes of sleep paralysis since the age of 16, four years prior to the onset of her neurological symptoms. Episodes of sleep paralysis, which manifested at a frequency of about once a week, occurred only upon awakening in the morning and were considered by the patient as a most terrifying experience. Periods of mental stress, sleep deprivation, physical fatigue and exacerbation of MS symptoms appeared to enhance the occurrence of sleep paralysis. In July of 1992 the patient began experimental treatment with AC pulsed applications of picotesla intensity electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 5Hz frequency which were applied extracerebrally 1-2 times per week. During the course of treatment with EMFs the patient made a dramatic recovery of symptoms with improvement in vision, mobility, balance, bladder control, fatigue and shea term memory. Tn addition, her baseline pattern reversal visual evoked potential studies, which showed abnormally prolonged latencies in both eyes, normalized 3 weeks after the initiation of magnetic therapy and remained normal more than 2.5 years later. Since the introduction of magnetic therapy episodes of sleep paralysis gradually diminished and abated completely over the past 3 years. This report suggests that MS may be associated with deficient REM sleep inhibitory neural mechanisms leading to sleep paralysis secondary to the intrusion of REM sleep atonia and dream Imagery into the waking state. Pineal melatonin and monoaminergic neurons have been implicated in the induction and maintenance of REM sleep and the pathogenesis of sleep paralysis and it is suggested that resolution of sleep paralysis in this patient by AC pulsed applications of EMFs was related to enhancement of melatonin circadian rhythms and cerebral serotoninergic neurotransmission.

   Method. A MEDLINE literature search was made covering the period 1990-95 with systematic searching of citations from the articles identified. Representative articles were selected, focusing on those aspects which had not been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere, namely suicidal ideation, depression, personality and schizophrenia.
   Results. Lowering cholesterol levels have been associated with an increase in violent deaths in cardiovascular primary prevention studies. However, altered cholesterol levers have also been reported in relation to other psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusion. There is substantial evidence that serum cholesterol levels may be associated with variations in mental state or personality. Further work is needed to clarify this and to elucidate the mechanisms involved.

AB  - Winter is energetically demanding. Physiological and behavioral adaptations have evolved among nontropical animals to cope with winter because thermoregulatory demands increase when food availability decreases. Seasonal breeding is central within the suite of winter adaptations among small animals. Presumably, reproductive inhibition during winter conserves energy at a time when the odds of producing viable young are low. In addition to the well-studied seasonal cycles of mating and birth, there are also significant seasonal cycles of illness and death among many populations of mammals and birds In the field. Challenging winter conditions, such as low ambient temperatures and decreased food availability, can directly induce death via hypothermia, starvation, or shock. In some cases, survival in demanding winter conditions puts individuals under great physiological stress, defined here as an adaptive process that results in elevated blood levels of glucocorticoids. The stress of coping with energetically demanding conditions can also indirectly cause illness and death by compromising immune function. Presumably, the increased blood concentrations adrenocortical steroids response to winter stressors compromise immune function and accelerate catabolic mechanisms in the field, although the physiological effects of elevated glucocorticoids induced by artificial stressors have been investigated primarily in the laboratory. However, recurrent environmental stressors could reduce survival if they evoke persistent glucocorticoid secretion. The working hypothesis of this article is that mechanisms have evolved in some animals to combat seasonal stress-induced immunocompromise as a temporal adaptation to promote survival. Furthermore, we hypothesize that mechanisms have evolved that allow individuals to anticipate periods of immunologically challenging conditions, and to cope with these a seasonal health-threatening conditions. The primary environmental cue that permits physiological anticipation of season Is the daily photoperiod; however, other environmental factors may interact with photoperiod to affect immune function and disease processes. The evidence for seasonal fluctuations in lymphatic organ size, structure immune function, and disease processes, and their possible interactions with recurrent environmental stressors, is reviewed.
   Seasonal peaks of lymphatic organ size and structure generally occur in late autumn or early winter and seasonal minima are observed prior to the onset of breeding. although many of the field data suggest that immune function and disease processes are also enhanced during the winter, the opposite seasonal pattern is also observed in some studies. We propose that compromised immune function may be observed in some populations during particularly harsh winters when stressors override the enhancement of immune function evoked by short day lengths. Because so many factors covary in field studies, assessment of our proposal that photoperiod mediates seasonal changes in immune function requires laboratory studies in which only photoperiod is varied. A review of the effects of photoperiod on immune function in laboratory studies reveals that exposure to short day lengths enhances immune function in every species examined. Short day exposure in small mammals causes reproductive inhibition and concomitant reduction in plasma levels of prolactin and steroid hormones, as well as alterations in the temporal pattern of pineal melatonin secretion. These hormones affect immune function, and influence the development of opportunistic diseases, including cancer, however, it appears that either prolactin or melatonin secretion is responsible for mediating the effects of photoperiod on immune function. Taken together, day length appears to affect immune function in many species, including animals that typically do not exhibit reproductive responsiveness to day length. These data could have a major impact on understanding the etiology and progression of diseases in humans and nonhuman animals. The clinical significance of these data is also considered.

AB  - The recurrent affective disorders are discussed from the perspective of accumulating inherited and experiential effects on gene expression. Stress and episodes of affective illness are viewed as leaving biochemical and microstructural residues in the central nervous system (CNS) in relation to their patterning, severity, and recurrence. Comorbid factors such as substance abuse and developmental disturbances may also interact with these illness-related variables. In addition to the primary pathological processes, secondary adaptive changes can also be induced, which, in concert with pharmacological interventions, may be sufficient to counter episode occurrences and illness progression. We postulate that the balance of primary pathological and secondary adaptive changes at multiple levels of CNS regulation accounts for recurrence and cyclicity in the affective disorders. The importance of early, effective, long-term interventions in the recurrent affective disorders and the therapeutic potential of several new treatment modalities including repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are discussed.

AB  - Purpose. To review critically the research literature on the health effects of worksite stress-management interventions.
   Search Methods. Stress-management interventions were defined as techniques that are designed to help employees modify their appraisal of stressful situations or deal more effectively with the symptoms of stress. Stress-management studies that were worksite based, assessed a health outcome, and were published in the peer-reviewed literature were included in this review. The main search method was the one described in the lend article to this special issue of the JOURNAL, but supplementary sources included prior reviews of the research literature and expert contacts. Sixty-four studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review.
   Summary of Findings. A variety of stress-management techniques was used in worksite studies, including muscle relaxation, meditation, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral skills, and combinations of these techniques. The most common techniques used were muscle relaxation, cognitive-behavioral skills, and combinations of two or more techniques. Outcome measures to evaluate the success of stress interventions included physiologic and psychologic measurements, somatic complaints, and job-related measures. Nearly three-fourths of the studies offered the training to all workers and did not specifically recruit high-stress employees. Over half the studies were randomized control trials, but only 30% conducted posttraining follow-up evaluations. The effectiveness of stress interventions varied according to the health-outcome measure used; some techniques were more effective for psychologic outcomes (e.g., cognitive-behavioral skills), whereas others were more effective for physiologic outcomes (e.g., muscle relaxation). Biofeedback was the least frequent technique used in work settings and also seemed to be the least effective technique. Meditation produced the most consistent results across outcome measures but was used in only six studies. In general, studies using a combination of techniques (e.g., muscle relaxation plus cognitive-behavioral skills) seemed to be more effective across outcome measures than single techniques.
   Conclusions. The large number of different stress-management techniques coupled with the wide range of health outcome measures used in stress intervention studies makes ii difficult to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of each technique and each outcome. Also, the quality of the methodology varied substantially among studies. Nevertheless, the most positive results across the various health outcomes were obtained with a combination of true or more techniques. None of the stress interventions was consistently effective in producing effects on job/organization-relevant outcomes, such as absenteeism or job satisfaction. To produce changes on these types of measures, stress interventions will need to alter or modify the sources of stress in the work environment. It can be said that stress management in work settings can be effective in enhancing worker physical and psychologic health, but the choice of which stress-management technique to use should be based on the specific health outcomes that are targeted for change.

   Results. Sixty-eight articles were used in the review.
   Conclusions. Developments in the field of perinatal psychiatry include a greater understanding of the nosology and aetiology of the conditions, the effect of maternal illness on the child, as well as transcultural factors. The perspective of the individual sufferer has been somewhat ignored. New treatments with both pharmacotherapy and hormones are emerging, but perhaps the greatest current challenge is to adapt our management strategies to community care.

AB  - Several distinct classes of agents have demonstrated efficacy as mood stabilizers in patients with bipolar disorder. It may be reasonable to assume that these agents share one or more common mechanisms of action. This paper will explore the hypothesis that all effective mood stabilizers exert their actions through inhibition of postsynaptic signal-transduction and kindling processes. A literature search was performed for all currently used mood stabilizers to identify reports of mood-stabilizer action in postreceptor cell-signaling and kindling processes. Most effective mood stabilizers appear to inhibit intracellular calcium mobilization through several distinct mechanisms. In addition, several mood stabilizers appear to diminish generation of second-messenger molecules from the membrane phospholipids phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine, inhibit the activity of protein kinases, and directly inhibit activity of G-proteins. Finally, all established mood stabilizers also exhibit antikindling effects. All of these mechanisms of action could dampen excessive intracellular and intercellular signaling, which may be a core feature of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. The observation that all effective mood stabilizers inhibit both kindling and signal-transduction pathways suggests that these processes are intimately linked. We hypothesize that an effective mood stabilizer must possess some specific minimum inhibitory effects at postsynaptic signal-transduction and kindling processes. If this hypothesis is correct, then a rational search for safer and more effective mood-stabilizing agents can begin.

AB  - Background The role of psychosocial factors in the aetiology of coronary heart disease continues to be debated. Despite public perception of a major role for their effect, scientific opinion on their relevance remains divided. This paper reviews the literature on the influence of social support and life stress on coronary heart disease incidence and mortality.
   Methods Observational studies published in English, based on over 100 human subjects from the general population, investigating life stress or social support were considered. Fourteen studies derived from MEDLINE searches on MeSH headings: coronary disease; stress, psychological; social support; social isolation; life change events. An equivalent search of BIDS and studies referenced by papers identified using these sources was carried out.
   Results and conclusions The review concludes that both life stress and social support were found to have an influence on coronary heart disease, social support more so than stress. Both have a stronger influence on coronary heart disease mortality than on initial incidence of clinical disease. Measures of the quality of support, in particular emotional support, show the largest effects. The review highlights problems in drawing conclusions from the available literature; in particular, the inconsistency in measures used to define the psychosocial factors. Further studies are needed to investigate interrelationships between stress and social support, and a recommendation is made to adopt pragmatic measures in future studies, which if proven to have an effect, may be open to modification.

AB  - Coral reef geomorphology and community composition were investigated in the tropical northeastern Pacific during April 1994. Three areas were surveyed in the Revillagigedo Islands (Mexico), and an intensive study was conducted on Clipperton Atoll (1,300 km SW of Acapulco), including macro-scale surface circulation, sea surface temperature (SST) climatology, geomorphology, coral community structure, zonation, and biogeography. Satellite-tracked drifter buoys from 1979-1993 demonstrated complex patterns of surface circulation with dominantly easterly flow (North Equatorial Counter Current, NECC), but also westerly currents (South Equatorial Current, SEC) that could transport propagules to Clipperton from both central and eastern Pacific regions. The northernmost latitude reached by the NECC is not influenced by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, but easterly flow velocity evidently is accelerated at such times. Maximum NECC flow rates indicate that the eastern Pacific barrier can be bridged in 60 to 120 days. SST anomalies at Clipperton occur during ENSO events and were greater at Clipperton in 1987 than during 1982-1983. Shallow (15-18 m) and deep (50-58 m) terraces are present around most of Clipperton, probably representing Modern and late Pleistocene sea level stands. Although Clipperton is a well developed atoll with high coral cover, the reef-building fauna is depauperate, consisting of only 7 species of scleractinian corals belonging to the genera Pocillopora, Porites, Pavona and Leptoseris, and 1 species of hydrocoral in the genus Millepora. The identities of the one Pocillopora species and one of the two Porites species are still unknown. Two of the remaining scleractinians (Pavona minuta, Leptoseris scabra) and the hydrocoral (Millepora exaesa), all formerly known from central and western Pacific localities, represent new eastern Pacific records. Scleractinian corals predominate (10-100% cover) over insular shelf depths of 8 to 60 m, and crustose coralline algae are dominant (5-40% cover) from 0.5 to 7 m. Spur and groove features, constructed of alternating frameworks coralline algae, are generally well developed around most atoll exposures. Although crustose coralline algae predominate in the breaker zone (with up to 100% cover), a prominent algal ridge is absent with only a slight buildup (ca. 10 cm) to seaward. Frequent grazing by the pufferfish Arothron meleagris results in the removal of large amounts of live tissue and skeleton from Porites lobata. Acanthaster planci is present, but rare. The grazing of large diadematid sea urchins, (2 species each of Diadema and Echinothrix) on dead corals cause extensive erosion in some areas. Large numbers of corals on the 15-18 m terrace had recently suffered partial (P. lobata, 60-70% maximum of all colonies sampled) or total (Pocillopora sp., 80% maximum) mortality. The lengths of regenerating knobs and the rates of linear skeletal growth in P. lobata, determined by sclerochronologic analysis, indicated a period of stress during 1987. Massive skeletal growth is significantly higher at intermediate (16-17 m) than shallow (6-8 m) depths with mean extension rates of 1.5 mm yr(-1) in P. lobata and 1.4 mm yr(-1) in P. minuta at intermediate depths. Skeletal growth in P. lobata was depressed during the 1987 El Nino event at Clipperton. The branching coral Pocillopora sp. demonstrated high and similar skeletal growth rates at both shallow (25.4 mm yr(-1)) and intermediate (26.5 mm yr(-1)) depths.
   The presence of widely distributed Indo-Pacific zooxanthellate corals at Clipperton and the Revillagigedo Islands indicates that these NE Pacific Islands probably serve as a stepping stone for dispersal into the far eastern Pacific region.

AB  - The problems of access-retrieving linguistic structure from some mental grammar -end disambiguation-choosing among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous linguistic input-are fundamental to language understanding, The literature abounds with psychological results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation, and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to combine models which account for these results to build a general, uniform model of access and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic levels. For example, psycholinguistic theories of lexical access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or coverage of psycholinguistic data. This article presents a single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm is based on or parallel parser which ranks constructions for access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path effect. I show that this motivated probabilistic treatment accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results, arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic knowledge and for the use of probabilistically-enriched grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.

AB  - Objective: The clinical experience of the authors has suggested there is a significant group of elderly and individuals with medical illness and depressive symptoms who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for major depression. We were interested in all available data regarding minor depression in both the medically ill and community individuals. Methods: MEDLINE was searched from 1965 to 1995, using the terms ''depressive disorders'' and ''medical illness,'' as well as ''atypical depression'' and ''elderly.'' Relevant references from these primary articles were also utilized. Results: In medical patients, depressive symptoms were associated with decreased likelihood of discharge to home. Although diagnostic criteria vary, some suggest anhedonia as the central feature. From 3 to 16 percent of medical outpatients suffer from minor depression. Up to 64 percent of medical inpatients will complain of depressed mood. Studies in community samples found that minor depression was responsible for 9 to 16 percent of total disability days, and was associated with absenteeism from work, as well as separation and divorce. Little is known about the natural history and prognosis of minor depression. Conclusions: Minor depression is both common and has a significant impact on the health care system, and therefore deserves further study.

AB  - Objective: To review the history of the Placebo from its origin and describe its transformation in this century both in meaning and usage; the triad.
   Data source: Literature available in the National Library in Washington.
   Study selection: Literature from 1990 to present.
   Data extraction: History, research in mechanism of placebo effect, fields of effectiveness and usage, and ethical elaboration and philosophy of its use.
   Data synthesis: A discussion of its transformation in perception of the use and effect; effects, fields of use, ethics including consideration of deceit, pragmatism versus undesirable habits, false conclusions in controlled experiments.
   Conclusions: Placebo, a word traced back at least to Chaucer, has undergone a change (in the past 40 years) both in function and concept. Once a trivial epithet for a sham substance knowingly prescribed out of convenience or desperation, it now refers to substances intrinsically inert but capable of releasing psycho-physiological sequences which evoke beneficial effects, particularly in conditions of pain, anxiety, and depression. This claim has been shown to depend on a triad of interrelationships in one whose belief is strongly invested in an authority, who proffers a symbol of therapeutic potency. More recently, a second use of ''placebo'' refers to a control substance (or procedure) in a random and doubly blinded experiment, wherein the control group is supposed to measure the extent of the ''psychological'' effect against that of the experimental drug in the subject. The purposes of these two usages are obviously not similar, although the effects are: side reactions and benefits as with the active substance. Recent research has gained acceptance among many workers that placebos may be just as active as pharmacological agents in 30 to 40 percent of subjects through the triad effect.
   The use of placebo substitutes for genuine agents has aroused controversy in Ethics over the past 40 years. At present apologists for and antagonists against the prescriptions of deceitful substances appear in a fair cross section of publications, along with those less dogmatic, who wish to quality its use.

AB  - A marked decrease in the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite (5-HIAA) has been demonstrated in postmortem studies of suicide victims with various psychiatric disorders. Depression is the most common mental manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS) which accounts for the high incidence of suicide in this disease. CSF 5-HIAA concentrations are reduced in MS patients and nocturnal plasma melatonin levels were found to be lower in suicidal than in nonsuicidal patients. These findings suggest that the increased risk of suicide in MS patients may be related to decreased 5-HT functions and blunted circadian melatonin secretion. Previous studies have demonstrated that extracerebral applications of pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla range rapidly improved motor, sensory, affective and cognitive deficits in MS. Augmentation of cerebral 5-HT synthesis and resynchronization of circadian melatonin secretion has been suggested as a key mechanism by which these EMFs improved symptoms of the disease. Therefore, the prediction was made that this treatment modality would result in attenuation of suicidal behavior in MS patients. The present report concerns three women with remitting-progressive MS who exhibited suicidal behavior during the course of their illness. All patients had frequent suicidal thoughts over several years and experienced resolution of suicidal behavior within several weeks after introduction of EMFs treatment with no recurrence of symptoms during a follow-up of months to 3.5 years. These findings demonstrate that in MS pulsed applications of picotesla level EMFs improve mental depression and may reduce the risk of suicide by a mechanism involving the augmentation of 5-HT neurotransmission and resynchronization of circadian melatonin secretion.

AB  - We present an overview of methodological issues involved in conducting psychopathology research, including conceptual, analytic, and interpretive considerations. Research issues germane to structured diagnostic interviewing, comorbidity of mental disorders, and ascertainment and sampling are reviewed. Further, the problem of specificity (with respect to disorder, to differential deficit, and to time) is discussed. Specific issues concerning risk vs protective factors, conducting research with special populations, and the continuity of abnormal and normal functioning are highlighted. Finally, various analogue strategies (human subclinical syndromes, experimental study of "pathological" processes in normals, animal models, and computer simulations) are critiqued. Our review documents many of the impressive methodological developments that have emerged in this field, and we hope our review stimulates additional research that exploits recent methodological advances.

AB  - Research that relates personality to depression is one of the dominant themes in the clinical literature. The current paper examines this research from a critical perspective. It is argued that existing research is limited by (i) a failure to adopt a broad conceptual approach to the study of personality and depression; and (ii) the use of personality measures with questionable psychometric properties. Our observations lead us to suggest that greater adherence to established methodology and conceptual developments in the personality field will result in substantial improvements in research on personality and depression, and may ultimately provide a more accurate appraisal of the role of personality factors in depression. In addition to examining important issues, key directions for future research are discussed.

Method: The conceptual origins of PTSD ave described, and the literature on the prevalence, longitudinal course, phenomenology, and neurobiology of PTSD is reviewed. Results: Paradoxically, there are a series of findings that support the idea that PTSD is a distinct diagnostic entity, but these are different from those originally developed from psychosocial theory and stress research. Conclusions: PTSD has been a controversial diagnosis and is again at a vulnerable point. it is imperative that the field address how current findings challenge the original conceptualizations of this disorder so that the next generation of conceptual issues cart be formulated.

AB  - Objective: To review the status of current treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Method: Treatment studies of SAD published between January 1989 and March 1995 were identified using a computerized MEDLINE literature search, Additional citations were obtained from the reference sections of these articles. Studies included in this review were selected using operational methodologic criteria Results: Many studies support the efficacy of bright light therapy using a fluorescent light box. The best studied protocol is > 2500 lux white light for 2 hours per day, but newer protocols using 10,000 lux for 30 minutes have comparable response rates. Studies of light visors and other head-mounted devices also report similar response rates, but have not yet shown superiority over putative control conditions. There are fewer medication studies in SAD, but controlled studies suggest that fluoxetine, d-fenfluramine and propranolol are effective. Other treatments such as dawn simulation require further study. No studies of psychological treatments for SAD were found. Many studies had methodologic limitations, including brief treatment periods, small sample sizes, and lack of replication, that limit the generalizability of findings. Conclusion: There are several well-studied, effective treatments for SAD, including light therapy and medications. However, further research must be done to demonstrate sustained treatment response over time, to clarify the intensity-response relationship of light therapy, to clarify the role of light therapy and medications, and to assess combination treatments.

AB  - Learning a conditioned stimulus (CS)-unconditioned stimulus (US) association is accompanied by a variety of long-lasting changes in physiology and chemistry of the synapse in the dentate gyrus. To determine the time course of synaptic modification during learning, changes in the perforant path-dentate gyrus-evoked field potentials were measured in rats performing a classical conditioning (paired tone and footshock) or pseudoconditioning (unpaired tone and footshock) task. Over the course of 4 days of training, differential changes in the evoked response were observed in the two groups. In the conditioned group, there was an increase in the slope of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) which started after five tone-shock paired trials and lasted for more than 40 min, outlasting the training session by 20 min. In contrast, a decrease in the slope of the EPSP which commenced after training and lasted for at least 1 h was observed in the pseudoconditioned group. In both groups there was a prolonged decrease in the amplitude of the population spike. The increase in the EPSP was reduced and the duration tended to shorten over days of training in the conditioned group, whereas in the pseudoconditioned group the decrease in the EPSP tended to increase. Off-line analysis of suppression of lever-pressing for food reward during the presentation of the tone, indicated that the conditioned rats had learned the tone-footshock association. Temperature was measured in the dentate gyrus of rats undergoing an identical procedure. In both groups slight temperature increases were observed, with no difference in amplitude and time-course between the groups. The differential effect of conditioning and pseudoconditioning on the evoked response and changes in temperature eliminate the possibility that effects of stress, arousal and muscular effort are the primary cause of the changes in the EPSP. The results suggest that behavioural events can exert bidirectional control of synaptic strength of entorhinal cortex inputs to the dentate gyrus and that the sign of synaptic modification is at least in part determined by the temporal relationship between these events. The data are discussed in terms of the type of neural activity that may mediate the processing of information in the dentate gyrus.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent and cause an enormous burden of suffering, loss of productivity, morbidity, and mortality. This article will review prevention of psychiatric disorders in a manner that is relevant to the mental health clinician. Clinicians may increasingly play a role in preventive interventions through (1) identifying individuals at risk, (2) consulting with agencies, school personnel, and employers who may identify individuals at risk, (3) providing treatment that can reduce the chronicity, severity, and total duration of psychiatric illness, and (4) providing mental health care to a specific population within our evolving health care system, in which health promotion and disease prevention play an increasingly important role. Appropriate literature was located by searching the English-language citations since 1985 in index Medicus (search terms included prevention, preventive psychiatry, early intervention, mental disorders, risk factors, and primary prevention), reviewing several textbooks on psychiatric preventive services, and finding additional sources cited in the reference sections of these publications. This paper presents the public health model of disease prevention, which divides prevention activities into primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions. The model is applied to childhood psychiatric disorders and to adult-onset schizophrenia, depressive disorders, and substance use disorders, The review concludes with a discussion of the implications for the clinician and for public health policy.

AB  - It is well-known that principal chiral models and symmetric space models in two-dimensional Minkowski space have an infinite-dimensional algebra of hidden symmetries. Because of the relevance of symmetric space models to duality symmetries in string theory, the hidden symmetries of these models are explored in some detail. The string theory application requires including coupling to gravity, supersymmetrization, and quantum effects. However, as a first step, this paper only considers classical bosonic theories in flat space-time. Even though the algebra of hidden symmetries of principal chiral models is confirmed to include a Kac-Moody algebra (or a current algebra on a circle), it is argued that a better interpretation is provided by a doubled current algebra on a semi-circle (or line segment). Neither the circle nor the semi-circle bears any apparent relationship to the physical space. For symmetric space models the line segment viewpoint is shown to be essential, and special boundary conditions need to be imposed at the ends. The algebra of hidden symmetries also includes Virasoro-like generators. For both principal chiral models and symmetric space models, the hidden symmetry stress tenser is singular at the ends of the line segment.

AB  - Child psychiatric epidemiology is a relatively new field. Since the ground breaking survey carried out in Buffalo by Lapouse and Monk (1959), over three decades of fairly active research efforts have ensued. In spite of the breadth and scope of surveys that have been conducted during that period, there are major methodological issues that remain unresolved. Salient among these are the field's lack of a common language for case definition and classsification and the fact that comprehensive psychiatric assessments of children require multiple informants for valid case ascertainment and that different informants frequently disagree, even when asked the same questions. Because there is no consensus on how to best address these issues, child psychiatric epidemiology has not developed uniform methods for systematic investigation. As a consequence, different investigations have employed diverse methodological approaches, such as different sampling strategies, different informants as sources of data and a wide array of assessment procedures and ways to operationalize 'caseness'. The present paper reviews the literature of child psychiatry epidemiology focusing on how the different studies have dealt with these methodological challenges, the advances that have been made in spite of the difficulties and what still needs to be learned in the field.

AB  - Persistence of individual differences in animal behavior in reactions to various environmental challenges could reflect basic divergences in temperament, which might be used to predict details of adaptive response. Although studies have been carried out on fear and anxiety in various species, including laboratory, domestic and wild animals, no consistent definition of fearfulness as a basic trait of temperament has emerged.
   After a classification of the events that may produce a state of fear, this article describes the great variability in behavior and in physiological patterns generally associated with emotional reactivity. The difficulties of proposing fearfulness - the general capacity to react to a variety of potentially threatening situations - as a valid basic internal variable are then discussed. Although there are many studies showing covariation among the psychobiological responses to different environmental challenges, other studies find no such correlations and raise doubts about the interpretation of fearfulness as a basic personality trait. After a critical assessment of methodologies used in fear and anxiety studies, it is suggested that discrepancies among results are mainly due to the modulation of emotional responses in animals, which depend on numerous genetic and epigenetic factors. It is difficult to compare results obtained by different methods from animals reared under various conditions and with different genetic origins.
   The concept of fearfulness as an inner trait is best supported by two kinds of investigations. First, an experimental approach combining ethology and experimental psychology produces undeniable indicators of emotional reactivity. Second, genetic lines selected for psychobiological traits prove useful in establishing relationships between behavioral and neuroendocrine aspects of emotional reactivity. It is suggested that fearfulness could be considered a basic feature of the temperament of each individual, one that predisposes it to respond similarly to a variety of potentially alarming challenges, but is nevertheless continually modulated during development by the interaction of genetic traits of reactivity with environmental factors, particularly in the juvenile period. Such interaction may explain much of the interindividual variability observed in adaptive responses.

AB  - Altered locomotor activity is a cardinal sign of several psychiatric disorders. With advances in technology, activity can now be measured precisely. Contemporary studies quantifying activity in psychiatric patients are reviewed. Studies were located by a Medline search (1965 to present; English language only) cross-referencing motor activity and major psychiatric disorders. The review focused on mood disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Activity levels are elevated in mania, agitated depression, and ADHD and attenuated in bipolar depression and seasonal depression. The percentage of low-level daytime activity is directly related to severity of depression, and change in this parameter accurately mirrors recovery. Demanding cognitive tasks elicit fidgeting in children with ADHD, and precise measures of activity and attention may provide a sensitive and specific marker for this disorder. Circadian rhythm analysis enhances the sophistication of activity measures. Affective disorders in children and adolescents are characterized by an attenuated circadian rhythm and an enhanced 12-hour harmonic rhythm (diurnal variation). Circadian analysis may help to distinguish between the activity patterns of mania (dysregulated) and ADHD (intact or enhanced). Persistence of hyperactivity or circadian dysregulation in bipolar patients treated with lithium appears to predict rapid relapse once medication is discontinued. Activity monitoring is a valuable research tool, with the potential to aid clinicians in diagnosis and in prediction of treatment response.

AB  - Background. A review of the efficacy of antidepressant drug treatment in patie
   Method. Randomised double-blind clinical trials of antidepressant drugs, carried out among patients with OCD and published in peer-reviewed journals between 1975 and May 1994, were selected together with three studies currently in press. Forty-seven trials were located by searching the Medline and Excerpta Medica - psychiatry data bases, scanning psychiatric and psychopharmacological journals, consulting recent published reviews and bibliographies, contacting pharmaceutical companies and through cross-references. Hedges' g was computed in pooled data at the conclusion of treatment under double-blind conditions or at the latest reported point of time during this treatment period. For each trial, effect sizes were computed for all available outcome measures of the following dependent variables: obsessive-compulsive symptoms considered together; obsessions; compulsions; depression; anxiety; global clinical improvement; psychosocial adjustment; and physical symptoms.
   Results. Clomipramine was superior to placebo in reducing both obsessive-compulsive symptoms considered together (g = 1.3 I; 95% Cl = 1.15 to 1.47) as well as obsessions (g = 0.89, 95% Cl = 0.36 to 1.42) and compulsions (g = 0.79; 95% Cl = 0.34 to 1.24) taken separately. Also, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as a class were superior to placebo, weighted mean g being respectively 0.47 (95% Cl = 0.33 to 0.61), 0.54 (95% Cl = 0.34 to 0.74) and 0.52 (95% Cl = 0.34 to 0.70) for obsessive-compulsive symptoms considered together, and obsessions and compulsions taken separately. Although on Y-BOCS the increase in improvement rate over placebo was 61.3%, 28.5%, 28.2% and 21.6% for clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline respectively, the trials testing clomipramine against fluoxetine and fluvoxamine showed similar therapeutic efficacy between these drugs. Finally, both clomipramine and fluvoxamine proved superior to antidepressant drugs with no selective serotonergic properties.
   Conclusion. Antidepressant drugs are effective in the short-term treatment of patients suffering from OCD; although the increase in improvement rate over placebo was greater for clomipramine than for SSRIs, direct comparison between these drugs showed that they had similar therapeutic efficacy on obsessive-compulsive symptoms; clomipramine and fluvoxamine had greater therapeutic efficacy than antidepressant drugs with no selective serotonergic properties; concomitant high levels of depression at the outset did not seem necessary for clomipramine and for SSRIs to improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

AB  - Background. The prescription of psychotropic drugs for children is a sensitive and highly contentious subject which may explain the apparent lack of uniformity and consistency in clinical practice.
   Method. This review is based on Medline and manual search of the literature.
   Results. More than 1000 relevant references were found, and information has been culled from all these. Fifty particularly relevant articles have been selected for the reference list.
   Conclusion. Recent years have seen considerable research in this field, and a clearer picture of the benefits and limitations of drug use in children is emerging.

AB  - We study a supersymmetric theory twisted on a Kahler four-manifold M = Sigma(1) x 2, where Sigma(1,2) are two-dimensional Riemann surfaces. We demonstrate that it possesses a ''left-moving'' conformal stress tenser on Sigma 1 (Sigma 2) in a BRST cohomology, which generates the Virasoro algebra with the conventional commutation relations. The central charge of the Virasoro algebra has a purely geometric origin and is proportional to the Euler characteristic chi of the Sigma 2 (Sigma 1) surface. It is shown that this construction can be extended to include a realization of a Kac-Moody algebra in BRST cohomology with a level proportional to the Euler characteristic chi, This structure is shown to be invariant under renormalization group. A representation of the algebra Wit, in terms of a free chiral supermultiplet is also given, We discuss the role of instantons and a possible relation between the dynamics of four-dimensional Yang-Mills theories and those of two-dimensional sigma models.

AB  - Over the last decade there has been increasing recognition of premenstrual disorders, and numerous treatments have been tried for symptom relief. A literature search using Medline was conducted to locate all articles written in English and including the terms ''premenstrual treatment,'' ''premenstrual syndrome,'' ''late luteal phase dysphoric disorder,'' or ''menstruation and mood'' over the last 30 years. Although more than 300 articles were retrieved, only one-third of them described double-blind studies and just 41 of the double-blind studies involved prospectively diagnosed patients. The definition of the disorder varied across studies as did research design and outcome measures. Many studies did not assess for Axis I comorbidity, which may have a significant impact on drug response. We attempted to do a metaanalysis of the existing double-blind, prospectively diagnosed studies, broken down by drug class and symptom reduction. However, we could not make statistical comparisons within or across drug groups to assess efficacy of treatment for specific symptoms due to differences in outcome-assessment measures across studies. Several promising pharmacological strategies exist to treat the patient with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. We review double-blind studies for each class of drugs, highlight some open studies, and present guidelines. Additional double-blind studies with prospectively diagnosed patients are needed. Standardization of definition, design, and outcome measures used in this field is important to enable direct comparison across studies of different treatment strategies.

AB  - Studies comparing obese and nonobese persons have generally failed to find differences in global aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., depression, anxiety). The resulting conclusion, that obesity does not carry risk for psychological problems, is inimical to clinical impression, reports from overweight individuals, and a consistent literature showing strong cultural bias and negative attitudes toward obese persons. The often-cited notion that obesity has no psychological consequences may be an inevitable byproduct of the manner in which the first generation of studies in the field has been conducted. The authors propose a second generation of studies that begins with a risk factor model to identify the individuals who will suffer from their obesity and the areas of functioning most affected. Recommendations are also made for a third generation of studies that will establish causal pathways linking obesity to specific areas of distress.

AB  - It is often stated that there are identifiable prodromal symptoms of psychosis in patients suffering from schizophrenia. In this article, we review the evidence for the existence of such prodromal symptoms. Computerized and direct searches of the psychiatric literature were conducted to identify relevant reports. The methods and findings of the studies were then examined for their relevance to several issues concerning prodromal symptoms. We found that very few studies have directly assessed the relationship between putative prodromal symptoms and the exacerbation of psychosis. The research that has been reported suggests that prodromal symptoms have only modest power as predictors of relapse. It appears that while some individual schizophrenia patients may show reasonably consistent patterns of prodromal symptoms, such symptoms are probably of limited general value in predicting psychosis. Two particular issues that warrant further investigation are individual differences in patterns of prodromal symptoms and the extent to which such symptoms actually precede changes in level of psychosis.

AB  - The present paper proposes a new psychophysiological approach to the genesis of positive and negative schizophrenic symptoms. According to this approach, the initial factor in schizophrenic disorders is a functional insufficiency of the right hemisphere which can be determined by early emotional experience in combination with subtle brain damage. This functional insufficiency causes (a) the inability to grasp and select information before its realization; and (b) the inability to produce a polysemantic context which is crucial for creativity, psychological defense, and the restoration of search activity, all of which determine psychophysiological adaptation to the environment. Right hemisphere insufficiency causes left hemisphere hyperactivity as an ineffective attempt to compensate for this functional deficiency. As a result, normal search activity is replaced by artificial search activity which is represented by ''positive'' symptoms, and which uses the predisposition of the left hemisphere's catecholamine system for its increased activity. The suggestion is made that cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (the inability to use appropriate previous information in relation to current perceptual input) is related to the competition between information processing which requires left hemisphere activity, and the formation of positive symptoms, also based on left hemisphere activity.

AB  - Twenty males and females reporting experience with either a word processing or editing package were paid as volunteers to evaluate a 16-row database record that was presented 256 times successively on a video display terminal (VDT) screen. Each evaluation required a decision about whether the datum adjacent to a designated label field was identical to or different from a separately displayed ''target'' data item. The database record had four configurations (i.e., formats), which differed in terms of bit-level complexity. Decision times (i.e., latencies) were assessed in a repeated-measures experimental design and concurrently, electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded for the masseter (jaw) and corrugator supercilii (eyebrow) muscles. The results showed that decision times differed among the four formats, but bit-level complexity was found to be unrelated to decision times. Local density of information, however, was highest for the format showing the slowest decision time. Masseter EMG activity did not change reliably over a resting baseline, and it was not differentially affected by format complexity. Corrugator supercilii EMG activity was reliably greater during task performance than during a resting baseline, but it was not differentially affected by format complexity. Although different configurations of information have been known to affect user response time and task performance can evoke facial EMG activity, the available data do not support the conclusion that bit-level complexity of a database record displayed on a VDT screen is related to user performance or facial EMG activity.

AB  - Background. In the 'fashionable' field of eating disorders, there has been a notable gap in the historiography of rumination, allowing considerable scope for constructing a comprehensive historical profile of this disorder.
   Method. A wide-ranging examination of printed material, both etymological and medical, backed by a Medline computer search, uncovered extensive sources, some of considerable rarity, including case reports from the early 17th century onwards. Extracted data focused on incidence, sex distribution, age range, outcome and causation, and the findings are discussed in relation to diagnostic criteria in DSM-III-R and ICD-10.
   Results. While confirming the frequency of rumination in infants and the mentally retarded, the study demonstrated, particularly, the need to recognise its occurrence in normal adults, occasionally as a collateral behaviour in anorexia and bulimia nervosa, and suggested that its prevalence, distorted by secrecy, exceeded estimated levels.
   Conclusions. In future reviews of classification, existing anomalies and inadequacies in the status and description of rumination would benefit from integrating some of the historical conclusions.

AB  - Research on the development of emotions and their functional characteristics as regulators of behavior has grown dramatically over the past 10 years. There is currently renewed emphasis on the importance of emotion regulation and dysregulation for our understanding of normal development and the development of psychopathology. The 11 essays that constitute this Monograph survey theoretical, conceptual, and methodological issues involved in the study of emotion regulation, placing particular emphasis on the role that physiological systems play in the regulation of emotion and on the interface of a biological and a behavioral perspective.
   The Monograph is divided into three parts. Part I contains essays on the definitional issues involved in the study of emotion regulation. Kagan and Thompson attempt to define exactly what phenomenon it is that we are interested in studying. Kagan argues for a descriptive approach to studying emotional behavior, one in which psychological labels are put aside until there is a clear understanding of the behavioral pattern. Thompson provides a thorough review of the possible topics to be studied under the rubric of emotion regulation and emphasizes the importance of context for studying these phenomena. Both authors provide guidelines for approaching the study of emotional behaviors during development. Calkins outlines the influence that individual differences in emotion expression have on emotion regulation. She addresses the role of temperament and temperament/environment interactions and their effect on the development of emotion regulation. Cole, Michel, and Teti deal with the role that emotion regulation plays in development psychopathology, outlining the manner in which the development of emotion regulation may become dysfunctional and lead to problem outcomes. Their essay serves as a bridge between traditional developmental work on emotion and research in developmental psychopathology.
   The four essays in Part 2 focus on three different physiological systems-the neuroendocrine (Stansbury and Gunnar), autonomic nervous (Porges, Doussard-Roosevelt, and Maiti), and central nervous (Dawson and Fox) systems. These essays share common approaches to the study of emotion regulation, even though each system presents novel and potentially nonoverlapping information about the behaviors in question. The reader is provided with the background necessary to understand each complex physiological system and hence to evaluate the research that is being undertaken in that area.
   The three essays in Part 3 consider the role of relationships as regulators of emotional behavior. Both Hofer and Field write from the perspective of developmental psychobiology, presenting evidence of the effect that relationships have on physiological systems that are important for growth and development. Cassidy discusses current attachment theory and the role that working models of attachment play in the regulation of emotion.
   Taken together, these 11 essays offer a particular perspective toward emotional development and emotion regulation. This perspective reflects a functionalist view of emotions and provides evidence for the role that emotions play as regulators even as they themselves are being regulated during behavioral interaction.

AB  - Objective: The co-occurrence of mania with other medical and psychiatric disorders has been little studied. The authors reviewed the literature in order to clarify the current state of knowledge of this subject and to identify possible areas of future research. Methods: Published articles which specifically addressed associations of mania with medical disorders and other psychiatric syndromes were identified using the Paperchase(R) medical literature search system and by cross-referencing from other published work. The articles were then organized into three categories: 1) medical disorders associated with secondary mania; 2) medical comorbidity in bipolar disorder; and 3) psychiatric comorbidity in bipolar disorder. Results: The review of medical illness and secondary mania supports the hypothesis that injuries involving right-side and mid-line brain structures are associated with so-called secondary mania. Additionally, an association between bipolar disorder and migrane is identified. Several psychiatric disorders appear to occur with mania at rates higher than expected including obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, impulse control disorders, and substance abuse. Conclusions: The authors discuss the potential implications of these findings and suggest research approaches to further examine the relationships between mania and other medical and psychiatric syndromes.

AB  - A theory of ironic processes of mental control is proposed to account for the intentional and counterintentional effects that result from efforts at self-control of mental states. The theory holds that an attempt to control the mind introduces 2 processes: (a) an operating process that promotes the intended change by searching for mental contents consistent with the intended state and (b) a monitoring process that tests whether the operating process is needed by searching for mental contents inconsistent with the intended state. The operating process requires greater cognitive capacity and normally has more pronounced cognitive effects than the monitoring process, and the 2 working together thus promote whatever degree of mental control is enjoyed. Under conditions that reduce capacity, however, the monitoring process may supersede the operating process and thus enhance the person's sensitivity to mental contents that are the ironic opposite of those that are intended.

AB  - Objective: An evaluation of the safety and efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), for the treatment of patients with severe medical and neurological illness, was undertaken. Method. The English-language literature reporting the use of ECT in patients with neurological and somatic disease was reviewed. This review included reports describing ECT used for the treatment of affective disturbances and catatonia in patients with concurrent neurological or somatic disease, as well as reports dealing with the efficacy of ECT for the treatment of certain neurological conditions for which it has been reported to have some benefit independent of its psychiatric effect. Conclusions: ECT is safe and effective for the treatment of affective and catatonic disorders in patients with most neurological and medical diseases, including elderly and debilitated patients with multiple illnesses, if the specific medical risks are carefully evaluated in each case, and appropriate modifications of technique are used to reduce the risk of potential complications. Apart from its use in psychiatry, ECT has been reported to have therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, aggressive behavioral disorders following brain injury, certain forms of epilepsy, and some forms of delirium due to toxic or metabolic encephalopathies. The potential for ECT to play an active role in the clinical management of patients with these disorders, many of whom are presently refractory to maximal medical treatment, should be evaluated by systematic studies.

TI  - INTRODUCTION TO VERTEX ALGEBRAS, BORCHERDS ALGEBRAS AND THE MONSTER LIE-ALGEBRA
AB  - The theory of vertex algebras constitutes a mathematically rigorous axiomatic formulation of the algebraic origins of conformal field theory In this context Borcherds algebras arise as certain ''physical'' subspaces of vertex algebras. The aim of this review is to give a pedagogical introduction to this rapidly developing area of mathematics. Based on the machinery of formal calculus, we present the axiomatic definition of vertex algebras. We discuss the connection with conformal field theory by deriving important implications of these axioms. In particular, many explicit calculations are presented to stress the eminent role of the Jacobi identity axiom for vertex algebras. As a class of concrete examples the vertex algebras associated with even lattices are constructed and it is shown in detail how affine Lie algebras and the fake monster Lie algebra naturally appear. This leads us to the abstract definition of Borcherds algebras as generalized Kac-Moody algebras and their basic properties. Finally, the results about the simplest generic Borcherds algebras are analyzed from the point of view of symmetry in quantum theory and the construction of the monster Lie algebra is sketched.

AB  - Chronic depression has not been appreciated or studied as well as episodic mood disorders or other chronic psychiatric disorders. This review provides an overview of the clinical features, biology, and treatment of chronic depression and suggests additional areas for research. Methods: The English-language literature was searched using MEDLINE. Additional references were selected from the bibliographies of recent publications. Studies of chronic nonbipolar depressed patients were selected, chronicity was defined as the persistence of depressive symptoms for at kast two years or as a diagnosis of DSM-III or DSM-III-R dysthymia, ''double depression,'' or chronic major depression. Results and conclusions: Reported prevalence rates of chronic depression range from 3 to 5 percent in community samples and from 9 to 31 percent in clinical samples. Compared with patients with major depression, those with chronic depression have increased neurotic personality traits, adverse life events, health care utilization, and comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions, especially thyroid dysfunction. Biological and family studies support the relationship of chronic depression to the major mood disorders. Chronicity is also associated with inadequate treatment with anti-depressant drugs, Serotonergic or monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be more effective in treating chronic depression than tricyclic antidepressants. Psychosocial therapies need further study but may be especially useful in combination with drug treatment. Future research should investigate the clinical and biological correlates of subtypes of chronic depression, the response of the subtypes to different antidepressants, and the relative efficacy of combined antidepressant-psychosocial treatment.

AB  - This article reviews the literature on the general health, health care utilization, prevalence, medical comorbidity, and treatment of dysthymia in medical settings. Method: The literature was searched by using MEDLINE and by reviewing the bibliographies of recent publications. Studies were selected that included health data on patients with dysthymia or chronic depression according to DSM-III, DSM-III-R, ICD-9, or RDC criteria, or patients who were described as having persistent depressive symptoms. Results: This review shows that dysthymic patients are at increased risk for poor general health and frequently use medical services. Compared to the general population, dysthymia is more prevalent in primary care and among patients with various medical and neurological conditions, sleep disorders, chronic fatigue, hypothyroidism, and somatoform disorders. Pharmacotherapy is effective, but has not been well studied. Non-tricyclic antidepressants might be especially useful. Psychotherapy studies are virtually nonexistent. Conclusions: Although dysthymia is considered a minor depressive condition, these findings show that it is a significant public health problem, comparable to major depression. Recent efforts to improve the recognition and treatment of major depression in medical settings, therefore, should be extended to include the entire spectrum of depressive disorders. Future studies should investigate the type and pattern of medical comorbidity and health care utilization, different antidepressant and psychosocial therapies, and the clinical and biological correlates of treatment response in different chronic depressive subtypes in medical settings and compare them to major depressive and subsyndromal depressive conditions.

AB  - This paper reviews the central role of self-efficacy expectations in a variety of approaches to organizational performance and management. It also explores the implications of self-efficacy for the study of psychological burn-out. It is proposed that conceptualizing burn-out as a crisis in self-efficacy would allow a more reasonable understanding of moderate instances of the syndrome, and would differentiate the concept of burn-out distinctly from the related field of occupational stress. The paper proposes the utility of a more specific construct of professional efficacy in light of the essential achievement experiences which occur in the workplace. It is proposed that a clearer delineation of the role of professional efficacy throughout these research approaches would enhance the coherence of the field. In conclusion the paper discusses implications for research and practice.

AB  - From ancient history to present times, mankind has sought for anxiolytics, and various medications have been found and consequently used, at present culminating in heavy benzodiazepine use. Side-effects such as dependence and tolerance have always induced the need, and accordingly the search, for new and better treatments. The 5-HT1A receptor agonists like buspirone are an example of such new therapeutic agents. Whether or not those compounds will indeed be better as well remains to be seen. Recently another new class of putative anxiolytics has been proposed. the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The present article reviews the evidence for anxiolytic activity of this new class of compounds in animal models of anxiety. Compared to the established anxiolytics (benzodiazepines and, to a lesser extent, 5-HT1A receptor agonists) 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have a different anxiolytic profile. They are active in a limited number of animal models, they often are very potent and the ratio between therapeutic activity and side-effects is remarkably large. No evidence for tolerance or rebound effects was found, which makes them an attractive alternative to the benzodiazepines. Preliminary human clinical data are controversial; some investigators have reported positive effects in anxiety, others have not been able to demonstrate this.

Also, some of the controversies in the field, as well as a summary of the most salient points of the review, will be discussed. Previous sections of this review dealt with the classification of depressive disorders and research techniques for studying the biochemical mechanisms of these disorders (Part I) and various transmitter/receptor theories of depressive disorder (Part II).

AB  - Child sexual abuse is a commonly encountered and often emotionally damaging experience, maintained by secrecy and followed by denial after disclosure. Treatment in this field involves both the child and the family in a variety of treatment settings and modalities, often proceeding in parallel. Child developmental considerations dictate that treatment often proceeds in phases. It aims to protect the child from further abuse and the consequences of disclosure, and address the trauma and context of the abuse. Careful planning and co-operation is required by the many professionals working in this stressful area in order to avoid confusion, conflicts, and splits which may mirror relationships in the family. The heterogeneity of the problem is reflected in the fact that treatment cannot be offered in a uniform programme. Legal issues may influence the treatment process. Evaluation of treatment modalities, the identification of protective factors and achieving long-term adjustment in the least detrimental manner offer challenges in this newly developing field.

AB  - Most psychological, physiological, and computational models of early vision suggest that retinal information is divided into a parallel set of feature modules. The dominant theories of visual search assume that these modules form a "blackboard" architecture: a set of independent representations that communicate only through a central processor. A review of research shows that blackboard-based theories, such as feature-integration theory, cannot easily explain the existing data. The experimental evidence is more consistent with a "network" architecture, which stresses that: (1) feature modules are directly connected to one another, (2) features and their locations are represented together, (3) feature detection and integration are not distinct processing stages, and (4) no executive control process, such as focal attention, is needed to integrate features. Attention is not a spotlight that synthesizes objects from raw features. Instead, it is better to conceptualize attention as an aperture which masks irrelevant visual information.

In addition to integrating these data, problems and future directions in this research are discussed. The review is presented in three parts. This study, Part I, describes diagnostic classification schemes for depressive disorders, some epidemiological and biological correlates of the classifications, and research techniques for investigating depressive disorders. Research techniques include animal models, human biochemical techniques, and Positron Emission Tomography. In a future issue, Part II will discuss various transmitter/receptor theories of depressive disorders, e.g., noradrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic, GABAergic, and peptidergic theories. Also in a future issue, Part III will discuss treatments for depression and some of the controversies in the field.

AB  - Fish in low-alkalinity lakes having pH of 6.0-6.5 or less often have higher body or tissue burdens of mercury, cadmium, and lead than do fish in nearby lakes with higher pH. The greater bioaccumulation of these metals in such waters seems to result partly from the greater aqueous abundances of biologically available forms (CH3Hg+, Cd2+, and Pb2+) at low pH. In addition, the low concentrations of aqueous calcium in low-alkalinity lakes increase the permeability of biological membranes to these metals, which in fish may cause greater uptake from both water and food. Fish exposed to aqueous inorganic aluminum in the laboratory and field accumulate the metal in and on the epithelial cells of the gills; however, there is little accumulation of aluminum in the blood or internal organs. In low-pH water, both sublethal and lethal toxicity of aluminum has been clearly demonstrated in both laboratory and field studies at environmental concentrations. In contrast, recently measured aqueous concentrations of total mercury, methylmercury, cadmium, and lead in low-alkalinity lakes are much lower than the aqueous concentrations known to cause acute or chronic toxicity in fish, although the vast majority of toxicological research has involved waters with much higher ionic strength than that in low-alkalinity lakes. Additional work with fish is needed to better assess (1) the toxicity of aqueous metals in low-alkalinity waters, and (2) the toxicological significance of dietary methylmercury and cadmium.

AB  - This chapter summarizes behavioral and neurochemical data on the delayed effect of locus coeruleus stimulation on learning capabilities in the rat. The initial observation showed that electrical stimulation of the locus coeruleus of a 15-day-old-rat improved the early stages of acquisition and extinction of a food-reinforced task performed 4 weeks later. Neurochemical lesion of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle performed 10 days before the stimulation did not attenuate the behavioral effect, whereas the lesion of the locus coeruleus proper suppressed the subsequent behavioral improvement. More recently we showed that the increase of adrenocorticotrophin release consecutive to a moderate stressful situation was significantly lower in previously stimulated rats than in implanted nonstimulated animals. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the neurochemical lesion of the locus coeruleus increased neophobia in the open-field as well as in a specific exploration task. Taken together these data strongly suggest that the long-term improvement in acquisition and extinction of locus coeruleus-stimulated rats results mainly from an attenuated stress reaction when these animals are confronted with a new environment (beginning of acquisition) or a new situation (beginning of extinction). Finally, we were interested in investigating the possibility of some long-term neurochemical modifications that could be related to the observed behavioral effects. The most significant modification observed concerned certain subpopulations of adrenoceptors in specific brain regions. By using specific ligands of the beta-, alpha-1- and alpha-2-adrenoceptors, we studied the long-term effect (4 weeks) of the locus coeruleus stimulation on the kinetic characteristics of these three sub-types of receptors in four brain areas (the cortex. hippocampus, hypothalamus and brainstem). No significant alteration in the density of beta-binding sites was observed in any of the four structures analyzed; likewise locus coeruleus stimulation did not modify the density or affinity of the beta-, alpha-1- and alpha-2-receptors in the brainstem. The density of alpha-1- and alpha-2-receptors was significantly increased in the cortex whereas in the hippocampus only the density of the alpha-2-receptors was increased. Finally, a very large increase of the density of alpha-2-adrenoceptors was observed in the hypothalamus (113%). In each case the increase in receptor density was also associated with a decreased affinity. A behavioral counterpart of these changes in the kinetic properties of the alpha-2-receptors has been observed by using a pharmacological approach. The injection of small doses of clonidine induced. in stimulated rats (4 weeks after the stimulation), a delayed hyperactivity in the open-field 24 h after the injection whereas such hyperactivity was never observed in implanted non-stimulated animals. These neurochemical data are discussed. The stress-reduction hypothesis formulated above is tentatively related to the binding data which showed that the most significant increase of the alpha-2-receptors was observed in the hypothalamus.

AB  - Many components of abortion care in early pregnancy can safely be provided on an outpatient basis by mid-level providers or by pregnant people themselves. Yet, some states impose non-evidence-based provider restrictions, understood as legal or regulatory restrictions on who may provide or manage all or some aspects of abortion care. These restrictions are inconsistent with the World Health Organization's support for the optimization of the roles of various health workers, and do not usually reflect evidence-based determinations of who can provide abortion. As a matter of international human rights law, states should ensure that the regulation of abortion is evidence-based and proportionate, and disproportionate impacts must be remedied. Furthermore, states are obliged take steps to ensure women do not have to undergo unsafe abortion, to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality, and to effectively protect women and girls from the physical and mental risks associated with unsafe abortion. States must revise their laws to ensure this. Where laws restrict those with the training and competence to provide from participating in abortion care, they are prima facie arbitrary and disproportionate and thus in need of reform. This review, developed by experts in reproductive health, law, policy, and human rights, examined the impact of provider restrictions on people seeking abortion, and medical professionals. The evidence from this review suggests that provider restrictions have negative implications for access to quality abortion, contributing inter alia to delays and recourse to unsafe abortion. A human rights-based approach to abortion regulation would require the removal of overly restrictive provider restrictions. The review provides evidence that speaks to possible routes for regulatory reform by expanding the health workforce involved in abortion-related care, as well as expanding health workers' roles, both of which could improve timely access to first trimester surgical and medical abortion, reduce costs, save time, and reduce the need for travel.
   Plain language summary
   This review identifies evidence of the impacts of provider restrictions on people seeking to access abortion and on abortion providers. It pursues a methodology designed to ensure the full integration of public health and human rights standards developed by the research team and published elsewhere. The evidence from this review points clearly to provider restrictions having negative implications for health outcomes, health systems, and human rights. This is especially important as international guidance provided by the WHO indicates best practice in provision and management of abortion and shows clearly that undue provider restrictions are not justified by reference to the nature and complexity of abortion.

AB  - The nature of "the self" has been one of the central problems in philosophy and more recently in neuroscience. This raises various questions: (i) Call we attribute a self to animals? (ii) Do animals and humans share certain aspects of their core selves, yielding a trans-species concept of self? (iii) What are the neural processes that underlie a possible trans-species concept of self? (iv) What are the developmental aspects and do they result in various levels of self-representation? Drawing on recent literature from both human and animal research, we suggest a trans-species concept of self that is based upon what has been called a "core-self" which can be described by self-related processing (SRP) as a specific mode of interaction between organism and environment. When we refer to specific neural networks, we will here refer to the underlying system as the "core-SELF." The core-SELF provides primordial neural coordinates that represent organisms as living creatures-at the lowest level this elaborates interoceptive states along with raw emotional feelings (i.e., the intentions in action of a primordial core-SELF) while higher media] cortical levels facilitate affective-cognitive integration (yielding a fully-developed nomothetic core-self). Developmentally, SRP allows stimuli from the environment to be related and linked to organismic needs, signaled and processed within core-self structures within subcorical-cortical midline structures (SCMS) that provide the foundation for epigenetic emergence of ecologically framed, higher idiographic forms of selfhood across different individuals within a species. These functions ultimately operate as a coordinated network. We postulate that core SRP operates automatically, is deeply affective, and is developmentally and epigenetically connected to sensory-motor and higher cognitive abilities. This core-self is mediated by SCMS, embedded in visceral and instinctual representations of the body that are well integrated with basic attentional, emotional and motivational functions that are apparently shared between humans, non-human mammals, and perhaps ill a proto-SELF form, other vertebrates. Such a trans-species concept of organismic coherence is thoroughly biological and affective at the lowest levels of a complex neural network, and culturally and ecologically molded at higher levels of neural processing. It allows organisms to selectively adapt to and integrate with physical and social environments. Such a psychobiologically universal, but environmentally diversified, concept may promote novel trans-species studies of the core-self across mammalian species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: The allied health workforce is one of the largest workforces in the health industry. It has a critical role in cost-effective, preventative health care, but it is poorly accessible in rural areas worldwide. This review aimed to inform policy and research priorities for increasing access to rural allied health services in Australia by describing the extent, range and nature of evidence about this workforce.
   Methods: A scoping review of published, peer-reviewed rural allied health literature from Australia, Canada, the USA, New Zealand and Japan was obtained from six databases (February 1999 February 2019).
   Results: Of 7305 no-duplicate articles, 120 published studies were included: 19 literature reviews, and 101 empirical studies from Australia (n=90), Canada (n=8), USA (n=2) and New Zealand (n=1). Main themes were workforce and scope (n=9), rural pathways (n=44), recruitment and retention (n=31), and models of service (n=36). Of the empirical studies, 83% per cent were cross-sectional; 64% involved surveys; only 7% were at a national scale. Rural providers were shown to have a breadth of practice, servicing large catchments with high patient loads, requiring rural-specific skills. Most rural practitioners had rural backgrounds, but rural youth faced barriers to accessing allied health courses. Rural training opportunities have increased in Australia but predominantly as short-term placements. Rural placements were associated with increased likelihood of rural work by graduates compared with discipline averages, and high quality placement experiences were linked with return. Recruitment and retention factors may vary by discipline, sector and life stage but important factors were satisfying jobs, workplace supervision, higher employment grade, sustainable workload, professional development and rural career options. Patient-centred planning and regional coordination of public and private providers with clear eligibility and referral to pathways facilitated patient care. Outreach and telehealth models may improve service distribution although require strong local coordination and training for distal staff.
   Conclusion: Evidence suggests that more accessible rural allied health services in Australia should address three key policy areas. First improving rural jobs with access to senior workplace supervision and career options will help to improve networks of critical mass. Second, training skilled and qualified workers through more continuous, high quality rural pathways is needed to deliver a complementary workforce for the community. Third, distribution depends on networked service models at the regional level, with viable remuneration, outreach and telehealth for practice in smaller communities. More national-scale, longitudinal, outcomes-focused studies are needed using controlled designs.

AB  - The command and control of limb movements by the cerebellar and reflex pathways are modeled by means of a circuit whose structure is deduced from functional constraints. One constraint is that fast limb movements must be accurate although they cannot be continuously controlled in closed loop by use of sensory signals. Thus, the pathways which process the motor orders must contain approximate inverse functions of the bio-mechanical functions of the limb and of the muscles. This can be achieved by means of parallel feedback loops, whose pattern turns out to be comparable to the anatomy of the cerebellar pathways. They contain neural networks able to anticipate the motor consequences of the motor orders, modeled by artificial neural networks whose connectivity is similar to that of the cerebellar cortex. These networks learn the direct biomechanical functions of the limbs and muscles by means of a supervised learning process. Teaching signals calculated from motor errors are sent to the learning sites, as, in the cerebellum, complex spikes issued from the inferior olive are conveyed to the Purkinje cells by climbing fibers. Learning rules are deduced by a differential calculation, as classical gradient rules, and they account for the long term depression which takes place in the dendritic arborizations of the Purkinje cells.
   Another constraint is that reflexes must not impede voluntary movements while remaining at any instant ready to oppose perturbations. Therefore, efferent copies of the motor orders are sent to the interneurones of the reflexes, where they cancel the sensory-motor consequences of the voluntary movements.
   After learning, the model is able to drive accurately, both in velocity and position, angular movements of a rod actuated by two pneumatic McKibben muscles. Reflexes comparable to the myotatic and tendinous reflexes, and stabilizing reactions comparable to the cerebellar sensory-motor reactions, reduce efficiently the effects of perturbing torques. These results allow to link the behavioral concepts of the equilibrium-point "lambda model" [J Motor Behav 18 (1986) 17] with anatomical and physiological features: gains of reflexes and sensori-motor reactions set the slope of the "invariant characteristic," and efferent copies set the "threshold of the stretch reflex."
   Thus, mathematical and physical laws account for the raison d'etre of the inhibitory nature of Purkinje cells and for the conspicuous anatomical pattern of the cerebellar pathways. These properties of these pathways allow to perform approximate inverse calculations after learning of direct functions, and insure also the coordination of voluntary and reflex motor orders.

AB  - Research evidence suggests that heterogeneity in emotion processing difficulties in autistic individuals may reflect co-occurring alexithymia. Elevated levels of alexithymia is a robust finding in the adult autistic population but there is a relative poverty regarding the corresponding research in younger populations. The aim of this review is to investigate associations between autism and alexithymia in children and adolescents, so that we can better understand the nature and impact of alexithymia in autistic individuals early on in their lives. Online scientific databases were systematically reviewed for studies on autistic children and adolescents and co-occurring alexithymia. A total of eight studies were identified. Evidence indicated that alexithymia prevalence in autistic individuals is higher compared to their typically developing peers and is closely related to the emotional and social deficits involved in autism but not to the associated cognitive deficits. Main concerns associated with these results are related to the alexithymia assessment measures implemented in each study, their limitations, and potential effects on the validity of findings. This review sheds light on the topic of alexithymia in children and adolescents and underscores the difficulties in conducting this research, while providing insights for research with autistic children and adolescents. Lay abstract In this study, we aim to explore the ability of autistic children to process emotions and respond to a range of feelings in relation to a triad of difficulties known as alexithymia, namely children's difficulties to recognize, describe, and distinguish emotions. Alexithymia is common in autistic adults but we know very little about children. To understand this condition better, within a large group of studies, first we study the extent to which alexithymia difficulties are present in autistic children. In reviewing the literature, we also present the assessment measures implemented in each study, their limitations, and potential effects on our understanding of findings. This knowledge will help us understand the extent to which alexithymia is present in autistic children and how it may be related to their emotional difficulties. Also, it will allow us to further detect challenges early on in children's lives so that we recommend interventions that teach autistic children how to recognize, describe, and distinguish emotions in themselves and in others. Such interventions may include family members of autistic children to assist interactions with their child. Supporting children from an early age will help them develop skills that will ready them for school and life and it will enhance their ability to build supportive relationships and meet their fullest potential.

AB  - Few would dispute that law and legal procedures lie at the core of American self-identity and are woven deeply into the fabric of our culture. Indeed, our nation's faith in law has frequently been the subject of criticism. Most recently, self-proclaimed "communitarian" commentators have warned that our insistence on legal solutions is encouraging us to become a society of litigants whose attachment to "rights talk" and legal battles is thwarting our ability to reach consensus on social issues or instill shared values in our communities. While there are many possible responses to such a critique, this Essay offers one that is perhaps less familiar. Instead of simply arguing that law is a necessary evil or an important counterweight to majoritarian pressures, Professor Berman asks whether we can conceive of ways in which law actually helps foster community by creating a forum for useful discussion and debate among differing worldviews.
   In order to explore the possible benefits to be gained from using "law talk" to address societal conflicts, Professor Berman draws on his prior research concerning trials of animals and inanimate objects in medieval and early modern Europe and in ancient Greece. These seemingly bizarre legal proceedings may provide a useful thought experiment that allows us to imagine three possible social functions of law more generally. First, the mere assertion of legal jurisdiction may, in and of itself, help to define the boundaries of membership in a community. Second, law provides a rationalizing framework and a formal discourse that encourages a dialogue built on appeals to broader philosophical and legal principles. In addition, the ritualized nature of legal discourse may itself be a source of comfort in times of traumatic stress. Third, and perhaps most importantly, legal and quasi-legal discourse, particularly when it is widely dispersed within a culture, may provide a useful language both for debating and contesting social and political issues and for adjudicating among the multiple narratives that are inevitably present in a heterogeneous society. Thus, law may function as a symbolic terrain of engagement for competing worldviews. In this vision, our supposed national tendency to wage legal battles may not be a sign of true divisiveness, but rather of the constructive need for a discursive forum to tell alternative stories.
   If law can actually play such a generative discursive role, then perhaps our nation's abiding legal faith is not solely the albatross we have been led to believe it is. Perhaps our faith is also an opportunity. By creating both a forum and a language for conversation among diverse cultural narratives, and by establishing a commitment to a culture of conversation about competing values, legal debates can foster dialogue in a postmodern culture where most historical verities have been exposed as products of hierarchy. Such dialogue, because it includes the possibility for continuous self-criticism and re-creation, may even open the space for generating bridges to a transformed future.

AB  - This article is dedicated to my beloved mother, Zofia Kuzak, Honorary Member of the Polish Neuropsychological Society, and my highest moral authority, to honor her 100th birthday. During the Nazi occupation, at the age of 23, she was deported to Germany and forced into slave labour at a German camp, from which she managed to escape. During this escape she had to sit for three long days high up in a tree, without food and without anything to drink, something made possible by her strong physical condition. After three days, she dared to leave the tree and, in throwing the Nazis pursuing her, she ran away not to the South - to her home in Nowy Sacz, but to the North to Poznan, where she took refuge in the apartment of other relatives, true Polish patriots. She stayed there for the years 1943-1947, keeping the accounts at the large family grocery store. The experiences from this period influenced the formation of her own self and her identity. Her stories about times of tragedy and her ways of dealing with the darkest moments in her life contributed to the fact that I became interested in the subject of the self and identity. I have prepared two monographs and several articles on this topic. This article presents a new approach to integrated self system, associated not only with the physical organism, but also with the social and cultural world. The foundation of this approach to the self is microgenetic theory, especially its account of consciousness, of the transition from self to image, act and object, the epochal nature of this transition, and its relation to introspection, imagination and agency. The affinities of microgenetic theory to many aspects of the thought process should be evident to readers of this journal, but the theory, which was developed from studies of pathological cases, rests on a wealth of clinical detail. In brief, the micro-temporal transition from archaic to recent formations (distributed systems) in the phyletic history of the forebrain constitutes the absolute mental state, with consciousness the relation of self to image and/or object. The reader will be able also to find here the overlapping of states, the continuity of the core over successive states, and subjective time experience. However, the integrated self system is associated not only with the operation of the biological brain and its complex patterns of neural connections, but also with the activity of the social mind/brain, in terms of bonds created within social groups, as well as the cultural mind/brain creating the world of cultural values, including religious ones. I will sum up with a model of self system changing in time (4D), pulsating according to the states of mind (5D) forming different numbers of "bits" of information, as marked on the x axis, and linked to the duration of memories, marked on the y axis. The self system also depends on gravity (6D), and other hyperspace dimensions hitherto unknown in neuroscience.

AB  - Energy is the motor of life. Energy ensures the organism's survival and competitive advantage for reproductive success. For almost 3 billion years, unicellular organisms were the only life form on earth. Competition for limited energy resources and raw materials exerted an incessant selective pressure on organisms. In the adverse environment and due to their 'feast and famine' life style, hardiness to a variety of stressors, particularly to nutrient deprivation, was the selection principle. Both resistance and mutagenic adaptation to stressors were established as survival strategies by means of context-specific processes creating stability or variability of DNA sequence. The conservation of transduction pathways and functional homology of effector molecules clearly bear witness that the principles of life established during prokaryotic and eukaryotic unicellular evolution, although later diversified, have been unshakably cast to persist during metazoan phylogenesis. A wealth of evidence suggests that unicellular organisms evolved the phenomena of differentiation and apoptosis, sexual reproduction, and even aging, as responses to environmental challenges. These evolutionary accomplishments were elaborated from the dichotomous resistance/mutagenesis response and sophisticated the capacity of cells to tune their genetic information to changing environmental conditions. Notably, the social deprivation responses, differentiation and apoptosis, evolved as intercellularly coordinated events: a multitude of differentiation processes were elaborated from sporulation, the prototypic stress resistance response, while apoptosis, contrary to current concepts, is no altruistic cell suicide but was programmed as a mutagenic survival response; this response, however, is socially thwarted leading into mutagenic error catastrophe. In the hybrid differentiation-apoptosis process, cytocide and cannibalism of apoptotic cells thus serve the purpose of fueling the survival of the selfish genes in the differentiating cells. However, successful mutagenesis, although repressed, persisted in the asocial stress response of carcinogenesis as a regression to primitive unicellular behavior following failure of intercellular communication. While somatic mutagenesis was largely prevented, Metazoa elaborated germ cell mutagenesis as an evolutionary vehicle. Genetic competence, a primitive, stress-induced mating behavior, evolved into sexual reproduction which harnessed mutagenesis by subjecting highly mutable germ cells to a rigid viability selection. These processes were programmatically fixed as life- and cell-cycle events but retained their deprivation response phenotypes. Thus, the differentiation-apoptosis tandem evolved as the 'clay' to mold the specialized structures and functions of a multicellular organism while sexual reproduction elaborated the principle of quality-checked mutagenesis to create the immense diversity of Metazoa following the Cambrian explosion. Throughout these events, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which are regulated by energy homeostasis, shape the genetic information in a regulated but random, uncoded process providing the fitness-related feedback of phenotype to genotype. The interplay of genes and environment establishes a dynamic stimulus-response feedback cycle which, in animate nature, may be the organizing principle to contrive the reciprocal duality of energy and matter.

AB  - Glycolysis, the process responsible for the conversion of monosaccharides to pyruvic acid, is a ubiquitous feature of cellular metabolism and was the first major biochemical pathway to be well characterized. Although the majority of glycolytic enzymes are common to all organisms, the past quarter of a century has revealed that glycolysis in higher plants possesses numerous distinctive features. Research in the nineteenth century established convincingly that plants carry out alcoholic fermentation under anaerobic conditions. In 1878, Wilhelm Pfeffer asserted that a non-oxygen-requiring 'intramolecular respiration' was involved in the aerobic respiration of plants. Between 1900 and 1950 it was demonstrated that plants metabolize sugar and starch by a glycolytic pathway broadly similar to that of yeasts and muscle tissue. In 1948, the first purification and characterization of a plant glycolytic enzyme, aldolase, was published by Paul Stumpf. By 1960 the presence of each of the 10 enzymes of glycolysis, presumed at the time to be located in the cytosol, had been confirmed in higher plants. Shortly after 1960 it was shown that the mechanism of glycolytic regulation in plants had features in common with that of animals and yeasts, especially as regards the important role played by the enzyme phosphofructokinase; but important regulatory properties peculiar to plants were soon demonstrated. In the last 30 years, higher-plant glycolysis has been found to exhibit a number of additional characteristics peculiar to plant systems. One conspicuous feature of plant glycolysis, discovered in the 1970s, is the presence of a complete or nearly complete sequence of glycolytic enzymes in plastids, distinct and spatially separated from the glycolytic enzymes located in the cytosol. Plastidic and cytosolic isoenzymes of glycolysis have been shown to differ in their kinetic and regulatory properties, suggesting that the two pathways are independently regulated. Since about 1980 it has become increasingly clear that the cytosolic glycolysis of plants may make use of several enzymes other than the conventional ones found in ye as ts, muscle tissue and plant plastids: these enzymes include a pyrophosphate- dependent phosphofructokinase, a non-reversible and nonphosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase (vacuolar location) and a three-enzyme sequence able to produce pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate avoiding the pyruvate-kinase step, These non-conventional enzymes may catalyze glycolysis in the plant cytosol especially under conditions of metabolic stress. Experiments on transgenic plants possessing significantly elevated or reduced (reduced to virtually nil in some cases) levels of glycolytic enzymes are currently playing an important part in improving our understanding of the regulation of plant glycolysis; such experiments illustrate an impressive degree of flexibility in the pathway's operation. Plant cells are able to make use of enzymes bypassing or substituting for several of the conventional enzymic steps in the glycolytic pathway; the extent and conditions under which these bypasses operate are the subject of current research. The duplication of the glycolytic pathway in plants and the flexible nature of the pathway have possibly evolved in relation to the crucial biosynthetic role played by plant glycolysis beyond its function in energy generation; both functions must proceed if a plant is to survive under varying and often stressful environmental or nutritional conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary: Wheat is a major crop consumed by a large population of the world. Hence, increasing its nutritional value can largely handle the malnutrition issues of the growing population. In the past few decades, different biofortification techniques including conventional breeding, transgenic approach, and agronomic biofortification have been largely employed for increasing the nutrient content in wheat grains. However, all of these techniques have their own drawbacks such as environmental hazards, long time requirement, reduced acceptability etc. Thus, nanobiofortification of wheat crop has gained interest as an efficient alternative strategy to achieve nutritional gains. However, there is still a long way forward to effectively utilize nanotechnology for wheat nutritional development. In this scenario, a review on the current advancement in wheat nanobiofortification is highly required so that the lacking points in this research area can be identified and accomplished. However, such a review article has been missing so far. This review describes the progress in the use of nanomaterials for wheat biofortification till date. It will help the scientific community to identify the lack in this research area and widely implement the nanotechnology to biofortify wheat crops.
   The deficiency of nutrients in food crops is a major issue affecting the health of human beings, mainly in underdeveloped areas. Despite the development in the methods of food fortification, several barriers such as lack of proper regulations and smaller public-private partnerships hinder its successful implementation in society. Consequently, genetic and agronomic biofortification has been suggested as the potential techniques for fortifying the nutrients in diets. However, the time-consuming nature and restricted available diversity in the targeted crop gene pool limit the benefits of genetic biofortification. In agronomic biofortification, organic fertilizers face the problem of prolonged duration of nutrients release and lesser content of minerals; while in inorganic fertilizers, the large-sized fertilizers (greater than 100 nm) suffer from volatilization and leaching losses. The application of nanotechnology in agriculture holds enormous potential to cope with these challenges. The utility of nanomaterials for wheat biofortification gains its importance by supplying the appropriate dose of fertilizer at the appropriate time diminishing the environmental concerns and smoothening the process of nutrient uptake and absorption. Wheat is a major crop whose nano-biofortification can largely handle the issue of malnutrition and nutrients deficiency in human beings. Though several research experiments have been conducted at small levels to see the effects of nano-biofortification on wheat plants, a review article providing an overview of such studies and summarizing the benefits and outcomes of wheat nano-biofortification is still lacking. Although a number of review articles are available on the role of nanotechnology in wheat crop, these are mostly focused on the role of nanoparticles in alleviating biotic and abiotic stress conditions in wheat. None of them focused on the prospects of nanotechnology for wheat biofortification. Hence, in this review for the first time, the current advancement in the employment of different nanotechnology-based approaches for wheat biofortification has been outlined. Different strategies including the supply of nano-based macro- and micronutrients that have shown promising results for wheat improvement have been discussed in detail. Understanding several aspects related to the safe usage of nanomaterials and their future perspectives may enhance their successful utilization in terms of economy and fulfillment of nutritional requirements following wheat nano-biofortification.

AB  - The aim of this review is to provide a thorough overview of the health effects from the complexed biomagnified mixture of long-range transported industrial organochlorines (OCs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and mercury (Hg) on polar bear (Ursus maritimus) health. Multiple scientific studies of polar bears indicate negative relationships between exposure to these contaminants and health parameters; however, these are all of a correlative nature and do not represent true cause-and-effects. Therefore, information from controlled studies of farmed Norwegian Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and housed East and West Greenland sledge dogs (Canis familiaris) were included as supportive weight of evidence in the clarification of contaminant exposure and health effects in polar bears. The review showed that hormone and vitamin concentrations, liver, kidney and thyroid gland morphology as well as reproductive and immune systems of polar bears are likely to be influenced by contaminant exposure. Furthermore, exclusively based on polar bear contaminant studies, bone density reduction and neurochemical disruption and DNA hypomethylation of the brain stem seemed to occur. The range of tissue concentration, at which these alterations were observed in polar bears, were ca. 1-70,000 ng/g lw for OCs (blood plasma concentrations of some PCB metabolites even higher), ca. 1-1000 ng/g lw for PBDEs and for PFCs and Hg 114-3052 ng/g ww and 0.1-50 mu g/g ww, respectively. Similar concentrations were found in farmed foxes and housed sledge dogs while the lack of dose response designs did not allow an estimation of threshold levels for oral exposure and accumulated tissue concentrations. Nor was it possible to pinpoint a specific group of contaminants being more important than others nor analyze their interactions. For East Greenland polar bears the corresponding daily Sigma OC and Sigma PBDE oral exposure was estimated to be 35 and 0.34 mu g/kg body weight, respectively. Furthermore, PFC concentrations, at which population effect levels could occur, are likely to be reached around year 2012 for the East Greenland polar bear subpopulation if current increasing temporal trends continue. Such proposed reproductive population effects were supported by physiological based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling of critical body residues (CBR) with risk quotients >= 1 for Sigma PCB. dieldrin, Sigma PFC and Sigma OHC (organohalogen contaminant). The estimated daily TEQ for East Greenland polar bears and East Greenland sledge dogs were 32-281-folds above WHO Sigma TEQ guidelines for humans. Compared to human tolerable daily intake (TDI), these were exceeded for PCBs, dieldrin, chlordanes and Sigma HCH in East Greenland polar bears. Comparisons like these should be done with caution, but together with the CBR modelling and T-score estimations, these were the only available tools for polar bear risk evaluation. In conclusion, polar bears seem to be susceptible to contaminant induced stress that may have an overall sub-clinical impact on their health and population status via impacts on their immune and reproductive systems.

AB  - Physical inactivity continues to be a global issue with many adolescents and adults failing to meet the recommendations for daily exercise. Efforts to reduce physical inactivity in adults include the incorporation of strategies such as workplace physical activity programs, especially for sedentary workers. In this systematic literature review we examined current literature about the efficacy of workplace physical activity programs, as well as the barriers and enablers to these programs. Six EBSCO databases were searched (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, APA PsycInfo, APA PsycArticles and SPORTDiscus with full text) between a ten year period (2011 to 2021). The search terms used were "physical activity", "workplace" and "program" along with their variations. Following a systematic process, eighteen papers met the eligibility criteria. The authors analysed the findings using a narrative synthesis, in which four themes emerged from the data. These include Benefits to physical health, Benefits to mental health, Barriers to workplace physical activity and Workplace activity enablers. These findings provided several recommendations for organizations that endeavour to improve the health of workplace employees. Generalised workplace physical activity programs were viewed favourably by both employees and employers. Incorporating these practices into daily work structures may provide favourable outcomes such as increased work productivity and reduced physical inactivity.

AB  - Cognitive flexibility is a widely studied construct and is considered an important treatment target for several psychological disorders. The convergence of several independent fields of research has led to assumptions about the assessment of cognitive flexibility - assumptions that are not empirically supported and often conflate different notions of flexibility. This critical review discusses how the conflation of self-report and neurocognitive assessments has seemingly arisen from literature on eating disorders. We describe how seminal early observations of "inflexible " personality characteristics, communication competence research, and investigations of frontal lobe function after injury led to two methods of assessing "cognitive flexibility ". We discuss the impact that conflation of self-report and neurocognitive assessments has had on the field, and we provide recommendations for assessing cognitive flexibility in both research and clinical settings.

AB  - Background The global population is ageing rapidly, with low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) undergoing a fast demographic transition. As the number of older adults in LMICs increases, services able to effectively address their physical and mental health needs will be increasingly important. Objective We review the health and socioeconomic resources currently available for older people in South Asian countries, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, to identify gaps in available resources and assess areas for improvement. Methods We conducted a search of grey and published literature via Google Search, Compendex, EBSCO, JSTOR, Medline, Ovid, ProQuest databases, Scopus and Web of Science. Data on population demographics, human resources, health funding and social protection for older people were extracted. Local informants were consulted to supplement and verify the data. Results In the study countries, the number of health professionals with expertise in elderly care was largely unknown, with minimal postgraduate training programmes available in elderly medicine or psychiatry. Older adults are therefore cared for by general physicians, nurses and community health workers, all of whom are present in insufficient numbers per capita. Total average healthcare expenditure was 2.5-5.5% of GDP, with 48.1-72.0% of healthcare costs covered by out-of-pocket payments. Pakistan did not have a social pension; only India and Nepal offered financial assistance to people with dementia; and all countries had disproportionately low numbers of care elderly homes. Conclusions Inadequate healthcare funding, a shortage of healthcare professionals and insufficient government pension and social security schemes are significant barriers to achieving universal health coverage in LMICs. Governing bodies must expand training programmes for healthcare providers for older adults, alongside increasing social protection to improve access to those in need and to prevent catastrophic health expenditure.

AB  - Although there are methods of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to virtual reality (VR) solutions, there are few studies in the literature. Thus, to fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review of these methods. In this review, we apply a methodology proposed in the literature that locates existing studies, selects and evaluates contributions, analyses, and synthesizes data. We used Google Scholar and databases such as Elsevier's Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select documents. The results showed that when AI methods are used in VR applications, the main advantages are high efficiency and precision of algorithms. Moreover, we observe that machine learning is the most applied AI scientific technique in VR applications. In conclusion, this paper showed that the combination of AI and VR contributes to new trends, opportunities, and applications for human-machine interactive devices, education, agriculture, transport, 3D image reconstruction, and health. We also concluded that the usage of AI in VR provides potential benefits in other fields of the real world such as teleconferencing, emotion interaction, tourist services, and image data extraction.

AB  - Movement dataset reviews exist but are limited in coverage, both in terms of size and research discipline. While topic-specific reviews clearly have their merit, it is critical to have a comprehensive overview based on a systematic survey across disciplines. This enables higher visibility of datasets available to the research communities and can foster interdisciplinary collaborations. We present a catalogue of 704 open datasets described by 10 variables that can be valuable to researchers searching for secondary data: name and reference, creation purpose, data type, annotations, source, population groups, ordinal size of people captured simultaneously, URL, motion capture sensor, and funders. The catalogue is available in the supplementary materials. We provide an analysis of the datasets and further review them under the themes of human diversity, ecological validity, and data recorded. The resulting 12-dimension framework can guide researchers in planning the creation of open movement datasets. This work has been the interdisciplinary effort of researchers across affective computing, clinical psychology, disability innovation, ethnomusicology, human-computer interaction, machine learning, music cognition, music computing, and movement neuroscience.

AB  - Over the last years there has been significant research on the presence and effects of plastics in terrestrial systems. Here we summarize current research findings on the effects of nano- and microplastics (NMPs) on terrestrial plants, with the aim to determine patterns of response and sensitive endpoints. We conducted a systematic review (based on 78 studies) on the effects of NMPs on germination, plant growth and biochemical biomarkers. This review highlights that the majority of studies to date have used pristine polystyrene or polyethylene particles, either in a hydroponic or pot-plant setup. Based on these studies we found that effects on plants are widespread. We noted similar responses between and within monocots and dicots to NMPs, except for consistent lower germination seen in dicots exposed to NMPs. During early development, germination and root growth are more strongly affected compared to shoot growth. NMPs induced similar adverse growth effects on plant biomass and length in the most tested plant species (lettuce, wheat, corn, and rice) irrespective of the polymer type and size used. Moreover, biomarker responses were consistent across species; chlorophyll levels were commonly negatively affected, while stress indicators (e.g., ROS or free radicals) and stress respondents (e.g., antioxidant enzymes) were consistently upregulated. In addition, effects were commonly observed at environmentally relevant levels. These findings provide clear evidence that NMPs have wide-ranging impacts on plant performance. However, as most studies have been conducted under highly controlled conditions and with pristine plastics, there is an urgent need to test under more environmentally realistic conditions to ensure the lab-based studies can be extrapolated to the field.

AB  - Research studies on social robotics and human-robot interaction have gained insights into factors that influence people's perceptions and behaviors towards robots. However, adults' perceptions of robots may differ significantly from those of infants. Consequently, extending this knowledge also to infants' attitudes toward robots is a growing field of research. Indeed, infant-robot interaction (IRI) is emerging as a critical and necessary area of research as robots are increasingly used in social environments, such as caring for infants with all types of disabilities, companionship, and education. Although studies have been conducted on the ability of robots to positively engage infants, little is known about the infants' affective state when interacting with a robot. In this systematic review, technologies for infant affective state recognition relevant to IRI applications are presented and surveyed. Indeed, adapting techniques currently employed for infant's emotion recognition to the field of IRI results to be a complex task, since it requires timely response while not interfering with the infant's behavior. Those aspects have a crucial impact on the selection of the emotion recognition techniques and the related metrics to be used for this purpose. Therefore, this review is intended to shed light on the advantages and the current research challenges of the infants' affective state recognition approaches in the IRI field, elucidates a roadmap for their use in forthcoming studies as well as potentially provide support to future developments of emotion-aware robots.

AB  - BackgroundAdopting a common elements approach, this practitioner review aims to highlight specific treatment elements that are common to interventions with demonstrated benefits in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for reducing suicide attempts and self-harm in youth. Identification of common treatment elements among effective interventions offers a key strategy for clarifying the most robust features of effective interventions and improving our ability to implement effective treatment and decrease the lag between scientific advances and clinical care. MethodsA systematic search of RCTs evaluating interventions targeting suicide/self-harm in youth (ages 12-18) yielded a total of 18 RCTs assessing 16 different manualized interventions. An open coding process was used to identify common elements present within each intervention trial. Twenty-seven common elements were identified and classified into format, process, and content categories. All trials were coded for the inclusion of these common elements by two independent raters. RCTs were also classified into those where trial results supported improvements in suicide/self-harm behavior (n = 11 supported trials) and those without supported evidence (n = 7 unsupported trials). ResultsCompared with unsupported trials, the 11 supported trials shared the following elements: (a) inclusion of therapy for both the youth and family/caregivers; (b) an emphasis on relationship-building and the therapeutic alliance; (c) utilization of an individualized case conceptualization to guide treatment; (d) provided skills training (e.g. emotion regulation skills) to both youth and their parents/caregivers; and (e) lethal means restriction counseling as part of self-harm monitoring and safety planning. ConclusionsThis review highlights key treatment elements associated with efficacy that community practitioners can incorporate in their treatments for youth presenting with suicide/self-harm behaviors.

AB  - BackgroundIndigenous youth worldwide continue to experience disproportional rates of poorer mental health and well-being compared to non-Indigenous youth. Mentoring has been known to establish favorable outcomes in many areas of health but is still in its early phases of research within Indigenous contexts. This paper explores the barriers and facilitators of Indigenous youth mentoring programs to improve mental health outcomes and provides evidence for governments' response to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.MethodsA systematic search for published studies was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and grey literature through Trove, OpenGrey, Indigenous HealthInfoNet, and Informit Indigenous Collection. All papers included in the search were peer-reviewed and published from 2007 to 2021. The Joanna Briggs Institute approaches to critical appraisal, data extraction, data synthesis, and confidence of findings were used.ResultsA total of eight papers describing six mentoring programs were included in this review; six papers were from Canada, and two originated from Australia. Studies included mentor perspectives (n = 4) (incorporating views of parents, carers, Aboriginal assistant teachers, Indigenous program facilitators, young adult health leaders, and community Elders), mentee perspectives (n = 1), and both mentor and mentee perspectives (n = 3). Programs were conducted nationally (n = 3) or within specific local Indigenous communities (n = 3) with varying mentor styles and program focus. Five synthesized findings were identified from the data extraction process, each consisting of four categories. These synthesized findings were: establishing cultural relevancy, facilitating environments, building relationships, facilitating community engagement, and leadership responsibilities, which were discussed in the context of extant mentoring theoretical frameworks.ConclusionMentoring is an appropriate strategy for improving general well-being. However, more research is needed to explore program sustainability and maintaining outcomes in the long term.

AB  - BackgroundHeat stress negatively affects poultry welfare, including the Japanese quail, especially in sub-Saharan African countries. The quail is vital to research and protein food security, which are affected by global warming. This study identified and reviewed the literature on the impact of heat stress on the Japanese quail organs to provide context for the problem and ways to mitigate it.Main bodyEligible studies for this scoping review must be primarily animal-based experiments that include Japanese quail exposure to acute or chronic heat stress. Systematic reviews, theses and dissertations that meet these criteria were also eligible for use in this review. Reports that involved other types of quail species, eggs and or cell lines were not eligible and were excluded. The databases that were searched include MEDLINE (via PubMed), SCOPUS, CAB Abstracts (via CAB Direct) and Web of Sciences (All databases). A total of 4598 records were identified. After removing 105 duplicates, 4461 and 9 were excluded during the level 1 and 2 screening, respectively. Finally, 24 papers were included for data extraction. All eligible studies were primary animal experiments, and the average heat stress temperature level was 35.3 degrees C. Morphological findings of this scoping review include macrovesicular steatosis in the liver, necrosis of kidney tubular cells, dead and abnormal sperm cells in the testis, lung congestion, and neuronal degeneration resulting from heat stress exposure.ConclusionsHeat stress negatively impacts the organs of the Japanese quail, causing cell death in the liver, brain and testis, which will affect the production and survival of the Japanese quail. In addition, some cost-effective dietary strategies tested in mitigating heat stress were recommended.

AB  - Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been associated with many adverse health outcomes. However, the evidence on such associations with the liver function was not reviewed systemically. Therefore in this study, we systemically reviewed the observational studies on exposure to PAHs and liver function. The MOOSE guidelines were applied to perform this review. We systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for all relevant articles published in English until 10 September 2022. The quality of retrieved studies was evaluated based on the Gascon et al. method. We retrieved a total of 3927 citations through the initial search, of which an overall of five articles (n = 6994 participants) was included in our final review. The quality assessment indicated that three studies had excellent, one had good, and one had fair quality. Three reviewed studies reported a significant negative association between exposure to PAHs and liver function. One study reported a significant correlation between urinary metabolites of PAHs with serum g-glutamyltransferase (GGT), two studies reported that there was an increase in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related exposure to PAH-albumin adducts as well as benzo[a]pyrene (BPDE)-DNA adducts in the blood, and two studies indicated that higher levels of urinary metabolites of PAHs were associated with higher risk of abnormal levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and GGT enzymes. Overall, our review indicated that exposure to PAHs has an adverse impact on human liver function.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) continuously release a complex mixture of municipal, hospital, industrial, and runoff chemicals into the aquatic environment. These contaminants are both legacy contaminants and emerging-concern contaminants, affecting all tissues in a fish body, particularly the liver. The fish liver is the principal detoxifying organ and effects of consistent pollutant exposure can be evident on its cellular and tissue level. The objective of this paper is thus to provide an in-depth analysis of the WWTP contaminants' impact on the fish liver structure, physiology, and metabolism. The paper also gives an overview of the fish liver biotransformation enzymes, antioxidant enzymes, and non-enzymatic antioxidants, their role in metabolizing xenobiotic compounds and coping with oxidative damage. Emphasis has been placed on highlighting the vulnerability of fish to xenobiotic compounds, and on biomonitoring of exposed fish, generally involving observation of biomarkers in caged or native fish. Furthermore, the paper systematically assesses the most common contaminants with the potential to affect fish liver tissue.

AB  - Existing literature has reported inequities in access to Canadian health care services among immigrants. The aim of this scoping review was (a) to explore research regarding Canadian immigrants' unique experiences in accessing healthcare, and (b) to provide suggestions for future research and programming considering the identified immigrant-specific service gaps in health care. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, following the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework. The review's findings suggest unmet health care access needs specific to immigrants in Canada, with the most common access barriers including communication, socioeconomic, and cultural barriers. The scoping review expands on the immigrant health care experiences and accessibility factors through a thematic analysis. Findings suggest that developing community-based programming, improving training for health care providers in culturally competent care, and policies that address the social determinants of health can improve health care accessibility among immigrants.

AB  - This article reviews a selection of books published over the last decade that explore the relationship between humans and the environment in the ancient Greek world. These publications represent a new phase of the ecological turn in classical studies, in which ancient environmental studies has emerged as a distinct subdivision of the environmental humanities. Their contributions can roughly be divided into two groups according to their approaches and goals: one applies ecocritical analyses to Greek literature, presenting alternative ecologies to those that have produced contemporary environmental crises; the other applies historical methods to written and material evidence to illuminate the realities of ancient Greek human-environment relations. The three subsections of this review provide overviews of scholarship addressing sustainability and the conservation of natural resources; ecology and religion; and societal resilience in the face of ecological stress. I suggest productive avenues for further research in each area, arguing that interdisciplinary communication and collaboration are becoming increasingly important in this evidentially, methodologically and theoretically variegated field.

We analyzed the content and methods in (a) participant characteristics, (b) study characteristics, (c) topics and theoretical frameworks, and (d) publication trends. To summarize key findings, top nations of origin included Mexico, China, and South Korea. English-speaking, young individuals and college students were overrepresented in study participants. Acculturation and enculturation was one of the most frequently used variables, topics, and theories. Nevertheless, the proportion of acculturation and enculturation research has declined over time, while research on racial bias and discrimination has increased since 2000. It suggests growing attention to sociopolitical dimensions of migration beyond cultural transition. Qualitative methods were frequently used when studying Middle Eastern immigrants, refugees, and LGBTQ issues. We evaluated the findings from strength-based, bidirectional, ecological, and intersectional perspectives and suggest directions for research, practice, advocacy, education, and training.

AB  - Spatial ability has long been regarded as important in STEM, and mental rotation, a subcategory of spatial ability, is widely accepted as the cognitive ability with the largest gender difference in favor of men. Multiple meta-analyses of various tests of spatial ability have found large gender differences in outcomes of the mental rotation test (MRT). In this paper, we argue that more recent literature suggests that the MRT is not a valid measure of mental rotation ability. More importantly, we argue that the construct of "spatial ability" itself has been co-constructed with gender, and thus has not been devised in a neutral way, but in a manner that is influenced by gender beliefs. We discuss that though spatial thinking is also required in feminized fields, past research has cast spatial ability as only necessary in masculinized STEM fields. Due to a prevailing belief that spatial ability was an inherently male ability, researchers "selectively bred" some spatial assessment instruments to maximize gender differences, rather than to precisely measure a spatial construct. We argue that such instruments, of which the MRT is one, cannot validly assess between-group differences, and ideas about biological or evolutionary causes of sex differences in spatial ability lack empirical evidence. Instead, the co-construction of gender and spatial ability better explains observed patterns. We also provide recommendations for spatial researchers moving forward.

AB  - Pesticides are a well-known family of chemicals that have contaminated water systems globally. Four common subfamilies of pesticides include organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, and carbamate insecticides which have been shown to adversely affect the human nervous system. Studies have shown a link between pesticide exposure and decreased viability, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of murine neural stem cells. Besides human exposure directly through water systems, additional factors such as pesticide bioaccumulation, biomagnification and potential synergism due to co-exposure to other environmental contaminants must be considered. A possible avenue to investigate the molecular mechanisms and biomolecules impacted by the various classes of pesticides includes the field of -omics. Discovery of the precise molecular mechanisms behind pesticidemediated neurodegenerative disorders may facilitate development of targeted therapeutics. Likewise, discovery of pesticide biodegradation pathways may enable novel approaches for water system bioremediation using genetically engineered microorganisms. In this minireview, we discuss recently established harmful impacts of various categories of pesticides on the nervous system and the application of -omics field for discovery, validation, and mitigation of pesticide neurotoxicity. ?? 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Freshwater mussels of the order Unionida are currently one of the most imperiled groups of organisms in the North American faunal region. Accurate risk assessments and development of effective management strategies for remaining populations require knowledge of thermal limits in the face of increasing surface water temperature due to climate change and various anthropogenic factors. We conducted a systematic literature review of unionid mussels (order Unionida, families Margaritiferidae and Unionidae) in the North American faunal region to (1) summarize lethal thermal tolerance data by life stage and taxonomy, (2) discuss ecological and climate change implications of existing lethal tolerance data, and (3) identify needs for future research. We identified lethal tolerance estimates for only 28 of 302 species in the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae. The mean acute median lethal temperatures were 32.8 degrees C for glochidia (19 species), 35.0 degrees C for juveniles (13 species), and 36.3 degrees C for adults (4 species). Generally, glochidia were less tolerant than juveniles or adults of the same species--but there were several exceptions. Generally, Amblemini had the highest acute and chronic thermal tolerance of all tribes followed by Anodontini, Pleurobemini, Lampsilini, and Quadrilini. Acclimation temperature affected lethal tolerance endpoints in less than half (52 of 145) of comparisons within species. Lethal tolerance data for additional species, combined with a comprehensive database of in situ surface water temperatures, would be useful for modeling the frequency and duration of lethal limit exceedance in North America and identifying populations currently living at or near their upper lethal limits.

AB  - Asystole presenting at the start of electrical stimulus application during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a relatively common occurrence. It is most likely caused by vagal nerve stimulation, affecting autonomic cardiac tone. This article reviews the effect of the electrode placement (EP) on the incidence and severity of bradycardia and asystole. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Embase and PubMed databases, up to September 2021, searching for studies evaluating the effect of EP on bradycardia and/or asystole during ECT. Nine case reports describing asystole in patients receiving ECT almost exclusively reported the association with bitemporal (BT) EP. One small descriptive study found no significant effect of EP on cardiac pauses. The results from 4 cohort studies, however, suggest that a right unilateral placement bears a higher risk for developing bradycardia and asystole than BT and bifrontal ECT. The available evidence suggests that right unilateral ECT holds a greater risk for the development of bradycardia and asystole than BT and bifrontal EP.

AB  - Affective responses have been considered key determinants for exercise adherence, but research on affective responses to stretching activities is scarce. Given the role of these responses in exercise adherence, our aim in this review was to explore (a) the utility and feasibility of core affect in stretching-related activities as measured by the Feeling Scale (FS) and/or the Felt Arousal Scale (FAS); (b) the timing of administering these scales; and (c) the scales' applicability and interpretability in this context. Inclusion criteria for studies in this review were experimental and non-experimental studies written in English that based affect assessment on the FS and/or FAS and that applied these scales to participants engaged in physical activity, individually or in groups. We also considered studies that focused on stretching activities that were either isolated or components of a class/activity and studies that used healthy participants of any age. Exclusion criteria were populations with mental health problems, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diseases likely to alter pain perception or be associated with chronic pain, instrument validation studies, gray literature, and systematic reviews. We searched PubMed, SPORTDiscus and PsycINFO databases, and we added studies retrieved manually from reference sections while following PRISMA guidelines. We used the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool for judging methodological quality of research articles. Our final analyses were based on 12 empirical studies published between 2003 and 2021with a total of 718 participants. Both scales were found to be useful and feasible in the most usual places for exercise, but core affect results cannot be properly interpreted due to variability of study protocols and the absence of guidelines for adequate baseline assessment. Most studies recorded affect responses pre-session, during session, and post-session. We observed no standardized timing or frequency of assessment, and there was high heterogeneity among stretching protocols. Currently, research in core affect assessment of stretching-related activities lacks sufficient methodological quality to draw generalizable conclusions.

AB  - BackgroundPrevious meta-analyses of psychotherapies for children and adolescents with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) did not investigate whether treatment efficacy is diminished when patients report multiple (versus single) traumas. AimsTo examine whether efficacy of psychological interventions for paediatric PTSD is diminished when patients report multiple (versus single) traumas. MethodWe systematically searched PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Web of Science and PTSDpubs on 21 April 2022 and included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the following criteria: (a) random allocation; (b) all participants presented with partial or full PTSD; (c) PTSD is the primary treatment focus; (d) sample mean age <19 years; (e) sample size n >= 20. Trauma frequency was analysed as a dichotomous (single versus >= 2 traumas) and continuous (mean number of exposures) potential moderator of efficacy. ResultsOf the 57 eligible RCTs (n = 4295), 51 RCTs were included in quantitative analyses. Relative to passive control conditions, interventions were found effective for single-trauma-related PTSD (Hedges' g = 1.09; 95% CI 0.70-1.48; k = 8 trials) and multiple-trauma-related PTSD (g = 1.11; 95% CI 0.74-1.47; k = 12). Psychotherapies were also more effective than active control conditions in reducing multiple-trauma-related PTSD. Comparison with active control conditions regarding single-event PTSD was not possible owing to scarcity (k = 1) of available trials. Efficacy did not differ with trauma exposure frequency irrespective of its operationalisation and subgroup analyses (e.g. trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy only). ConclusionsThe current evidence base suggests that psychological interventions for paediatric PTSD can effectively treat PTSD in populations reporting single and multiple traumas. Future trials for PTSD following single-event trauma need to involve active control conditions.

Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most widely occurring mycotoxins globally and poses significant harm to the animal husbandry industry and human health. People are increasingly aware of the adverse effects of DON on vulnerable structures and functions in the intestine, especially in the field of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). In this review, we present insights into DON that induces oxidative stress and affects the expansion of ISCs. Related studies of strategies for reducing its harm are summarized. We also discussed promising approaches such as regulation of microbiota, molecular docking, and modulation of the redox status via reducing the expression of Keap1 protein and single-cell sequencing, which may be critical for further revealing the mechanism of DON that induces oxidative stress and affects the expansion of ISCs.

The most common adverse events were premature ventricular contraction and hypertension. There have been no reports of serious adverse effects that necessitated the cessation of ECT.ConclusionsElectroconvulsive therapy is a safe and efficacious treatment for major psychiatric disorders, and the presence of CIEDs should not delay or deter the use of ECT in these patients.

AB  - Sleep disturbance is a major component of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of circadian disruption is largely overlooked, though many PTSD studies collect proxy markers of circadian timing. This individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis examined the correlation between sleep timing / chronotype and PTSD severity among individuals diagnosed with PTSD, the standardized mean difference in sleep timing / chronotype for individuals with and without PTSD, and moderators of these relationships. A systematic search was con-ducted; authors provided IPD for 27 studies and aggregate data for 16 studies (3,011 participants with PTSD; 2,703 participants without PTSD). Two-step meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects multivariate approach with robust variance estimation. Bedtime and wake time were not significantly associated with PTSD symptoms or diagnosis. Less total sleep time / time in bed was weakly associated with greater PTSD symptoms. Moderator analyses revealed that effect sizes were stronger in certain populations and when using wrist actig-raphy to measure sleep timing; however, gap maps revealed few studies in moderator categories with the strongest effects. Only two studies measured chronotype, prohibiting strong conclusions. Our findings indicate that the relationship between sleep timing and PTSD is weak; however, key gaps in the literature warrant further study.

AB  - Purpose - Using smart mobile devices, called mobile health (mHealth), facilitates providing health services, speeds up the process and reduces the costs and complications of direct services. Also, mHealth has many capabilities and applications in epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. This study aimed to systematically review the mHealth adoption researches in epidemic/pandemic outbreaks and provide some suggestions for future research for tackling for COVID-19.Design/methodology/approach - The results produced in this study are based on the literature analysis of 36 articles on mHealth adoption. To find the relevant studies; searches were done in PubMed, Google, Web of Science and Scopus by related keywords during 2020-2022. After selecting the studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, data were collected by using PRIZMA methods for systematically reviewing the literature.Findings - Of the 727 retrieved studies, 36 studies related to mHealth services during the pandemic situation were included. This has been performed by collecting data including demographic details, methodological details, limitations and significance of relationships between the constructs from the available articles based on the mHealth services. All studies emphasized the positive effect of mHealth for usage in epidemic/pandemic outbreaks.Research limitations/implications - The main applications of mHealth for epidemic/pandemic outbreaks included public health aspects, data management, educational programs, diagnosis as well as treatment. mHealth is an appropriate method for encountering epidemic/pandemic outbreaks due to its extensive applications. In the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19, mHealth is one of the best choices to use in the patient-physician relationship as Tele-visits, using in fever coach, providing real-time information for healthcare providers, population monitoring and detecting the diseases based on data obtained from different locations. These findings will help the mHealth providers to design their services accordingly.Originality/value - This study contributes to the researchers and academicians by providing relevant information regarding the mHealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the first time initiative to explore the research questions and future research direction for the researchers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on this, we present a comprehensive and actionable research agenda and practical implications.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with ototoxicity, which is caused by external factors. Mitophagy plays a key role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and function and is regulated by a series of key mitophagy regulatory proteins and signaling pathways. The results of ototoxicity models indicate the importance of this process in the etiology of ototoxicity. A number of recent investigations of the control of cell fate by mitophagy have enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms by which mitophagy regulates ototoxicity and other hearing-related diseases, providing opportunities for targeting mitochondria to treat ototoxicity.

AB  - A systematic review was performed aiming to identify the various occupational risk factors of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among female workers. A systematic, comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify studies published until 24 November 2021, evaluating the possible occupational risk factors of LUTS among female workers. Two reviewers assessed all articles retrieved through a computerised search for eligibility using predetermined criteria. Data on the first author, publication year, country, study design, participants, identified occupational risk factors, outcome variables and main results were extracted from the selected articles. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale guidelines were adopted to estimate the quality scores. Overall, our search yielded a total of 16 articles suitable for review. The occupational risk factors identified in the studies were strenuous physical demand and activity, prolonged sitting, occupational stress, shift work, limited use of the toilet at work and other occupational environments (eg, an unclean and uncomfortable workplace, dangerous job and probability of accidents, feeling pressed for time and awkward position for long periods). The findings of this review may raise awareness regarding the risk of LUTS among female workers with these factors. From an occupational health perspective, the implementation of tailored prevention strategies based on these occupational factors may prevent female workers from developing LUTS.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42022316728.

AB  - Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain why individuals with psychosis consume more tobacco compared with the general population, but the reasons remain unclear. The phases predating the onset of psy-chosis could provide an interesting framework to clarify this association. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide an updated and comprehensive synthesis of the association between tobacco smoking and Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) status.We performed a multistep systematic PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant electronic search for articles published from inception until October 1st, 2021. Web of Science was searched, complemented by a manual search of original articles reporting the outcome of tobacco consumption (defined as the number of individuals which were smoking tobacco at baseline) in a group of CHR-P patients versus healthy controls (HC). We employed quality assessment of the included studies with Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). The effect size for the primary outcome was the odds ratio (OR) of smoking tobacco in CHR-P samples vs HC. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis, assessment of heterogeneity with I2 index, sensitivity analyses excluding one study at a time for primary outcome, meta-regressions with four independent moderators (mean age, female ratio, sample size, NOS) and assessment of publication bias with funnel plot and Egger's test.We included 21 independent articles, totalling 2018 CHR-P individuals (mean age of 21.35 +/- 2.91 years and average female ratio of 41 +/- 7 %) and 1160 HC (mean age of 22.42 +/- 3.70 years and average female ratio of 45 +/- 11 %). The NOS score was 6.52 +/- 1.25 (range from 0 to 9). The OR of smoking status was 2.22 (95%CI 1.74-2.84, p < 0.01). Heterogeneity (I2) was 24.09 (p = 0.16). Sensitivity analyses, removing one study at a time, revealed the robustness of our main finding. Meta-regressions did not reveal any significant association between the moderators and the main outcome. Visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's test did not reveal evident publication bias.Our main finding of an increased OR of smokers in the CHR-P individuals compared to healthy controls corroborates the accumulation of unhealthy lifestyles in this vulnerable group. This does not demonstrate any causal association between tobacco smoking and incidence of psychosis, which should be investigated in future prospective cohorts. In conclusion, the window of opportunity represented by CHR-P status should involve more efficient physical health screening and better investigating the aetiological impact of smoking in the develop-ment of psychosis.

AB  - BackgroundPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of public health concern, because of their ubiquitous and extremely persistent occurrence, and depending on their structure, their bio-accumulative, mobile and toxic properties. Human health effects associated with exposure to PFAS include adverse effects on the immune system. In 2020, EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) defined adverse effects on the immune system as the most critical effect for human health risk assessment, based on reduced antibody responses to childhood vaccines and similar effects observed in experimental animal studies. Likewise, the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) considers PFAS-induced immunotoxicity, especially in children, as the critical effect for risk assessment. However, the mechanisms by which antibody concentrations are impacted are not completely understood. Furthermore, other targets of the immune system functions have been reported in the literature.ObjectiveThe aim of this review is to explore PFAS-associated immune-related effects. This includes, relevant mechanisms that may underlie the observed effects on the immune system, immunosuppression as well as immunoenhancement, such as i) modulation of cell signalling and nuclear receptors, such as NF-kappa B and PPARs; ii) alteration of calcium signalling and homoeostasis in immune cells; iii) modulation of immune cell populations; iv) oxidative stress and v) impact on fatty acid metabolism & secondary effects on the immune system.MethodsA literature research was conducted using three databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus), which were searched in July 2021 for relevant studies published in the time frame from 2018 to 2021. In total, 487 publications were identified as potentially eligible and following expert-based judgement, articles relevant for mechanisms of PFAS induced immunotoxicity are discussed.ConclusionsTaken together, we show that there is substantial evidence from both in vitro and in vivo experimental as well as epidemiological studies, supporting that various PFAS, not only PFOA and PFOS, affect multiple aspects of the immune system. Timing of exposure is critical, because the developing immune system is especially vulnerable to toxic insults, resulting in a higher risk of particularly adverse immune effects but also other organs later in life.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this work was to summarize relationships between two subtypes of major depressive disorder (melancholic and atypical) and four core features of depression that reflect the domains identified consistently in previous studies of major depressive disorder endophenotypes (exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward processing, cognitive control deficits, and somatic symptoms) on the one hand and selected peripheral inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], cytokines, and adipokines) on the other. Methods: A systematized review was conducted. The database used for searching articles was PubMed (MEDLINE). Results: According to our search, most peripheral immunological markers associated with major depressive disorder are not specific to a single depressive symptom group. The most evident examples are CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. The strongest evidence supports the connection of peripheral inflammatory markers with somatic symptoms; weaker evidence indicates a role of immune changes in altered reward processing. The least amount of evidence was found for the role of peripheral inflammatory markers in exaggerated reactivity to negative information and cognitive control deficits. Regarding the depression subtypes, a tendency for higher CRP and adipokines was observed in atypical depression; increased IL-6 was found in melancholic depression. Conclusion: Somatic symptoms of depression could be a manifestation of a specific immunological endophenotype of depressive disorder. Melancholic and atypical depression may be characterized by different profiles of immunological markers.

AB  - Seasonality patterns are reported in various psychiatric disorders. The current paper summarizes findings on brain adaptations associated with seasonal changes, factors that contribute to individual differences and their implications for psychiatric disorders. Changes in circadian rhythms are likely to prominently mediate these seasonal effects since light strongly entrains the internal clock modifying brain function. Inability of circadian rhythms to accommodate to seasonal changes might increase the risk for mood and behavior problems as well as worse clinical outcomes in psychiatric disorders. Understanding the mechanisms that account for inter-individual variations in seasonality is relevant to the development of individualized prevention and treatment for psychiatric disorders. Despite promising findings, seasonal effects are still understudied and only controlled as a covariate in most brain research. Rigorous neuroimaging studies with thoughtful experimental designs, powered sample sizes and high temporal resolution alongside deep characterization of the environment are needed to better understand the seasonal adaptions of the human brain as a function of age, sex, and geographic latitude and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the alterations in seasonal adaptation in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - IntroductionEpigenetic marks have been proposed as early changes, at the subcellular level, in disease development. To find more specific biomarkers of effect in occupational exposures to toxicants, DNA methylation studies in peripheral blood cells have been performed. The goal of this review is to summarize and contrast findings about DNA methylation in blood cells from workers exposed to toxicants. MethodsA literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science. After first screening, we discarded all studies performed in vitro and in experimental animals, as well as those performed in other cell types other than peripheral blood cells. Results: 116 original research papers met the established criteria, published from 2007 to 2022. The most frequent investigated exposures/labor group were for benzene (18.9%) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (15.5%), particulate matter (10.3%), lead (8.6%), pesticides (7.7%), radiation (4.3%), volatile organic compound mixtures (4.3%), welding fumes (3.4%) chromium (2.5%), toluene (2.5%), firefighters (2.5%), coal (1.7%), hairdressers (1.7%), nanoparticles (1.7%), vinyl chloride (1.7%), and others. Few longitudinal studies have been performed, as well as few of them have explored mitochondrial DNA methylation. Methylation platforms have evolved from analysis in repetitive elements (global methylation), gene-specific promoter methylation, to epigenome-wide studies. The most reported observations were global hypomethylation as well as promoter hypermethylation in exposed groups compared to controls, while methylation at DNA repair/oncogenes genes were the most studied; studies from genome-wide studies detect differentially methylated regions, which could be either hypo or hypermethylated. DiscussionSome evidence from longitudinal studies suggest that modifications observed in cross-sectional designs may be transitory; then, we cannot say that DNA methylation changes are predictive of disease development due to those exposures. ConclusionDue to the heterogeneity in the genes studied, and scarcity of longitudinal studies, we are far away from considering DNA methylation changes as biomarkers of effect in occupational exposures, and nor can we establish a clear functional or pathological correlate for those epigenetic modifications associated with the studied exposures.

AB  - Backgrounds Cancer survivors suffer from specific symptoms known as chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments (CICIs). CICIs are difficult to capture with existing assessments such as the brief screening test for dementia. Although recommended neuropsychological tests (NPTs) exist, international consensus and shared cognitive domains of assessment tools are unknown. The aim of this scoping review was as follows: (1) to identify studies that assess CICIs in cancer survivors; (2) to identify shared cognitive assessment tools and domains by mapping the domains reported in studies using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework.Methods The study followed the recommendations made by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. We searched the following three databases through October 2021: PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Prospective longitudinal or cross-sectional studies were selected to determine CICI-specific assessment tools for adult cancer survivors.Results Sixty-four prospective studies (36 longitudinal studies and 28 cross-sectional studies) were included after checking for eligibility. The NPTs were divided into seven main cognitive domains. The specific mental functions were often used in the order of memory, attention, higher-level cognitive functions, and psychomotor functions. Perceptual functions were used less frequently. In some ICF domains, shared NPTs were not clearly identified. In some different domains, the same NPTs were used, such as the trail making test and the verbal fluency test. When the association between the publishing year and the amount of NPT use was examined, it was found that the amount of tool use tended to decline over the publication years. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive function (FACT-Cog) was a shared consensus tool among the patient-reported outcomes (PROs).Conclusion Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments are currently gaining interest. Shared ICF domains such as memory and attention were identified for NPTs. There was a gap between the publicly recommended tools and the tools actually used in the studies. For PROs, a clearly shared tool, FACT-Cog, was identified. Mapping the domains reported in studies using the ICF can help in the process of reviewing consensus on which NPTs may be used to target cognitive domains.

AB  - BackgroundJob burnout negatively contributes to individual well-being, enhancing public health costs due to turnover, absenteeism, and reduced job performance. Personality traits mainly explain why workers differ in experiencing burnout under the same stressful work conditions. The current systematic review was conducted with the PRISMA method and focused on the five-factor model to explain workers' burnout risk.MethodsThe databases used were Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO. Keywords used were: "Burnout," "Job burnout," "Work burnout," "Personality," and "Personality traits".ResultsThe initial search identified 3320 papers, from which double and non-focused studies were excluded. From the 207 full texts reviewed, the studies included in this review were 83 papers. The findings show that higher levels of neuroticism (r from 0.10** to 0.642***; beta from 0.16** to 0.587***) and lower agreeableness (r from - 0.12* to - 0.353***; beta from - 0.08*** to - 0.523*), conscientiousness (r from -0.12* to -0.355***; beta from - 0.09*** to - 0.300*), extraversion (r from - 0.034** to - 0.33***; beta from - 0.06*** to - 0.31***), and openness (r from - 0.18*** to - 0.237**; beta from - 0.092* to - 0.45*) are associated with higher levels of burnout.ConclusionsThe present review highlighted the relationship between personality traits and job burnout. Results showed that personality traits were closely related to workers' burnout risk. There is still much to explore and how future research on job burnout should account for the personality factors.

AB  - The aim of the study is to evaluate the interventions examining music exposure's effects on prosocial behaviour, to identify the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) through which they change it, and to examine the mechanisms of action (MoAs) that mediate the relationship between music exposure and prosocial behaviour. The review identified 15 research articles, comprising 19 relevant studies. The results revealed that, though many of the included studies did not provide enough information to code them adequately, the BCTs "Instruction on how to perform a behaviour", "Salience of consequences", "Reduce negative emotions" and "Identification of self as role model" were the most commonly utilized techniques. Additionally, "Emotion" was the most significant MoA in the intervention-behaviour relationship in this context, but too few BCTs were able to be coded to make conclusions about any BCT-MoA relationships.

AB  - Creative art-based therapies (cABT) provide a creative non-pharmacological approach in therapy to people with dementia and can potentially improve their personhood. This review identified cABT that focused on the personhood of persons with dementia living in residential facilities and determined how quality of life (QOL) or well-being were assessed. Searches were conducted on PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (OVID), and SCOPUS databases, to gather articles from 2010 to 2020. In this review, cABT encompassed art, music, and theater/drama. An overall of five studies were included and, in these studies, art programs were seen in the form of water painting, an intergenerational art program, live music performances, and medical clowns. QOL and well-being were assessed using the Greater Cincinnati Well-being Observation Tool, a QOL checklist, and transcribed from conversations to develop themes on participation and mental well-being. Personhood was promoted through self-expression and self-creativity. Increased number of participants are required for future cABT to further understand the impact the arts may have on personhood, on the QOL and well-being, and enhancing creativity for people with dementia.

AB  - Objectives: To estimate the risk of suicide attempt repetition among individuals with an index attempt. It also aims to study the role of risk factors and prevention programme in repetition.Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in keeping with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies on attempt repetition (both cohort studies and intervention studies) were searched from inception to 2022.Results: A total of 110 studies comprising 248,829 attempters was reviewed. The overall repetition rate was 0.20 (0.17, 0.22). Repetition risk linearly increased over time. A higher risk of attempt repetition was associated with female sex and index attempts in which self-cutting methods were used. Moreover, a mental disorder diagnosis was associated with an increasing repetition risk (OR = 2.02, p < .01). The delivery of a preventive programme reduced the repetition risk, OR = 0.76, p < .05; however, this effect was significant for psychotherapy in-terventions, OR = 0.38, p < .01.Conclusion: One in five suicide attempters will engage in a new suicide attempt. An elevated repetition risk is associated with being female, more severe index methods and psychiatric disorder diagnosis. Preventive pro-grammes, particularly psychotherapy, may contribute to reducing repetition risk and eventually save lives.

AB  - Epigenomic modifications of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene have been postulated to underlie the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurological conditions. This systematic review summarizes current evidence investigating the association of BDNF epigenomic modifications (DNA methylation, non-coding RNA, histone modifications) with brain-related phenotypes in humans. A novel contribution is our creation of an open access web-based application, the BDNF DNA Methylation Map, to interactively visualize specific positions of CpG sites investigated across all studies for which relevant data were available. Our literature search of four databases through September 27, 2021 returned 1701 articles, of which 153 met inclusion criteria. Our review revealed exceptional heterogeneity in methodological approaches, hindering the identification of clear patterns of robust and/or replicated results. We summarize key findings and provide recommendations for future epigenomic research. The existing literature appears to remain in its infancy and requires additional rigorous research to fulfill its potential to explain BDNF-linked risk for brain-related conditions and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the association between children's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: Databases were systematically searched for peer-reviewed literature published between 2010 and 2022. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed the quality of included studies. Meta-analysis was conducted for studies that used the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Results: Twenty-three studies were included, with most rated as "good" quality. Meta-analysis found "very large" effect in both parent- (Hedges' g -1.67, 95% CI [-2.57, -0.78]) and child-reported (Hedges' g -1.28, 95% CI [-2.01, -0.56]) HRQoL for children with ADHD compared to children without ADHD. No difference between parent- and child-reported HRQoL in children with and without ADHD was found. However, parent-reported HRQoL was lower than child-reported HRQoL among children with ADHD. Conclusion: ADHD was associated with substantially poorer children's HRQoL. Among children with ADHD, parents rated their children's HRQoL lower than the children themselves.

AB  - Secure attachment has broad and long-lasting benefits for the development and wellbeing of a child. Conversely, disorganized attachment is associated with social, emotional, and behavioral problems in children, and later psychopathology. Children with a developmental delay or disability (DD) may be at greater risk of insecure or disorganized attachment than children without DD. This systematic review aims to (1) synthesize the available evidence worldwide regarding attachment and children with DD and (2) to examine the effectiveness of interventions employed to prevent or address attachment insecurity for this population. Peer reviewed articles with four-fold attachment classification data or attachment interventions for children with DD were included in the review. Seventeen databases were searched for studies published in English from January 1980 to January 2019. The systematic review protocol was registered a priori with PROSPERO (CRD42018117574). Twenty-three articles met the inclusion criteria, nine containing strange situation procedure (SSP) data and 14 relating to interventions. Meta-analysis was conducted with data from six of the SSP articles (n = 215). The remaining articles were reviewed narratively. Results indicate that children with DD are significantly less likely to develop a secure attachment and significantly more likely to develop a disorganized attachment than children without DD. Emerging research indicates promise that early intervention may be effective in improving attachment security.

AB  - ObjectivesCancer-related insomnia (CRI) is one of the most common and serious symptoms in patients with cancer. Acupuncture and moxibustion have been widely applied in the treatment of CRI. Nevertheless, the comparative efficacy and safety of different acupuncture and moxibustion techniques remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of different acupuncture and moxibustion techniques in the treatment of CRI. MethodsEight medical databases were comprehensively searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as of June 2022. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias and conducted the research selection, data extraction, and quality assessment of the included RCTs. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using frequency models, combining all available direct and indirect evidence from RCTs. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was set as the primary outcome, and adverse events and effective rates were set as the secondary outcomes. The efficacy rate was calculated as the ratio of patients with insomnia symptom relief to the total number of patients. ResultsThirty-one RCTs with 3,046 participants were included, including 16 acupuncture- and moxibustion-related therapies. Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation [surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 85.7%] and acupuncture and moxibustion (SUCRA 79.1%) were more effective than Western medicine, routine care, and placebo-sham acupuncture. Furthermore, Western medicine showed significantly better effects than placebo-sham acupuncture. In the NMA, the acupuncture and moxibustion treatments with the best therapeutic effects for CRI were transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (SUCRA 85.7%), acupuncture and moxibustion (SUCRA 79.1%), auricular acupuncture (SUCRA 62.9%), routine care combined with intradermal needling (SUCRA 55.0%), and intradermal needling alone (SUCRA 53.3%). No serious acupuncture- or moxibustion-related adverse events were reported in the included studies. ConclusionAcupuncture and moxibustion are effective and relatively safe in treating CRI. The relatively conservative recommended order of acupuncture- and moxibustion-related therapies for CRI is as follows: transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation, acupuncture and moxibustion, and auricular acupuncture. However, the methodological quality of the included studies was generally poor, and further high-quality RCTs are needed to strengthen the evidence base.

KW  - FOREIGN DOMESTIC WORKERS
KW  - MIGRATION
KW  - NURSES
AB  - BackgroundThe rate of international migration for the primary purpose of employment has increased exponentially in recent decades. A significant proportion of this global movement takes place across East and Southeast Asia as workers move on a temporary basis from lower-middle-income home countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to high-income host destinations including Hong Kong and Singapore. Relatively little is known about the unique and long-term health needs of this heterogeneous group of people. This systematic review presents an analysis of recent research into the experiences and perceptions of health of temporary migrant workers in the East and Southeast Asian regions.MethodsFive electronic databases CINAHL Complete (via EbscoHost), EMBASE (including Medline), PsycINFO (via ProQuest), PubMed and Web of Science, were systematically searched for qualitative or mixed methods, peer-reviewed literature published in print or online between January 2010 and December 2020. Quality of the studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research published by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Findings from the included articles were extracted and synthesised using qualitative thematic analysis.ResultsEight articles were included in the review. Findings from this review indicate that multiple dimensions of workers' health is impacted by the processes of temporary migration. In addition, the research reviewed indicated that migrant workers used various strategies and mechanisms to attempt to address their health-related issues and to take better care of themselves. Such agentic practices could help them manage and maintain their health and wellbeing across physical, psychological and spiritual dimensions within the structural constraints of their employment.ConclusionsLimited published research has focused on the health perceptions and needs of temporary migrant workers in East and Southeast Asia. The studies included in this review focused on female migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines. These studies provide valuable insights but do not reflect the heterogeneity of migrants moving within these regions. The findings of this systematic review highlight that temporary migrant workers experience high and sustained levels of stress and are exposed to certain health risks which may compromise long-term health outcomes. These workers demonstrate knowledge and skills in managing their own health. This suggests that strength-based approaches to health promotion interventions may be effective in optimising their health over time. These findings are relevant to policy makers and non-government organisations supporting migrant workers.

AB  - Visualization and tracking of the information flow in the broader brain area are essential because nerve cells make a vast network in the brain. Fluorescence Ca2+ imaging is a simultaneous visualization of brain cell activities in a wide area. Instead of classical chemical indicators, developing various types of transgenic animals that express Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent proteins enables us to observe brain activities in living animals at a larger scale for a long time. Multiple kinds of literature have reported that transcranial imaging of such transgenic animals is practical for monitoring the wide-field information flow across the broad brain regions, although it has a lower spatial resolution. Notably, this technique is helpful for the initial evaluation of cortical function in disease models. This review will introduce fully intact transcranial macroscopic imaging and cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging as practical applications.

KW  - PREVALENCE
AB  - Background: While the public is under serious pressure from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the final impact and possible contributing factors to postpartum depression symptoms (PPDS) remain unknown. Therefore, a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PPDS and the COVID-19 pandemic was carried out by comparing the data between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic timeframes and exploring the influencing factors.Methods: This systematic review was prospectively registered and recorded in a study protocol (Prospero CRD42022336820, ). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINALH, Cochrane and Scopus was cmpleted on June 6, 2022. Studies that compared the prevalence of PPD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic period were included.Results: Of 1766 citations identified, 22 studies were included with 15,098 participates before the COVID-19 pandemic and 11,836 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the analysis showed that the epidemic crisis was associated with an increased prevalence of PPDS (OR: 0.81 [0.68, 0.95], P = 0.009, I-2 = 59%). Subgroup analysis was conducted according to the study characteristics and regions. Within the study characteristics classification, results showed an obvious increase in the prevalence of PPDS during the COVID-19 pandemic if PPDS cutoff was defined as Edinburgh postpartum depression score (EPDS) >= 13 points (OR: 0.72 [0.52, 0.98], P = 0.03, I-2 = 67%) and an increased prevalence in follow-ups that happened after 2 weeks (>= 2 weeks postpartum) (OR: 0.81 [0.68, 0.97], P = 0.02, I-2 = 43%). Selected studies that were high-quality (OR: 0.79 [0.64, 0.97], P = 0.02, I-2 = 56%) demonstrated an increased prevalence of PPDS during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Sorting by regional factors, studies conducted in Asia (OR: 0.81 [0.70, 0.93], P = 0.003, I-2 = 0%) showed an increase of PPDS prevalence rates during the COVID-19 period, while studies conducted in Europe (OR: 0.82 [0.59, 1.13], P = 0.23, I-2 = 71%) and North America (OR: 0.66 [0.42, 1.02], P = 0.06, I-2 = 65%) showed no significant difference. All studies conducted in the developed (OR: 0.79 [0.64, 0.98], P = 0.03, I-2 = 65%) and developing countries (OR: 0.81 [0.69, 0.94], P = 0.007, I-2 = 0%) showed an increase of PPDS during the COVID-19 period.Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with an increased prevalence of PPDS, especially after long-term follow-up and among the group with a high possibility of depression. The negative influence from the pandemic, causing more PPDS was significant in studies from Asia.

AB  - We explore the role of inner speech (covert self-directed talk) during the acquisition and use of concepts differing in abstractness. Following Vygotsky, inner speech results from the internalization of linguistically mediated interactions that regulate cognition and behaviour. When we acquire and process abstract concepts, uncertainties about word meaning might lead us to search actively for their meaning. Inner speech might play a role in this searching process and be differentially involved in concept learning compared with use of known concepts. Importantly, inner speech comes in different varieties-e.g. it can be expanded or condensed (with the latter involving syntactic and semantic forms of abbreviation). Do we use inner speech differently with concepts varying in abstractness? Which kinds of inner speech do we preferentially use with different kinds of abstract concepts (e.g. emotions versus numbers)? What other features of inner speech, such as dialogicality, might facilitate our use of concepts varying in abstractness (by allowing us to monitor the limits of our knowledge in simulated social exchanges, through a process we term inner social metacognition)? In tackling these questions, we address the possibility that different varieties of inner speech are flexibly used during the acquisition of concepts and their everyday use.

AB  - A few years ago, powered prostheses triggered new technological advances in diverse areas such as mobility, comfort, and design, which have been essential to improving the quality of life of individuals with lower limb disability. The human body is a complex system involving mental and physical health, meaning a dependant relationship between its organs and lifestyle. The elements used in the design of these prostheses are critical and related to lower limb amputation level, user morphology and human-prosthetic interaction. Hence, several technologies have been employed to accomplish the end user's needs, for example, advanced materials, control systems, electronics, energy management, signal processing, and artificial intelligence. This paper presents a systematic literature review on such technologies, to identify the latest advances, challenges, and opportunities in developing lower limb prostheses with the analysis on the most significant papers. Powered prostheses for walking in different terrains were illustrated and examined, with the kind of movement the device should perform by considering the electronics, automatic control, and energy efficiency. Results show a lack of a specific and generalised structure to be followed by new developments, gaps in energy management and improved smoother patient interaction. Additionally, Human Prosthetic Interaction (HPI) is a term introduced in this paper since no other research has integrated this interaction in communication between the artificial limb and the end-user. The main goal of this paper is to provide, with the found evidence, a set of steps and components to be followed by new researchers and experts looking to improve knowledge in this field.

AB  - Background: Studies on the association of homocysteine level with poststroke depression (PSD) have yielded conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the elevated homocysteine level at the acute stage of ischemic stroke in predicting PSD.Methods: Two authors systematically searched articles indexed in PubMed and Embase databases up to 31 January 2022. Studies evaluating the association of homocysteine level with the development of PSD in patients with acute ischemic stroke were selected.Results: A total of 10 studies involving 2,907 patients were identified. The pooled adjusted odds ratio (OR) of PSD was 3.72 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.03-6.81] for the top vs. bottom homocysteine level. The value of elevated homocysteine level in predicting PSD was stronger in >= 6-month follow-up (OR 4.81; 95% CI 3.12-7.43) than those in <= 3-month follow-up subgroup (OR 3.20; 95% CI 1.29-7.91). Moreover, a per unit increase in homocysteine level conferred a 7% higher risk of PSD.Conclusion: Elevated homocysteine level in the acute stage of ischemic stroke may be an independent predictor of PSD.

AB  - concepts, like justice and friendship, are central features of our daily lives. Traditionally, abstract concepts are distinguished from other concepts in that they cannot be directly experienced through the senses. As such, they pose a challenge for strongly embodied models of semantic representation that assume a central role for sensorimotor information. There is growing recognition, however, that it is possible for meaning to be 'grounded' via cognitive systems, including those involved in processing language and emotion. In this article, we focus on the specific proposal that social significance is a key feature in the representation of some concepts. We begin by reviewing recent evidence in favour of this proposal from the fields of psycholinguistics and neuroimaging. We then discuss the limited extent to which there is consensus about the definition of 'socialness' and propose essential next steps for research in this domain. Taking one such step, we describe preliminary data from an unprecedented large-scale rating study that can help determine how socialness is distinct from other facets of word meaning. We provide a backdrop of contemporary theories regarding semantic representation and social cognition and highlight important predictions for both brain and behaviour.

AB  - Grassland soils are climate-dependent ecosystems that have a significant greenhouse gas mitigating function through their ability to store large amounts of carbon (C). However, what is often not recognized is that they can also exhibit a high methane (CH4) uptake capacity that could be influenced by future increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and variations in temperature and water availability. While there is a wealth of information on C seques-tration in grasslands there is less consensus on how climate change impacts on CH4 uptake or the underlying mecha-nisms involved. To address this, we assessed existing knowledge on the impact of climate change components on CH4 uptake by grassland soils. Increases in precipitation associated with soils with a high background soil moisture content generally resulted in a reduction in CH4 uptake or even net emissions, while the effect was opposite in soils with a rel-atively low background moisture content. Initially wet grasslands subject to the combined effects of warming and water deficits may absorb more CH4, mainly due to increased gas diffusivity. However, in the longer-term heat and drought stress may reduce the activity of methanotrophs when the mean soil moisture content is below the optimum for their survival. Enhanced plant productivity and growth under elevated CO2, increased soil moisture and changed nutrient concentrations, can differentially affect methanotrophic activity, which is often reduced by increasing N de-position. Our estimations showed that CH4 uptake in grassland soils can change from -57.7 % to +6.1 % by increased precipitation, from -37.3 % to +85.3 % by elevated temperatures, from +0.87 % to +92.4 % by decreased precip-itation, and from -66.7 % to +27.3 % by elevated CO2. In conclusion, the analysis suggests that grasslands under the influence of warming and drought may absorb even more CH4, mainly because of reduced soil water contents and in-creased gas diffusivity.

AB  - Toxic metal(loid)s are widespread and permanent in the biosphere, and bacteria have evolved a wide variety of metal (loid) resistance genes (MRGs) to resist the stress of excess metal(loid)s. Via active efflux, permeability barriers, extracellular/intracellular sequestration, enzymatic detoxification and reduction in metal(loid)s sensitivity of cellular targets, the key components of bacterial cells are protected from toxic metal(loid)s to maintain their normal physiological functions. Exploiting bacterial metal(loid) resistance mechanisms, MRGs have been applied in many environmental fields. Based on the specific binding ability of MRGs-encoded regulators to metal(loid)s, MRGs-dependent biosensors for monitoring environmental metal(loid)s are developed. MRGs-related biotechnologies have been applied to environmental remediation of metal(loid)s by using the metal(loid) tolerance, biotransformation, and biopassivation abilities of MRGs-carrying microorganisms. In this work, we review the historical evolution, resistance mechanisms, environmental variation, and environmental applications of bacterial MRGs. The potential hazards, unresolved problems, and future research directions are also discussed.

AB  - Evaluating the presence of behavior change techniques (BCTs) in mHealth apps could be used to better understand what "active ingredients" contribute to outcomes. Despite the early onset of Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and the increasing use of mobile apps to seek mental healthcare among young people, BCTs underpinning mHealth apps targeting AN have never been systematically examined. This review systematically identified and analyzed BCTs underpinning apps targeted at reducing AN in young people in an attempt to understand their active components. Apps were searched and screened in Apple Store and Google Play. Six apps that met the inclusion criteria and were coded by trained researchers against the BCT Taxonomy V1. Overall, 22 of 93 possible BCTs were identified. The most common were "Information about health consequences," "Social support (unspecified)," and "Information about antecedents". Identified BCTs suggested potential overlaps with traditional clinical treatments for AN, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and family-based therapy. Further investigation is required to evaluate the apps' usability and effectiveness.
   Behavioral change techniques identified in mobile health apps targeting Anorexia Nervosa in adolescence.
   Lay Summary Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is considered to be one of the most fatal mental disorders and has an early onset in adolescence. More recently, there has been a surge in the development of mobile health (mHealth) apps that young people are beginning to turn toward to for mental healthcare support. However, despite the early onset of AN and the increasing use of mobile apps to seek mental healthcare, the content of such apps has been largely unexplored. The aim of this review was to systematically identify the behavioral change techniques (BCTs) underpinning AN apps for young people. BCTs refer to the "common language" used by researchers to determine the triggers of behavior change. Apps were searched and screened in Apple Store and Google Play. Six apps met the inclusion criteria and were coded by trained researchers against a taxonomy containing a total of 93 distinct BCTs (BCT Taxonomy V1). Overall, 22 of 93 possible BCTs were identified and suggested potential overlaps with traditional clinical treatments for AN, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and family-based therapy. Further investigation is required to evaluate the apps' usability and effectiveness.

AB  - The current study presents the first bathymetric map of Toshka Lakes in Egypt using the bathymetric method that is based on the combination of in situ measurements, Remote Sensing, and GIS technologies. Such a combination allows an accurate determination of the three-dimensional shapes and volumes of inland water basins, as shown by its implementation in the survey of the Toshka Lakes. The determined total surface area of the Toshka Lakes is 2321.64 km2, holding a cumulative capacity of 53.28 billion m3 (almost equal to Egypt's annual water income from the Nile). Being today the Toshka Lakes in a mature stage, the results of the morphometric and hypsometric analyses provide useful information for water conservation. The lakes are also expected to gradually shrink in size, similar to what happened in the past decades. Therefore, besides providing a digital database useful for water management, the proposed study is fundamental for appraising, with more realistic expectations, the future changes in the water basins in the Toshka Depression. This article documents the current status of the Lakes and enables researchers and decision-makers to predict their changes in volume and area with depth in the future.

The coprimary outcomes were study-defined response and remission.Results: A systematic search of the literature yielded 442 references, of which 3 RCTs (130 children and adolescents with FEDN MDD, 50.8% male, and mean age range from 14.5 to 17.5 years) met the inclusion criteria. Among the two RCTs (66.7%, 2/3) examining the effects of LF-rTMS on study-defined response and remission and cognitive function, active LF-rTMS was more efficacious than sham LF-rTMS in terms of study-defined response rate and cognitive function (all p < 0.05) but not regarding study-defined remission rate (all p > 0.05). No significant group differences were found with regard to adverse reactions. None of the included RCTs reported the dropout rate.Conclusion: These findings preliminarily found that LF-rTMS could benefit children and adolescents with FEDN MDD in a relatively safe manner, although further studies are warranted.

AB  - According to the United Nations, an estimated 26.6 million people worldwide were refugees in 2021. Experiences before, during, and after flight increase psychological distress and contrib-ute to a high prevalence of mental disorders. The resulting high need for mental health care is generally not reflected in the actual mental health care provision for refugees. A possible strategy to close this gap might be to offer smartphone-delivered mental health care. This systematic review summarizes the current state of research on smartphone-delivered inter-ventions for refugees, answering the following research questions: (1) Which smartphone-delivered interventions are available for refugees? (2) What do we know about their clinical (efficacy) and (3) nonclinical outcomes (e.g., feasibility, appropriateness, acceptance, and barriers)? (4) What are their dropout rates and dropout reasons? (5) To what extent do smartphone-delivered interventions consider data security? Relevant databases were system-atically searched for published studies, gray literature, and unpublished information. In total, 456 data points were screened. Twelve interventions were included (nine interventions from 11 peer-reviewed articles and three interventions without published study reports), compris-ing nine interventions for adult refugees and three for adolescent and young refugees. Study participants were mostly satisfied with the interventions, indicating adequate acceptability. Only one randomized controlled trial (RCT; from two RCTs and two pilot RCTs) found a significant reduction in the primary clinical outcome compared to the control group. Dropout rates ranged from 2.9 to 80%. In the discussion, the heterogeneous findings are integrated into the current state of literature.

AB  - Objective: Staff's attitudes to the use of coercion may influence the number of coercive interventions employed and staff willingness to engage in professional development projects aimed at reducing the use of coercion itself. The Staff Attitude to Coercion Scale (SACS) was developed to assess the attitudes of mental healthcare staff to the use of coercion in 2008 and has been employed subsequently. This global study systematically reviews and summarizes the use of the scale in research.Methods: Seven databases were searched for studies using SACS in articles published in peer reviewed journals and gray literature. In addition, researchers who have asked for permission to use the scale since its development in 2008 were contacted and asked for their possible results. Extracting of data from the papers were performed in pairs of the authors.Results: Of the 82 identified publications, 26 papers with 5,838 respondents were selected for review. A review of the research questions used in the studies showed that the SACS questionnaire was mostly used in studies of interventions aimed at reducing coercion and further explain variation in the use of coercion.Conclusion: SACS is, to our best of knowledge, the only questionnaire measuring staff's attitudes to the use of coercive interventions in mental health services. Its widespread use indicates that the questionnaire is perceived as feasible and useful as well as demonstrating the need for such a tool. However, further research is needed as the relationship between staff attitudes to coercion and the actual use of coercion remains unclear and needs to be further investigated. Staff attitudes to coercion may be a prerequisite for leaders and staff in mental healthcare to engage in service development and quality improvement projects.

AB  - PurposeTo quantify the current literature and limitations associated with research examining thermoregulatory and cardiovascular strain in laborers working in the heat. MethodsPubMed, SCOPUS, and SPORTDiscus were searched for terms related to the cardiovascular system, heat stress, and physical work. Qualifying studies included adult participants (18-65 years old), a labor-intensive environment or exercise protocol simulating a labor environment, a minimum duration of 120 min of physical work, and environmental heat stress (ambient temperature >= 26.0 degrees C and >= 30% relative humidity). Studies included at least one of the following outcomes: pre- and peak physical work, core temperature, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HR variability, and rate pressure product. ResultsTwenty-one out of 1559 potential studies qualified from our search. There was a total of 598 participants (mean = 28 +/- 50 participants per study, range = 4-238 participants per study), which included 51 females (8.5%) and 547 males (91.5%). Of the participants, 3.8% had cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes: n = 10; hypertension: n = 13) and 96.2% were characterized as "healthy". Fifty-seven percent of the included studies were performed in a laboratory setting. ConclusionsStudies were predominantly in men (91.5%), laboratory settings (57%), and "healthy" individuals (96.2%). To advance equity in protection against occupational heat stress and better inform future heat safety recommendations to protect all workers, future studies must focus on addressing these limitations. Employers, supervisors, and other safety stakeholders should consider these limitations while implementing current heat safety recommendations.

AB  - Background:Hippocampal disturbances are important in the pathophysiology of both schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD). Imaging studies have shown selective volume deficits across hippocampal subfields in both disorders. We aimed to investigate whether these volumetric alterations in hippocampal subfields are shared or divergent across disorders. Methods:We searched PubMed and Embase from database inception to May 8, 2021. We identified MRI studies in patients with schizophrenia, MDD or both, in which hippocampal subfield volumes were measured. We excluded nonoriginal, animal or postmortem studies, and studies that used other imaging modalities or overlapping data. We conducted a network meta-analysis to estimate and contrast alterations in subfield volumes in the 2 disorders. Results:We identified 45 studies that met the initial criteria for systematic review, of which 15 were eligible for network metaanalysis. Compared to healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia had reduced volumes in the bilateral cornu ammonis (CA) 1, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, subiculum, parasubiculum, molecular layer, hippocampal tail and hippocampus-amygdala transition area (HATA); in the left CA4 and presubiculum; and in the right fimbria. Patients with MDD had decreased volumes in the left CA3 and CA4 and increased volumes in the right HATA compared to healthy controls. The bilateral parasubiculum and right HATA were smaller in patients with schizophrenia than in patients with MDD. Limitations:We did not investigate medication effects because of limited information. Study heterogeneity was noteworthy in direct comparisons between patients with MDD and healthy controls. Conclusion:The volumes of multiple hippocampal subfields are selectively altered in patients with schizophrenia and MDD, with overlap and differentiation in subfield alterations across disorders. Rigorous head-to-head studies are needed to validate our findings.

AB  - Objective: People experiencing severe mental illness report higher rates of tobacco smoking than the general population, while rates of quitting and sustaining abstinence are considerably lower. This systematic review aimed to identify factors associated with sustained abstinence in people experiencing severe mental illness following a smoking intervention. Method: Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL and Cochrane Library from the inception of the e-databases until June 2022. Selection criteria included randomised and non-randomised studies of smoking cessation interventions in which most of the participants were experiencing severe mental illness, and reported a follow-up of 3 months or longer. From an initial 1498 unique retrieved records, 26 references were included detailing 17 smoking cessation intervention studies and 3 relapse prevention intervention studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB2 tool for randomised study designs and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised designs. Results: Participation in smoking interventions was associated with higher odds of abstinence in the medium-term, but not long-term follow-ups. There was insufficient evidence that any other factors impact sustained abstinence. Most studies were considered to have some risk of bias, largely due to insufficient availability of analysis plans. Conclusion: Despite an abundance of studies investigating smoking cessation in smokers experiencing severe mental illness, there is limited knowledge on the factors associated with staying quit. The inclusion of people experiencing severe mental illness in large-scale randomised control trials, in which predictors of sustained abstinence are measured in the medium and long term are needed to address this important question.

AB  - We conducted a critical review, using systematic methods, of the literature examining mental health consumer perspectives on their physical and mental health in academic research published between 2005 and 2021. This review examined the inclusion, extent, type and centrality of consumer perspectives regarding their mental and physical health. The search produced 1,865 papers from which 116 met the inclusion criteria. Studies predominantly focused on consumers' individual experiences of their physical and mental health, including but not limited to their understandings and experiences of medication and associated risk factors. They also captured some social aspects of mental health consumers' physical health, including factors that impacted individual agency, stigma, and social and interpersonal factors. Structural factors affecting physical and mental health, such as accessibility of services and financial constraints, were also identified. The review revealed that in comparison to clinician perspectives, the direct representation of consumer perspectives was lacking. Similarly, while clinician and carer perspectives on structural factors were investigated, the consumer perspective in this area was missing. The review also found few genuine codesigned or coproduced research studies. To better identify and respond to the health needs as prioritized by consumers, this paper argues it is imperative that future studies prioritize codesigned and coproduced research. It is argued that a focus on "services as provided" rather than "services as received" has contributed to a lack of progress in addressing the life expectancy gap for consumers. It is recommended that journals, ethics committees and research policy organizations develop guidelines and standards to inform best practice in research on consumer perspectives and experience and to support the implementation of codesigned and/or coproduced approaches in future research. Respecting and including consumers as equal partners in the research process will lead to more meaningful insights to inform policy and practice and reduce the life expectancy gap for people living with mental health concerns.

AB  - Objective: Suicide and suicidal behaviors are reported to be common in patients with Tuberculosis (TB). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantitively assess the prevalence of suicidality and identify the factors associated with suicidality in patients with TB.Methods: We searched databases PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar for studies that reported the prevalence of suicide, suicidal ideations, or suicide attempts in patients with TB. We assessed the quality of studies with the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Nine studies (8770 participants) were included. Pooled prevalence for current suicidal ideations within the last year was 8.5% [95% CI: 5.8%12.3%]. Pooled prevalence for current suicidal attempts within the last year was 3.1% [2.2%-4.5%]. Suicide was reported in 0.92% of TB patients at the end of 2 years, whereas 2.2% to 8.4% of all TB deaths were reported due to suicide. Factors associated with suicidality were female gender, TB retreatment, comorbid HIV, presence of another chronic medical illness, psychological distress, and comorbid psychiatric illnesses. Conclusion: The prevalence rates of suicidal ideation and attempts were higher in patients with TB than in the general population. Integrating mental health services with TB programs will help develop interventions for high-risk individuals.Prospero registration number: CRD42021281849.

AB  - When COVID-19 spread in China in December 2019, thousands of studies have focused on this pandemic. Each presents a unique perspective that reflects the pandemic's main scientific disciplines. For example, social scientists are concerned with reducing the psychological impact on the human mental state especially during lockdown periods. Computer scientists focus on establishing fast and accurate computerized tools to assist in diagnosing, preventing, and recovering from the disease. Medical scientists and doctors, or the frontliners, are the main heroes who received, treated, and worked with the millions of cases at the expense of their own health. Some of them have continued to work even at the expense of their lives. All these studies enforce the multidisciplinary work where scientists from different academic disciplines (social, environmental, technological, etc.) join forces to produce research for beneficial outcomes during the crisis. One of the many branches is computer science along with its various technologies, including artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, big data, decision support systems (DSS), and many more. Among the most notable DSS utilization is those related to multicriterion decision making (MCDM), which is applied in various applications and across many contexts, including business, social, technological and medical. Owing to its importance in developing proper decision regimens and prevention strategies with precise judgment, it is deemed a noteworthy topic of extensive exploration, especially in the context of COVID-19-related medical applications. The present study is a comprehensive review of COVID-19-related medical case studies with MCDM using a systematic review protocol. PRISMA methodology is utilized to obtain a final set of (n = 35) articles from four major scientific databases (ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science). The final set of articles is categorized into taxonomy comprising five groups: (1) diagnosis (n = 6), (2) safety (n = 11), (3) hospital (n = 8), (4) treatment (n = 4), and (5) review (n = 3). A bibliographic analysis is also presented on the basis of annual scientific production, country scientific production, co-occurrence, and co-authorship. A comprehensive discussion is also presented to discuss the main challenges, motivations, and recommendations in using MCDM research in COVID-19-related medial case studies. Lastly, we identify critical research gaps with their corresponding solutions and detailed methodologies to serve as a guide for future directions. In conclusion, MCDM can be utilized in the medical field effectively to optimize the resources and make the best choices particularly during pandemics and natural disasters.

AB  - Background: Accumulating evidence has linked exposure to ambient air pollution to a reduction in semen quality; how-ever, the exposure-response associations are yet to be synthesized.Objective: To summarize the exposure-response associations between air pollution and semen quality.Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for relevant studies published before April 20, 2022. Studies investigating the exposure-response association of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 with semen quality written in English were included. Semen quality parameters included semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm number, total motility, progressive motility, and normal forms. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were performed to synthesize associations in the meta-analysis. Results: The search returned 850 studies, 11 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. Each 10 mu g/m3 increase of expo-sure to PM10 and SO2 was respectively associated with a 2.18 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.10 %-4.21 %) and 8.61 % (1.00 %-15.63 %) reduction in sperm concentration, and a 2.76 % (0.10 %-5.35 %) and 9.52 % (5.82 %-13.93 %) reduction in total sperm number. Each 10 mu g/m3 increase of exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 was respectively associ-ated with a 1.06 % (95 % CI: 0.31 %-1.82 %) and 0.75 % (0.43 %-1.08 %) reduction in total motility, and a 0.55 % (0.09 %-1.01 %) and 0.31 % (0.06 %-0.56 %) reduction in progressive motility. No association was observed for PM2.5 or PM10 with semen volume;PM2.5, NO2, CO, or O3 with sperm concentration or total sperm number; and gaseous air pollutants with total or progressive motility. The association between air pollution and normal forms was not summa-rized due to insufficient number of studies. No significant publication bias was detected.Conclusions: Exposure to ambient PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 was inversely associated with sperm concentration, total sperm number, total motility, and/or progressive motility. Our findings add to the evidence that air pollution may lead to ad-verse effects on male reproductive system and suggest that reducing exposure to air pollution may help maintain better semen quality.

AB  - This article proposes a heuristic model for sentiment analysis on luxury hotel reviews to analyse and explore marketing insights from attitudes and emotions expressed in reviews. We make several significant contributions to visual and multimedia analytics. This research will develop the practical application of visual and multimedia analytics as the research foundation is based on information analytics, geospatial analytics, statistical analytics and data management. Large amounts of data are generated by hotel customers on the Internet, which provides a good opportunity for managers and analysts to explore the hidden information. The analysis of luxury hotels involves different types of data, including real-world scale data, high-dimensional data and geospatial data. The diversity of data increases the difficulty of processing computational visual analytics. It leads to that some classical classification methods, which cost too much time and have high requirements for hardware, are excluded. The goal is to achieve a compromise between performance and cost. An experiment of this model is operated using data extracted from Booking.com. The entire framework of this experiment includes data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering consisting of term frequency-inverse document frequency and Doc2Vec based feature generation and feature selection, Random Forest classification, data analysis and data visualization. The whole process combines statistical analysis, review sentiment analysis and visual analysis to make full use of this dataset and gain more decision-making information to improve luxury hotels' service quality. Compared with simple sentiment analysis, this integrated analytics in social media is expected to be used in practice to gain more insights. The result shows that luxury hotels should focus on staff training, cleanness of rooms and location choice to improve customer satisfaction. The sentiment distribution shows that scores are consistent with the emotion they show in reviews. Hotels in Spain have a much better average score than hotels in the other five countries. In the experiment, the sentiment analysis model is evaluated by receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curve. It is proved that this model performs well. Twenty most essential features have been listed for future adjustments to the model.

AB  - Introduction: Most children have exposure of traumatic events during their life, such as natural disasters, accidents, and abuses. A review of traumatised children's perspective on traumatic events plays an important role in enhancing our understanding and promoting appropriate tailor-made intervention and support to these children. Methods: Four main health-related electronic databases were searched for all English full-text qualitative research articles over the past 11 years to uncover the recent best available perspective/evidence from traumatised children. The PRISMA checklist was adopted to guide the review process. Results: Five themes about children's experiences and perspectives towards the traumatic events encountered were summarised and integrated from 19 qualitative studies identified. They included daily life problems related to trauma, negative responses to trauma, perceived health needs, coping strategies related to trauma and stress, and growth from traumatic experience. Conclusions: This systematic review provides evidence about responses/impacts and perceived health needs of traumatised children and informs the direction caregivers' training can take, helping these children by early identification and timely intervention. More research is needed to examine/compare traumatised children's responses and coping between diverse traumatic experiences, time from exposure, and the sociodemographic characteristics of these children.

AB  - Background: Emerging technology research focusing on promoting healthy lifestyles for the middle-aged and elderly is paramount in recent literature. However, limited evidence is available for the middle-aged population. This paper reviews how emerging technologies can help in promoting a healthy lifestyle for the middle-aged and elderly.Methods: A scoping literature review method was employed. Articles were extracted from online databases pub-lished within 2010-2021. Overall, 3,152 articles related to the topic were obtained and 2979 articles were archived via different search procedures. Moreover, 173 articles that met the inclusion criteria underwent qualitative syn-thesize for conclusive inferences.Results: Most studies focused on people aged 60 and up, leaving the middle-aged population under-studied and unprepared to age. Older adults have high technology anxiety and resistance to change. Limited studies are avail-able to support technology-based healthy lifestyle promotion for middle-aged people. The emerging technologies that are useful in promoting healthy lifestyle behavior among middle-aged people include: robotics, virtual reality, wearables, artificial intelligence, smart textiles, as well as centralized health information systems.Conclusion: This review sets as a pace-setter for future research on how emerging technologies can aid in the development of healthy lifestyles for the middle-aged and elderly population, allowing them to live a quality life as they age.

AB  - Organic contaminants (OCs) are ubiquitous in the environment, posing severe threats to human health and ecological balance. In particular, OCs and their metabolites could interact with genetic materials to induce genotoxicity, which has attracted considerable attention. In this review, bibliometric analysis was executed to analyze the publications on the genotoxicity of OCs in soil from 1992 to 2021. The result indicated that significant contributions were made by China and the United States in this field and the research hotspots were biological risks, damage mechanisms, and testing methods. Based on this, in this review, we summarized the mani-festations and influencing factors of genotoxicity of OCs to soil organisms, the main damage mechanisms, and the most commonly utilized testing methods. OCs can induce genotoxicity and the hierarchical response of soil organisms, which could be influenced by the physicochemical properties of OCs and the properties of soil. Specific mechanisms of genotoxicity can be classified into DNA damage, epigenetic toxicity, and chromosomal aberrations. OCs with different molecular weights lead to genetic material damage by inducing the generation of ROS or forming adducts with DNA, respectively. The micronucleus test and the comet test are the most commonly used testing methods. Moreover, this review also pointed out that future studies should focus on the relationships between bioaccessibilities and genotoxicities, transcriptional regulatory factors, and potential metabolites of OCs to elaborate on the biological risks and mechanisms of genotoxicity from an overall perspective.

AB  - Background: Women prisoners are a population that is vulnerable to mental health problems. Women prisoners have a higher risk of mental health problems than women in the general population. So far, there have been very few studies with specific on women prisoner populations discussing mental health needs in prisons. The high prevalence of mental health problems in women prisoners is inseparable from meeting the mental health needs of women prisoners in prison. This review aimed to identify the mental health needs of women prisoners.Methods: A scoping review was used, a systematic search of the articles on Oxford Academic Journals, Emerald Insight, Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar using the keywords "Mental Health " OR "Health " AND "Needs " OR "Needs Assessment " OR "Addressing Needs " AND "Female " OR "Woman " OR "Women " AND "Inmates " OR "Prisoners " OR "Offenders " OR "Convicts ".Results: A total of 10 out of 254 selected, were considered eligible for inclusion and the results showed that the six major themes of mental health needs of women prisoners were treatment of substance, drug, and alcohol abuse, support system, empathy, training, mental illness treatment and access to health services, and health intervention: therapy and counselling.Conclusion: It is recommended for further research to focus more on the problem of access to gender-based mental health services in prisons.

AB  - Simple Summary Mechanical stress is a substantial natural environmental constraint for plants that is induced by dry compacted soils, intense rain and windstorms, changes in gravity, and obstacles. It is crucial to completely comprehend the precise mechanisms of plant response and adaptation to mechanical stresses as it has been demonstrated that their performance and growth rates are strongly impacted by these conditions. Over the past few decades, research in different fields (botany, biomechanics, genetics, biochemistry, imaging, etc.) has offered fragmentary insights into the mechanisms used by plants to counteract mechanical pressures. In an attempt to illustrate the complete picture, this review synthesizes current mechanical stress knowledge and research gaps on both above- and below-ground organs of annual and perennial plants, underlying similarity/differences and providing future recommendations. Mechanical stimuli, together with the corresponding plant perception mechanisms and the finely tuned thigmomorphogenetic response, has been of scientific and practical interest since the mid-17th century. As an emerging field, there are many challenges in the research of mechanical stress. Indeed, studies on different plant species (annual/perennial) and plant organs (stem/root) using different approaches (field, wet lab, and in silico/computational) have delivered insufficient findings that frequently impede the practical application of the acquired knowledge. Accordingly, the current work distils existing mechanical stress knowledge by bringing in side-by-side the research conducted on both stem and roots. First, the various types of mechanical stress encountered by plants are defined. Second, plant perception mechanisms are outlined. Finally, the different strategies employed by the plant stem and roots to counteract the perceived mechanical stresses are summarized, depicting the corresponding morphological, phytohormonal, and molecular characteristics. The comprehensive literature on both perennial (woody) and annual plants was reviewed, considering the potential benefits and drawbacks of the two plant types, which allowed us to highlight current gaps in knowledge as areas of interest for future research.

AB  - Background: A good perception of disease risk can help patients adopt correct preventive behaviors and good adherence to treatment. We examined knowledge, awareness, and perception towards thyroid cancer (TC) by a systematic analysis of published literature.Methods: Four databases, including PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of science were searched using relevant keywords for papers prior to June 30, 2022. The levels of knowledge, awareness, and perception about TC, as well as risk factors, clinical signs, and sources of health were narratively synthesized.Results: Ten papers were finally included in this study for analysis. Despite relative good awareness, both the general population and medical students have relatively poor levels of knowledge and perception of TC and risk factors. The results of most studies showed that less than half of the participants had good knowledge about TC and its risk factors. Most participants are increasingly turning to the Internet and social media to obtain information about TC. This study also indicated that poor levels of knowledge regarding TC were strongly related to educational attainment and type of participants.Conclusion: The findings of this paper provide valuable information for intervention providers to prevent and control of TC and encourage them to carry out health promotion campaigns to enhance knowledge and awareness of TC.

AB  - Simple Summary We presented a comprehensive, systematic literature review of all published New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)-related intoxications and fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic (from January 2020 to March 2022). Public implications, such as isolation and social distancing, may have reduced consumption of some drugs. These stressful conditions brought an increase in the use of other drugs, with the illicit market and related misuse of drugs moving to different drugs of abuse, such as NPS. More than 200 cases were reported in Europe, UK, USA and Japan during the pandemic period, with synthetic opioid, synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones the most representative NPS classes. Importantly, the combined consumption of several NPS classes comprised 30% of all cases. Considering that the pandemic may have reduced the capabilities of forensic toxicology laboratories to report comprehensive information, the data could have led to an underestimation. In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, declaring the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March 2020. Stringent measures decreased consumption of some drugs, moving the illicit market to alternative substances, such as New Psychoactive Substances (NPS). A systematic literature search was performed, using scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and institutional and government websites, to identify reported intoxications and fatalities from NPS during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search terms were: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, intox*, fatal*, new psychoactive substance, novel psychoactive substance, smart drugs, new psychoactive substance, novel synthetic opioid, synthetic opioid, synthetic cathinone, bath salts, legal highs, nitazene, bath salt, legal high, synthetic cannabinoid, phenethylamine, phencyclidine, piperazine, novel benzodiazepine, benzodiazepine analogue, designer benzodiazepines, tryptamine and psychostimulant. From January 2020 to March 2022, 215 NPS exposures were reported in Europe, UK, Japan and USA. Single NPS class intoxications accounted for 25, while mixed NPS class intoxications represented only 3 cases. A total of 130 NPS single class fatalities and 56 fatalities involving mixed NPS classes were published during the pandemic. Synthetic opioids were the NPS class most abused, followed by synthetic cathinones and synthetic cannabinoids. Notably, designer benzodiazepines were frequently found in combination with fentalogues. Considering the stress to communities and healthcare systems generated by the pandemic, NPS-related information may be underestimated. However, we could not define the exact impacts of COVID-19 on processing of toxicological data, autopsy and death investigations.

AB  - Cavitation-based technologies have emerged as a sustainable and effective way to treat natural waters and wastewater, considering their increasing scarcity due to pollution and climate change. For this reason, this work aimed to conduct a scientometric analysis on the topic of cavitation for water and wastewater treatment during the last 20 years, from 2001 to August 2022. We focused on hydrodynamic and ultrasonic cavitation as the prevalent methods of inducing cavitation. Furthermore, an in-depth study on the main trends regarding the number of publications and citations, key -words co-occurrence and evolution, and countries' publication trends was carried out to investigate the future direc-ti on of this research topic. The data was gathered from the Web of Science database and analyzed by the Visualization Of Similarities software. This work focused on: i) publication and citation trends, ii) scientific categories, iii) countries' contribution to the topic of cavitation, iv) prominent journals, v) keyword co-occurrence and cluster anal-ysis, and vi) keyword evolution analysis. Results showed a significant increase in publications during the past 5 years. The scientific categories with the highest number of publications were "environmental sciences" and "environmental engineering," with a combined share of 19.4 % of publications. Keywords evolution analysis showed that limited focus was given to topics related to "energy" and "energy efficiency" in the field of cavitation, but with the rising importance of each process's sustainability, the attention given to these concepts will increase in the future.Future directions for the topic of cavitation-related water and wastewater treatments will shift towards more environ-mentally friendly applications of hydrodynamic and ultrasonic cavitation as well as towards more green and sustain-able approaches to address the increasing water pollution problems and shortage. Moreover, it will include other uses besides water treatment such as manufacturing nanomaterials food production and medicine.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Pathophysiologically, it is characterized by intracytoplasmic aggregates of alpha-synuclein protein in the Lewy body and loss of dopaminergic neurons from substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum regions of the brain. Although the exact mechanism of neurodegeneration is not fully elucidated, it has been reported that environmental toxins such as MPTP, rotenone, paraquat, and MPP+ induce oxidative stress, which is one of the causative factors for it. To date, there is no complete cure. However, the indispensable role of oxidative stress in mediating PD indicates that antioxidant therapy could be a possible therapeutic strategy against the disease. The deficiency of vitamins has been extensively co-related to PD. Dietary supplementation of vitamins with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and free radical scavenging properties could be the potential neuroprotective therapeutic strategy. This review summarizes the studies that evaluated the role of vitamins (A, B, C, D, E, and K) in PD. It will guide future studies in understanding the potential therapeutic role of vitamins in disease pathophysiology and may provide a framework for designing treatment strategies against the disease.

AB  - This paper serves to enhance the current knowledge base of airborne microplastics which is significantly smaller than that of microplastics in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. It systematically presents the prevalence, sources, fate, risks and mitigations of airborne microplastics through the review of >140 scientific papers published mainly in the last 10 years. Unlike the extant review, it places an emphasis on the indoor microplastics, the risks of air-borne microplastics on animals and plants and their mitigations. The outdoor microplastics are mostly generated by the wear and tear of tires, brake pads, waste incineration and industrial activities. They have been detected in many regions worldwide at concentrations ranging from 0.3 particles/m3 to 154,000 particles/L of air even in the Pyrenees Mountains and the Arctic. As for indoor microplastics, the reported concentrations range from 1 piece/m3 to 9900 pieces/m2/day, and are frequently higher than those of the outdoor microplastics. They come from the wear and tear of walls and ceilings, synthetic textiles and furniture finishings. Airborne microplastics could be suspended and resuspended, entrapped, settle under gravity as well as interact with chemicals, microorganisms and other microplastic particles. In the outdoors, they could also interact with sunlight and be carried by the wind over long distance. Air-borne microplastics could adversely affect plants, animals and humans, leading to reduced photosynthetic rate, re-tarded growth, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and increased cancer risks in humans. They could be mitigated indirectly through filters attached to air-conditioning system and directly through source reduction, regula-tion and biodegradable substitutes.

AB  - Epigenetic pathways are essential in different biological processes and in phenotype-environment interactions in response to different stressors and they can induce phenotypic plasticity. They encompass several processes that are mitotically and, in some cases, meiotically heritable, so they can be transferred to subsequent generations via the germline. Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance (TEI) describes the phenomenon that phenotypic traits, such as changes in fertility, metabolic function, or behavior, induced by environmental factors (e.g., parental care, pathogens, pollutants, climate change), can be transferred to offspring generations via epigenetic mecha-nisms. Investigations on TEI contribute to deciphering the role of epigenetic mechanisms in adaptation, adver-sity, and evolution. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of epigenetic changes between generations, and the downstream chain of events leading to persistent phenotypic changes, remain unclear. Therefore, inter-, (transmission of information between parental and offspring generation via direct exposure) and transgenerational (transmission of information through several generations with disappearance of the triggering factor) consequences of epigenetic modifications remain major issues in the field of modern biology. In this article, we review and describe the major gaps and issues still encountered in the TEI field: the general challenges faced in epigenetic research; deciphering the key epigenetic mechanisms in inheritance processes; identifying the relevant drivers for TEI and implement a collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach to study TEI. Finally, we provide suggestions on how to overcome these challenges and ultimately be able to identify the specific contribution of epigenetics in transgenerational inheritance and use the correct tools for environmental science investigation and biomarkers identification.

AB  - Objectives: Ketamine is a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that can be used to treat major depressive disorder by single or repeated infusions. However, the accessibility and scalability of oral ketamine make it preferred over intravenous ketamine. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of oral ketamine, esketamine and r-ketamine for unipolar and bipolar depression. Materials and methods: Electronic databases were searched from inception to September 2022 to identify relevant articles. Results: Twenty-two studies, including four randomized clinical trials (RCTs), one case series, six case reports, five open-label trials and six retrospective chart review studies involving 2336 patients with depression were included. All included studies reported significant improvement following ketamine administration. Ketamine was well tolerated without serious adverse events. However, RCTs had a high risk of bias due to analysis methods and adverse events monitoring. Ketamine dosage varied from 0.5 to 1.25 mg/kg. The frequency of administration was daily to monthly. Several important limitations were identified, most notably the small number of RCTs. Conclusions: Taken together, preliminary evidence suggests the potential for antidepressant effect of oral ketamine. However, further research with large sample size and long follow-up period is needed to better determine the antisuicidal effect and efficacy in treatment-resistant depression.

AB  - BackgroundDespite a publicly-funded healthcare system, alarming cancer-related health and healthcare inequities persist in Canada. However, it remains unclear how equity is being understood and taken up within the Canadian cancer context. Our objective was to identify how health and healthcare equity are being discussed as goals or aims within the cancer care sector in Canada.MethodsA rapid scoping review was conducted; five biomedical databases, 30 multidisciplinary websites, and Google were searched. We included English-language documents published between 2008 and 2021 that discussed health or healthcare equity in the Canadian cancer context.ResultsOf 3860 identified documents, 83 were included for full-text analysis. The prevalence of published and grey equity-oriented literature has increased over time (2008-2014 [n = 20]; 2015-2021 [n = 62]). Only 25% of documents (n = 21) included a definition of health equity. Concepts such as inequity, inequality and disparity were frequently used interchangeably, resulting in conceptual muddling. Only 43% of documents (n = 36) included an explicit health equity goal. Although a suite of actions were described across the cancer control continuum to address equity goals, most were framed as recommendations rather than direct interventions.ConclusionHealth and healthcare equity is a growing priority in the cancer care sector; however, conceptual clarity is needed to guide the development of robust equity goals, and the development of sustainable, measurable actions that redress inequities across the cancer control continuum. If we are to advance health and healthcare equity in the cancer care sector, a coordinated and integrated approach will be required to enact transformative and meaningful change.

KW  - ADAPTATION
KW  - PERSPECTIVES
AB  - The contribution of human activities to climate change is well understood. Yet the integration of climate change con-siderations into local decision making tools designed to govern activities affecting the environment, such as Environ-mental Impact Assessments (EIAs), remains underdeveloped and inconsistently applied for proposed policies, programs, plans and projects. This study reviews progress across a range of 19 EIA regimes and identifies and assesses regulations and guidelines that have been established to promote the integration of climate change considerations within EIAs. A typology of levels of integration is developed to guide analysis across multiple EIA regimes. The findings identify a global and growing requirement for climate change aspects to be considered within EIAs and describe the range of ways this is done across the regimes selected. Climate change is typically concerned with the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from proposed developments in EIAs. Fewer regimes are concerned with climate change adap-tation, and in general, an integration deficit is identified for regimes where climate change is only partially considered. Examples of high integration indicate that EIA holds the potential to play a substantive role in climate change governance at project level decision making, suggesting the tools hold promise for local level climate governance. However, many do-mestic obstacles can militate against integration, including political, socio-technical, and economic imperatives, particu-larly for exemptions of sector and scope. Nevertheless, examples also indicate advances can be made through jurisprudence during the EIA review stage to establish new precedents of how climate should be considered in EIAs. Po-tential future research and practice directions are identified, and recommendations include the development of regulations and practice guidelines; inclusion of climate change adaptation; strengthening post-decision monitoring; application to all relevant sectors and activities; alignment with SEA; and integration across all stages of the EIA process.

AB  - Essential trace metals like zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), and copper (Cu) play an important physiological role in the metabolomics and healthy functioning of body organs, including the brain. However, abnormal accumulation of trace metals in the brain and dyshomeostasis in the different regions of the brain have emerged as contributing factors in neuronal degeneration, A beta aggregation, and Tau formation. The link between these essential trace metal ions and the risk of AD has been widely studied, although the conclusions have been ambiguous. Despite the absence of evidence for any clinical benefit, therapeutic chelation is still hypothesized to be a therapeutic option for AD. Furthermore, the parameters like bioavailability, ability to cross the BBB, and chelation specificity must be taken into consideration while selecting a suitable chelation therapy. The data in this review summarizes that the primary intervention in AD is brain metal homeostasis along with brain metal scavenging. This review evaluates the impact of different trace metals (Cu, Zn, Fe) on normal brain functioning and their association with neurodegeneration in AD. Also, it investigates the therapeutic potential of metal chelators in the management of AD. An extensive literature search was carried out on the "Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar " to investigate the effect of trace elements in neurological impairment and the role of metal chelators in AD. In addition, the current review highlights the advantages and limitations of chelation therapies and the difficulties involved in developing selective metal chelation therapy in AD patients.

AB  - Social Stories (also known as social narratives) help individuals participate in and understand social situations. This scoping review identifies and synthesizes social narrative research targeting behavior change in individuals with ASD. Using the following questions as a guide: (a) What is the scope of social narrative interventions used for individuals with ASD, (b) What behavior change outcome measures are evaluated, and (c) What research designs are used; five databases were searched from 2007-to-2018. Fifty-six articles met the criteria. Primary outcomes were sorted into two macro-categories: Reduce Disruptive Behaviors and Increase Desired Behaviors. Most, but not all, studies were found to be effective for various behaviors such as aggressive actions, verbal protests, identifying emotions, executive functioning, following directions, and responding in social situations. Social narratives can be used to promote skills/behaviors in individuals with ASD to enable participation, an important goal in occupational therapy practice. They are an accessible and feasible intervention that can be implemented in various settings for behaviors including activities of daily living, social skills, independence, and self-regulation. Most research reviewed used a single subject design, which is a limitation of the research as it makes results difficult to generalize. However, through replication, functional relationships can be determined. Additional research utilizing randomized control trials is recommended.

AB  - BackgroundPrevious functional magnetic resonance imaging studies indicated that acupuncture could activate the brain regions in patients with migraine. However, these studies showed inconsistent results. This activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis aimed to investigate the consistent activated change of brain regions between pre- and post-acupuncture treatment in migraineurs. MethodsWe conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, the Wanfang Database, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database from their inception to 18 August, 2022, to obtain articles assessing the functional magnetic resonance imaging changes of acupuncture for migraine. Two investigators independently performed literature selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The methodological quality was assessed with a modified version of the checklist. The reporting quality of interventions among included studies was evaluated by the Revised Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA). Our meta-analysis was conducted according to the GingerALE software. The Jackknife sensitivity analysis was used to assess the robustness of the results. Results14 articles were finally included according to the eligible criteria. Regarding the immediate effect of acupuncture on migraine, the ALE meta-analysis demonstrated that the deactivation regions were mainly located in the superior frontal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus (uncorrected P < 0.001). The ALE meta-analysis of the cumulative effect showed that the activation regions were the thalamus, superior frontal gyrus, posterior lobe of the cerebellum, insula, middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate, and the deactivation brain regions were located in the transverse temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and inferior occipital gyrus (uncorrected P < 0.001). ConclusionAcupuncture could activate multiple brain areas related with the regulation of pain conduction, processing, emotion, cognition, and other brain regions in patients with migraine. In the future, the combination of multiple imaging technologies could be a new approach to deeply investigate the central mechanism of acupuncture for migraine.

AB  - Background Psychiatry is facing one of the highest levels of shortages among medical specialties. Stigma toward psychiatry plays an influential role in medical students' decision to choose psychiatry as a career and has been reported to be prevalent in different parts of the world, particularly in low/middle-income countries.Objective To systematically review the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) medical students' attitudes toward psychiatry, to assess whether their attitudes are stigmatized or not, and the factors affecting their attitudes.Method PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsychInfo (PsycARTICLES) were searched using a combination of main terms "stigma, " "psychiatry, " "medical students, " and the name of Eastern Mediterranean countries. Cross-sectional studies assessing the attitudes of EMR medical students toward psychiatry were included in this review.Results Ten studies were eligible to be included in the result synthesis. These were from Pakistan (n = 3), Iran (n = 2), Saudi Arabia (n = 1), Lebanon (n = 1), Egypt (n = 1), Bahrain (n = 1), and Oman (n = 1). Most studies reported a combination of both positive and negative attitudes among medical students; however, the overall attitude was positive. Factors affecting medical students' attitude toward psychiatry included poor psychological well-being, having a friend with a psychiatric illness, involving in a romantic relationship with someone suffering from mental illness, young age, frequency of exposure to psychiatry clerkship/teaching, and quality of psychiatry clerkship. Nevertheless, the final positive or negative outcome of these factors on students' attitudes remained controversial.Conclusion Considering the lack of sufficient data from most EMR countries, we need to exercise caution in interpreting the results of this review. Nevertheless, our review indicates that psychiatry is not stigmatized among EMR medical students, and they have generally positive attitudes toward it. The findings of studies evaluating influencing factors are contradictory and demand further exploration.

AB  - Background Internet interventions are a promising avenue for delivering alcohol prevention to employees. The objective of this scoping review was to map all research on alcohol internet interventions aimed at employees regardless of design, to gain an overview of current evidence and identify potential knowledge gaps.Methods We conducted a literature search in three data bases (PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science). Eligibility criteria were that (1) the study targeted employees age >= 18 years; (2) the intervention was delivered predominantly online; (3) the study focused specifically or in part on alcohol use; and (4) the study was published in English in a peer-reviewed academic journal. Two reviewers independently screened, reviewed, and extracted data.Results Twenty studies were included, of which 10 were randomized controlled trials, five were secondary analyses, three were feasibility trials, one was a cohort study and one described the rationale and development of an intervention. No qualitative studies were found. Randomized trials tended to show effects when interventions were compared to waitlists but not when more intensive interventions were compared to less intensive ones. We identified two design-related aspects where studies differed; (1) whether all applicants were included regardless of alcohol use level and (2) whether the intervention was explicitly framed as alcohol-focused or not. Significant recruitment problems were noted in several studies.Conclusions Alcohol internet interventions hold promise in delivering alcohol prevention to employees, but heterogeneity in study design and difficulties in recruitment complicate interpretation of findings.Systematic review registration, Open Science Framework.

AB  - AimDissociative amnesia is an emblematic psychiatric condition in which patients experience massive memory loss ranging from focal to global amnesia. This condition remains poorly understood and this review aims to investigate the neuroanatomical feature of this disease. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature available on PubMed, up to December 1, 2022, using a combination of keywords referring to dissociative amnesia. We included every scientific report involving patients undergoing a functional imaging procedure. ResultsTwenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria (gathering 49 patients). Only one was a controlled study with a large sample. The other 21 were case reports and case series. In resting state, neuroimaging studies mostly showed a hypo-activated right inferolateral prefrontal cortex, associated with limbic hypoactivity and lesser activation of the hippocampal and para-hippocampal structures. The patients also presented abnormal patterns of cerebral activation when performing memory tasks. When testing recognition of memories from the amnestic period, patients showed increased activation across temporal areas (hippocampal and para-hippocampal gyri) and the limbic network. When trying to recollect memories from an amnestic period compared to a non-amnestic period, patients failed to activate these structures efficiently. Most of these patterns tended to return to normal when symptoms resolved. ConclusionThis review identified a paucity of controlled studies in the field of dissociative amnesia neuroimaging, which restricts the extrapolation of results. Patients with dissociative amnesia present a broad prefronto-temporo-limbic network dysfunction. Some of the brain areas implicated in this network might represent potential targets for innovative treatments.

AB  - There is growing evidence of the comorbidity between personality disorder (PD) and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). However, there are no systematic reviews including critical appraisal and meta-analyses that identify, evaluate, and synthesize the available evidence on these associations. Therefore, we present here a protocol of the methodology to undertake a systematic review, with the objective to evaluate associations between PD and MSDs in epidemiological population-based studies. A systematic review of observational studies will be conducted. A complete search strategy will be developed in consultation with a health librarian. To identify peer-reviewed literature, the search will be translated for, and implemented in Medline Complete, CINAHL Complete, and PsycINFO via the EBSCOhost platform from 1990 to the present. Gray literature will be identified. Studies will be eligible if they examine general population participants aged 15 years and over. Associations of interest are the presence of threshold or positive screen according to the DSM-V/5 (groupings: any, Clusters A, B, C, specific PD) or ICD-10 for PD in relation to arthritis, back/neck conditions, fibromyalgia, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and/or "any " of these MSDs. Data extraction and critical appraisal will be conducted in line with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidance for systematic reviews of etiology and risk. The results from all studies will be presented in tables, text, and figures. A descriptive synthesis will present the characteristics of included studies, critical appraisal results, and descriptions of the main findings. Where appropriate, meta-analyses will be performed. If heterogeneity (e.g., I-2 = 50%) is detected, subgroup/sensitivity analysis may be used to explore the possible sources. The systematic review does not require ethics approval. The proposed systematic review will strengthen the evidence base on what is known regarding associations between PD and MSDs by identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the findings of existing observational studies including meta-analyses, where appropriate.

AB  - ObjectiveCancer-related fatigue is one of the most common adverse reactions to cancer survivors, which has a significant impact on the daily life. As a traumatic event, cancer not only brings great physical and mental harm to patients, but also poses a threat to the physical and psychological health of caregivers. Current studies have shown that physical activity improves cancer-related fatigue in cancer survivors. And studies have suggested that dyadic interventions are more effective in improving patient outcomes and may also provide some benefits to caregivers. But the literature on the effects of dyadic-based physical activity on improving cancer-related fatigue has not been synthesized. This scoping review described the scope and impact of studies on cancer-related fatigue with dyadic-based physical activity interventions. MethodsSix databases which is PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL and Medline were searched for all studies of dyadic-based physical activity interventions with outcome measures including cancer-related fatigue published since the inception of the databases through May 2022. The search strategy was developed based on PICO principles. ResultsThis article includes 6 pre and post-test designs and 2 randomized controlled trial design. The majority of participants were survivors with breast and lung cancer. The overall results showed that the effectiveness of dyadic-based physical activity interventions in improving cancer-related fatigue was unsatisfactory. ConclusionsThis scoping review suggests that current dyadic-based physical activity interventions are not well-researched among cancer survivors. In the future, more high-quality studies with more sophisticated and rigorous interventions are needed.

AB  - IntroductionInternational organisations have called to increase young people's involvement in healthcare and health policy development. We currently lack effective methods for facilitating meaningful engagement by young people in health-related decision-making. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify deliberative priority setting methods and explore the effectiveness of these in engaging young people in healthcare and health policy decision-making.MethodsSeven databases were searched systematically, using MeSH and free text terms, for articles published in English before July 2021 that described the use of deliberative priority setting methods for health decision-making with young people. All titles, abstracts and full-text papers were screened by a team of six independent reviewers between them. Data extraction followed the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines. The results are presented as a narrative synthesis, structured around four components for evaluating deliberative processes: 1) representation and inclusion of diverse participants, 2) the way the process is run including levels and timing of participant engagement, 3) the quality of the information provided to participants and 4) resulting outcomes and decisions.FindingsThe search yielded 9 reviews and 21 studies. The more engaging deliberative priority setting tools involved young people-led committees, mixed methods for identifying and prioritising issues and digital data collection and communication tools. Long-term and frequent contact with young people to build trust underpinned the success of some of the tools, as did offering incentives for taking part and skills development using creative methods. The review also suggests that successful priority setting processes with young people involve consideration of power dynamics, since young people's decisions are likely to be made together with family members, health professionals and academics.DiscussionYoung people's engagement in decision-making about their health is best achieved through investing time in building strong relationships and ensuring young people are appropriately rewarded for their time and contribution. If young people are to be instrumental in improving their health and architects of their own futures, decision-making processes need to respect young people's autonomy and agency. Our review suggests that methods of power-sharing with young people do exist but that they have yet to be adopted by organisations and global institutions setting global health policy.

AB  - How do new ideas come about? The central hypothesis presented here states that insights might happen during mental navigation and correspond to rapid plasticity at the cellular level. We highlight the differences between neocortical and hippocampal mechanisms of insight. We argue that the suddenness of insight can be related to the sudden emergence of place fields in the hippocampus. According to our hypothesis, insights are supported by a state of mind-wandering that can be tied to the process of combining knowledge pieces during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). Our framework connects the dots between research on creativity, mental navigation, and specific synaptic plasticity mechanisms in the hippocampus.

AB  - BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to adequate food in terms of quality and quantity, especially for the most vulnerable population groups. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Food Insecurity and its main socioeconomic and health determinants in pregnant women and mothers of children under 2 years of age, during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42021278033). The descriptors "Pregnant Woman", "Postpartum Women", "Breastfeeding Women", "COVID-19", "Food Insecurity", "Food Security" were combined in Scopus (Elsevier), Medline/PubMed (via National Library of Medicine), Embase (Elsevier), Web of Science and Science Direct independently by two researchers in September 2022. Original articles about Food Insecurity in households with pregnant women and mothers of children under 2 years of age during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. The meta-analysis of the prevalence of Food Insecurity was conducted using the RStudio software (4.0.4). ResultsThe initial search resulted in 539 records, and 10 articles met the proposed criteria and were included in this review. The prevalence of Food Insecurity ranged from 11.5 to 80.3% and in the meta-analysis it was 51% (IC: 30-71) (I-2 = 100.0%). The main socioeconomic and health determinants were ethnicity, domain language, low education, low income, informal employment, unemployment, occurrence of mental disorders, domestic violence, in addition to the unavailability of food in markets and lack of transport. The inclusion of studies with data collection by telephone stands out as a limitation, due to the non-inclusion of vulnerable groups without access to this means of communication. ConclusionIt is necessary to implement and strengthen specific public policies for the maternal and child group with the objective of protecting and strengthening the rights of women to maintain the physical and mental integrity of this group and guarantee Food Security.

Literature searches were conducted in six databases and a grey literature search of policy documents and relevant material was also conducted. Due to the range of available literature, both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were considered for inclusion.ResultsFollowing the completion of the literature searches and sifting, nineteen papers were eligible for inclusion.Facilitators to reporting self-harm across the different settings were found to be recognising self-harm behaviours, using passive screening, training and experience, positive communication, and safe, private information sharing. Barriers to reporting self-harm included confidentiality concerns, negative perceptions of young people, communication difficulties, stigma, staff lacking knowledge around self-harm, and a lack of time, money and resources.Facilitators to recording self-harm across the different settings included being open to discussing what is recorded, services working together and co-ordinated help. Barriers to recording self-harm were mainly around stigma, the information being recorded and the ability of staff being able to do so, and their length of professional experience.ConclusionFollowing the review of the current evidence, it was apparent that there was still progress to be made to improve the reporting and recording of self-harm in young people, across the different settings. Future work should concentrate on better understanding the facilitators, whilst aiming to ameliorate the barriers.

AB  - Passenger hostility is commonplace in the transit industry. However, research investigating this job stressor is limited in both scope and quality. This systematic review examines three questions regarding passenger hostility: (a) what is its occurrence (incidence and prevalence); (b) what are its consequences; and (c) what factors are related to its occurrence, intensity, or consequences? Six databases were searched for studies published between 2010 and 2020 reporting the occurrence, consequences, or correlates of passenger hostility directed toward transit workers. Risk of bias was categorized using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Results were summarized in tables and narratively synthesized. Nineteen eligible studies (10 quantitative and nine qualitative or mixed methods) were identified. Evidence from 14 studies indicated that passenger hostility occurs frequently, and is often underreported, especially in its less severe forms. Sixteen studies reported correlates of the occurrence, intensity, or consequences of hostility, with these grouped into worker, passenger, organizational, environmental, and event categories. Immediate and long-term impacts were identified in ten studies. This review contributes to understanding the likely antecedents, correlates and consequences of passenger hostility directed at transit industry workers. It also highlights some common methodological limitations in past research and proposes solutions to them. As such, the paper provides suggestions for future explorations and intervention targets aimed at reducing this common workplace stressor.

AB  - Objective The current systematic review (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020220142) aims to characterize sleep health in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and evaluate disease-related and psychosocial prognostic factors associated with sleep disturbances in pediatric IBD. Methods A search of PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was performed. Included studies were written in English, presented original peer-reviewed research, included participants with a mean age of 8-18 years, and reported on at least one quantitative sleep outcome for children with IBD or factors impacting sleep for these children. Studies that did not report on a sleep outcome or factors influencing sleep, or only examined fatigue were excluded. Study quality was evaluated using validated quality assessment tools. The data from the included studies were extracted and synthesized across sleep health domains. Results Database searches yielded 122 records (total participants = 3,905). After full-text and reference/citation searches, 28 articles were included in the review. Methods used to evaluate sleep widely varied across studies and a majority of the studies were cross-sectional. Results suggest that children with IBD may not experience more frequent sleep disturbance than healthy children. Greater sleep disturbance in pediatric IBD was found to be associated with poorer psychosocial functioning and greater active disease/severe symptoms. Conclusions The findings from this review highlight the complex associations between sleep disturbances, inflammation, disease severity, and psychosocial functioning in children with IBD. Additional research with greater methodological rigor (e.g., use of validated sleep measures, longitudinal design, reporting of effect sizes) is warranted to further elucidate these relationships. The current systematic review examines the existing evidence and methods of measurement of sleep disturbances in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. We describe and evaluate factors associated with sleep disturbance in this population. The quality of evidence, strengths and weaknesses of the literature, and future directions are described.

AB  - Chewing khat during pregnancy adversely affects maternal and fetal health, but available studies are scarce and inconsistent, and it is difficult to conclude the relationship between khat consumption and perinatal outcomes. We aimed to investigate the available studies on the effect of khat use during pregnancy on perinatal and maternal outcomes. For this meta-analysis, we conducted a thorough search of articles published in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science up to the date this search was undertaken (03.01.2022). We used random effect model with the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate the pooled odds ratio and mean difference. We found that khat use during pregnancy was significantly associated with increased odds of low birth weight (OR:2.51; 95% CI: 1.60 to 3.94), congenital anomalies (OR:3.17; 95% CI: 1.30 to 7.73), premature rupture of membrane (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.59 to 2.50), perinatal mortality (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.26 to 3.03), and lower APGAR scores at the fifth minute (MD: -1.7; 95% CI: -2.32 to -1.07). Also, increased odds for developing maternal psychological stress and anemia were reported in women using khat during pregnancy. There were no statistically significant differences in stillbirth and preterm birth between women using khat during pregnancy and their counterparts. Since prenatal khat use is associated with adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes, we strongly recommend equitable and easily accessible health services through the implementation of integrated addiction treatment with maternity services to address khat use during pregnancy and encourage the practice of healthy behavior of women.

AB  - There is a growth in the use of robotic telepresence technology, allowing users to remotely access an environment, to support the inclusion/attendance of school pupils experiencing physical/emotional difficulties in the UK. Educational psychologists (EPs) are likely to encounter robotic telepresence technology due to their role in supporting pupil inclusion. Despite the Department for Education exploring this technology as a form of alternative provision, there is a lack of research exploring perceptions around robotic telepresence technology. The current review explores perspectives of users. Database searches were conducted between July 2021 and September 2021, identifying studies published within the last ten years. Eleven papers met the inclusion criteria. The review identified four inductive themes: potential for robotic telepresence technology to promote inclusion; potential for robotic telepresence technology to facilitate engagement; technical design factors influencing utility; and acceptability of robotic telepresence technology to users. Findings are discussed alongside implications for educational psychologists/future research.

AB  - BackgroundThe re-emerging dominance of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2021 caused a new wave of Afghan refugees heading Iran and neighboring countries. Iran in the Middle East and Germany in Europe are two major host countries to the largest populations of Afghan refugees. In both countries, several studies have been done to assess the health condition of refugees.ObjectivesTo systematically review the existing literature to identify similarities and differences of health conditions of Afghan refugees living in the two countries, and to synthesize evidence on the health status and health care access of these populations.MethodsRelated electronic databases and grey literature of Iran and Germany on the health of Afghan refugees were scanned and searched up for the period 2000-2020. Key terms were formed by combining "Afghan refugees or immigrants or populations or asylum seekers", "Physical or mental health", "Healthcare service or access or use", "Iran or Germany". Empirical studies were considered if they contained samples of Afghan refugees with particular outcomes for Afghans. Results were categorized for both countries in the three main areas of physical health, mental health, and access/use of healthcare services.ResultsNine hundred twenty-two documents were extracted, of which 75 full-texts were finally reviewed. 60 documents belonged to the health condition of Afghan refugees residing in Iran including 43 in physical health, 6 in mental health, 8 in healthcare access and use, and 3 in multiple aspects of health, and 15 belonged to Germany including 7 in physical health, 4 in mental health, 2 in healthcare access and use, and 2 in multiple aspects of health. A less explicit evaluation of the overall health condition of Afghan refugees was observable, particularly for Germany. While matches on the study subject exist for both countries, in comparison to Germany, we extracted more quantitative and qualitative health studies on Afghan refugees of the mentioned areas from Iran. German health studies were rare, less qualitative, and more on the health condition of diverse refugee groups in general.ConclusionsWide gaps and unanswered questions related to mental health and overall health status of the Afghan refugee population are observable, especially in Germany. Our systematic review identified the gap in evidence, which we would recommend to bridge using a wider lens to comprehensively assess the overall condition of refugees considering associations between health and socio-economic and cultural determinants instead of a one-dimensional approach. Further, within health studies on refugee populations, we recommend stratification of results by the country of origin to capture the within-group diversity among refugees with different countries of origin.

AB  - Objective: Winter birth has been hypothesized to be associated with increased schizophrenia risk for nearly a century. Major hypotheses regarding the potential etiological risk factors for schizophrenia such as vitamin D deficiency and virus exposure in utero are predicated based on the observation that risk of schizophrenia is higher in children born in winter months.Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between season and month of birth and risk of schizophrenia. We further investigated this relationship stratified by hemisphere.Results: Forty-three studies spanning 30 countries and territories and 440,039 individuals with schizophrenia were included in this meta-analysis. Winter births were associated with a small but statistically significant increased risk of schizophrenia (OR 1.05, 95 % CI 1.03-1.07, p < 0.0001) and summer births were associated with a small but statistically significant decreased risk of schizophrenia (OR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.94-0.98, p = 0.0001). Stratified subgroup analysis demonstrated no significant difference between hemispheres in the risk of schizophrenia for either winter or summer births. Conclusions: Analysis using birth month data demonstrated a clear seasonal trend towards increased risk of schizophrenia being associated with winter birth months and decreased risk of schizophrenia in summer-to-fall months in the Northern but not Southern Hemisphere. These data suggest a small-but-substantial increased risk of schizophrenia in winter birth month. Further research needs to examine potential etiologic causes for this association.

AB  - Salinization is a threat that affects aquatic ecosystems worldwide. As primary producers, freshwater macrophytes are of paramount importance in these ecosystems, however, information regarding the potential impacts of salinization upon these organisms is still scarce. In this review we provide a comprehensive and updated discussion of how freshwater macrophytes deal with salinity increase in freshwaters. We reviewed the salinity tolerance of widespread non-halophyte macrophytes through an overview of salinity tolerance mechanisms, their tolerance classification, and salinity effects at different levels of organization: from individuals to ecosystems. Thus, we demonstrated that widespread macrophytes that inhabit freshwaters display efficient salinity tolerance to salinity levels between 5 and 10 g L-1, and only a few species display tolerance to salinities higher than 10 g L-1. Widespread macrophytes demonstrated salinity tolerance of approximately 5 g L-1. Widespread macrophytes demonstrated salinity tolerance of approximately 5 g L-1. Emergent, floating and submerged species showed no significant difference in salinity tolerance. Salinity stress symptoms in freshwater macrophytes are somewhat similar to those of terrestrial plants and can show up even at slight salinity increases. Salinities higher than 1 g L-1 can negatively affect both physiology and diversity of non-halophyte macrophytes and cause long-term - and not well understood - changes in freshwater ecosystems. Salinization of freshwater ecosystems, among others threats, in combination with climate change, raise concerns about the future ecological status of freshwater ecosystems and the services they can provide.

AB  - Background and aim: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental illness characterized by difficulties in social communication and repetitive behaviors. There have beenmany previous studies of toxic metals in ASD. Therefore, the priority of this study is to review the relationships between exposure to toxic metals and ASD.
   Materials & methods: This study was based on a comprehensive search of international databases, such as Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar, for all works related to the subject under discussion from 1982 to 2022. We further summarize published data linked to this topic and discuss with clarifying evidence that agrees and conflicts with the association between exposure to toxic metals, including mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and aluminum (Al) and ASD.
   Results: 40 out of 63 papers met the requirements for meta-analysis. Blood Pb levels (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.81; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.36-1.25), blood Hg (SMD = 0.90; CI: 0.30-1.49), hair Pb (SMD = 1.47; CI: 0.03-2.92), urine As (SMD= 0.65; CI: 0.22-1.09), and urine Al levels (SMD= 0.85; CI: 0.40-1.29) in autistic individuals were significantly higher than those of healthy control (HC). Whereas, blood As levels (SMD = 1.33; CI: -1.32-3.97), hair As (SMD= 0.55; CI: -0.14-1.24), hair Cd (SMD= 0.60; CI: -0.31-1.51), hair Hg (SMD= 0.41; CI: -0.30-1.12), hair Al (SMD = 0.87; CI: -0.02-1.77), urine Pb (SMD = -0.68; CI: -2.55-1.20), urine Cd (SMD = -0.26; CI: -0.94-0.41), and urine Hg levels (SMD = 0.47; CI: -0.09-1.04) in autistic individuals were significantly lower than those of HC.
   Conclusion: Toxic metal content significantly differed between individuals with ASD and HC in the current metaanalysis. The results assist in clarifying the significance of toxic metals as environmental factors in the development of ASD.

AB  - Microalgae is considered an alternative source for biodiesel production producing renewable, sustainable and carbon -neutral energy. Microalgae property changes among species, which determines the efficiency of biodiesel production. Besides the lipid content evaluation, multi-principles (including high lipid productivity, high biomass yield, pollution resistance and desired fatty acid, etc.) for superior oil-producing species screening was proposed in this review and three microalgae species (Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus obliquus and Mychonastes afer) with high bio-lipid producing prospect were screened out based on big data digging and analysis. The multilateral strategies for algal-lipid stimulat-ing were also compared, among which, nutrient restriction, temperature control, heterotrophy and chemicals addition showed high potential in enhancing lipid accumulation; while electromagnetic field showed little effect. Interestingly, it was found that the lipid accumulation was more sensitive to nitrogen (N)-limitation other than phosphorus (P). Nu-trient restriction, salinity stress etc. enhanced lipid accumulation by creating a stressed environment. Hence, optimum conditions (e.g. N:15-35 mg/L and P:4-16 mg/L) should be set to balance the lipid accumulation and biomass growth, and further guarantee the algal-lipid productivity. Otherwise, two-step cultivation could be applied during all the stressed stimulation. Different from lab study, effectiveness, operability and economy should be all considered for stim-ulation strategy selection. Nutrient restriction, temperature control and heterotrophy were highly feasible after the multidimensional evaluation.

AB  - Recently, human industrial practices and certain activities have caused the widespread spread of emerging contami-nants throughout the environmental matrix, even in trace amounts, which constitute a serious threat to human health and environmental ecology, and have therefore attracted the attention of research scholars. Different traditional tech-niques are used to monitor water pollutants, However, they still have some disadvantages such as high costs, ecological problems and treatment times, and require technicians and researchers to operate them effectively. There is therefore an urgent need to develop simple, inexpensive and highly sensitive methods to sense and detect these toxic environ-mental contaminants. Optical fiber microfluidic coupled sensors offer different advantages over other detection technologies, allowing manipulation of light through controlled microfluidics, precise detection results and good sta-bility, and have therefore become a logical device for screening and identifying environmental contaminants. This paper reviews the application of fiber optic microfluidic sensors in emerging environmental contaminant detection, focusing on the characteristics of different emerging contaminant types, different types of fiber optic microfluidic sen-sors, methodological principles of detection, and specific emerging contaminant detection applications. The optical detection methods in fiber optic microfluidic chips and their respective advantages and disadvantages are analyzed in the discussion. The applications of fiber optic biochemical sensors in microfluidic chips, especially for the detection of emerging contaminants in the aqueous environment, such as personal care products, endocrine disruptors, and perfluorinated compounds, are reviewed. Finally, the prospects of fiber optic microfluidic coupled sensors in environ-mental detection and related fields are foreseen.

AB  - Objective Suicide is considered one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, especially among women with postpartum depression. In the current systematic review, we conducted a qualitative data synthesis of recent studies exploring novel risk factors including sleep disturbances and medical conditions, alongside known and significant risk factors for perinatal suicidality.Evidence acquisition We conducted a systematic search of the literature according to PRISMA guidelines on PubMed, PsycNET, and Scopus databases. Search terms were "pregnancy " "OR " "postpartum " "OR " "peripartum " "OR " "perinatal " "OR " "postnatal " combined with the Boolean "AND " operator with "suicide " "OR " "suicidality " "OR " "suicidal ideation " "OR " "suicidal behavior. "Evidence synthesis The initial search yielded 1,458 records, of which 51 research reports that met inclusion criteria were analyzed. These 51 studies sampled a total of 45,942 participants. Clinically, sleep disturbance, psychopathology, and social support have been identified as dominant risk factors for suicidal behavior among pregnant and postpartum women, as well as medical conditions and aversive life events.Conclusion Monitoring sleep disturbance, depression, and perceived social support is critical given that they are significant risk factors for suicide among perinatal women. Early identification of perinatal women who may be at risk of suicide, although not depressed, is crucial.Limitations The use of tools designed to identify depression to identify suicidal risk, fail to identify women who are at risk but who do not suffer from depression. Other methodological limitations are the lack of longitudinal studies and the complexity of examining suicidal behavior in sample studies.

AB  - Exposure therapy (ET), which follows the Pavlovian extinction model, is regarded as the gold-standard treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). The prospect of virtual reality in lieu of a traditional laboratory setting for the treatment of SAD has not been rigorously explored. The aim of the review was to summarize, find gaps in the current literature, and formulate future research direction by identifying two broad research questions: the comparative efficacy between in vivo ET and virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) and the effectiveness of the Pavlovian extinction model in treating SAD. The criteria for effectiveness were effect size, relapse prevention, attrition rate and ecological validity. A literature search on recent randomized controlled trials yielded a total of 6 original studies (N=358), excluding duplication and overlapping participants. All studies supported that VRET was as effective as in vivo ET. Behavioral therapy that follows classical conditioning principles has a high attrition and relapse rate. Comparisons were drawn between the efficacy of the Pavlovian extinction model and other existing models, including third-wave approaches. The neural markers are suggested to be included as efficacy measures in treating SAD. The gold-standard treatment for SAD requires a paradigm shift through rigorous longitudinal comparative studies.

AB  - Ferroptosis is distinct from other apoptotic forms of programmed cell death and is characterized by the accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation. Iron plays a crucial role in the oxidation of lipids via the Fenton reaction with oxygen. Hence, iron accumulation causes phospholipid peroxidation which induces ferroptosis. Moreover, detoxification by glutathione is disrupted during ferroptosis. A growing number of studies have implicated ferroptosis in nervous system disorders such as depression, neurodegenerative disease, stroke, trau-matic brain injury, and sepsis-associated encephalopathy. This review summarizes the pathogenesis of ferroptosis and its relationship with various nervous system disorders.

AB  - Psychoeducation is recommended in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and has been shown to improve satisfaction with mental health service and treatment adherence, reduce relapse and hospital read-mission rates, and enhance functioning and quality of life. Youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) may also benefit from receiving psychoeducation as part of their treatment. The goal of this study was to conduct a scoping review to map out the existing literature on psychoeducation for CHR individuals, including content, utilization, and benefits, in order to identify areas for future research and clinical care. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection) to identify literature through 02/25/2022 that provided data or significant commentary about the provision of psychoeducation to CHR individuals. After screening titles and abstracts, four co-authors assessed full-text articles for eligibility. Thirty-three studies were included in the review. Psycho -education is recommended in the treatment of CHR individuals, is a preferred treatment option among CHR individuals, and many CHR programs report offering psychoeducation. However, details about the psycho -educational content and method of delivery are notably absent from recommendations and reports on the provision of CHR psychoeducation in real-world settings. We identified two brief and structured CHR psycho -education interventions and one longer-term psychoeducational multifamily group model for CHR that show feasibility and promise, though they have not yet undergone randomized trials to evaluate effectiveness of the psychoeducation. We also identified several comprehensive CHR interventions that included an explicit psy-choeducation module, though the unique role of the psychoeducational component is unknown. Despite being recommended as a critical component of treatment for CHR individuals and preferred by CHR individuals, the ways in which psychoeducation are being delivered to CHR individuals in real-world practice is still largely ambiguous. Rigorous evaluations of psychoeducation treatment models are needed, as well as investment from clinical programs to facilitate the implementation and dissemination of standardized psychoeducation for CHR individuals.

AB  - Introduction: In recent years, the relationship between academic burnout (AB) and problematic mobile phone use (PMPU) has become the hot issue of scholars, and a lot of related research has been carried out, but the results are different. Most studies showed that there was a significant positive correlation between AB and PMPU. However, some studies showed that the relationship between AB and PMPU was not significant. While this study aimed at exploring the relationship between AB and PMPU, as well as the influence of some moderating factors (region, age, gender, publication year, the measurement instrument) on them. Methods: According to the searching process for studies of PRISMA, we searched the related studies on AB and PMPU in Mainland China from January 2012 to November 2022 from CNKI, Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP Information Co., Ltd. (VIP), Baidu scholar, ProQuest dissertations, Taylor & Francis, Springer, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO and PsyclNFO. Eventually, 50 studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving 38,488 subjects, with the sample size ranging from 193 to 2,260. CMA 3.0 was used to analyze the overall effect and test the moderating effect. Results: The result shows that the relationship between AB and PMPU can be considered as a moderate correlation (r= 0.414, 95%CI [0.384, 0.443]), and moderator analysis shows that the relationship between AB and PMPU was moderated by the measurement instrument and publication year. Discussion: Specifically, when the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale and the Smartphone Addiction Scale for College Students were used as PMPU measurement tools, the correlation coefficients between AB and PMPU were higher. When the publication year was used as a moderating variable, the relationship between AB and PMPU increased over the years.

AB  - The residential sector is one of the primary energy consumers and emitters of greenhouse gases. Given the environ-mental problem, one of the methods of mitigating electricity consumption and reducing the temperature in buildings is green infrastructure: green roofs and walls. This article presents a compilation of the studies carried out in Mexico about green infrastructure; the energy, thermal and environmental benefits obtained were analyzed according to the vegetation, substrate, climate, and systems configuration. In addition, the development of policies, laws, regula-tions, and incentives in the field of green roofs in Mexico was also analyzed. The results indicate that using green infrastructure can help mitigate greenhouse gases since a green roof can reduce the indoor temperature up to 19.9 degrees C, save 28 % annually in electricity consumption and remove 80 % of rainwater pollutants. Finally, the results of this research can provide insight for researchers, legislators, and urban planners about the state in which Mexico is located, as well as help in decision-making.

AB  - Introduction: The use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), or vaping, is a relatively recent phenom-enon, and there are various gaps in our current knowledge regarding the specific effects of e-cigarettes, such as their immunological effects. The importance of this question became even more relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.Objective: This literature review examines the relationship between the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and immunological effects to examine available information and identify gaps in the current knowledge. Our search strategy included studies focusing on the effects of ENDS on the immune response during infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 and pneumonia. Methods: Peer-reviewed studies presenting quantitative data published from 2007, the year that e-cigarettes were introduced to the US market until 2022 have been included. All studies were indexed in PubMed. We excluded papers on THC and EVALI (E-cigarette, or Vaping Product, Use Associated Lung Injury) as we wanted to focus on the effects of nicotine devices.Results: Among the 21 articles that assessed the relationship between ENDS and immunological health effects, we found eight studies based on cell models, two articles based on both cell and mouse models, five articles based on mouse models, and six studies of human populations. Most of the articles identified in our review demonstrated a potential association between vaping and adverse immunological health effects.Discussion: Overall, the evidence from the cell and animal studies indicates that there is a positive, statistically significant association between vaping and adverse immune response during infectious respiratory diseases. The evidence from human studies is not conclusive.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy (SERS) is a powerful technique of vibrational spectroscopy based on the inelastic scattering of incident photons by molecular species. It has unique properties such as ultra-sensitivity, selectivity, non-destructivity, speed, and fingerprinting properties for analytical and sensing appli-cations. This enables SERS to be widely used in real-world sample analysis and basic plasmonic mechanistic studies. However, the desirable properties of SERS are compromised by the high cost and low reproducibility of the signals. The development of multifunctional, stable and reusable nano-engineered SERS substrates is a viable solution to circumvent these drawbacks. Recently, plasmonic SERS active nano-substrates with various mor-phologies have attracted the attention of researchers due to promising properties such as the formation of dense hot spots, additional stability, tunable and controlled morphology, and surface functionalization. This compre-hensive review focused on the current advances in the field of SERS active nanosubstrates suitable for the detection and quantification of anionic environmental pollutants. The common fabrication methods, including the techniques for morphological adjustments and surface modification, substrate categories, and the design of nanotechnologically fabricated plasmonic SERS substrates for anion detection are systematically presented. Here, the need for the design, synthesis, and functionalization of SERS nano-substrates for anions of great environ-mental importance is explained in detail. In addition, the broad categories of SERS nano-substrates, namely colloid-based SERS substrates and solid-support SERS substrates are discussed. Moreover, a brief discussion of SERS detection of certain anionic pollutants in the environment is presented. Finally, the prospects in the fabrication and commercialization of pilot-scale handheld SERS sensors and the construction of smart nano-substrates integrated with novel amplifying materials for the detection of anions of environmental and health concern are proposed.

AB  - Environmental exposures including toxins and nutrition may hamper the developing brain in utero, limiting the brain's reserve capacity and increasing the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize all currently available evidence for the association between prenatal exposures and AD-related volumetric brain biomarkers. We systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies in humans reporting on associations between prenatal exposure(s) and AD-related volumetric brain biomarkers, including whole brain volume (WBV), hippocampal volume (HV) and/or temporal lobe volume (TLV) measured with structural magnetic resonance imaging (PROSPERO; CRD42020169317). Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We identified 79 eligible studies (search date: August 30th, 2020; Ntotal=24,784; median age 10.7 years) reporting on WBV (N = 38), HV (N = 63) and/or TLV (N = 5) in exposure categories alcohol (N = 30), smoking (N = 7), illicit drugs (N = 14), mental health problems (N = 7), diet (N = 8), disease, treatment and physiology (N = 10), infections (N = 6) and environmental exposures (N = 3). Overall risk of bias was low. Prenatal exposure to alcohol, opioids, cocaine, nutrient shortage, placental dysfunction and maternal anemia was associated with smaller brain volumes. We conclude that the prenatal environment is important in shaping the risk for late-life neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Mind wandering, also known as task-unrelated thought, refers to the drift of attention from a focal task or train of thought. Because self-caught measures of mind wandering require participants to spontaneously indicate when they notice their attention drift, self-caught methodologies provide a way to measure mind wandering with meta-awareness. Given the proposed role of metaawareness in mental health and psychological interventions, an overview of existing selfcaught methodologies would help clinicians and researchers make informed decisions when choosing or adapting a mind wandering or meta-awareness measure. This systematic review included 39 studies after 790 studies were assessed for eligibility. All studies operationalised mind wandering as instances of attention drift from a primary task. Three types of primary task were identified: (1) tasks adapted from computerised continuous performance tests (CPT) of sustained attention, (2) tasks involving focusing on the breath or a stream of aural beats, akin to in-vivo mindfulness meditation, (3) tasks involving an everyday life activity such as reading. Although data on mind wandering without meta-awareness (e.g., measured with probe-caught measures) was also obtained in many studies, such data was not always used in conjunction with self-caught mind wandering data to determine level of mind wandering meta-awareness. Few studies reported both reliability and validity of the measures used. This review shows that considerable methodological heterogeneity exists in the literature. Methodological variants of self-caught mind wandering methodologies are documented and examined, and suggestions for future research and clinical work are suggested.

AB  - Benzodiazepines have been in use for over half a century. While they remain highly prescribed, their unfavorable side-effect profile and abuse liability motivated a search for alternatives. Most of these efforts focused on the development of benzodiazepine-like drugs that are selective for specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes. While there is ample evidence that subtype-selective GABA(A) receptor ligands have great potential for providing symptom relief without typical benzodiazepine side-effects, it is less clear whether subtype-selective targeting strategies can also reduce misuse and abuse potential. This review focuses on the three benzodiazepine properties that are relevant to the DSM-5-TR criteria for Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, namely, reinforcing properties of benzodiazepines, maladaptive behaviors related to benzodiazepine use, and benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence. We review existing evidence regarding the involvement of different GABA(A) receptor subtypes in each of these areas. The reviewed studies suggest that alpha 1-containing GABA(A) receptors play an integral role in benzodiazepine-induced plasticity in reward-related brain areas and might be involved in the development of tolerance and dependence to benzodiazepines. However, a systematic comparison of the contributions of all benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors to these processes, a mechanistic understanding of how the positive modulation of each receptor subtype might contribute to the brain mechanisms underlying each of these processes, and a definitive answer to the question of whether specific chronic modulation of any given subtype would result in some or all of the benzodiazepine effects are currently lacking from the literature. Moreover, how non-selective benzodiazepines might lead to the maladaptive behaviors listed in DSM and how different GABA(A) receptor subtypes might be involved in the development of these behaviors remains unexplored. Considering the increasing burden of benzodiazepine abuse, the common practice of benzodiazepine misuse that leads to severe dependence, and the current efforts to generate side-effect free benzodiazepine alternatives, there is an urgent need for systematic, mechanistic research that provides a better understanding of the brain mechanisms of benzodiazepine misuse and abuse, including the involvement of specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes in these processes, to establish an informed foundation for preclinical and clinical efforts.

AB  - BackgroundDespite evidence on the significant potential value of family involvement during the treatment of patients with severe mental illness, research has shown that family involvement is largely underused. The duty of confidentiality is reported to be a key barrier to family involvement. To develop more insight into this barrier, this scoping review focuses on the following question: What are the reported ethical challenges related to confidentiality when involving family in the treatment of patients with severe mental illness? MethodsA systematic search into primary studies was conducted using the following databases: Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Web of Science core collection (Clarivate). The PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) scheme and qualitative content analysis were used to make the ethical challenges more explicit. ResultsTwelve studies-both qualitative and quantitative-were included. We identified the following main categories of ethical challenges: (1) the best interest of family members vs. confidentiality, (2) the patient's best interest vs. the right to confidentiality, (3) patient trust and alliance as a reason not to involve the relatives or not to share information, and (4) using confidentiality as a smokescreen. We also identified several subcategories and illustrative and concrete examples of ethical challenges. ConclusionsThrough a systematic examination, we discovered various types of ethical challenges related to confidentiality when involving the family in the treatment of patients with severe mental illness. However, research on these ethical challenges and the constituents of these challenges remains limited and often implicit. An ethical analysis will create knowledge which may facilitate a more balanced and nuanced approach to respecting the principle of confidentiality while also considering other moral principles. The duty of confidentiality does not always have to be a major barrier to family involvement; this insight and using this ethical analysis in the training of healthcare professionals may benefit the patient, the family, and the services.

AB  - Aims: Considerable number of studies in the existing literature indicate the existence of stigma related to many diseases, disabilities, and disorders, but less attention has been given to diabetes-related stigma. This narrative review of literature aims to explore the existence of stigma surrounding type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods: Literature were searched using search engines, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus electronic databases published from year 2000 to 2020. Both qualitative and quantitative studies focusing on the stigma associated with T1DM were included. A total of 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis of collected research material was done. Results: Results provided substantial evidence that stigma associated with T1DM was experienced by T1DM patients and their caregivers at some point in their lives and it had affected their lives in different domains such as difficulty finding a spouse, discrimination at employment opportunities, educational institutions, management of disease, being misjudged as a druggie, poor quality of life of the patient and caregiver, depressive symptoms among parents of patients, constant worrying of their child's disease management, and so on. Conclusion: Stigma related to T1DM is experienced by individuals suffering from it, and it is widespread. It not only affects the sufferers but their loved ones also. To reduce and cope-up with stigma, there is a need to increase public education and awareness at a mass level. Further research and awareness will serve to build our understanding of the experience of diabetes-related stigma.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Substance use disorders co-occurring with other mental health disorders are common and harmful. Clinical guidelines often recommend substance use screening and brief intervention though evidence about screening practice in mental health services is limited. This systematic review of routine clinical practice in adult mental health services aims to identify (a) proportions of screening and brief intervention, (b) how they are practised and (c) their outcomes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase and relevant Cochrane databases for articles until 31 July 2021 reporting on adults in English, regardless of geographical location. Backward snowball methods were used to locate additional articles. Screening, brief intervention and mental health services were defined. Data were extracted and variables compared related to setting, period, patient cohort, substances routine substance use disorder care pathways, and study quality was assessed. Results: We identified 17 articles reporting routine screening within adult mental health services. Studies in community settings mainly reported on screening for alcohol and other substance use disorders, while studies from inpatient settings reported mainly on tobacco. There was marked variation in methods and screening proportions. Only two studies reported on brief intervention. Conclusion: This systematic review shows marked variation in mental health services routine screening practices with early focus on alcohol but more recently tobacco screening. We suggest approaches to enhancing implementation of screening and brief intervention in routine care, particularly using electronic health records.

AB  - Circadian disruption has become more prevalent in society due to the increase in shift work, sleep disruption, blue light exposure, and travel via different time zones. The circadian rhythm is a timed transcription-translation feedback loop with positive regulators, BMAL1 and CLOCK, that interact with negative regulators, CRY and PER, to regulate both the central and peripheral clocks. This review highlights the functions of the circadian rhythm, specifically in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), during both healthy and pathological states. The BBB is a highly selective dynamic interface composed of CNS endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and microglia that form the neurovascular unit (NVU). Circadian rhythms modulate BBB integrity through regulating oscillations of tight junction proteins, assisting in functions of the NVU, and modulating transporter functions. Circadian disruptions within the BBB have been observed in stress responses and several neurological disorders, including brain metastasis, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Further understanding of these interactions may facilitate the development of improved treatment options and preventative measures.

AB  - Background: Ineffective cannabis regulatory frameworks such as prohibition have sparked interest in alternative solutions to reduce individual and societal harms. While it has been suggested that the recreational legalization process has yielded early successes, the relatively recent implementation of the novel policies has provided a modest time frame for a truly thorough establishment and assessment of key population-level indicators. The following systematic review focuses on identifying the downstream public health sequelae of cannabis legalization policies, including parameters such as cannabis consumption rates, hospitalization rates, vehicular accidents and fatalities, criminal activity, and suicidal behaviors, as well as other substance use trends.Methods: An exhaustive search of the MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases were performed to identify high-quality (1) longitudinal studies, which (2) compared key public health outcomes between regions which had and had not implemented recreational cannabis legalization (RML) policies, (3) using distinct databases and/or time frames. Thirty-two original research articles were retained for review.Results: Adult past-month cannabis consumption (26+ years) seems to have significantly increased following RML, whereas young adult (18-26 years) and adolescent (12-17 years) populations do not show a significant rise in past-month cannabis use. RML shows preliminary trends in increasing service use (such as hospitalizations, emergency department visits, or poisonings) or vehicular traffic fatalities. Preliminary evidence suggests that RML is related to potential increases in serious/violent crimes, and heterogeneous effects on suicidal behaviors. While the research does not illustrate that RML is linked to changing consumptions patterns of cigarette, stimulant, or opioid use, alcohol use may be on the rise, and opioid prescribing patterns are shown to be significantly correlated with RML.Conclusion: The current data supports the notion that RML is correlated with altered cannabis consumption in adults, potentially increased criminal activity, and a decline in opioid quantities and prescriptions provided to patients. Future work should address additional knowledge gaps for vulnerable populations, such as individuals with mental health problems or persons consuming cannabis frequently/at higher THC doses. The effects of varying legalization models should also be evaluated for their potentially differing impacts on population-level outcomes.

AB  - AimPsychosis and related disorders are a major public health issue. Early identification and prevention for those at high risk (at-risk-mental-state, ARMS) is important. General practitioners (GPs) are often the first point of contact for health services. In this review we aim to identify (1) the most common methods for identifying individuals with an ARMS in primary care, (2) the methods for improving identification of individuals with an ARMS in primary care, and (3) the most common barriers that prevent GPs from screening for individuals with an ARMS. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO 42021245095) of quantitative and qualitative studies with no date restriction. Searches were performed in September 2021. Studies' quality was appraised using Mixed Methods Appraisal tool (MMAT). ResultsWe identified 16 eligible studies, and all but one provided quantitative data. Nearly two-thirds of studies were classified as 'medium' quality. Employing narrative synthesis, we identified three themes relating to (1) improving GP knowledge and confidence in identifying individuals with an ARMS, (2) balancing the over- and under-identification of individuals with an ARMS in primary care, and (3) supporting GPs as significant stakeholders in early diagnosis and treatment of individuals with an ARMS. ConclusionsImproved identification of individuals with an ARMS is needed. We identified various strategies, including development and implementation of identification methods (e.g., screening measures), educational interventions for GPs (e.g., workshops), and systemic interventions (e.g., simplifying referrals to secondary care, developing integrated services). When implemented successfully, these interventions may help facilitate the access to appropriate care for individuals with an ARMS.

AB  - Background: Major holidays such as Christmas and New Year's Eve are regular occasions for get-togethers in families and other social groups. Socially, these days are often loaded with memories and expectations but also involve the potential for interpersonal tension and conflicts and disappointments. In addition, loneliness might also be most intense during these days. All these factors might lead to the expectation of increased mental distress and subsequently increased help-seeking in psychiatric contexts resulting in emergency psychiatric contacts, psychiatric hospitalizations, and even suicidal behavior. But is there evidence for increased psychiatric emergencies and hospitalizations around the days of Christmas?Methods: The existing evidence is systematically reviewed here (studies in PubMed in English investigating annual and Christmas-related variations in suicide (attempts), psychiatric emergencies and hospitalizations, last search date (13.07.2022) and complemented by an analysis of acute admissions at the University Psychiatry Clinics Basel, Switzerland, around Christmas and Easter holidays compared to the other days of the year. Easter was chosen as a comparison holiday.Results: In 25 reviewed studies, Christmas holidays were not associated with increased utilization of emergency psychiatric services. In contrast, hospitalizations were lower on Christmas and other holidays than the rest of the year. Analyzing the annual variation of 26,088 hospitalizations in our center between 2012 and 2021 revealed the same pattern.Conclusion: The assumption of increased utilization of psychiatric emergency services on Christmas and other major holidays is not confirmed by multiple studies around the globe in various socio-cultural and medical settings. The study is registered in the international prospective register for systematic reviews

AB  - As the shallow mineral resources are nearly depleted, the mining of deep resources has become an urgent problem to be studied. The increase in mine depth can lead to the increase of mine heat hazard, which is a critical concern for mining safety/occupational health and safety. However, there are limited review articles available regarding the prevention of mine heat hazard. To fill in this gap, a bibliometric analysis and knowledge mapping of the field of mine heat hazard prevention are presented in this paper. A total of 314 papers from the Web of Science (WOS) core collection database that published between January 1998 and July 2022 were analyzed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace. China, South Africa, Poland, USA, and Australia are the top five countries in this field. The important journals are Applied Thermal Engineering, Applied Energy, Energies, and International Journal of Mining Science and Technology. In addition, the research focal points and two research fronts were identified and discussed. The knowledge base of mine heat hazard research focuses on mine cooling technology, energy efficiency optimization of cooling systems, thermodynamic theory, and occupational health. There are two research fronts. One is to use the numerical simulation method to study various problems such as simulate the performance of refrigeration systems and thermal comfort in mines. The second is to study the occupational health impact of climate change on miners. Therefore, this paper provides readers and academics with an overview of the intellectual structure and knowledge body that have been developed on the subject of mine heat hazard.

AB  - Background: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, complex, and refractory type of neuropathic pain. Several systematic reviews support the efficacy of acupuncture and related treatments for PHN. Nevertheless, the efficacy of various acupuncture-related treatments for PHN remains debatable.Objective: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture-related treatments for PHN, identify the most effective acupuncture-related treatments, and expound on the current inadequacies and prospects in the applications of acupuncture-related therapies.Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, four Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical, Chongqing VIP, and Wan Fang databases), clinical research registration platform (World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registration platform, China Clinical Trial Registration Center) for relevant studies. We also examined previous meta-analyses; gray literature; and reference lists of the selected studies. We then evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies and performed a Bayesian multiple network meta-analysis.Results: We included 29 randomized controlled trials comprising 1,973 patients, of which five studies showed a high risk of bias. The pairwise meta-analysis results revealed that the efficacy of all acupuncture-related treatments for pain relief related to PHN was significantly better than antiepileptics. The network meta-analysis results showed that pricking and cupping plus antiepileptics were the most effective treatment, followed by electroacupuncture (EA) plus antiepileptics for pain relief in patients with PHN. EA plus antiepileptics ranked the best regarding reduced Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores in patients with PHN. No results were found regarding the total response rate or quality of life in this study. Acupuncture-related treatments showed a lower incidence of adverse events than that of antiepileptics.Conclusion: Acupuncture-related therapies are potential treatment options for PHN and are safe. Pricking and cupping plus antiepileptics, are the most effective acupuncture-related techniques for pain relief, while EA plus antiepileptics is the best acupuncture-related technique for improving PHN-related insomnia and depression symptoms. However, owing to the limitations of this study, these conclusions should be cautiously interpreted, and future high-quality studies are needed.Systematic review registration:, identifier CRD42021226422.

AB  - Professional development requires reflection. However, a conceptual model that considers the different perspectives on reflection remains missing. Regarding reflection, three different research streams can be distinguished: (I) an individual action-process-perspective, (II) a critical perspective, and (III) a social-relatedness perspective. From these three streams, important components are derived in the present study and integrated into one conceptual model. This model contains the individual and contextual components which influence reflection and considers reflection to be a process containing mutually influencing emotion, motivation, and cognition which can lead to various outcomes such as performance and, consequently, innovation. For illustrating the meaning of the model's components in a specific professional context, we used data from an interview study with eight teachers of vocational schools. The conceptual model can serve as a basis for further research on reflection in all kinds of work contexts and be used to foster professional development, for instance by developing interventions to foster reflection.

AB  - Waste generated by healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a new source of pollution, particularly with the widespread use of single-use personal protective equipment (PPE). Releasing microplastics (MPs) and microfibers (MFs) from discarded PPE becomes an emerging threat to environmental sustainability. MPs/MFs have recently been reported in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, including water, deep-sea sediments, air, and soil. As COVID-19 spreads, the use of plastic-made PPE in healthcare facilities has increased significantly worldwide, resulting in massive amounts of plastic waste entering the terrestrial and marine environments. High loads of MPs/MFs emitted into the environment due to excessive PPE consumption are easily consumed by aquatic organisms, disrupting the food chain, and potentially causing chronic health problems in humans. Thus, proper management of PPE waste is critical for ensuring a post-COVID sustainable environment, which has recently attracted the attention of the scientific community. The current study aims to review the global consumption and sustainable management of discarded PPE in the context of COVID-19. The severe impacts of PPE-emitted MPs/MFs on human health and other environmental segments are briefly addressed. Despite extensive research progress in the area, many questions about MP/MF contamination in the context of COVID-19 remain unanswered. Therefore, in response to the post-COVID environmental remediation concerns, future research directions and recommendations are highlighted considering the current MP/ MF research progress from COVID-related PPE waste.

AB  - Nowadays, microplastic has been detected in many environmental samples, including aquatic and terrestrial environ-ments. However, few studies recently have addressed their attention to microplastic contamination in different drink-ing sources and food packages. This review paper has narrated those few findings in brief. Literature showed that different pieces of microplastic fragments, e.g., polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), etc. are detected in plastic drinking bottle, tap water, and food packaging containers. Microplastic fragmenta-tion may be associated with mechanical stress, UV radiation, low plastic material quality, aging factor, and atmo-spheric deposition. Besides these, microplastic is a hub of different chemical compounds and can also retain other complex materials from the surroundings. This makes the microplastic contamination even more complicated and dif-ficult to detect them accurately in a single method. Additionally, one of the common practices at the community level is the long-time repeated usage of plastic drinking bottles and food boxes that subsequently cause microplastic leaching and potential health threats to consumers. This narrative study summarizes the current scenario of microplastic contamination from drinking bottles and food containers and emphasizes doing more quality research in this subtle but highly imposed field to understand potential exposure better.

AB  - Nanotechnology is a burgeoning revolutionary technology in the 21st century. Climate emergencies caused by natural or anthropogenic activities have tragically consequential repercussions on agricultural output worldwide. Modern cropping systems profoundly rely on synthetic fertilizers to deliver necessary nutrients, yet their prolonged and persis-tent administration is hazardous to the environment, soil fertility, and nutritional dynamics of the rhizospheric microbiome. By addressing the drawback of physico-chemically synthesized nano-dimensioned fertilizer, this review emphasizes on integrating nanoparticles and biofertilizers conjointly as nano-biofertilizers (NBF) which can safeguard global food security, in light of the population surge. Inoculation with nanoparticles and biofertilizers strengthens plant growth and stress tolerance. However, combined together (NBF), they have emerged as a more economically and environmentally sustainable, highly versatile, and long-lasting agriculture tool. Microbe-based green synthesis using the encapsulation of inorganic nanoparticles of Si, Zn, Cu, Fe, Ni, Ti, and Ag as well as organic materials, includ-ing chitosan, cellulose, and starch, to formulate NBFs can eliminate the constraints of conventional fertilizer contam-ination. The application of NBFs is in its infancy in agriculture, yet it has promising potential for transforming traditional farming techniques into smart agriculture, compared to any of the existing strategies. From this perspective, this review is an attempt to provide a comprehensive understanding of the formulations, fabrication, and characteri-zation of NBFs while unraveling the underlying mechanisms of plant-NBF interactions along with their contribution to climate change-induced biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. We substantially summarize the latest advancements of field applications of NBFs for precision farming. Moreover, we critically revised their applications in agro-ecosystems according to the current literature, while also discussing the bottlenecks and future trends for developing potent NBFs.

AB  - Objective: Test anxiety is one of the common psychological and behavioral problems of college students, which can result in poor academic performance and even academic failure. Aromatherapy has been proposed as a promising method to reduce test anxiety in college students, but its precise efficacy has not been fully confirmed. This meta-analysis evaluated the effects of aromatherapy on the symptoms of test anxiety in college students to serve as a reference for future research and provide more scientific and exact evidence.Methods: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, Science Direct, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Journal Full-Text Database (VIP), and Wanfang Data were electronically searched from inception to June 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on aromatherapy for treating students' test anxiety. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for RCTs was used by two reviewers to critically and independently assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Review Manager 5.4 was used for the meta-analysis. Stata 17.0 was used for sensitivity analysis and Egger's test.Results: Seven RCTs included 425 patients, with a moderate risk of bias in the included studies. The meta-analysis found that aromatherapy effectively reduced test anxiety in college students (SMD = -0.67, p < 0.01), with high heterogeneity of results (I-2 = 72%). The different types of essential oil devices used in the study are the source of inter-study heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis suggested that most effective methods were aromatherapy with compound essential oils (SMD = -0.91, p < 0.01), and using cloths or pads as the essential oil devices (SMD = -1.03, p < 0.01). There was no difference between aromatherapy and placebo control groups (SMD = -0.65, p = 0.25).Conclusion: Aromatherapy with inhalation can help relieve test anxiety in college students, but more and higher-quality studies are needed. This study provides a reference for future research designs in terms of the selection of essential oil types and devices and the design of research groups.

AB  - Purpose-Most adults do not follow the minimum requirements for physical activity despite the benefits such activity can provide toward improving quality of life. On average, an adult spends 60% of daily hours in the workplace, making it essential to create working environments that are favorable to avoiding harmful effects on the health of workers. Toward this end, the application of physical activity programs in a work context is one of the possible interventions. This study aims to carry out a systematic review of the literature to identify the impact of physical activity programs applied in the workplace, on employee wellness and organizational productivity.Design/methodology/approach - The search for reports was carried out in two databases, namely, Thomson Reuters Web of Science and Scopus, according to several inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) was applied to ensure the quality of the study. Microsoft Excel 2016 was used to organize the database to support the data analysis.Findings - The sample comprised 64 reports published in international journals between 1986 and 2019. From these studies, six thematic clusters were formed: Workplace Physical Activity Interventions, Workplace Wellness, Physical Activity and Organizational Performance, Barriers to Developing Physical Activity Programs in the Workplace, Physical Activity and Sedentary Occupations and Workplace Physical Activity Incentives. The analysis of these clusters confirmed that the implementation of physical activity programs in this context could represent beneficial effects for workers and the organizational system by contributing to a reduction in the rates of absenteeism and presenteeism. However, there are still many organizations that do not implement such programs.Originality/value - The results of this study are essential for managers of organizations to be able to implement physical activity programs in a work context, similarly to the application of a strategy of corporate social responsibility in an intra-organizational environment. This research may also be useful for professionals in the areas of sports and physical exercise, who want to build their business around physical exercise programs applied to a work context.

AB  - Background: Electroacupuncture (EA) is a promising therapy for depression. However, a comprehensive review of EA for depression is needed. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EA for depression. Potentially relevant trials and reviews were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL from inception to March 2022. EA alone and combined with other therapy were eligible for inclusion. The severity of depression during and after treatment and the number of adverse events were assessed as outcomes. Risk of bias (ROB) evaluation, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, reporting bias assessment, and GRADE system evaluation were also conducted. Results: Thirty-four trials were included. The overall ROB was medium. Low-quality evidence showed that the efficacy of EA was not less than that of antidepressants [EA + selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)] and manual acupuncture (MA). EA and EA + SSRIs had better efficacy than SSRIs alone in decreasing the severity of depression during the early treatment. Moderate-quality evidence also showed that EA and EA + SSRIs were safer than SSRIs alone. Sensitivity analysis was mostly not feasible. Major publication bias was unlikely. Conclusion: These results indicate that the efficacy of EA is not less than that of antidepressants and MA. Moreover, EA and EA + SSRI treatments show a more rapid onset and greater safety than SSRIs. More high-quality trials are needed for further confirmation.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) are common neuropsychiatric disorders that lead to neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis. It is possible to further explore the connection between inflammation in the brain and SCZ, BD, and MDD. Therefore, we systematically reviewed PubMed and Web of Science on brain inflammatory markers measured in SCZ, BD, and MDD postmortem brains. Out of 2166 studies yielded by the search, 46 studies met the inclusion criteria in SCZ, BD, and MDD postmortem brains. The results were variable across inflammatory markers. For example, 26 studies were included to measure the differential expression between SCZ and control subjects. Similarly, seven of the included studies measured the differential expression of inflammatory markers in patients with BD. The heterogeneity from the included studies is not clear at present, which may be caused by several factors, including the measured brain region, disease stage, brain source, medication, and other factors.

AB  - Delay discounting refers to the depreciation of the value of a reward as a function of the time it takes to obtain it. Growing evidence shows altered delay discounting in several pathological conditions, including neurological disorders. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature on delay dis-counting (DD) in Parkinson's Disease (PD). We found steeper DD in patients with PD, compared to healthy controls, both in "on" and "off" dopaminergic medication. These results confirm altered DD in PD and suggest an independent influence of the dopaminergic medication and the clinical condition itself on it. Also the effect of impulse control disorder and of pharmacological treatments are analysed.

Finally, forty journal articles aligned with the inclusion criteria.Results: The results found that gamification has been widely utilized in more than ten non-English-speaking countries and various English language skills, which indicated that gamification has gained popularity in facilitating EFL/ESL learning. The benefits of using gamification included improving students' English language skills and abilities, positively affecting students' attitudes and emotional responses, providing an authentic language learning environment and cultivating students' comprehensive competence. The drawbacks of using gamification mainly included the technical problems, short-lived positive effect, and the negative influence caused by the gamified competition, and so forth. The most frequently used gamification elements were feedback, points, quiz, digital badges, leaderboard, and reward, followed by progress bar, story-telling, challenge, videos, time limit, and competition.Discussion: The results provide a better understanding of the state of using gamification in EFL/ESL instruction in recent years. It will be useful for researchers seeking to understand and evaluate gamification as well as to practitioners interested in using gamification.

KW  - mental disorders

KW  - aiding diagnosis
KW  - meta-analysis
AB  - Background: The house-tree-person (HTP) drawing test has received growing attention from researchers as a common projective test. However, the methods used to select and interpret drawing indicators still lack uniformity. Objective: This study aims to integrate drawing indicators into the process of screening for or classifying mental disorders by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of the application of the HTP test. Methods: A search of the following electronic databases was performed in May 2022: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, EBSCO, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang. Screening and checking of the literature were performed independently by two researchers. The empirical studies published on the use of the HTP test in mental disorders and studies providing specific data on the occurrence frequency of drawing characteristics were analyzed. A total of 30 studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 665 independent effect sizes and 6,295 participants. The strength of the association between drawing characteristics of the HTP test and the prevalence of mental disorders was measured by the ratio (OR) with a 95% CI. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot, Rosenthal's fail-safe number (Nfs), and the trim and fill method. Results: The results revealed 50 drawing characteristics that appeared at least three times in previous studies, of which 39 were able to significantly predict mental disorders. The HTP test can be divided into the following four dimensions: house, tree, person, and the whole. These dimensions reflect the structure, size, and other characteristics of the picture. The results showed that the greatest predictor of mental disorders was the whole (OR = 4.20, p < 0.001), followed by the house (OR = 3.95, p < 0.001), the tree (OR = 2.70, p < 0.001), and the person (OR = 2.16, p < 0.001). The valid predictors can be categorized into the following four types: item absence, bizarre or twisted, excessive details, and small or simplified. The subgroup analysis showed that the affective-specific indicators included no motion, leaning house, and decorated roof; thought-specific indicators included excessive separation among items, no window, loss of facial features, and inappropriate body proportions; and common indicators of mental disorders included no additional decoration, simplified drawing, very small house, two-dimensional house, and very small tree. Conclusion: These findings can promote the standardization of the HTP test and provide a theoretical reference for the screening and clinical diagnosis of mental disorders.

AB  - Introduction: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have different cognitive and intelligence profiles than typical developing individuals. Some of these children need cognitive rehabilitation. This study's main purpose is to provide a systematic review about applying computerized cognitive games for autistic children and to determine the effectiveness of such interventions.Material and methods: A thorough search of the ISI Web of Science, Medline (through PubMed), Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and APA PsycInfo databases was performed for articles published from inception to May 17, 2022.Results: Of 1746 papers, 28 studies were found to be eligible in this systematic review. Fifteen studies (53.57%) compared a Control Group (CG) with Experimental Groups (EGs), while 13 papers (46.42%) evaluated only the impact of the applied intervention in an experimental group. Major domains of cognitive functions are divided into five main categories: 1. Executive functions, 2. Social cognition/emotions, 3. Attention/concentration, 4. Learning and memory, and 5. Language. In 42.85% (12 studies) of the screened papers, social cognition and emotions were assessed after cognitive rehabilitation. The highest rate of effects reported by studies were related to social cognition enhancement. Of the total number of included studies, 17 studies reported a positive effect at all scales, of which nine were quasi experimental, and seven were fully experimental.Conclusion: Using suitable computerized game-based solutions could enhance cognition indexes in autistic children. Hence, further investigation is needed to determine the real effectiveness of these novel technologies.

AB  - In recent years, plastic waste has become a universally significant environmental problem. Ingestion of food and water contaminated with microplastics is the main route of human exposure. Fishery products are an important source of microplastics in the human diet. Once ingested, microplastics reach the gastrointestinal tract and can be absorbed causing oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and translocation to other tissues. Furthermore, microplastics can release chemical substances (organic and inorganic) present in their matrix or previously absorbed from the environment and act as carriers of microorganisms. Additives present in microplastics such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP), and potentially toxic elements can be harmful for humans. However, to date, the data we have are not sufficient to perform a reliable assessment of the risks to human health. Further studies on the toxicokinetics and toxicity of microplastics in humans are needed.

AB  - Background: Discussions regarding syndemics have dominated research in recent years. Vaccine hesitancy has also been propelled to the forefront. In this narrative review, we aim to frame a novel syndemic framework to understand the interaction between vaccine hesitancy, COVID-19, and negative health outcomes. Methods: A non-systematic electronic search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar. Search criteria were limited to articles published between November 2019 and June 2022. Articles related to the COVID-19 syndemic and vaccine hesitancy were included. Results: Our review revealed that the adherence to COVID-19 regulations-although they were effective in preventing COVID-19 transmission, cases, and deaths-created a dynamically unstable 'vicious cycle' between undesirable health, economic, and social outcomes. The "accumulation" of complex stressors decreased individuals' cognitive flexibility and hindered them from making decisions and getting vaccinated. Furthermore, it increased individuals' risk of acquiring COVID-19, losing their employment, increasing poverty, and decreasing healthcare utilization. We illustrated how the amalgamation of sociodemographic and contextual factors associated with COVID-19 might impact people's vaccine decisions, making them more hesitant toward COVID-19 vaccination. Failing to receive vaccinations increases the chances of COVID-19 transmission, hospitalization, and other negative health outcomes. Conclusions: Understanding the interaction between these factors is essential to provide policymakers with inspiration to set appropriate interventions for promoting COVID-19 vaccination acceptance to decrease the overall burden of pandemics.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to health care for people living with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has been significantly disrupt-ed. Calls have been made to adapt health systems and innovate service delivery models to improve access to care. We identified and summarized the health sys-tems adaptions and interventions implemented to improve NCD care and their potential impact on low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods We comprehensively searched Medline/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, PsycINFO, Global Literature on coronavirus disease, and Web of Science for relevant literature published between January 2020 and Decem-ber 2021. While we targeted articles written in English, we also included papers published in French with abstracts written in English.Results After screening 1313 records, we included 14 papers from six countries. We identified four unique health systems adaptations/interventions for restoring, maintaining, and ensuring continuity of care for people living with NCDs: tele-medicine or teleconsultation strategies, NCD medicine drop-off points, decen-tralization of hypertension follow-up services and provision of free medication to peripheral health centers, and diabetic retinopathy screening with a handheld smartphone-based retinal camera. We found that the adaptations/interventions enhanced continuity of NCD care during the pandemic and helped bring health care closer to patients using technology and easing access to medicines and rou-tine visits. Telephonic aftercare services appear to have saved a significant amount of patients' time and funds. Hypertensive patients recorded better blood pressure controls over the follow-up period.Conclusions Although the identified measures and interventions for adapting health systems resulted in potential improvements in access to NCD care and better clinical outcomes, further exploration is needed to establish the feasibility of these adaptations/interventions in different settings given the importance of context in their successful implementation. Insights from such implementation studies are critical for ongoing health systems strengthening efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and future global health security threats for people liv-ing with NCDs.

AB  - This paper analyzes the current evi-dence on discrimination perceived by elderly adults (> 50 years) in the use of health services and identifies factors associated with this discri-minatory experience. It involved an integrative literature review, carried out on the Biblioteca Virtual de Saude, CINAHL, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science search websites, in June/2021. The key words used were social discrimination or ageism; middle-aged, or aged 80 and over or elderly; health services or health services for the elderly, including synonyms, in Portuguese, En-glish, and Spanish. The search strategy identified 1,165 articles; 19 met the eligibility and inclusion criteria and were included in this integrative re-view. They comprise quantitative and qualitative studies published between 2002 and 2021; about 60% carried out in the United States and Austra-lia. The prevalence of discrimination in the use of health services ranged from 2% to 42%. The report of discriminatory practices was associated with ethnic-racial characteristics, sex, age, sexual orientation, physical appearance, and social class. By giving visibility to the theme, this work aims to stimulate the definition of concrete ways to tack-le discrimination, in an attempt to interrupt the perpetration of inequities in the health care area.

AB  - Evidence of the health impacts from environmental noise has largely been drawn from studies in high-income countries, which has then been used to inform development of noise guidelines. It is unclear whether findings in high-income countries can be readily translated into policy contexts in low-middle-income-countries (LMICs).
   We conducted this systematic review to summarise noise epidemiological studies in LMICs. We conducted a literature search of studies in Medline and Web of Science published during 2009-2021, supplemented with specialist journal hand searches. Screening, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias as well as overall quality and strength of evidence were conducted following established guidelines (e.g. Navigation Guide).
   58 studies were identified, 53% of which were from India, China and Bulgaria. Most (92%) were cross-sectional studies. 53% of studies assessed noise exposure based on fixed-site measurements using sound level meters and 17% from propagation-based noise models. Mean noise exposure among all studies ranged from 48 to 120 dB (L-eq), with over half of the studies (52%) reporting the mean between 60 and 80 dB.
   The most studied health outcome was noise annoyance (43% of studies), followed by cardiovascular (17%) and mental health outcomes (17%). Studies generally reported a positive (i.e. adverse) relationship between noise exposure and annoyance. Some limited evidence based on only two studies showing that long-term noise exposure may be associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Findings on mental health outcomes were inconsistent across the studies. Overall, 4 studies (6%) had "probably low", 18 (31%) had "probably high" and 36 (62%) had "high" risk of bias. Quality of evidence was rated as "low' for mental health outcomes and "very low' for all other outcomes. Strength of evidence for each outcome was assessed as "inadequate', highlighting high-quality epidemiological studies are urgently needed in LMICs to strengthen the evidence base.

A meta-analysis and systematic review car-ried out as per the Cochrane Handbook recom-mendations and following the steps recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes. The inclusion stu-dies were done with the following PECO criteria: P-pregnant women, E-environmental factors, O-weight gain. The search procedure was conduc-ted on the databases EMBASE, Web of Science, Cinahl, LILACS and MEDLINE (PubMed). The relationship between the socioeconomic factors of the micro-region of residence and gestational weight gain was evidenced by the linkage betwe-en residing in high-poverty neighborhoods and inadequate gestational weight gain. This study revealed the higher prevalence of excessive gesta-tional weight gain in pregnant women those li-ves in urban areas. Environmental factors of the pregnant women's residence area implicated in the excessive gestational weight gain. Our findin-gs can therefore contribute to the development of public policies to prevent inadequate gestational weight gain.

AB  - Conspiracy theories are abundant in social and political discourse, with serious consequences for individuals, groups, and societies. However, psychological scientists have started paying close attention to them only in the past 20 years. We review the spectacular progress that has since been made and some of the limitations of research so far, and we consider the prospects for further progress. To this end, we take a step back to analyze the defining features that make conspiracy theories different in kind from other beliefs and different in degree from each other. We consider how these features determine the adoption, consequences, and transmission of belief in conspiracy theories, even though their role as causal or moderating variables has seldom been examined. We therefore advocate for a research agenda in the study of conspiracy theories that starts-as is routine in fields such as virology and toxicology-with a robust descriptive analysis of the ontology of the entity at its center.

AB  - The workplace elicits a wide range of emotions and, likewise, emotions change our experience of the workplace. This article reviews the scientific field of emotion in organizations, drawing from classic theories and cutting-edge advances to integrate a disparate body of research. The review is organized around the definition of emotion as an unfolding sequence of processes: We interpret the world around us for its subjective meaning, which results in emotional experience. Emotional experience, in turn, has consequences for behaviors, attitudes, and cognition. Emotional experience also elicits expressive cues that can be recognized by others. Each process in the emotion sequence can be regulated. Processes can also iterate until emotion is shared throughout workgroups and even entire organizations. A distinct body of organizationally relevant research exists for each process, and emotional intelligence refers to effectiveness across all. Differences across culture and gender, future research directions, and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - The implementation of public policies in crisis situations is a scarce field of study, especially at the street level, in which there is interaction between the State and the citizen. The pandemic as a crisis affected the autonomy of frontline professionals and shaped their behavior, especially influenced by organizational and relational factors. This way, the study explores the research agenda in the context of the pandemic, available in the Web of Science database, seeking to understand its influence on street-level implementation of public policies, using the integrative review method for this purpose. Additionally, an attempt was made to understand how the use of software contributes to data analysis, pointing out its advantages and limitations. For this, VOSviewer 1.6.17 was used. The main results revealed that crisis contexts such as the pandemic profoundly influence the implementation of public policies at the street level with negative impacts on user service. The research focus defined has limitations due to the lack of advances in the number of data analyzed, but contributes to a better understanding of the influences of crises for implementation of public policies at the street level. Investigations on the emotional consequences to the front line and the approach to action during the crisis by professionals who deal daily with emergency situations such as firefighters and professionals of mobile vehicles of the medical emergency network are indicated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread changes in the way people work. Some of these changes represent the same kinds of work modifications or adjustments that have often been requested as workplace accommodations, and which may improve labour market and employment outcomes for people with disabilities.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this scoping review was to examine the literature on workplace accommodations in the pandemic and their impacts and implications for people with disabilities.
   METHODS: Following a search of six international databases, articles were selected by two reviewers, and data were abstracted in accordance with scoping review methodology. A thematic analysis was used to report the relevant findings.
   RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria, and three main themes were identified: positive impacts of pandemic-relatedworkplace accommodations on people with disabilities (e.g., improved accessibility, reduced stigma around workplace accommodations, rapid implementation of workplace accommodations, opportunities for advocacy); negative impacts (e.g., worsened physical and mental health, new accommodation needs); and action needed and recommendations (e.g., revisit legislation and policy on accommodations, ensure representation of people with disabilities). Overall, our review identified a mixed assessment of the impacts of pandemic-related accommodations on people with disabilities. However, there was a broader consensus regarding the importance of learning from the experiences of the pandemic to improve workplace accommodation policies in the future.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic may present opportunities for improving workplace accommodation policies, but our review also highlights the need for more research examining how workplace changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted people with disabilities.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a scoping review to determine how past studies have applied the theory of intersectionality, a critical feminist research paradigm, to understand the physical health and mental health outcomes of perinatal people as a step toward addressing maternal health disparities and injustice. The study includes a review of existing research on maternal physical and mental health outcomes, presents the strengths and limitations of existing studies, and provides recommendations on best practices in applying intersectionality in research to address systemic issues and improve outcomes for the perinatal population. Methods: We conducted an extensive literature search across four search engines, yielding 28 publications using the intersectionality framework that focused on the outcomes of perinatal people, with a total sample of 9,856,042 participants. We examined how these studies applied intersectionality and evaluated them based on three areas: conceptualization, research method, and interpretation/findings. Results: Our findings indicate that maternal health researchers have provided good descriptions of the interaction of systemic inequalities and have used analysis that allows for the examination of interlocking and mutually reinforcing social positions or systems. We find that improvement is needed in the areas of conceptualization, reflexivity, and understanding of power structure. Recommendations are provided in the form of a checklist to guide future research toward an impactful approach to addressing perinatal health disparities. Relevance: Our scoping review has implications for improving applied health research to address perinatal health disparities, mortality, and morbidity. Recommendations are given along with references to other tools, and a guidance checklist is provided to support scholars in creating an impactful approach to applying intersectionality in the goal of addressing maternal health disparities.

AB  - The idea of linking stressors, services providing units (SPUs), and ecosystem services (ES) is ubiquitous in the literature, although is currently not applied in areas contaminated with heavy metals (HMs), This integrative literature review introduces the general form of a deterministic conceptual model of the cross-scale effect of HMs on biogeochemical services by SPUs with a feedback loop, a cross-scale heuristic concept of resilience, and develops a method for applying the conceptual model. The objectives are 1) to identify the clusters of existing research about HMs effects on ES, biodiversity, and resilience to HMs stress, 2) to map the scientific fields needed for the conceptual model's implementation, identify institutional constraints for inter-disciplinary cooperation, and propose solutions to surpass them, 3) to describe how the complexity of the cause-effect chain is reflected in the research hypotheses and objectives and extract methodological consequences, and 4) to describe how the conceptual model can be implemented. A nested analysis by CiteSpace of a set of 16,176 articles extracted from the Web of Science shows that at the highest level of data aggregation there is a clear separation between the topics of functional traits, stoichiometry, and regulating services from the typical issues of the literature about HMs, biodiversity, and ES. Most of the resilience to HMs stress agenda focuses on microbial communities. General topics such as the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship in contaminated areas are no longer dominant in the current research, as well as large-scale problems like watershed management. The number of Web of Science domains that include the analyzed articles is large (26 up to 87 domains with at least ten articles, depending on the sub-set), but thirteen domains account for 70-80% of the literature. The complexity of ap-proaches regarding the cause-effect chain, the stressors, the biological and ecological hierarchical level and the management objectives was characterized by a detailed analysis of 60 selected reviews and 121 primary articles. Most primary articles approach short causal chains, and the number of hypotheses or objectives by article tends to be low, pointing out the need for portfolios of complementary research projects in coherent inter-disciplinary programs and innovation ecosystems to couple the ES and resilience problems in areas contaminated with HMs. One provides triggers for developing innovation ecosystems, examples of complementary research hypotheses, and an example of technology transfer. Finally one proposes operationalizing the conceptual methodological model in contaminated socio-ecological systems by a calibration, a sensitivity analysis, and a validation phase.

AB  - NOMOPHOBIA, or NO MObile PHone Phobia, refers to a psychological condition in which people fear being disconnected from their mobile phones. The purpose of this review was to establish the prevalence of nomophobia symptoms in youth and young adults according to severity, country, culture, population, measurement tool, and year of data collection. An electronic search of fourteen databases, two digital preservation services, and three content aggregator services was conducted from the inception of each database until 15 September 2021. A total of 52 studies involving 47,399 participants from 20 countries were included in the analyses. The prevalence of nomophobia was defined as the proportion of individuals scoring at or above established cut-offs on validated measures. Based on a random-effects meta-analysis, approximately 20% of individuals showed mild symptoms of nomophobia, 50% showed moderate symptoms, and 20% showed severe symptoms. Our results showed that university students from non-Western cultures are the most likely to suffer severe symptoms. In the year 2021, the prevalence rate of nomophobia increased. The instrument that was best able to detect nomophobia was the nomophobia questionnaire. Most individuals who own mobile phones experience mild or moderate symptoms of nomophobia. Severe symptoms deserve attention from clinicians and research scientists. A valid method of identifying individuals with a severe addiction to their mobile phones will help with timely and effective therapeutic management.

AB  - The chronicity of depressive disorders is a major problem. Dopamine stimulating agents (DSA) are suggested to hold a promising potential in depression management, particularly in older adults, in whom dopamine deficiency due to aging may be an underlying cause. More evidence is needed to support these drugs in the management of depression. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Data was extracted from eighteen randomized-controlled-trials and eight open-label-studies. Additional meta-regression-analyses were performed to examine superiority of monotherapy versus augmentation, and to rule out a putative age effect. DSA were found to reduce depressive symptoms (SMD=-0.26, 95%CI(-0.43;-0.10]). Heterogeneity was high and a significant Egger's test indicated publication bias. Adjustment for missing studies, using trim-and-fill-methodology, reduced the effect size (SMD=-0.17, 95%CI(-0.39;0.05]), which lost statistical significance. Removing the outlier study from the analysis, the effect size remained marginally small, but was statistically-significant (SMD=-0.17, 95%CI(-0.31;-0.02]). Neither augmentation nor monotherapy was superior. No age effect was found. It can be concluded that off-label DSA are overall effective in reducing depressive symptoms. However, the evidence is weak, regarding the publication bias, and modest-to-weak treatment effects. Well-designed high-quality trials are highly needed, before dopamine stimulating agents can be adequately posi-tioned in future depression treatment protocols.

AB  - The aging population increases steadily because of a healthy lifestyle and medical advancements in healthcare. However, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming more common and problematic among older adults. AD-related cases show an increasing trend annually, and the younger age population may also be at risk of developing this disorder. AD constitutes a primary form of dementia, an irreversible and progressive brain disorder that steadily damages cognitive functions and the ability to perform daily tasks. Later in life, AD leads to death as a result of the degeneration of specific brain areas. Currently, the cause of AD is poorly understood, and there is no safe and effective therapeutic agent to cure or slow down its progression. The condition is entirely preventable, and no study has yet demonstrated encouraging findings in terms of treatment. Identifying this disease's pathophysiology can help researchers develop safe and efficient therapeutic strategies to treat this ailment. This review outlines and discusses the pathophysiology that resulted in the development of AD including amyloid-beta plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity, and changes in neurotrophins level may sound better based on the literature search from Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Potential therapeutic strategies are discussed to provide more insights into AD mechanisms by developing some possible pharmacological agents for its treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary In the current scenario of climate change, plants need to overcome a great amplitude of temperatures and increasingly common droughts in the very same space. Gesneriads are a worldwide family of plants in which many "resurrection" species have arisen: plants with the ability to withstand long periods of time with very little water content and successfully revive upon water availability. Due to their rocky and mountainous habitat, many of them have to face a great temperature variability and freezing temperatures, and indeed, their resurrection ability and freezing tolerance share similar metabolic responses. Tolerance of gesneriads to different environmental stresses is thought to be applicable in crop growth improvement, but their difficult indoor cultivation and outdoor accessibility are major obstacles for their study. Therefore, this review aims to identify common patterns in the already known resurrection species to propose new tentative resurrection gesneriads, as well as gather the metabolic responses to desiccation and freezing stress as a way of making them more reachable to the scientific community. Gesneriaceae is a pantropical family of plants that, thanks to their lithophytic and epiphytic growth forms, have developed different strategies for overcoming water scarcity. Desiccation tolerance or "resurrection" ability is one of them: a rare phenomenon among angiosperms that involves surviving with very little relative water content in their tissues until water is again available. Physiological responses of desiccation tolerance are also activated during freezing temperatures, a stress that many of the resurrection gesneriads suffer due to their mountainous habitat. Therefore, research on desiccation- and freezing-tolerant gesneriads is a great opportunity for crop improvement, and some of them have become reference resurrection angiosperms (Dorcoceras hygrometrica, Haberlea rhodopensis and Ramonda myconi). However, their difficult indoor cultivation and outdoor accessibility are major obstacles for their study. Therefore, this review aims to identify phylogenetic, geoclimatic, habitat, and morphological features in order to propose new tentative resurrection gesneriads as a way of making them more reachable to the scientific community. Additionally, shared and species-specific physiological responses to desiccation and freezing stress have been gathered as a stress response metabolic basis of the family.

AB  - Background: Currently, depression is diagnosed on the basis of neuropsychological examinations and clinical symptoms, and there is no objective diagnostic method. Several studies have explored the application of microRNAs as potential biomarkers diagnostic for depression. This study aims to determine the diagnostic value of microRNAs for depression. Methods: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Web of Science, Wanfang Database, SINOMED, China Science and Technology Journal Databaseand China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched up to 11 January 2022. Stata (version 16.0) and RevMan (version 5.3) software were used for meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated; the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Moreover, meta-regression analyses were performed to determine the source of heterogeneity. Deeks' funnel plot test was used to assess publication bias.Results: In total, 677 patients were enrolled, including 364 patients with depression and 313 healthy controls. Meta-analysis results showed that the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR of microRNAs for the diagnosis of depression were 0.82 [95% confidence intervals(CI): 0.76, 0.87], 0.70 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.77), and 11 (95% CI: 6, 20), respectively, and the AUC of the SROC was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.87).Conclusions: MicroRNAs have high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing depression and are potential diagnostic biomarkers for depression.

AB  - Background: the purpose of this study was to systematically review the effects of intervention experiments led by ordinary teachers to improve students' mental health literacy and to provide evidence-based research and new ideas for improving students' mental health literacy. Methods: A systematic search using 5 English (Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO, Springer Link) and 3 Chinese (CNKI, WanFang, and VIP) databases was initiated to identify controlled trials assessing the immediate effect and delay effect of the intervention experiment led by ordinary teachers on improving students' mental health knowledge, anti-stigma, willingness, or behavior to seek-help. Results: a total of 14 experiments with 7873 subjects were included. The results showed that the immediate effect of the intervention on promoting students' mental health knowledge [g = 0.622, 95% CI (0.395, 0.849)] and anti-stigma [g = 0.262, 95% CI (0.170, 0.354)] was significant, but the amount of delay effect is not significant. Conclusions: the results of this review show that ordinary classroom teachers can effectively participate in projects to improve students' mental health literacy, significantly improve students' mental health knowledge and attitudes towards psychological problems, and make up for the shortage of full-time mental health teachers in schools. In future, more attention should be paid to students' mental health literacy, and evidence-based intervention research should be strengthened. Furthermore, we can improve students' mental health literacy and avoid poor mental health by addressing delays in early intervention, as well as improve experimental design, prolong the intervention time, and improve the effectiveness of the intervention.

AB  - Many studies have shown that acrolein can cause respiratory system hazards in rats/mice. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between acrolein exposure and respiratory system damage in rats/mice. The search work was performed in China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Wanfang Database, Elsevier ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and PubMed according to the search strategy before September 26, 2022. After literature screening, 27 eligible articles were finally included for Meta-analysis. The results showed that acrolein significantly increased the levels of cell counts (total cells, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophil), cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha), proteins (total protein, MUC5AC), and airway AB/PAS-positive staining area in rats/mice. Our study showed that acrolein exposure could significantly induce the inflammatory response in the lungs of rats/mice, and the degree of inflammatory response was related to the animal species, animal gender, acrolein dose, and experiment duration.

In all, 35 studies were included in a narrative synthesis and, where appropriate, a meta-analytic evaluation using a random-effects model.ResultsLiving alone was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (k = 15, n = 80,243, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20-1.83, I-2 = 83%), and meta-regressions found that the effects were stronger in studies from Europe and with longer follow-up. However, there was evidence of publication bias. Social isolation was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, measured both as a dichotomous variable (k = 3, n = 2648, HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.08-2.04, I-2 = 31%) and as a continuous variable (k = 5, n = 2388, HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.02-1.24, I-2 = 51%). Meta-analysis was not feasible for loneliness as exposure, but narrative synthesis of four studies suggested a tentative association between loneliness and increased risk of all-cause mortality.ConclusionsSupporting public health concerns, our review finds that loneliness, social isolation, and living alone are associated with premature mortality among individuals with established cardiovascular disease. However, evidence of publication bias and large methodological differences across studies point to the need for more rigorous research.

AB  - This study aimed to identify factors associated with the prevalence and severity of menstrual-related symptoms. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021208432). We conducted literature searches of PubMed and Ichushi-Web and used the Jonna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist to assess the quality. Of the 77 studies included in the meta-analysis, significant odds ratios (ORs) were obtained for eight factors associated with primary dysmenorrhea (PD): age >= 20 years (OR: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.34), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m(2) (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.01-2.26), longer menstrual periods (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04-0.28), irregular menstrual cycle (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13-1.45), family history of PD (OR: 3.80; 95% CI: 2.18-6.61), stress (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.30-2.72), sleeping hours < 7 h (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.04-1.35), and bedtime after 23:01 (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.16-1.45). Two factors were associated with severity of PD (moderate vs. severe): BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2) (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.01-3.54) and smoking (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.08-3.47). PD severity (mild vs. severe) and prevalence of premenstrual syndrome were associated with BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2) (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.04-3.50) and smoking (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.31-2.66), respectively. The identified risk factors could be utilized to construct an appropriate strategy to improve menstrual symptoms and support women's health.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to catalog and evaluate response biomarkers correlated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms to improve clinical trials. Methods: A systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus was conducted in April 2020. Seven criteria were applied to focus on original research that includes quantifiable response biomarkers measured alongside ASD symptoms. Interventional studies or human studies that assessed the correlation between biomarkers and ASD-related behavioral measures were included. Results: A total of 5,799 independent records yielded 280 articles for review that reported on 940 biomarkers, 755 of which were unique to a single publication. Molecular biomarkers were the most frequently assayed, including cytokines, growth factors, measures of oxidative stress, neurotransmitters, and hormones, followed by neurophysiology (e.g., EEG and eye tracking), neuroimaging (e.g., functional MRI), and other physiological measures. Studies were highly heterogeneous, including in phenotypes, demographic characteristics, tissues assayed, and methods for biomarker detection. With a median total sample size of 64, almost all of the reviewed studies were only powered to identify biomarkers with large effect sizes. Reporting of individual-level values and summary statistics was inconsistent, hampering mega- and meta-analysis. Biomarkers assayed in multiple studies yielded mostly inconsistent results, revealing a "replication crisis." Conclusions: There is currently no response biomarker with sufficient evidence to inform ASD clinical trials. This review highlights methodological imperatives for ASD biomarker research necessary to make definitive progress: consistent experimental design, correction for multiple comparisons, formal replication, sharing of sample-level data, and preregistration of study designs. Systematic "big data" analyses of multiple potential biomarkers could accelerate discovery.

AB  - Insufficient physical activity (PA) and excessive sedentary behavior (SB) are detrimental to physical and mental health. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify whether e-health interventions are effective for improving PA and SB in college students. Five electronic databases, including Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest, were searched to collect relevant randomized controlled trials up to 22 June 2022. In total, 22 trials (including 31 effects) with 8333 samples were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that e-health interventions significantly improved PA at post-intervention (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.45, p < 0.001) compared with the control group, especially for total PA (SMD = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.58, p = 0.005), moderate to vigorous PA (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.32, p = 0.036), and steps (SMD = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.23, 1.28, p < 0.001. There were no significant effects for both PA at follow-up (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI: - 0.01, 0.49, p = 0.057) and SB (MD = -29.11, 95% CI: -70.55, 12.32, p = 0.17). The findings of subgroup analyses indicated that compared to the control group, interventions in the group of general participants (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.63, p < 0.001), smartphone apps (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.73, p = 0.001), and online (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.43, p < 0.001) can significantly improve PA at post-intervention. Moreover, the intervention effects were significant across all groups of theory, region, instrument, duration, and female ratio. At follow-up, interventions in groups of developing region (SMD = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.62, p < 0.001), objective instrument (SMD = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.23, 1.42, p = 0.007), duration <= 3-month (SMD = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.72, 1.39, p < 0.001), and all female (SMD = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.02, 1.56, p = 0.044) can significantly improve PA. The evidence of this meta-analysis shows that e-health interventions can be taken as promising strategies for promoting PA. The maintenance of PA improvement and the effect of interventions in reducing SB remain to be further studied. Educators and health practitioners should focus on creating multiple e-health interventions with individualized components.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is a widespread disease that, if persistent, increases the risks of coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity. Slow breathing is a recommended blood pressure-lowering strategy though the mechanisms mediating its effects are unknown.Objective: This review aims to evaluate autonomic and vascular function as potential mediators driving BP adaptive responses with slow breathing.Methods: We searched EBSCO host, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed using key words for optimized search results.Results: Nineteen studies were included in this review (11 device-guided; 8 non-device-guided breathing). Though some studies showed increased vagally mediated components of heart rate variability during slow breathing, results from acute and long-term studies were incongruent. Increases in baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) following a single device-guided slow breathing bout were noted in normotensive and hypertensive adults. Long-term (4 weeks to 3 months) effects of slow breathing on BRS were absent. Device-guided breathing resulted in immediate reductions in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in normo-and hyper-tensive adults though results from long-term studies yielded inconsistent findings. Non-device-guided slow breathing posed acute and chronic effects on vascular function with reductions in arterial stiffness in adults with type I diabetes and in-creases in microvascular endothelial function in adults with irritable bowel syndrome. Non-device guided breathing also reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in healthy and hypertensive adults in acute and chronic studies. No adverse effects or non-adherence to treatment were noted in these trials.Conclusion: Device-guided slow breathing is a feasible and effective modality in improving BRS, HRV, and arterial stiffness though its long-term effects are obscure. Though less evidence exists supporting the efficacy of non -device-guided slow breathing, acute and chronic studies demonstrate improvements in vascular function and inflammatory cytokines. More studies are needed to further explore the long-term effects of slow breathing in general and non-device-guided breathing in particular.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique for determining emotional tone in a body of text. Using product reviews in sentiment analysis and opinion mining various methods have been developed previously. Although, existing product review analyzing techniques could not accurately detect the product aspect and non-aspect. Hence a novel Detach Frequency Assort is proposed to detect the product aspect term using TF-ISF (Term frequency-inverse sentence frequency) with Part of Speech (POS) tags for sentence segmentation and additionally using Feedback Neural Network to combine product aspect feedback loop. Furthermore, decision-making problem occurs during classification of sentiments. Hence, to solve this problem a novel technique named, Systemize Polarity Shift is proposed in which flow search based Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Bag of Words model classifies pre-trained review comments as positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Moreover, the identification of specific products is not focused in sentiment analysis. Hence, a novel Revival Extraction is proposed in which a specific product is extracted based on thematic analysis method to obtain accurate data. Thus, the proposed Product Review Opinion framework gives effective optimized results in sentiment analysis with high accuracy, specificity, recall, sensitivity, F1-Score, and precision.

KW  - PREVENTION
AB  - One of the five Ottawa Charter's means of action is the concept of "healthy public policy," which is an approach to health promotion that is integrated with public policy. This concept can be used as an approach/method in solving health problems at the broader policy level and involving all sectors comprehensively, not just health promotion at the community level and the partial health sector, so that public health problems can be resolved properly. We conducted a systematic review of health promotion policies or regulations using CCAT theory. The purpose of this study is to find the state of the art of research related to stakeholder synergy in online game addiction prevention policies in adolescents. References and literature for this systematic review were collected from the Proquest, ScienceDirect, Pubmed, and Google Scholar databases. The search uses the boolean phrases "OR" and "AND." Keywords: policy or regulation, health promotion, and community coalition action theory. The results of the systematic review conducted by the researchers showed that of the twenty selected articles, three articles used the coalition/partnership dimension from the CCAT theory, four articles used the stakeholder dimension, two articles used the collaboration dimension, five articles discussed school health policies, policies related to gaming disorders. One article on the analysis of the juvenile contraceptive law, one article on the prevention of mental health disorders, one article on health promotion interventions, and two articles on risk factors and self-regulation focus on online gaming addiction in adolescents. This study concludes that in the future, further research is needed regarding health promotion policies to prevent online game addiction in adolescents to develop specific policy recommendations related to preventing online game addiction in adolescents.

AB  - With the rapid development of science and technology, high-dimensional data have been widely used in various fields. Due to the complex characteristics of high-dimensional data, it is usually distributed in the union of several low-dimensional subspaces. In the past several decades, subspace clustering (SC) methods have been widely studied as they can restore the underlying subspace of high-dimensional data and perform fast clustering with the help of the data self-expressiveness property. The SC methods aim to construct an affinity matrix by the self-representation coefficient of high-dimensional data and then obtain the clustering results using the spectral clustering method. The key is how to design a self-expressiveness model that can reveal the real subspace structure of data. In this survey, we focus on the development of SC methods in the past two decades and present a new classification criterion to divide them into three categories based on the purpose of clustering, i.e., low-rank sparse SC, local structure preserving SC, and kernel SC. We further divide them into subcategories according to the strategy of constructing the representation coefficient. In addition, the applications of SC methods in face recognition, motion segmentation, handwritten digits recognition, and speech emotion recognition are introduced. Finally, we have discussed several interesting and meaningful future research directions.

AB  - Assistive robots have the potential to support older people and people with disabilities in various tasks so that they can live more independently. One of the research challenges is the appearance of assistive robots so that they are accepted by prospective users and encourage interaction. This scoping review aims to identify studies that report preferences in order to derive indicators for the embodiment of a robot with assistance functions. A systematic literature research was conducted in the three electronic databases IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and PubMed Central (PMC). Included papers date back not further than 2015 and report empirical studies about the preferred appearance of service robots. The search resulted in 1,760 papers. 29 were included, of which 20 papers reported quantitative studies, three described a qualitative and six a mixed-methods design. Out of these papers, seven categories of robot appearances and design components could be extracted. Most papers focused on humanoid or humanlike robots and components like facial features or gender aspects. Others relied on design that reflects the robot's function or simulated emotions through light applications. Only eight studies focused on older adults, and no study on people with disabilities. The appearance of a humanoid robot is often described as favorable, but the definition of 'humanoid' varies widely within all analyzed studies and an explizit allocation of features is not possible. For their practical work, robot designers can extract various aspects from the papers; however, for generalization more research is necessary.

AB  - Although many instruments are used to assess the families of people with diabetes, their measurement properties have not been systematically reviewed. We aimed to identify and evaluate the psychometric properties of the instruments used to assess family functioning in adults with diabetes. Methods: A systematic literature review, according to the JBI systematic reviews of measurement properties, was conducted using different databases, including gray literature. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021239733. Two independent reviewers searched, screened, and assessed the risk of bias among the articles according to the COSMIN methodology. The quality of each included instrument was assessed using the updated criteria for good measurement properties. Results: Eighty-one studies were included, and thirty-one eligible instruments were identified. The psychometric properties frequently assessed were structural validity, internal consistency, and construct validity. Conclusions: Although 31 instruments were included, none of their psychometric properties were scored as "very good". From the instruments scored as adequate on development and content validity, five stood out for their quality appraisal.. The development of new instruments is not recommended. More studies should be conducted on the existing instruments to assess the less commonly evaluated psychometric properties. Using valid instruments to develop and evaluate interventions is essential to promote health literacy and the effectiveness of diabetes management.

AB  - Stress contributes to the development and maintenance of obesity. Mindfulness-based therapies are being used to reduce stress and promote weight reduction and maintenance. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions for stress and weight reduction in the short, medium, and long term. Searches on PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, WOS, and Science Direct were conducted until March 2021. Intervention studies with a sample of adults were included; these evaluated a mindfulness-based intervention and used stress and weight or body mass index as outcome variables. These criteria were met by 13 articles. A meta-analysis of 8 of the 13 articles was performed with a random-effects or fixed-effects model, depending on the level of heterogeneity between studies. Mindfulness-based interventions had a small effect on stress reduction over a 3-month period: effect size (standardized mean difference) = -0.29 (95% CI: -0.49, -0.10). However, no significant evidence was found for stress reduction from 3 months onwards, nor for weight or body mass index reduction in any period. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective in reducing stress in the short term, but not in the medium or long term, nor are they effective for weight or body mass index. More robust and longer study designs are needed to determine their effects.

AB  - Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is used to treat a variety of ailments. It has been highlighted for its potential to benefit people with bipolar disorders, for whom there are clear current unmet treatment needs. This scoping review sought to synthesise all available evidence related to the potential effects of acetazolamide on symptoms related to bipolar disorder, acceptability and tolerability, and intervention characteristics (e.g., dose and duration). Following publication of the review protocol, the Pubmed, Embase, and PsycInfo databases were searched (all dated to 31 August 2022). A systematic approach was undertaken to identify eligible articles and extract relevant data from these. Five studies were included, assessing a total of 50 patients treated with acetazolamide. Most patients were from two open-label trials, while the others were case reports. Approximately one third of patients were experiencing psychosis or mania before treatment initiation, and one third had refractory depression. Forty-four percent of patients were estimated to achieve a response (not seemingly affected by the baseline episode type, acetazolamide dose, or duration), while a further 22% appeared to experience minimal benefits from the intervention. Acetazolamide was generally reported to be tolerated well and acceptable for up to 2 years, although reporting for acceptability and tolerability was suboptimal. The reviewed evidence is extremely limited in size and methodology (e.g., no randomised studies, blinding, or standardised outcome assessment). We posit that the current findings are sufficiently encouraging to recommend substantive clinical trials, but we emphasise that at present, the evidence is exceedingly preliminary, and there remains evident uncertainty as to whether acetazolamide could be a viable treatment for bipolar disorders.

AB  - Foraminifera are considered good bioindicators of environmental stress based on morphological abnormalities, but physiological responses occur far earlier and have not been evaluated as pollution markers. The aim of this review was to collate all published articles reporting physiological changes in foraminifera after environmental and anthropogenic stressors, to evaluate their reliability as early markers of environmental stress. We reviewed 70 studies, meeting the inclusion criteria, reporting 13 physiological effects classes after exposure to 17 different stressors. Immune functions, bleaching and lifecycle disruptions, were the most reported. Amphistegina and Ammonia showed high proportion of effects with lead and mercury, with a significant relationship between these heavy metals and the number of physiological effects classes in Ammonia, and between bleaching in Amphistegina gibbosa and Amphistegina lobifera with solar light and temperature. This suggests physiological responses are potentially reliable early indicators of environmental stress. It is necessary to increase quantitative physiological measures and standard exposure protocols in order to properly evaluate these organisms as pollution bioindicators.

AB  - This study synthesizes the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on depression and suicidal ideation among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). During treatment, patients with MDD may experience repeated episodes, negative counseling, and suicidal ideation, which can lead to further depression and ultimately affect quality of life. Recent studies have shown that MBCT can improve the level of depression and suicidal ideation in patients with MDD. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted. The literature search for articles up to December 2021 was performed in the following electronic databases: Airiti Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, ProQuest, and the Index of the Taiwan Periodical Literature System. Records were independently evaluated by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved through consensus. The quality of study was evaluated using the Modified Jadad Scale score. A meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager Version 5.3.5 software with a random-effects model. Thirteen studies (1159 participants) investigating MBCT for patients with MDD were included. The MBCT sessions lasted 1.5-2.5 h and were delivered by therapists five times per week for 8 weeks. The meta-effects of MBCT among patients with MDD showed significant improvement in depression and suicidal ideation. Future research should evaluate the long-term effects of MBCT. MBCT is relatively convenient and effective for preventing and alleviating depression and suicidal ideation. Further research can provide detailed suggestions for effective MBCT implementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Supported Employment (SE) has shown better results in the employment rate for persons with disabilities than other methods within vocational rehabilitation, but howSE affects the employment rate for subgroups in the interventions needs further attention.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine previous research regarding the influence of intersecting statuses on the employment rate in SE for people with psychiatric, neuropsychiatric, or intellectual disabilities according to type of diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, age, level of education and previous work history.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in nine databases including peer-reviewed articles from 2000 to April 2021. Articles presenting the employment rate in SE interventions according to the intersecting statuses listed in the objective were included.
   RESULTS: The searches identified 3777 unique records, of which 53 articles were included in data extraction. In most of the included articles, intersecting statuses did not affect the employment rate for people in the SE interventions with psychiatric disabilities. Few studies have examined neuropsychiatric and intellectual disabilities. A majority of the studies subjected to full-text analysis were excluded due to a lack of reporting of the effects of intersecting statuses on the employment rate. The studies that reported on the effects of intersecting statuses on the employment rate often had small samples and lacked statistical power.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intersecting statuses do not appear to affect the employment rate for people receiving SE interventions, but systematic reviews with pooled samples need to be undertaken because of the low reporting rate and underpowered sample sizes in existing studies.

AB  - Background: Physical exercise can slow down the decline of the cognitive function of the older adults, yet the review evidence is not conclusive. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of aerobic and resistance training on cognitive ability. Methods: A computerized literature search was carried out using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase SCOPUS, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang, and VIP database to identify relevant articles from inception through to 1 October 2022. Based on a preliminary search of the database and the references cited, 10,338 records were identified. For the measured values of the research results, the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to synthesize the effect size. Results: Finally, 10 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Since the outcome indicators of each literature are different in evaluating the old cognitive ability, a subgroup analysis was performed on the included literature. The study of results suggests that aerobic or resistance training interventions significantly improved cognitive ability in older adults compared with control interventions with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MD 2.76; 95% CI 2.52 to 3.00), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MD 2.64; 95% CI 2.33 to 2.94), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (MD 2.86; 95% CI 2.25 to 3.47), the Wechsler Memory Scale (MD 9.33; 95% CI 7.12 to 11.54), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (MD 5.31; 95% CI 1.20 to 9.43), the Trail Making Tests (MD -8.94; 95% CI -9.81 to -8.07), and the Stroop Color and Word Test (MD -5.20; 95% CI -7.89 to -2.51). Conclusion: Physical exercise improved the cognitive function of the older adults in all mental states. To improve cognitive ability, this meta-analysis recommended that patients perform at least moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and resistance exercise on as many days as possible in the week to comply with current exercise guidelines while providing evidence for clinicians.

AB  - Incidents of bullying have increased on students in schools. This has a negative impact such as mental health problems and risk of suicide. Interventions related to bullying are still focused on being carried out independently. Meanwhile, collaborative interventions between nurses and the school are needed to acquire maximum results in preventing and reducing the incidence of bullying. The purpose of this study is to describe school-based nursing interventions in preventing and reducing the incidence of bullying among students at school. This study used scoping review with a search strategy using the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Review process to find the articles. The PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus electronic databases were searched. We found 12 articles from 594 articles in 3 databases which discussed nursing interventions based on school to prevent and reduce incidence of bullying in students. The studies included are design randomized control trials and quasi experiments. The samples with the range of 40-7121 respondents. We classified the school-based nursing interventions being three methods, there are Game programs, physical activity programs, training programs, and peer-group programs. The content of interventions are psychoeducation, empathy training, counseling, and self-management. This study shows that school-based nursing interventions can be an option in preventing and reducing the incidence of bullying among students at school.

AB  - Objective Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have been the longstanding targets of racism and discrimination in Australia. This paper presents the findings of a systematic literature review designed to identify and synthesise the available evidence exploring these intergroup attitudes, and the factors that correlate with them. Method Searches were conducted in Medline, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, ProQuest Psychology Database and PsycINFO databases. Eligible studies were required to measure attitudes of non-Indigenous Australians towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Results Twenty studies met the eligibility criteria (n = 2,958). The results outlined: (a) the prevalence of negative attitudes, (b) attitudes were most commonly conceptualised as modern racism, and (c) that there are a range of factors that are associated with negativity towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Conclusions The review outlined the relationship between attitudes towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and demographic, ideological, individual differences, and intergroup factors. This review highlights the need for continued research in this domain to inform appropriate prejudice reduction strategies. What is already known about this topic: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples face continued adversity, prejudice, and discrimination on their own land. This heightened propensity to be targeted for prejudice is a known social determinant of poorer health and wellbeing. Understanding racial attitudes towards this group is an imperative step in understanding and combating this health disparity. What this topic adds: There is a paucity of academic research exploring negativity towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples The limited quantity of evidence does establish a range of correlates with negative attitudes that can be clustered into four themes - demographic factors, ideological variables, individual differences factors, and intergroup factors. More research is warranted in this domain to further establish a body of evidence on intergroup attitudes towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, with a renewed focus needed on prejudice reduction techniques.

The impact of early sleep disruption on cognitive and physical development is also under-studied. The aim of this review was to investigate early childhood sleep development over the first two years and its association with neurodevelopment. Methods This review was conducted according to the 2009 PRISMA guidelines. Four databases (OVID Medline, Pubmed, CINAHL, and Web of Science) were searched according to predefined search terms. Results Ninety-three studies with approximately 90,000 subjects from demographically diverse backgrounds were included in this review. Sleep is the predominant state at birth. There is an increase in NREM and a decrease in REM sleep during the first two years. Changes in sleep architecture occur in tandem with development. There are more studies exploring sleep and early infancy compared to mid and late infancy and early childhood. Discussion Sleep is critical for memory, learning, and socio-emotional development. Future longitudinal studies in infants and young children should focus on sleep architecture at each month of life to establish the emergence of key characteristics, especially from 7-24 months of age, during periods of rapid neurodevelopmental progress.

AB  - Disconnection from education and employment in youth termed Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) has global attention. Major societal economic consequences and detrimental individual consequences follow disconnection. On the one hand, mental health problems are recognized as essential factors in disconnection, and on the other hand, youth clients within social welfare services face re-integrative initiatives with a vocational perspective. Psychosis and NEET are strongly associated with young help seekers inside mental healthcare services. In this systematic review, we investigate the occurrence of symptoms of psychosis among NEET status youth outside mental healthcare services to clarify if occurrence corresponds to the findings of NEET among help seekers with psychosis inside mental healthcare services. Based on literature search in the six databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, Soclndex and Cochrane Library for NEETs measured for psychosis, we present findings from a narrative synthesis of two included studies and a total of 179 included participants. Our findings demonstrate sparse literature describing psychosis among NEETs, contrasting findings within mental healthcare settings. The results point to a research gap. Further research exploring unrecognized mental health needs with the focus of severe mental disorders as psychosis among the NEET population is needed. Joint interventions of welfare benefit system and mental health service are recommended to evolve initiatives for prevention and integration of the NEETs.

AB  - Background The Ebola virus is known as one of the deadliest pathogens to infect humans. Children represent a minority of Ebola Virus Disease cases globally. Yet, the different Ebola outbreaks in Africa had a wide impact on children's lives and children' rights. Objective Review the published literature to date on Children's rights during Ebola outbreaks. Outcomes shall contribute to get a better understanding of the main limitations or violations of children's rights, identify potential gaps in the literature and support the promotion and protection of children's rights for current and future health crisis. Methods A scoping review from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library and Web of Science was performed using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Articles, reports and editorial, published on Ebola Outbreaks between 1976 and 2020 were retrieved. The UNCRC clusters of rights and treaty specific guidelines were used as a framework. Documents were found through a targeted search of websites from international or regional organisations involved in Ebola crises and children's protection. Results 48 articles and reports were reviewed. Few documents focused solely on children's rights. Several articles covered the topic of children and Ebola outbreaks. Most of the data are linked to basic health, education, discrimination of orphans and survivors. 31% of the reviewed articles underline the violence against the children (rape, abuse, Female genital mutilations), while 21% focus on the right to education. 23% cover the topic of orphans. Impact on mental health and SRH were amongst the other covered topics. Conclusion A lack of data on children's rights and their violations during epidemics is observed. Regional and international collaboration is needed to document the situation of children in health emergencies. Health measures and strategies based on children's opinions and raising awareness of their crucial role in society is key. Child-centred guidelines should be developed based on these elements.

AB  - Community health volunteers are considered a vital part of the community health structure in Africa. Despite this vital role in African health systems, very little is known about the community health volunteers' day-to-day lived experiences providing services in communities and supporting other health workers. This scoping review aims to advance understanding of the day-to-day experiences of community health volunteers in Africa. In doing so, this review draws attention to these under-considered actors in African health systems and identifies critical factors and conditions that represent challenges to community health volunteers' work in this context. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a synthesis of key challenges and considerations that can inform efforts to reduce attrition and improve the sustainability of community health volunteers in Africa. This scoping review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews checklist to achieve the objectives. A comprehensive search of six databases returned 2140 sources. After screening, 31 peer-reviewed studies were selected for final review. Analytical themes were generated based on the reviewers' extraction of article data into descriptive themes using an inductive approach. In reviewing community health volunteers' accounts of providing health services, five key challenges become apparent. These are: (1) challenges balancing work responsibilities with family obligations; (2) resource limitations; (3) exposure to stigma and harassment; (4) gendered benefits and risks; and (5) health-system level challenges. This scoping review highlights the extent of challenges community health volunteers must navigate to provide services in communities. Sustained commitment at the national and international level to understand the lived experiences of community health volunteers and mitigate common stressors these health actors face could improve their performance and inform future programs.

AB  - Background Identification of national research agendas for mental health and disability can be supported by well-designed research priority-setting studies. Few low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have undertaken such studies. Objective To identify mental health and disability research priorities in Ghana. Methods A mixed methods study comprising a rapid review, research priority ranking survey, and research capacity needs assessment survey was employed. Participants in the surveys included five expert pools identified from online search and existing database on mental health civil society organisations/non-governmental organisations. The research priority ranking was completed in two stages, using the Child and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method to identify priority questions for immediate and short term (0 to 5 years) and medium to long term (>5 years) in stage two. Both surveys were deployed online using google forms. Analysis for the ranking survey involved computing total scores from the CHNRI criteria and generating ranks for the research questions. Results A total of 68 experts (97% response rate), generated 94 and 92 questions for the short and long term, respectively. Forty experts (58% response rate) completed the ranking stage. The top 10 ranked research questions included: 4 questions addressing health systems; 2 questions on epidemiology; and 4 questions on interventions. All research questions were considered urgent and should be conducted in the immediate to short term (0-5 years). The methodological capacity of researchers to conduct disability and mental health research is weak. Conclusion Our approach has generated an agenda for mental health and disability research priorities for Ghana and demonstrated that it is feasible to employ a systematic methodology for research priority setting that includes key parameters of context and research capacity.

AB  - Background: The reported prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) among older adults varied widely across different studies. This was a meta-analysis to systematically examine the global prevalence of depression among older populations and its associated factors.Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Due to the differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between studies, random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled prevalence of depression and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI).Results: In total, 55 studies with 59,851 individuals met the study criteria and were included in the analyses. The overall prevalence of depression was 35.1% (95%CI: 30.2-40.4%). Subgroup analyses revealed that different sampling methods (Q=10592.49, p = 0.037), Geriatric Depression Scale versions (Q=13712.55, p < 0.001) and income levels (Q=14.028, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the pooled prevalence of depression in older adults. In the meta-regression analyses, time of survey (B=0.012, z = 2.30, p = 0.029) was positively associated, and mean age (B=-0.018, z = 2.10, p = 0.044) was negatively associated with the prevalence of depression in older populations. The funnel plot and Egger's test did not reveal any significant publication bias (Egger's test: t = 1.93, p = 0.059). Conclusion: This meta-analysis found that over a third of older populations globally had depression. Effective preventive measures, regular screening and timely interventions are needed to address this highly prevalent public health problem among older adults.

AB  - Objective: To systematically assess the effects of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) on post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and to compare the efficacy of two different NIBS.Methods Computer searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical literature Service System (SinoMed), and Wanfang Database were conducted using a combination of free words and subject terms. The search was conducted from the database creation date to 27 November 2022. The risk of bias in the included literature was assessed using the Cochrane Risk Assessment Scale. The quality of the included literature was assessed using the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) scale. A standard meta-analysis of study data for each outcome indicator was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Network meta-analysis was performed using State 14.0 according to the Bayesian framework.Results A total of 18 studies involving 809 patients were included. Meta-analysis shows NIBS significantly improved montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-1.02, P < 0.05), mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores (SMD = 0.72, 95% CI 0.25-1.20, P < 0.05), and modified barthel index (MBI) and functional independence measurement (FIM) scores (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11-0.54, P < 0.05) in patients with PSCI. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) of different NIBS in improving MoCA scores were in the order of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (SUCRA = 92.4%) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (SUCRA = 57.6%). The SUCRA of different NIBS in improving MMSE scores were in the order of tDCS (SUCRA = 81.6%) and TMS (SUCRA = 67.3%). The SUCRA of different NIBS in improving MBI and FIM scores were in the order of tDCS (SUCRA = 78.6%) and TMS (SUCRA = 65.3%).Conclusion The available evidence suggests that NIBS improves cognitive impairment. tDCS appeared more effective than TMS for cognitive function and activities of daily living in PSCI patients. Limited by the number of included studies, more large-sample, multicentre, double-blind, high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to further confirm this study's results.

AB  - Neurotrophins (NTs) as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) play multiple roles in different settings including neuronal development, function and survival in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems from early stages. This report aims to provide a summary and subsequent review of evidences on the role of NTs in rare and non-common pediatric human diseases associated with changes in neurodevelopment. A variety of diseases has been analyzed and many have been linked to NTs neurobiological effects, including chronic granulomatous disease, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Angelman syndrome, fragile X syndrome, trisomy 16, Williams-Beuren syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, WAGR syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, Down syndrome and Klinefelter Syndrome. NTs alterations have been associated with numerous pathologic manifestations including cognitive defects, behavioral abnormalities, epilepsy, obesity, tumorigenesis as well as muscle-skeletal, immunity, bowel, pain sensibility and cilia diseases. In this report, we discuss that further studies are needed to clear a possible therapeutic role of NTs in these still often uncurable diseases.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) draw international attention owing to their widespread distribution in water ecosystems, but whether MPs cause neurotoxic effects in aquatic animals at environmentally realistic concentrations is still controversial. This meta-analysis recompiled 35 studies to determine whether MPs could change the levels of brain (in vivo) neurotransmitters in aquatic animals at environmentally realistic concentrations (<= 1 mg/L, median = 0.100 mg/L). Then, a group comparison was conducted to compare the effects of different factors on the effect size and to explore the significant factors affecting the neurotoxicity of MPs. The results demonstrated that MP exposure could considerably decrease the levels of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) in the brain of aquatic animals by 16.2%. However, the effects of MPs on cholinesterase (CHE), acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were not statistically significant due to the small number of studies and samples. The neurotoxicity of MPs was closely linked with particle size and exposure time but independent of animal species, MP compositions, MP morphology and MP concentrations. Further literatures review indicated that MP-induced neurotoxicity and behavioral changes are related with multiple biological processes, including nerve damage, oxidative stress, intestinal flora disturbance and metabolic disorder. Furthermore, some factors influ-encing MP neurotoxicity in the real environment (e.g. the aging of MPs, the release of MP additives, and the co-exposure of MPs and pollutants) were discussed. Overall, this study preliminarily explored whether MPs induced changes in neurotoxicity-related indicators in aquatic animals through meta-analysis and provided scientific evidence for evaluating the health risks and neurotoxicity of MPs at the environmental level.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which is characterised mostly by loss of dopaminergic nerve cells throughout the nigral area mainly as a consequence of oxidative stress. Muscle stiffness, disorganised bodily responses, disturbed sleep, weariness, amnesia, and voice impairment are all symptoms of dopaminergic neuron degeneration and existing symptomatic treatments are important to arrest additional neuronal death. Some cannabinoids have recently been demonstrated as robust antioxidants that might protect the nerve cells from degeneration even when cannabinoid receptors are not triggered. Cannabinoids are likely to have property to slow or presumably cease the steady deterioration of the brain's dopaminergic systems, a condition for which there is now no treatment. The use of cannabinoids in combination with currently available drugs has the potential to introduce a radically new paradigm for treatment of Parkinson's disease, making it immensely useful in the treatment of such a debilitating illness.

AB  - Brain diseases, including tumors and mental and neurological disorders, seriously threaten the health and well-being of millions of people worldwide. Structural and functional neuroimaging modalities are commonly used by physicians to aid the diagnosis of brain diseases. In clinical settings, specialist doctors typically fuse the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data with other neuroimaging modalities for brain disease detection. As these two approaches offer comple-mentary information, fusing these neuroimaging modalities helps physicians accurately diagnose brain diseases. Typically, fusion is performed between a functional and a structural neuroimaging modality. Because the functional modality can complement the structural modality information, thus improving the performance for the diagnosis of brain diseases by specialists. However, analyzing the fusion of neuroimaging modalities is difficult for specialist doctors. Deep Learning (DL) is a branch of artificial intelligence that has shown superior performances compared to more conventional methods in tasks such as brain disease detection from neuroimaging modalities. This work presents a comprehensive review paper in the field of brain disease detection from the fusion of neuroimaging modalities using DL models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), pretrained, generative adver-sarial networks (GANs), and Autoencoders (AEs). First, neuroimaging modalities and the need for fusion are discussed. Then, review papers published in the field of neuroimaging multimodalities using AI techniques are explored. More-over, fusion levels based on DL methods, including input, layer, and decision, with related studies conducted on diagnosing brain diseases, are discussed. Other sections present the most important challenges for diagnosing brain diseases from the fusion of neuroimaging modalities. In the discussion section, the details of previous research on the fusion of neuroimaging modalities based on MRI and DL models are reported. In the following, the most important future directions include Datasets, DA, imbalanced data, DL models, explainable AI, and hardware resources are pre-sented. Finally, the main findings of this study are presented in the conclusion section.

AB  - Purpose Global understanding of the epidemiological landscape of non-affective psychotic disorders (NAPD) is predominantly based on studies from high-income countries. We sought to systematically review and meta-analyse all incidence studies conducted in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).Methods We systematically searched four databases using terms for NAPD, incidence and LMICs. Citations were eligible for inclusion if: published between 1 January 1960 and 31 May 2022; wholly or partially conducted in an LMIC, and; containing data on NAPD incidence in the general adult population. Two independent raters assessed study quality according to previously published criteria. We conducted a narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analyses where sufficient studies were available (N >= 5). Results We retrieved 11 421 records, of which 23 citations met inclusion criteria from 18 unique studies across 19 settings in 10 LMICs. Median study quality was 4 out of 7 (interquartile range: 3-6). The crude incidence of NAPD varied around 4.2 times, from 10.0 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.7-11.4) in Brazil to 42.0 (95%CI 32.2-54.8) in India, with marked heterogeneity in methodologies and rates. Our 60-year review highlights the dearth of robust evidence on the incidence of psychotic disorders in LMICs.Conclusion Without reliable, contemporary estimates of this fundamental cornerstone of population health, it is impossible to understand the true burden, distribution or causes of psychotic disorders in over 87% of the world's population. A new, more equitable global mental health evidence base for NAPD is now urgently required.

AB  - Background: Cerebellar structural and functional abnormalities underlie widespread deficits in clinical, cognitive, and motor functioning that are observed in schizophrenia. Consequently, the cerebellum is a promising target for novel schizophrenia treatments. Here we conducted an updated systematic review examining the literature on cerebellar stimulation efficacy and tolerability for mitigating symptoms of schizophrenia. We discuss the purported mechanisms of cerebellar stimulation, current methods for implementing stimulation, and future directions of cerebellar stimulation for intervention development with this population. Methods: Two independent authors identified 20 published studies (7 randomized controlled trials, 7 open-label studies, 1 pilot study, 4 case reports, 1 preclinical study) that describe the effects of cerebellar circuitry modulation in patients with schizophrenia or animal models of psychosis. Published studies up to October 11, 2022 were identified from a search within PubMed, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Results: Most studies stimulating the cerebellum used transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct-current stimulation, specifically targeting the cerebellar vermis/midline. Accounting for levels of methodological rigor across studies, these studies detected post-cerebellar modulation in schizophrenia as indicated by the alleviation of certain clinical symptoms (mainly negative and depressive symptoms), as well as increased frontal-cerebellar connectivity and augmentation of canonical neuro-oscillations known to be abnormal in schizophrenia. In contrast to a prior review, we did not find consistent evidence for cognitive improvements following cerebellar modulation stimulation. Modern cerebellar stimulation methods appear tolerable for individuals with schizophrenia, with only mild and temporary side effects. Conclusion: Cerebellar stimulation is a promising intervention for individuals with schizophrenia that may be more relevant to some symptom domains than others. Initial results highlight the need for continued research using more methodologically rigorous designs, such as additional longitudinal and randomized controlled trials.

AB  - All-terrain vehicle (ATV) incidents are one of the leading causes of injuries and fatalities among youth in the agricultural industry. It has been hypothesized that many youth-related ATV incidents occur because children ride ATVs that do not fit their capabilities and are not following basic safe riding practices. In addition, various ATV safety guidelines regarding youth (e.g., CPSC, ANSI/SVIA, ASI) are inconsistent and may not align with state or local laws. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive studies have compared the physical and mental requirements for riding ATVs and the youth's capabilities to ride ATVs safely. Consequently, there are no scientific-based recommendations for age limitation, physical and mental capabilities, and safety requirements for youth to ride ATVs safely. Thus, there is a need to review the available sources related to youth safety and ATVs in the agricultural industry, identify the research voids, and recommend modifications to current ATV guidelines. This study conducted a systematic review of available ATV-related studies, standards, guidelines, and laws to establish better-informed minimum age, physical and mental capabilities, and safety requirements for youths to ride ATVs on the farm.

AB  - This meta-analysis aims to clarify where we stand and where we are heading regarding the effectiveness of employee strengths use interventions. The systematic literature search yielded 21 independent controlled trials. Random-effects meta-analyses revealed a weak but significant effect for increasing individual strategies at post-intervention (d = .37, 95% confidence interval [CI] [.07, .67]) and a non-significant one at follow-up (d = .15, 95% CI [-.11, .40]); personal resources demonstrated a moderate post-intervention increase (d = .53, 95% CI [.25, .81]) and a small one at follow-up (d = .33, 95% CI [.18, .49]); and small and significant improvements were also observed for workplace well-being (post-intervention: d = .31, 95% CI [.21, .41]; follow-up: d = .27, 95% CI [.10, .43]), general well-being (post-intervention: d = .24, 95% CI [.10, .38]; follow-up: d = .18, 95% CI [.07, .30]), and post-intervention performance (d = .28, 95% CI [.11, .45]). Follow-up performance ceased to be significant (d = .22, 95% CI [-.15, .59]). Lengthier interventions were associated with stronger long-term gains in personal resources and workplace well-being; younger participants had stronger immediate boosts to personal resources. Strengths use interventions are a promising new approach in the evidence-based practice of organizational and occupational health psychologists, highlighting the benefits of building on human potential for employees and organizations alike.

AB  - Introduction:Depression is the most significant contributor to non-fatal health reductions worldwide. Acupuncture is the most commonly used complementary alternative therapy to relieve major depressive disorder (MDD) effectively. Nevertheless, the effects of acupuncture for MDD are uncertain. This review aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for MDD. Methods:Meta-analysis was performed for randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for MDD data from eight databases searched from inception until February 10, 2022. All RCTs with adult participants undergoing acupuncture treatment for MDD were included. The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD). We used random-effects meta-analysis to synthesize the results with a mean difference or odds ratio. Furthermore, the potential heterogeneity was tested through meta-regression/subgroup analyses/sensitive analysis. The quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results:Forty-three studies were included: 9 acupuncture versus sham acupuncture (n = 920), 26 acupuncture versus antidepressants (n = 2169), and 9 acupuncture plus antidepressants versus antidepressants (n = 667). Of the 43 high-quality articles, 24 and 8 were determined to have a low and moderate risk of bias, respectively. The pooled results for HAMD and SDS revealed the clinical benefits of acupuncture or acupuncture plus antidepressants compared to sham acupuncture or antidepressants, with high-quality evidence. Furthermore, high-quality evidence showed that acupuncture led to fewer adverse effects than antidepressants. Conclusions:Acupuncture or acupuncture plus antidepressants were significantly associated with reduced HAMD scores, with high-quality evidence. Also, more rigorous trials are needed to identify the optimal frequency of acupuncture for MDD and integrate such evidence into clinical care to reduce antidepressant use.

AB  - To identify research and gaps in literature about FGM/C-related attitudes and experiences among individuals from FGM/C-practicing countries living in the United States, we conducted a scoping review guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework. We searched Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), PubMed, and SCOPUS and conducted a grey literature search for studies assessing attitudes or experiences related to FGM/C with data collected directly from individuals from FGM/C-practicing countries living in the United States. The search yielded 417 studies, and 40 met the inclusion criteria. Findings suggest that women and men from FGM/C-practicing countries living in the United States generally oppose FGM/C, and that women with FGM/C have significant physical and mental health needs and have found US healthcare providers to lack understanding of FGM/C. Future research can improve measurement of FGM/C by taking into account the sociocultural influences on FGM/C-related attitudes and experiences.

AB  - Prospective economic evaluations conducted alongside clinical trials have become an increasingly popular approach in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a public health initiative or treatment intervention. These types of economic studies provide improved internal validity and accuracy of cost and effectiveness estimates of health interventions and, compared with simulation or decision-analytic models, have the advantage of jointly observing health and economics outcomes of trial participants. However, missing data due to incomplete response or patient attrition, and sampling uncertainty are common concerns in econometric analysis of clinical trials. Missing data are a particular problem for comparative effectiveness trials of substance use disorder interventions. Multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting are 2 widely recommended methods to address missing data bias, and the nonparametric bootstrap is recommended to address uncertainty in predicted mean cost and effectiveness between trial interventions. Although these methods have been studied extensively by themselves, little is known about how to appropriately combine them and about the potential pitfalls and advantages of different approaches. We provide a review of statistical methods used in 29 economic evaluations of substance use disorder intervention identified from 4 published systematic reviews and a targeted search of the literature. We evaluate how each study addressed missing data bias, whether the recommended nonparametric bootstrap was used, how these 2 methods were combined, and conclude with recommendations for future research.

AB  - The teaching-learning process of reading and writing has great relevance in the psycho-emotional and socio-psychological development of school-age children. This is an exercise in which they develop imagination, attention and memory capacity and through this process the management of emotions and sensitivity and capacity of apprehension of reality. The crisis derived from the COVID-19 pandemic transformed reality in an unprecedented way in the recent history of humanity and the educational context was shaken by all these changes. With confinement, the teaching-learning process of reading and writing, which is designed to take place in person, had to be developed in a hybrid or online way, which was a major challenge for teachers and families and, of course, also for children who were in the process of learning. One of the aspects that was blurred in this context was the role of the teacher, which in this case is one of the most important elements, to achieve adequate learning of reading and writing. On one hand, the teacher is in charge of helping to manage the emotions derived from the learning process itself and, on the other hand, he is a key figure so that this is not only technical learning but also contributes to the child's socio-emotional development. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the socio-psychological changes that have occurred in the educational context since the COVID-19 pandemic on the emotions linked to the teaching process, learning of reading and writing through a systematic review of the studies carried out on the subject, in order to provide recommendations for face-to-face learning in the post-COVID-19 era. A systematic review strategy was devised and the literature search was conducted. The search was conducted using ERIC, Dialnet, Scopus, WoS, EBSCO, and Google Scholar databases. This systematic review took place during the month of May 2022. The results show that given the scarce presence of empirical studies on the subject, the objective has only been partially met. However, a systematic review of the studies carried out on the subject. For the identification of recommendations in the development of face-to-face learning in the post-covid era, it has been possible to identify some ideas of interest for future curricular designs in primary school students who are immersed in learning to read and write.

AB  - Purpose The traditional genetic epidemiological studies are necessary to improve accurate risk communication to service users and their families. This scoping review aimed to describe the volume and scope of existing research evidence on family, twin and adoption studies of severe mental disorders (SMDs) in SSA. This is with a view to identifying gaps in the literature and the adequacy of data for a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Literature search was done for all original peer-reviewed research articles on the topic in SSA using PubMed and MEDLINE. Publications included were peer-reviewed original articles, irrespective of their quality, carried out in the region from the 1970s till 9th March, 2022, which were available in English or translated to English. Case reports, abstracts, and studies among populations living outside the region were excluded. Results A total of five studies that met the inclusion criteria across the 46 countries in the region were identified. Of the three thematic areas of focus, only family studies on SMDs had research work in SSA. These studies provided evidence of familial clustering of SMDs in SSA. There were no twin and adoption studies on SMDs in the region. However, the review noted the establishment of two twin registries in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria. A huge gap exists in the area of twin and adoption studies on SMDs in SSA. Conclusion The volume of research evidence on traditional family genetic studies of SMDs is grossly inadequate to consider a systematic review in SSA. We have suggested studies to remedy the situation.

AB  - The protein p53 is the main human tumor suppressor. Since its discovery, extensive research has been conducted, which led to the general assumption that the purview of p53 is also essential for additional functions, apart from the prevention of carcinogenesis. In response to cellular stress and DNA damages, p53 constitutes the key point for the induction of various regulatory processes, determining whether the cell induces cell cycle arrest and DNA repair mechanisms or otherwise cell death. As an implication, aberrations from its normal functioning can lead to pathogeneses. To this day, neurodegenerative diseases are considered difficult to treat, which arises from the fact that in general the underlying pathological mechanisms are not well understood. Current research on brain and retina-related neurodegenerative disorders suggests that p53 plays an essential role in the progression of these conditions as well. In this review, we therefore compare the role and similarities of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), two of the most prevalent neurological diseases, to the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which is among the most common forms of retinal degeneration.

AB  - Thorough investigations have defined underlying disease mechanisms, determining effective cervical dysplasia (CD) treatments. Previous work has assessed the effects of different treatments on women's sexual health. Recently however, several published studies have expanded the scope of findings, revealing the need for an updated examination and integration of knowledge to appropriately contextualize this clinical approach within sexual medicine and women's healthcare. A review of relevant literature was completed. The findings indicate that treatments for CD may be correlated with sexual issues such as decreased interest and sexual functioning, and decreased QoL including psychosocial elements like anxiety. Methodological variations used to investigate different CD treatment outcomes were observed and should be streamlined to facilitate comparison in future studies. There is a need for additional research into alternative non-surgical CD treatments which could mitigate unintended outcomes, and consideration should be given to accessibility of these treatments across different regions in Canada.

AB  - Electromagnetic signals from everyday wireless technologies are an ever-present environmental stressor, affecting biological systems. In this article, we substantiate this statement based on the weight of evidence from papers collated within the ORSAA database (ODEB), focusing on the biological and health effects of electromagnetic fields and radiation. More specifically, the experiments investigating exposures from real-world devices and the epidemiology studies examining the effects of living near mobile phone base stations were extracted from ODEB and the number of papers showing effects was compared with the number showing no effects. The results showed that two-thirds of the experimental and epidemiological papers found significant biological effects. The breadth of biological and health categories where effects have been found was subsequently explored, revealing hundreds of papers showing fundamental biological processes that are impacted, such as protein damage, biochemical changes and oxidative stress. This understanding is targeted toward health professionals and policy makers who have not been exposed to this issue during training. To inform this readership, some of the major biological effect categories and plausible mechanisms of action from the reviewed literature are described. Also presented are a set of best practice guidelines for treating patients affected by electromagnetic exposures and for using technology safely in health care settings. In conclusion, there is an extensive evidence base revealing that significant stress to human biological systems is being imposed by exposure to everyday wireless communication devices and supporting infrastructure. This evidence is compelling enough to warrant an update in medical education and practice.

AB  - Introduction: Intervention programs in sports psychology aid to modify the thoughts and behaviors of athletes in order to improve their performance in sports settings. For high-performance athletes, these interventions are very relevant, given that they constantly face pressure towards obtaining sporting achievements. Methods: This systematic review aims to analyze the scientific articles between 2010 and 2020 that evaluated the effect of psychological interventions on high-performance athletes. In the search procedure, nine studies were selected, the most studied variables were psychological skills, psychological flexibility, and stress. Results: The 44% of the interventions were designed by the research authors themselves, while the remaining 56% were replicated programs, which already had scientific evidence. Discussion: Psychological interventions have a positive impact on sports performance. This review allows sports institutions and professionals to have more knowledge and resources at their disposal to implement these types of programs in their sports planning.

AB  - Background: Facial emotion identification (FEI) deficits are associated with impaired social functioning in persons living with schizophrenia (PLwS), but the research on emotion-specific FEI deficits remains inconclusive. Furthermore, existing studies on FEI deficits are limited by their small sample sizes. We performed a meta-analysis of studies comparing the FEI abilities between Chinese PLwS and healthy controls in terms of the six basic facial emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise), as well as contempt, calmness, and neutral facial expressions. Methods: Major Chinese- and English-language databases were searched to retrieve case-control studies that compared the FEI task performance between Chinese PLwS and healthy controls (HCs) and reported the emotion-specific correct identification scores for PLwS and HCs. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case-control Studies ( "JBI checklist, " hereafter) was used to assess the risk of bias (RoB) of the included studies. Statistical analysis was performed using the "meta " package of R 4.1.2. Results: Twenty-three studies with a total of 28 case-control cohorts and 1,894 PLwS and 1,267 HCs were included. The RoB scores of the included studies ranged from two to seven. PLwS had statistically significantly lower FEI scores than HCs and the corresponding emotion-specific pooled standard mean differences (95% confidence intervals) were -0.69 (-0.88, -0.50) for happiness, -0.88 (-1.12, -0.63) for sadness, -1.44 (-1.83, -1.06) for fear, -1.18 (-1.60, -0.76) for disgust, -0.91 (-1.24, -0.57) for anger, -1.09 (-1.39, -0.78) for surprise, -0.26 (-0.51, -0.01) for contempt, -0.31 (-0.52, -0.09) for calmness, and -0.42 (-0.65, -0.18) for neutral. In the analyses of sources of heterogeneity, drug-naive status, clinical setting, positive and negative psychotic symptoms, and RoB were significant moderators of the magnitudes of FEI deficits. Conclusions: Chinese PLwS have significant FEI impairments in terms of recognizing the six basic facial emotions, contempt, calmness, and neutral emotions, and the magnitude of impairment varies depending on the type of emotion, clinical characteristics, and the level of RoB of the study. It is necessary to consider the characteristics of FEI deficits and the clinical moderators in the FEI deficits to develop remediation strategies targeting FEI deficits in schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Indigenous peoples of Canada, United States, Australia, and New Zealand experience disproportionately high rates of suicide as a result of the collective and shared trauma experienced with colonization and ongoing marginalization. Dominant, Western approaches to suicide prevention-typically involving individual-level efforts for behavioural change via mental health professional intervention-by themselves have largely failed at addressing suicide in Indigenous populations, possibly due to cultural misalignment with Indigenous paradigms. Consequently, many Indigenous communities, organizations and governments have been undertaking more cultural and community-based approaches to suicide prevention. To provide a foundation for future research and inform prevention efforts in this context, this critical scoping review summarizes how Indigenous approaches have been integrated in suicide prevention initiatives targeting Indigenous populations.Methods: A systematic search guided by a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach was conducted in twelve electronic bibliographic databases for academic literature and six databases for grey literature to identify relevant articles. the reference lists of articles that were selected via the search strategy were hand-searched in order to include any further articles that may have been missed. Articles were screened and assessed for eligibility. From eligible articles, data including authors, year of publication, type of publication, objectives of the study, country, target population, type of suicide prevention strategy, description of suicide prevention strategy, and main outcomes of the study were extracted. A thematic analysis approach guided by Metis knowledge and practices was also applied to synthesize and summarize the findings. Results: Fifty-six academic articles and 16 articles from the grey literature were examined. Four overarching and intersecting thematic areas emerged out of analysis of the academic and grey literature: (1) engaging culture and strengthening connectedness; (2) integrating Indigenous knowledge; (3) Indigenous self-determination; and (4) employing decolonial approaches.Conclusions: Findings demonstrate how centering Indigenous knowledge and approaches within suicide prevention positively contribute to suicide-related outcomes. Initiatives built upon comprehensive community engagement processes and which incorporate Indigenous culture, knowledge, and decolonizing methods have been shown to have substantial impact on suicide-related outcomes at the individual-and community-level. Indigenous approaches to suicide prevention are diverse, drawing on local culture, knowledge, need and priorities.

AB  - Introduction: Goal planning is routinely employed in mental health service delivery to identify priorities for treatment and support the achievement and evaluation of outcomes. Previous systematic reviews of the literature have focused on the use of goal planning in a range of physical and cognitive disability settings, but there is a lack of information regarding how goal planning is used in mental healthcare.Aims: This systematic integrative review aimed to understand the types of goals, effectiveness of goal planning, the experience of goal planning and barriers and facilitators to effective goal planning in mental healthcare settings.Methods: Five databases were systematically searched using key terms related to mental health AND goal planning. The search was supplemented through citation chaining. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, a narrative synthesis approach to data analysis was undertaken.Results: Fifty-four studies were identified through the search of the literature following the PRISMA guidelines. Data was systematically extracted and thematically organized. There was a high level of heterogeneity among the studies, originating from a range of countries and with diverse characteristics and focus. Four themes emerged from the data analysis and included: (i) goal planning as a central aspect of interventions; (ii) types of goals planned; (iii) factors that influenced goal planning and/or attainment; and (iv) collaboration and concordance in goal planning.Conclusion: This review found some support for the use of goal planning to improve outcomes in mental healthcare although there was no identified standardized approach to the use of goal planning. Individualized, recovery-oriented and collaborative goal planning was recommended but not always used in practice. Further research to understanding the most appropriate skills and training needed to support collaborative and effective goal planning is needed.

AB  - BackgroundInternational estimates suggest around a third of students arrives at university with symptoms indicative of a common mental disorder, many in late adolescence at a developmentally high-risk period for the emergence of mental disorder. Universities, as settings, represent an opportunity to contribute to the improvement of population mental health. We sought to understand what is known about the management of student mental health, and asked: (1) What proportion of students use mental health services when experiencing psychological distress? (2) Does use by students differ across health service types? MethodsA systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines using a Context, Condition, Population framework (CoCoPop) with a protocol preregistered on Prospero (CRD42021238273). Electronic database searches in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC and CINAHL Plus, key authors were contacted, citation searches were conducted, and the reference list of the WHO World Mental Health International College Student Initiative (WMH-ICS) was searched. Data extraction was performed using a pre-defined framework, and quality appraisal using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool. Data were synthesised narratively and meta-analyses at both the study and estimate level. Results7789 records were identified through the search strategies, with a total of 44 studies meeting inclusion criteria. The majority of included studies from the USA (n = 36), with remaining studies from Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Ethiopia and Italy. Overall, studies contained 123 estimates of mental health service use associated with a heterogeneous range of services, taking highly variable numbers of students across a variety of settings. Discussion This is the first systematic quantitative survey of student mental health service use. The empirical literature to date is very limited in terms of a small number of international studies outside of the USA; studies of how services link together, and of student access. The significant variation we found in the proportions of students using services within and between studies across different settings and populations suggests the current services described in the literature are not meeting the needs of all students.

AB  - Posttraumatic growth (PTG) is consistently reported to be associated with social support among people with breast cancer. But so far there is no consensus on the size and direction to which social support are related to PTG in people with breast cancer. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed by us to quantitatively synthesize the previous results. This meta-analysis followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, Chongqing VIP Information Co., Ltd. (VIP), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WANFANG DATA databases prior to 1 June 2022. A random effects model of Stata software (version 17.0) was employed to compute the pooled association coefficient and examine a series of moderating factors: economic level, publication type, region, year of publication, participants' age, and social support measurement tools. Ultimately, 31 studies including 6,380 breast cancer patients were identified. This meta-analysis offers evidence of a highly positive correlation between PTG and social support among people with breast cancer (r = 0.425). Economic level, region, and social support measurement tools moderated the link between PTG and social support among people with breast cancer. Whether variables such as disease stage, time since diagnosis, and disease treatment moderate the link between PTG and social support among people with breast cancer can be further investigated in the future.

AB  - Although research that documents minority stress caused to LGBTQ + people supports needed advocacy, it can concomi-tantly cause harm to communities by portraying them as depleted and powerless. This review article assesses if and how researchers who study minority stress also center inter-personal functions of gender expression that are agentic for trans/nonbinary (TNB) people. These functions were coded in the qualitative research related to minority stress for TNB people over the last five years. Findings revealed that while most interpersonal functions of gender were described rarely, especially those associated with TNB communities of color, damage-centered perspectives were common. Damage -centered perspectives were common. We charge the field to expand its scope of inquiry, center functionalist and agency -focused research, and to develop a multidimensional psy-chology of gender.

AB  - IntroductionPoor sleep quality has been suggested as a risk factor of frailty. However, previous studies that evaluated the association between insomnia and frailty in older population showed inconsistent results. We performed a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the association. MethodsObservational studies related to the aim of the meta-analysis were identified by search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. A random-effect model incorporating the potential between-study heterogeneity was used to pool the results. ResultsTwelve studies including 16,895 old people contributed to the meta-analysis. Pooled results suggested a significant association between insomnia and frailty in the older population (odds ratio [OR]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52-2.41, p < .001; I-2 = 80%). Subgroup analyses showed consistent association between different symptoms of insomnia and frailty, including difficulty in falling asleep (OR: 1.45), difficulty in maintaining sleep (OR: 1.23), early morning awakening (OR: 1.21), and non-restorative sleep (OR: 1.84, p for subgroup difference = .15). Results were also consistent for subgroup analyses according to the study country, sample size, cutoffs of age for defining the older population, proportions of men, diagnostic criteria for frailty, adjustment of depression, and scores of study quality (p for subgroup difference all > .05). However, a stronger association was observed for insomnia detected with the Athens Insomnia Scale (OR: 2.92) than that with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (OR: 1.30) or self-reporting (OR: 1.60, p for subgroup difference = .002). ConclusionInsomnia is independently associated with frailty in the older population.

MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, SPORTDiscus, PubMed, EMBASE, and ERIC were searched in June 2020. Included studies needed to 1) quantitatively analyze the association of 2 or more movement behaviors with an outcome, 2) analyze a population between 5 and 17 years of age, and 3) include at least an English abstract. We included 141 studies. Most studies included the combination of physical activity and sedentary behavior in their analyses. Sleep was studied less frequently. In combination, a high level of physical activity and a low level of sedentary behavior were associated with the best physical health, psychological health, and education-related outcomes. Sleep was often included in the combination that was associated with the most favorable outcomes. Sedentary behavior had a stronger influence in adolescents than in children and tended to be associated more negatively with outcomes when it was defined as screen time than when defined as overall time spent being sedentary. More initiatives and guidelines combining all 3 movement behaviors will provide benefit with regard to adiposity, cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular physical fitness, well-being, health-related quality of life, mental health, academic performance, and cognitive/executive function.

AB  - Science denial has adverse consequences at individual and societal levels and even for the future of our planet. The present article aimed to answer the question: What leads people to deny even the strongest evidence and distrust the scientific method? The article provides a narrative review of research on the underpinnings of science denial, with the main focus on climate change denial. Perspectives that are commonly studied separately are integrated. We review key findings on the roles of disinformation and basic cognitive processes, motivated reasoning (focusing on ideology and populism), and emotion regulation in potentially shaping (or not shaping) views on science and scientific topics. We also include research on youth, a group in an important transition phase in life that is the future decision-makers but less commonly focused on in the research field. In sum, we describe how the manifestations of denial can stem from cognitive biases, motivating efforts to find seemingly rational support for desirable conclusions, or attempts to regulate emotions when feeling threatened or powerless. To foster future research agendas and mindful applications of the results, we identify some research gaps (most importantly related to cross-cultural considerations) and examine the unique features or science denial as an object of psychological research. Based on the review, we make recommendations on measurement, science communication, and education.

AB  - Background: Stroke is a highly incapacitating disease that can lead to disabilities due to cognitive impairment, physical, emotional, and social sequelae, and a decrease in the quality of life of those affected. Moreover, it has been suggested that cognitive reserve (patients' higher levels of education or having a skilled occupation), for instance, can promote faster cognitive recovery after a stroke. For this reason, this review aims to identify the cognitive, functional, and behavioral effects of computerized rehabilitation in patients aged 50 years or older who had a stroke, considering cognitive reserve proxies. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-PRISMA, and performed the search for peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials without a date restriction on CINAHL, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were chosen. Results: We screened 780 papers and found 19 intervention studies, but only 4 met the inclusion criteria and shared data. These studies included computerized tools for motor and cognitive rehabilitation in the experimental groups. In all studies, computerized training was combined with other interventions, such as standard therapy, occupational therapy, and aerobic exercises. There were 104 participants affected by ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, predominantly male (57.69%), and all with cognitive impairment. Conclusion: Despite a limited number of studies, varied methods and insufficient information available, schooling as a CR proxy combined with high-intensity computerized cognitive training was key to mediating cognitive improvement. The systematic review also identified that the associated ischemic stroke and shorter time of onset for rehabilitation contribute to the cognitive evolution of patients. Findings do not support a greater benefit of computerized cognitive training compared to conventional cognitive therapies.

AB  - The article examines the effect of cooking food in kitchens on the health of women, as women and children are at a greater risk to indoor air pollution (IAP). It is important to study the cooking practices and prevalent behaviours among African women to understand the magnitude of the danger they face. The study suggests that a decline in the combustion of solid fuels and the use of clean energy can improve health among women and children, as well as sustainability goals. Proverbs 17:22 says, `A joyful heart is the health of the body, but a depressed spirit dries up the bones'. Bible verse Numbers 35:33-34 indicates, `You shall not pollute the land in which you live'. The cooking fuel analysis framework among rural women in Africa will guide forward the governments' sustainability policies for communities to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being of women and children.
   Contribution: The article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the literature on African cooking practices. A combined search string is made with keywords. Thematic content analysis is conducted with NVivo (produced by QSR International). The article covers two themes, namely improved well-being and suggesting policies to combat climate change and its impacts. Policies and schemes at grassroots levels and better economic conditions in African countries can help to overcome challenges and change health-damaging cooking behaviours. The new advanced sustainability analysis framework has the potential to influence modern kitchen fuels and increase the adoption of new technologies in African villages.

AB  - The human brain has high energetic expenses and consumes over 20% of total oxygen metabolism. Abnormal brain energy homeostasis leads to various brain diseases. Among multiple factors that contribute to these diseases, mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most common causes. Maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and functionality is of pivotal importance to brain energy generation. Mitochondrial quality control (MQC), employing the coordination of multiple mechanisms, is evolved to overcome many mitochondrial defects. Thus, not surprisingly, aberrant mitochondrial quality control results in a wide range of brain disorders. Targeting MQC to preserve and restore mitochondrial function has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of brain diseases. Here, we set out to summarize the current understanding of mitochondrial quality control in brain homeostasis. We also evaluate potential pharmaceutically and clinically relevant targets in MQC-associated brain disorders.

AB  - Introduction: Safety measures implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic have had a profound impact on the mobility of people worldwide We synthesized the global evidence on physical activity (PA) participation before and during the pandemic.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, Embase, WHO Global literature on coronavirus disease (between January 2020 and April 2022), and reference lists. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted to quantitatively synthesize the data.
   Results and discussion: Sixty-three primary studies were included. In children, the global pooled prevalence of PA was 46.4% before the pandemic, 40.6% during the pandemic before movement restriction (MR), and 19.5% during MR. A statistically significant decrease in prevalence was observed between the period before the pandemic and the period during which MR was implemented (p < 0.001). In adults, the global pooled prevalence (both sexes) decreased between the periods before the pandemic (64.7%) and during MR (57.0%). During the period of COVID-19 MR, children had significantly lower odds to meet the WHO PA recommendation than adults (19.5%, 95%CI: 15.8-23.8% vs. 57.0%, 95%CI: 43.3-62.5%; OR = 0.21; p <= 0.001). Patient populations were less active than the general population, and their PA levels decreased during the pandemic. Mental and physical health benefits of PA have been well-demonstrated. Prioritizing PA in health campaigns and strategies is critical to address health issues exacerbated during this pandemic.

AB  - This study involved a systematic and evaluative review of school climate measures to catalog main domains and subdomains and rate parameters of instrument presentation and psychometric quality. Four databases were used (Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, and PsycINFO) and 37 instruments (studies) met inclusion criteria (instrument measured school climate; psychometric properties of the instrument were provided; every instrument included in the review has its original version published; the article was in English or Spanish; the article was a peer-reviewed publication). Information was synthesized according to instrument presentation and psychometric quality. The expansion of literature search routes was designed to mitigate publication bias. Analysis revealed four main domains among extant school climate measures: relationships (social relationships, school connectedness, leadership, and culture), environment (school facilities, physical comfort, and cleanliness), safety/discipline (school safety, fairness of rules, bullying and aggression, disciplinary harshness, and general drug use), and academic (academic outcomes, equality of opportunity, engagement, and cohesiveness/competitiveness). This domain/subdomain architecture could serve as a touchstone for conceptualizing school climate and developing and refining future assessment devices for this construct. The domain/subdomain architecture could also help guide school reform efforts. Limitations included possible publication bias and an exclusive focus on questionnaires and not other methods to assess school climate.

KW  - social value
AB  - BackgroundThere is a growing recognition of the need to effectively assess the social value of public health interventions through a wider, comprehensive approach, capturing their social, economic and environmental benefits, outcomes and impacts. Social Return on Investment (SROI) is a methodological approach which incorporates all three aspects for evaluating interventions. Mental health problems are one of the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. This study aims to map existing evidence on the social value of mental health interventions that uses the SROI methodology. MethodsA scoping evidence search was conducted on Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar and relevant gray literature, published in English between January 2000 and March 2021 to identify studies which capture the SROI of mental health interventions in high- and middle-income countries. Studies that reported mental health outcomes and an SROI ratio were included in this review. The quality of included studies was assessed using Krlev's 12-item quality assessment framework. ResultsThe search identified a total of 435 records; and 42 of them with varying quality met the study inclusion criteria. Most of the included studies (93%) were non-peer reviewed publicly available reports, predominantly conducted in the United Kingdom (88%); and majority (60%) of those studies were funded by charity/non-for-profit organizations. Out of 42 included studies, 22 were targeted toward individuals experiencing mental health problems and the remainder 20 were targeted to vulnerable groups or the general population to prevent, or reduce the risk of poor mental health. Eighty-one percent of included studies were graded as high quality studies based on Krlev's 12-item quality assessment framework. The reported SROI ratios of the included studies ranged from 0.79 pound to 28.00 pound for every pound invested. ConclusionThis scoping review is a first of its kind to focus on SROI of mental health interventions, finding a good number of SROI studies that show a positive return on investment of the identified interventions. This review illustrates that SROI could be a useful tool and source of evidence to help inform policy and funding decisions for investment in mental health and wellbeing, as it accounts for the wider social, economic and environmental benefits of public health interventions. More SROI research in the area of public health is needed to expand the evidence base and develop further the methodology.

AimAssess the role of robot mediated intervention (RMI) role in the rehabilitation of ASD individuals by responding to five research questions in the area of (1) Technology maturity; (2) Skill improvement areas; (3) Research design including participant's demographics, datasets, intervention details, and evaluation tools; (4) Data gathering, analysis, and technology contribution, and (5) Role of Robots in intervention and its effectiveness. MethodsScoping review included RMI studies for ASD individuals published in PUBMED, SCOPUS, and IEEE-Xplore databases between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2020. The publications were evaluated utilizing the PRISMA scoping review criteria (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP). ResultsThe 59 selected publications demonstrated that RMI improved skills for ASD individuals in 12 areas. During RMI, extensive joint attention stimuli were given to ASD individuals, and the therapy promoted ASD children's eye contact, imitation, socio-communication, and academic skills. However, various ethical, privacy, and safety concerns were reported in the review. ConclusionRMI can improve access, quality, and affordability in ASD intervention. The acceptance and use of technology can be fast-tracked by (1) incorporating statistically valid study designs; (2) carrying out field trials including diverse participant groups; (3) standardizing datasets with quality parameters; (4) recruiting statistically appropriate participant groups from ASD, Neuro Typical (NT) and diverse developmental disorder population; and (5) and addressing ethical, privacy, safety, trust, and other stakeholder concerns.

AB  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a diffuse network that regulates physiological systems to maintain body homeostasis by integrating inputs from the internal and external environment, including the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems (ENS). Recent evidence suggests that ANS is one of the key neural pathways for acupuncture signal transduction, which has attracted worldwide attention in the acupuncture field. Here, we reviewed the basic and clinical research published in PubMed over the past 20 years on the effects of acupuncture on ANS regulation and homeostasis maintenance. It was found that acupuncture effectively alleviates ANS dysfunction-associated symptoms in its indications, such as migraine, depression, insomnia, functional dyspepsia, functional constipation. Acupuncture stimulation on some specific acupoints activates sensory nerve fibers, the spinal cord, and the brain. Using information integration and efferents from a complex network of autonomic nuclei of the brain, such as the insular cortex (IC), prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala (AMG), hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray (PAG), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), ventrolateral medulla (VLM), nucleus ambiguus (AMB), acupuncture alleviates visceral dysfunction, inflammation via efferent autonomic nerves, and relieves pain and pain affect. The modulating pattern of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves is associated with acupuncture stimulation on specific acupoints, intervention parameters, and disease models, and the relationships among them require further exploration. In conclusion, ANS is one of the therapeutic targets for acupuncture and mediates acupuncture's actions, which restores homeostasis. A systemic study is needed to determine the rules and mechanisms underlying the effects of acupoint stimulation on corresponding organs mediated by specific central nervous networks and the efferent ANS.

AB  - LAY SUMMARYInternational marching events, such as the Nijmegen Marches, have a prominent place in Canadian military history, and participation continues today. In the Dutch military, the load carriage requirements previously differed by sex, with men carrying 10 kilograms during the march and women carrying no weight. The Canadian delegation requires both male and female participants to carry 10 kilograms. This article examines the effect of this policy on possible injuriesusing a Gender-based Analysis Plus lens. Weight carriage should focus on anthropometric factors, not sex, which will allow for appropriate and equal increased stresses (weight) for march participants while minimizing injuries.
   Introduction: The Nijmegen Marches are an annual event in which military participants complete four consecutive days of 40-kilometre marches. Load carriage requirements differ among nations. The objective of this review is to apply a Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to injury prevention and consider the appropriateness of sex-based load carriage requirements. Methods: Two independent literature searches were undertaken using the MEDLINE database. A title and abstract screening review was conducted of articles reporting on gait biomechanics or injury risk related to load carriage that were published in English in the past 30 years. Thirteen articles were included in the review. Results: Four studies looked at sex-specific biomechanical adaptations to load carriage, with two reporting no significant differences and two reporting differences that may increase the risk of hip or knee injuries among women. Individuals who marched with a stride length longer than their natural or preferred length had more range of motion in their lower extremities and greater impact force; thus, they may be at a higher risk of injury. Weight carried was also identified as a risk factor, but the literature suggests that both sexes respond similarly to increased load as a proportion of body mass. Discussion: On the basis of the literature reviewed, no evidence-based recommendations can be made for sex-specific load carriage requirements in endurance marching. The published literature suggests that event standards for load carriage based on individual characteristics such as body weight or height may be more effective for injury prevention.

AB  - Background: Various studies have shown that about 40-50% of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are undiagnosed at the time of referral and are often treated as depression. The present meta-analysis was conducted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of psychometric properties of the bipolarity index (BI) in people with BD.Methods: We systematically searched databases including, Scopus, ISI Web of Sciences (WOS), Pubmed/Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO using standard search terms.Results: Two hundred and ninety-six records were found through the initial search. Of 679 articles, 25 duplicated studies were found and 70 were omitted due to the irrelevant titles and abstracts. The rest 450 were entered the full-text screening, of which 186 were excluded due to pre-defined inclusion criteria. Ultimately, 15 studies on 6525 patients were included. Our findings showed that the pooled sensitivity of BI in the diagnosis of BD was 0.82 (95%CI: 0.81-0.83, P < 0.0001, I-2 = 99%), while the pooled specificity also was 0.73 (95%CI: 0.72-0.74, P = 0.000, I-2 = 99%). The BI was significantly more accurate than the other tests with a pooled DOR of 47.2 (95%CI: 12.01-85.52, P = 0.0000, I-2 = 99.2%).Conclusion: BI appears to be a useful screening instrument with suitable psychometric properties to identify BD compared to both the MDQ and the HCL-32. Consequently, patients detected by the BI should be confirmed through diagnostic interviews. Thus, more studies are needed to explore the optimal cut-off values of BI among screened populations during long-term follow-up, since a considerable portion of individuals primarily diagnosed with major depressive disorders could have BD.

AB  - Introduction: Many university students have poor mental health, and cooccurring health risk behaviors. Targeting health behavior change in this population may improve mental health outcomes. This scoping review describes the extent and range of randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating interventions targeting health risk behaviors and measuring a mental health outcome, among university students. Methods: Six electronic databases were searched for RCTs published until the 18th May 2021. Eligible RCTs included university students, evaluated interventions that promoted health behavior change (i.e., dietary intake, physical activity, sedentary behavior, alcohol and drug use, smoking, and sleep), and measured a mental health-related outcome. Results: Fifty-nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria that were published from 2000 to 2021, and over half (n = 33) were conducted in the United States. Interventions evaluated within the RCTs (n = 92) predominantly targeted changes to dietary intake (n = 41 interventions), physical activity (n = 39), or alcohol intake (n = 35). Most interventions targeted one (n = 51) or two (n = 27) health behaviors only. Included RCTs considered mental ill health outcomes (n = 24), psychological wellbeing outcomes (n = 20), or both (n = 15). Discussion: This scoping review identified a moderate volume of experimental research investigating the impact of health behavior interventions on university students' mental health. There is scope for further research examining health behavior interventions targeting university students, particularly interventions taking a multi-behavioral approach.

AB  - The ever-present interest in loneliness has increased during the last decade. Although loneliness is generally not as prevalent as other topics and not among the top 5 most read papers in the journal Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being, it is closely connected to topics therein, such as well-being and health. Conceptualizing loneliness as indicator of risk, it may function as a cue for action. Accordingly, understanding loneliness, its development, prevalence, effects, and how to support individuals to prevent or overcome loneliness is key and the main aim of this special issue. Therefore, theories and models are reviewed in this paper and synthesized together with other aspects relating to the field of loneliness research and intervention. Accordingly, we propose an agenda including key determinants (e.g., risk groups), how to proceed (various research methods), intervention components (e.g., behavior change techniques, SDGs), and how to perform dissemination (open science practices, co-creative approaches, etc.). The original studies in this special issue provide stimulating examples. Moreover, the commentaries give new insights and inspiring ideas. Overall, this special issue aims to give readers a lens with which to re-examine their own research, enable innovation, and empower addressing loneliness and its interconnection synergistically.

AB  - Background: In recent years, there has been a global trend toward an increase in life expectancy and the proportion of elderly people among the population. In this regard, it becomes important to promote active and healthy aging. Physical inactivity and social isolation are both risk factors of many chronic illnesses and highly prevalent in older adults. This challenges communities to develop interventions that reduce these risk factors among elderly populations. The main aims of this study were to summarize community-based interventions that aim to simultaneously promote social participation and physical activity in older adults and to examine their effects. Methods: We performed a systematic review based on the PRISMA standards. Literature searches were conducted in six scientific databases in July 2021. Articles were included if they had an interventional design, focused on older adults living in the community and measured social participation and physical activity as an outcome. The data were summarized narratively due to the heterogeneity of studies and the variety of outcome measures. Results: Overall, 46 articles published in English were included. The studies were grouped in (1) interventions with main focus on physical activity promotion; (2) social activities that included a physical activity component; (3) health behavior interventions/ health education interventions; (4) multicomponent interventions; (5) environmental interventions. The majority of the reviewed studies reported positive effects of interventions on physical activity and/or social participation. No study reported negative effects. Analysis of quantitative studies showed that multicomponent interventions have great positive effects on both outcomes. In qualitative studies positive effects were found regardless of intervention type. Conclusion: This review summarizes the evidence about the effects of community-based interventions that aim to promote social participation and physical activity in older adults. Multicomponent interventions seem to be most suitable for simultaneous promotion of physical activity and social participation. However, high variability in measurement methods used to assess both social participation and physical activity in the included studies made it difficult to compare studies and to indicate the most effective.

AB  - Background: In February 2021, over one hundred scientists and policy experts participated in a web-based Workshop to discuss the ways that divergent evaluations of evidence and scientific uncertainties are used to delay timely protection of human health and the environment from exposures to hazardous agents. The Workshop arose from a previous workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on 'Late Lessons from Early Warnings' (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those agents. Results: Workshop participants used recent case studies including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency - Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations, which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public's health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence of financial conflicts of interest. Conclusion: The recommendations should enhance the production of "actionable evidence, " that is, reliable evaluations of the scientific evidence to support timely actions to protect health and environments from exposures to hazardous agents. The recommendations are applicable to policy and regulatory settings at the local, state, federal and international levels.

AB  - ContextCosts related to criminal justice are an important component of the economic burden of injuries; such costs could include police involvement, judicial and corrections costs, among others. If the literature has sufficient information on the criminal justice costs related to injury, it could be added to existing estimates of the economic burden of injury. ObjectiveTo examine research on injury-related criminal justice costs, and what extent cost information is available by type of injury. Data sourcesMedline, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts ProQuest, EconLit and National Criminal Justice Reference Service were searched from 1998 to 2021. Data extractionPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses was followed for data reporting. ResultsOverall, 29 studies reported criminal justice costs and the costs of crime vary considerably. ConclusionsThis study illustrates possible touchpoints for cost inputs and outputs in the criminal justice pathway, providing a useful conceptualisation for better estimating criminal justice costs of injury in the future. However, better understanding of all criminal justice costs for injury-related crimes may provide justification for prevention efforts and potentially for groups who are disproportionately affected. Future research may focus on criminal justice cost estimates from injuries by demographics to better understand the impact these costs have on particular populations.

AB  - Fisheries management involves a broad and complex set of tasks that are necessary to prevent overfishing and to help the recovery of overfished stock. Monitoring fishing activities based on two main sources, landings data and scientific surveys, is a challenging task. Fisheries collection data is often limited, which compromises the accuracy of the results obtained. Therefore, several emerging applications of molecular methods have the potential to provide unique understanding of ecological processes in marine environments and to build stronger empirical underpinnings for the Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a complex mixture of genetic material shed by those organisms that inhabit a given environment, whereby DNA is extracted from an environmental sample without accessing the target organism. eDNA studies can be categorized into two main approaches, i) eDNA metabarcoding or semi-targeted (community) approaches and ii) species-specific or targeted approaches (single). Although both categories are often discussed, they differ drastically in their methodology, interpretations and accuracy. Both approaches involve a series of steps that include eDNA capture, preservation, extraction and amplification. This detection will depend on the affinity to the targeted taxa sequences and completeness and accuracy of DNA reference collection databases. The eDNA method applied in marine environments are probably the most challenging aquatic environments for applying this technique. This is because of the extreme relationship between water-volume to biomass, dynamics and the physical and chemical properties of seawater that affect dispersion, dilution and preservation. Here, we review the present application of this novel method in fishery assessment in marine environments. To date, many studies suggest that this method offers the potential to revolutionize fisheries monitoring, which will contribute to improving the range of tasks involved in fisheries management. The compelling conclusion is that the methodological steps including in eDNA surveys should be standardized and that research efforts should focus on developing appropriately validated tests to address environmental and sampling factors that may affect eDNA detection in marine environments in order to draw reliable conclusions. This bioassessment tool can assist fisheries professionals in achieve their research, management, and conservation objectives, but not as a replacement for time-proven assessment methods.

AB  - Background: Dementia is a chronic and progressive illness characterized by severe impairment and high dependencies. Under the influence of Chinese traditional culture, 80% of patients with dementia are watched over at home by family caregivers as primary caregivers. However, long-term care brings formidable burdens to them and reduces the quality of their life. It is necessary to find out the influencing factors of caregivers' burden. Methods: A scoping search was conducted on eight electronic databases from 1 January 2010 to 14 June 2022: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China VIP Database, China Biomedical Literature Database, and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform. Research articles included in this review discussed the factors affecting Chinese dementia family caregivers' care burden or stress, and the level of care burden was evaluated by a standardized care burden scale. Results: A total of 1,888 related articles were found and 23 cross-sectional studies were eventually included. After quality assessment, 12 were of good quality and 11 were of fair quality. A total of 32 factors were identified that were associated with caregiver burden, and the results were grouped into three categories: patient, caregiver, and society. The severity of disease, poor self-care ability, neuropsychiatric symptoms, care time, number of helpers, poor health status, economic stress, poor psychological status, social support, and age were reported in many previous studies. Conclusion: In this review, the factors that affect the caregiver burden for people with dementia were clarified. By identifying these factors, hospitals, decision-makers, and communities can carry out special projects for these populations, provide appropriate assistance, or design corresponding intervention measures to reduce the caregiver burden and improve the quality of care for patients with dementia.

AB  - Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by progressive calcium deposition bilaterally in the brain, accompanied by various symptoms, such as dystonia, ataxia, parkinsonism, dementia, depression, headaches, and epilepsy. Currently, the etiology of PFBC is largely unknown, and no specific prevention or treatment is available. During the past 10 years, six causative genes (SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1, MYORG, and JAM2) have been identified in PFBC. In this review, considering mechanistic studies of these genes at the cellular level and in animals, we summarize the pathogenesis and potential preventive and therapeutic strategies for PFBC patients. Our systematic analysis suggests a classification for PFBC genetic etiology based on several characteristics, provides a summary of the known composition of brain calcification, and identifies some potential therapeutic targets for PFBC.

AB  - Background: In recent years, a significant proportion of inpatient facilities for people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism has been de-commissioned in England, This has resulted in individuals with intellectual disabilities being sent to distant hospitals far away from their families and carers leading to challenges in follow-up, community care and interventions. The impact of de-institutionalisation, has often caused patient trauma, family distress and subsequent discharge difficulties. Not every individual with intellectual disabilities and/or autism requires inpatient care but inpatient care when needed has to be local, adequate and appropriate. Aims: To evaluate current evidence of utility of inpatient models for people with intellectual disabilities and outline best clinical practice. Method: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science were searched with key search terms. The search was conducted by the information specialist and identified abstracts screened further for inclusion criteria, methodological issues, and other appropriate characteristics. Twenty-three papers were included in the rapid review. Papers shortlisted had the inclusion criteria applied against the full text version independently by two reviewers. Disagreements regarding eligibility of studies was resolved by discussion and consensus within the project team. Key data related to in-patient models of care was extracted from the included papers, which included year of study, design, study objectives, target population, method/s tested, outcomes reported, country of study/studies, and results. Data extraction was performed by two reviewers and reviewed by the project team. Results: From the review of services for people with intellectual disabilities, we came across four broad models/frameworks/approaches. Evidence on what worked for inpatient service provision tended to be based on models developed and implemented locally. Conclusions: We make recommendations for the best clinical practice and standards. Both clinical service providers and policymakers need to be aware of specific needs of individuals with intellectual disability and/or autism.

AB  - Lay Summary Chronic insomnia is a common sleep disorder and can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Previous research has consistently shown that CBT-I can reduce sleep difficulties such as difficulty falling and maintaining sleep. The effects of CBT-I on increasing sleep duration are less consistent across studies. This meta-analysis reviewed 43 randomized controlled trials of CBT-I published between 01/01/2004 and 05/30/2021 and synthesized the findings of the effects of CBT-I on sleep duration, measured subjectively and objectively. We found that CBT-I increased sleep duration measured by sleep diaries and polysomnography by about 30 min at post-treatment. This effect is weaker in people with older ages. Contrarily, CBT-I is found to lead to a decrease in sleep duration for about 30 min when sleep duration is measured by actigraphy. The discrepant findings between different sleep measurements reinforce the notion that different measures of sleep assess different aspects of sleep, and that different sleep measurements may have different responsiveness to the treatment of insomnia. Additionally, most people do not achieve the recommended sleep duration at the end of CBT-I. Future studies are needed to evaluate interventions that can help individuals with insomnia increase and maintain optimal sleep duration.
   Background Accumulating evidence suggests that sleep duration is a critical determinant of physical and mental health. Half of the individuals with chronic insomnia report less than optimal sleep duration. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective treatment for reducing sleep difficulties in individuals with chronic insomnia. However, its effectiveness for increasing sleep duration is less well-established and a synthesis of these findings is lacking. Purpose To provide a synthesis of findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of CBT-I on subjective and objective total sleep time (TST). Methods A systematic search was performed on articles published from 2004 to 05/30/2021. A total of 43 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Publication biases were examined. Meta-regressions were conducted to examine if any sample or treatment characteristics moderated the effect sizes across trials. Results We found a small average effect of CBT-I on diary-assessed TST at post-treatment, equivalent to an approximately 30-min increase. Age significantly moderated the effects of CBT-I on diary-measured and polysomnography-measured TST; older ages were associated with smaller effect sizes. Contrarily, a negative, medium effect size was found for actigraphy-assessed TST, equivalent to an approximately 30-min decrease. Publication biases were found for diary data at follow-up assessments suggesting that positive findings were favored. Conclusions CBT-I resulted in improvements in TST measured by sleep diaries and polysomnography (in adults). These improvements were not corroborated by actigraphy findings. Theoretical and clinical implications were discussed.

AB  - Purpose People released from incarceration are at increased risk of suicide compared to the general population. We aimed to synthesise evidence on the incidence of and sex differences in suicide, suicidal ideation, and self-harm after release from incarceration. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and PubMed between 1 January 1970 and 14 October 2021 for suicide, suicidal ideation, and self-harm after release from incarceration (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020208885). We calculated pooled crude mortality rates (CMRs) and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicide, overall and by sex, using random-effects models. We calculated a pooled incidence rate ratio (IRR) comparing rates of suicide by sex. Results Twenty-nine studies were included. The pooled suicide CMR per 100,000 person years was 114.5 (95%CI 97.0, 132.0, I-2 = 99.2%) for non-sex stratified samples, 139.5 (95% CI 91.3, 187.8, I-2 = 88.6%) for women, and 121.8 (95% CI 82.4, 161.2, I-2 = 99.1%) for men. The suicide SMR was 7.4 (95% CI 5.4, 9.4, I-2 = 98.3%) for non-sex stratified samples, 14.9 for women (95% CI 6.7, 23.1, I-2 = 88.3%), and 4.6 for men (95% CI 1.3, 7.8, I-2 = 98.8%). The pooled suicide IRR comparing women to men was 1.1 (95% CI 0.9, 1.4, I-2 = 82.2%). No studies reporting self-harm or suicidal ideation after incarceration reported sex differences. Conclusion People released from incarceration are greater than seven times more likely to die by suicide than the general population. The rate of suicide is higher after release than during incarceration, with the elevation in suicide risk (compared with the general population) three times higher for women than for men. Greater effort to prevent suicide after incarceration, particularly among women, is urgently needed.

AB  - Movies offer viewers a broad range of emotional experiences, providing entertainment, and meaning. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we reviewed the literature on digital systems designed to help users search and browse movie libraries and offer recommendations based on emotional content. Our search yielded 83 eligible documents (published between 2000 and 2021). We identified 22 case studies, 34 empirical studies, 26 proof of concept, and one theoretical paper. User transactions (e.g., ratings, tags) were the preferred source of information. The documents examined approached emotions from both a categorical (n=35) and dimensional (n=18) perspectives, and nine documents offer a combination of both approaches. Although there are several authors mentioned, the references used are frequently dated, and 12 documents do not mention author or model used. We identified 61 words related to emotion or affect. Documents presented on average 1.36 positive terms and 2.64 negative terms. Sentiment analysis (n=31) is frequently used for emotion identification, followed by subjective evaluations (n=15), movie low-level audio and visual features (n = 11), and face recognition technologies (n=8). We discuss limitations and offer a brief review of current emotion models and research.

AB  - BackgroundIn most countries, men complete suicide at twice the rate of women; masculinity plays an important role in placing men at a greater risk of suicide. This study identifies and describes trends in the topics discussed within the masculinity and suicide literature and explores changes over time.MethodsWe retrieved publications relating to masculinity and suicide from eight electronic databases and described origins in the field of research by reference to the first decade of publications. We then explored the subsequent evolution of the field by analysis of the content of article titles/abstracts for all years since the topic first emerged, and then separately by three epochs.ResultsWe included 452 publications (1954-2021); research output has grown substantially in the last five years. Early publications framed suicide in the context of severe mental illness, masculinity as a risk factor, and suicidality as being aggressive and masculine. We observed some differences in themes over time: Epoch 1 focused on sex differences in suicidality, a common theme in epochs 2 was relationship to work and its effect on men's mental health and suicidality, and epoch 3 had a focus on help-seeking in suicidality.ConclusionThe research field of masculinity and suicide is growing strongly, as evidenced by recent increase in publication volume. The structure, content and direction of the masculinity and suicide research are still evolving. Researchers must work with policymakers and practitioners to ensure that emerging findings are translated for use in programs designed to address suicide in boys and men.

AB  - There is a great heterogeneity in the conceptualization and operationalization of social capital in empirical research targeting adolescents. There has not yet been an attempt to systematically map and psychometrically evaluate the existing instruments for measuring social capital that have been developed and validated for adolescent samples. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate the design and psychometric properties of self-reported instruments for social capital, specifically developed and validated for use among adolescents. The design of this study was a systematic review guided by the COSMIN methodology for systematic reviews of Patient Reported Outcome Measures. The search included six electronic databases and no time frame was applied. Twenty studies were identified as describing the development and validation of a social capital instrument for adolescent samples. The results reveal common denominators, but also great variation in the design and validation of the instruments. Adolescents were only involved in the development procedures of four instruments. There is a lack of social capital instruments that cover both the multidimensionality of social capital and contextual relevance in relation to adolescents. Careful examination of instruments should thus precede a decision when designing studies and further instrument development involving the target group is encouraged.

AB  - Simple Summary The biology of cellular senescence has broad implications for the fields of aging, tissue and wound repair, tumor biology, and development. Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest, which is induced by internal and external stress mechanisms. Senescent cell populations are diverse and display transcriptomic and biomolecular variability, making it difficult to find a sole specific biomarker from defining this state. Although this cell fate is involved in cutaneous wound healing and tissue repair, there is still a substantial gap in understanding how senescent cells modulate regenerative processes. Addressing remaining key questions in the field may guide clinical care and management of both acute and chronic wounds and the development of novel therapeutic agents. Cellular senescence has gained increasing attention in the field of aging research. Senescent cells have been implicated in biological aging processes, tumorigenesis, development, and wound repair amongst other processes and pathologies. Recent findings reveal that senescent cells can both promote and inhibit cutaneous wound healing processes. Relating senescent cells in acute and chronic wounds will help to clarify their role in wound healing processes and inform our understanding of senescent cell heterogeneity. To clarify this apparent contradiction and guide future research and therapeutic development, we will review the rapidly growing field of cellular senescence and its role in wound healing biology.

This systematic review analyzed the impact of heatwaves on mortality, morbidity, and the associated vulnerability factors, focusing on the sensitivity component. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 flow checklist. Four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, PubMed) were searched for articles published from 2012 to 2022. Those eligible were evaluated using the Navigation Guide Systematic Review framework. Results: A total of 32 articles were included in the systematic review. Heatwave events increased mortality and morbidity incidence. Sociodemographic (elderly, children, male, female, low socioeconomic, low education), medical conditions (cardiopulmonary diseases, renal disease, diabetes, mental disease), and rural areas were crucial vulnerability factors. Conclusions: While mortality and morbidity are critical aspects for measuring the impact of heatwaves on human health, the sensitivity in the context of sociodemographic, medical conditions, and locality posed a higher vulnerability to certain groups. Therefore, further research on climate change and health impacts on vulnerability may help stakeholders strategize effective plans to reduce the effect of heatwaves.

The paper provides some discussion of human needs and water conservation issues related to freshwater systems: (1) introduction and background; (2) water basics and natural cycles; (3) freshwater roles in human cultures and civilizations; (4) water as a biosphere cornerstone; (5) climate as a hydrospheric 'game changer' from the perspective of freshwater; (6) human-induced stressors' effects on freshwater ecosystem changes (pollution, habitat fragmentation, etc.); (7) freshwater ecosystems' biological resources in the context of unsustainable exploitation/overexploitation; (8) invasive species, parasites, and diseases in freshwater systems; (9) freshwater ecosystems' vegetation; (10) the relationship between human warfare and water. All of these issues and more create an extremely complex matrix of stressors that plays a driving role in changing freshwater ecosystems both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as their capacity to offer sustainable products and services to human societies. Only internationally integrated policies, strategies, assessment, monitoring, management, protection, and conservation initiatives can diminish and hopefully stop the long-term deterioration of Earth's freshwater resources and their associated secondary resources.

AB  - Deposits of natural gas hydrates are some of the most promising sources of hydrocarbons. According to studies, at the current level of natural gas consumption, the traditional reserves will last for about 50 years, and the gas hydrate deposits will last for at least 250 years. Therefore, interest in the study of gas hydrates is associated first of all with gas production from gas hydrate deposits. Additionally, gas hydrates are widely studied for solving practical problems, such as transportation and storage of natural gas, utilization of industrial gases and environmental and technological disasters associated with gas hydrates. When solving practical problems related to gas hydrates, in addition to laboratory and field studies, mathematical modeling is also widely used. This article presents the mathematical models of non-isothermal flow in a porous medium considering the decomposition of gas hydrate. The general forms of the mass conservation equations, Darcy's law and the energy conservation equation are given. The article also presents derivations of the equations for taking into account the latent heat of phase transitions and non-isothermal filtration parameters for the energy conservation equation. This may be useful for researchers to better understand the construction of the model. For the parameters included in the basic equations, various dependencies are used in different works. In all the articles found, most often there was an emphasis on one or two of the parameters. The main feature of this article is summarizing various dependencies for a large number of parameters. Additionally, graphs of these dependencies are presented so that the reader can independently evaluate the differences between them. The most preferred dependencies for calculations are noted and explained.

AB  - QuestionDigital interventions based on cognitive-behavioural therapy (iCBT) is associated with reductions in suicidal ideation. However, fine-grained analyses of effects and potential effect-moderating variables are missing. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of iCBT on suicidal ideation, effect moderators, effects on suicide attempts and predictors of adherence. Study selection and analysisWe systematically searched CENTRAL, PsycINFO, Embase and PubMed for randomised controlled trials that investigated iCBT for suicidal ideation or behaviours. Participants reporting baseline suicidal ideation were eligible. We conducted a one-stage individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. Suicidal ideation was the primary outcome, analysed as three indices: severity of suicidal ideation, reliable changes and treatment response. FindingsWe included IPD from nine out of ten eligible trials (2037 participants). iCBT showed significant reductions of suicidal ideation compared with control conditions across all indices (severity: b=-0.247, 95% CI -0.322 to -0.173; reliable changes: b=0.633, 95% CI 0.408 to 0.859; treatment response: b=0.606, 95% CI 0.410 to 0.801). In iCBT, the rate of reliable improvement was 40.5% (controls: 27.3%); the deterioration rate was 2.8% (controls: 5.1%). No participant-level moderator effects were identified. The effects on treatment response were higher for trials with waitlist-controls compared with active controls. There were insufficient data on suicide attempts. Human support and female gender predicted treatment adherence. The main source of potential bias was missing outcome data. ConclusionsThe current evidence indicates that iCBT is effective in reducing suicidal ideation irrespective of age, gender and previous suicide attempts. Future studies should rigorously assess suicidal behaviour and drop-out reasons.

AB  - BackgroundStudies have reported elevated rates of dissociative symptoms and comorbid dissociative disorders in functional neurological disorder (FND); however, a comprehensive review is lacking. AimsTo systematically review the severity of dissociative symptoms and prevalence of comorbid dissociative disorders in FND and summarise their biological and clinical associations. MethodWe searched Embase, PsycInfo and MEDLINE up to June 2021, combining terms for FND and dissociation. Studies were eligible if reporting dissociative symptom scores or rates of comorbid dissociative disorder in FND samples. Risk of bias was appraised using modified Newcastle-Ottawa criteria. The findings were synthesised qualitatively and dissociative symptom scores were included in a meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42020173263). ResultsSeventy-five studies were eligible (FND n = 3940; control n = 3073), most commonly prospective case-control studies (k = 54). Dissociative disorders were frequently comorbid in FND. Psychoform dissociation was elevated in FND compared with healthy (g = 0.90, 95% CI 0.66-1.14, I-2 = 70%) and neurological controls (g = 0.56, 95% CI 0.19-0.92, I-2 = 67%). Greater psychoform dissociation was observed in FND samples with seizure symptoms versus healthy controls (g = 0.94, 95% CI 0.65-1.22, I-2 = 42%) and FND samples with motor symptoms (g = 0.40, 95% CI -0.18 to 1.00, I-2 = 54%). Somatoform dissociation was elevated in FND versus healthy controls (g = 1.80, 95% CI 1.25-2.34, I-2 = 75%). Dissociation in FND was associated with more severe functional symptoms, worse quality of life and brain alterations. ConclusionsOur findings highlight the potential clinical utility of assessing patients with FND for dissociative symptomatology. However, fewer studies investigated FND samples with motor symptoms and heterogeneity between studies and risk of bias were high. Rigorous investigation of the prevalence, features and mechanistic relevance of dissociation in FND is needed.

AB  - A notable rise in health-related disability for which evidence-based rehabilitation is beneficial is evident in low-to-middle income countries. This scoping review aimed to systematically identify and map the most common functioning problems associated with health conditions that contribute most to disability in South Africa using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. Peer-reviewed evidence published from January 2006 to December 2021 was systematically searched from five databases. Some 268 studies reporting on functioning problems (impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions) in South African adults (>18 years) related to 10 health conditions were included. A total of 130 different functioning problems were mapped to the ICF. The most prevalent problems (top 20) were related to mobility, pain, and mental health but spanned across several ICF domains and were mostly in patients at primary care. The high prevalence and wide range of functioning problems may be particularly burdensome on an already strained primary health care (PHC) system. This points towards targeted planning of innovative strategies towards strengthening rehabilitation service delivery at primary care to address these complexities where there is an inadequate rehabilitation workforce.

AB  - The use of cannabinoids as therapeutic drugs has increased among aging populations recently. Age-related changes in the endogenous cannabinoid system could influence the effects of therapies that target the cannabinoid system. At the preclinical level, cannabidiol (CBD) induces anti-amyloidogenic, antioxidative, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role of cannabinoids to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer. Emerging evidence suggests that CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol have neuroprotective therapeutic-like effects on dementias. In clinical practice, cannabinoids are being used off-label to relieve symptoms of PD and AD. In fact, patients are using cannabis compounds for the treatment of tremor, non-motor symptoms, anxiety, and sleep assistance in PD, and managing responsive behaviors of dementia such as agitation. However, strong evidence from clinical trials is scarce for most indications. Some clinicians consider cannabinoids an alternative for older adults bearing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's dementia with a poor response to first-line treatments. In our concept and experience, cannabinoids should never be considered a first-line treatment but could be regarded as an adjuvant therapy in specific situations commonly seen in clinical practice. To mitigate the risk of adverse events, the traditional dogma of geriatric medicine, starting with a low dose and proceeding with a slow titration regime, should also be employed with cannabinoids. In this review, we aimed to address preclinical evidence of cannabinoids in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD and AD and discuss potential off-label use of cannabinoids in clinical practice of these disorders.

AB  - Migrants from culturally and linguistically diverse (CaLD) backgrounds experience factors that may increase health inequities related to a range of determinants of health including housing and mental health. However, the intersection between mental health and housing for migrants is poorly understood. A scoping review searched four academic databases for concepts related to cultural and linguistic diversity, housing conditions, and public health interventions to address homelessness. A total of 49 articles were included and seven key themes identified: housing provision; mental health intersections and interventions; complexity and needs beyond housing; substance use; service provider and policy issues; the role of cultural and linguistic diversity; and consumer experience. The intersection of ethnicity with other social determinants of health and housing was highlighted though there were limited interventions tailored for migrants. Studies generally pointed to the positive impacts of Housing First. Other sub-themes emerged: social connection and community; shame, stigma, and discrimination; health and support requirements; and employment, financial assistance, and income. Consumer choice was identified as vital, along with the need for systemic anti-racism work and interventions. To support secure housing for migrants and mitigate mental health impacts, closer attention is required towards migration factors along with broader, tailored services complementing housing provision.

AB  - Although octocorals are a key component of marine hard-bottom systems, their feeding performance is still poorly understood. Understanding carbon budget trends in octocorals' feeding ecology seems essential to assess their role in benthic-pelagic coupling and to predict their responses to environmental changes. Herein, we provide a review of the feeding ecology of octocorals and an overall data reassessment of their carbon budgets through a systematic and comprehensive search of peer-reviewed literature published between 1960 and 2020, highlighting knowledge gaps. Overall, the feeding ecology of more than 95% of octocoral species remains unknown. Based on the available data, suspension feeding accounts for 162.8 +/- 171.0% of the metabolic requirements in azooxanthellate octocorals and 28.7 +/- 32.3% in zooxanthellate octocorals. Autotrophy is responsible for 156.7 +/- 113.9% of the acquired carbon in zooxanthellate octocorals. However, this value is significantly lower in gorgonian phenotypes compared to other soft corals. We present a conceptual framework describing and exploring the most relevant hypotheses regarding putative advantages of octocorals over scleractinians against environmental changes, including their ability to decrease energy expenses to overcome stress events, their lower dependency on autotrophy, and the type of interaction (facultative and flexible) with their symbionts.

AB  - Tropospheric ozone (O-3) is a long-range transboundary secondary air pollutant, causing significant damage to agricultural crops worldwide. There are substantial spatial variations in O-3 concentration in different areas of India due to seasonal and geographical variations. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region is one of the most crop productive and air-polluted regions in India. The concentration of tropospheric O-3 over the IGP is increasing by 6-7.2% per decade. The annual trend of increase is 0.4 +/- 0.25% year(-1) over the Northeastern IGP. High O-3 concentrations were reported during the summer, while they were at their minimum during the monsoon months. To explore future potential impacts of O-3 on major crop plants, the responses of different crops grown under ambient and elevated O-3 concentrations were compared. The studies clearly showed that O-3 is an important stress factor, negatively affecting the yield of crops. In this review, we have discussed yield losses in agricultural crops due to rising O-3 pollution and variations in O-3 sensitivity among cultivars and species. The use of ethylene diurea (EDU) as a research tool in assessing the losses in yield under ambient and elevated O-3 levels also discussed. Besides, an overview of interactive effects of O-3 and nitrogen on crop productivity has been included. Several recommendations are made for future research and policy development on rising concentration of O-3 in India.

AB  - Previous studies reported that virtual reality (VR)-based exposure therapy (VRET) was a clinically beneficial intervention for specific phobias. However, among VRET, VR-based graded exposure therapy (VR-GET) is little known about its efficacy on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated the effects of VR-GET for PTSD symptoms. A literature search yielded seven randomized controlled trials. The differences between conditions regarding the primary outcome of PTSD symptoms in the effect size of the individual study were calculated using Hedges' g. The findings showed VR-GET showed a significantly larger effect size for PTSD symptoms (g = 1.100, p = 0.001), compared to controls. However, no significant difference between conventional VRET and controls was found for PTSD symptoms (g = -0.279, p = 0.970). These findings indicated the superiority of VR-GET for PTSD symptoms compared to controls, supporting the importance of immersive PTSD treatments. Nevertheless, the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the substantial number of military service personnel studies. Future trials, considering individually tailored scenarios in virtual environments to cover a wider range of trauma types, are required to investigate its evidence on treating PTSD.

AB  - Micronutrient malnutrition is thought to play an important role in the cause of cognitive impairment and physical frailty. The purpose of this scoping review was to map current evidence on the association between micronutrient deficiency in blood and mild cognitive impairment, frailty, and cognitive frailty among older adults. The scoping review was conducted based on the 2005 methodological framework by Arksey and O'Malley. The search strategy for potential literature on micronutrient concentration in blood and cognitive frailty was retrieved based on the keywords using electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid, and Science Direct) from January 2010 to December 2021. Gray literature was also included in the searches. A total of 4310 articles were retrieved and 43 articles were incorporated in the review. Findings revealed a trend of significant association between low levels of B vitamins (folate and vitamin B12), vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, omega 3 fatty acid, and albumin, and high homocysteine levels in blood with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment among older adults. The results also indicated that low vitamin D levels, albumin, and antioxidants (lutein and zeaxanthin) in blood were significantly associated with frailty among older adults, while beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin in blood were inversely associated with the risk of cognitive frailty. Vitamin D and antioxidants seemed to be targeted nutrients for the prevention of cognitive frailty. In conclusion, a wide range of micronutrient deficiency was associated with either mild cognitive impairment or frailty; however, little evidence exists on the dual impairment, i.e., cognitive frailty. This scoping review can serve as preliminary evidence for the association between micronutrient deficiency in blood and mild cognitive impairment, frailty, and cognitive frailty among older adults and prove the relevancy of the topic for future systematic reviews.

AB  - Background Worldwide rising trend in infertility has been observed in the past few years with male infertility arising as a major problem. One main reason for the rise in male infertility cases is declining semen quality. It was found that any factor that affects semen quality can affect male fertility. There are several modifiable factors affecting semen quality including air pollution, use of pesticides and harmful chemicals, exposure to excessive heat, and can lead to decreased male fertility. Main body The present review focuses on some of these environmental factors that affect semen quality and hence, can cause male infertility. The literature from 2000 till June 2021 was searched from various English peer-reviewed journals and WHO fact sheets using the USA National Library of Medicine (PubMed) database, the regional portal of Virtual Health Library, and Scientific Electronic Library Online. The search terms used were: "Air pollution and male fertility", "Chemicals and male infertility", "Heat exposure and infertility", "heavy metals and male fertility". Conclusion Adverse environmental factors have a significant impact on semen quality, leading to decreased sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility, viability, and increased abnormal sperm morphology, sperm DNA fragmentation, ultimately causing male infertility. However, all these factors are modifiable and reversible, and hence, by mere changing of lifestyle, many of these risk factors can be avoided.

AB  - Background: Many studies have shown the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the choice of different parameters has been a challenging issue. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies until June 20, 2022. The treatment efficacy was evaluated by the relative risk (RR) using the pairwise test for response and remission rates. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the primary outcome differences and to assess the reliability of the results. Results: Thirty-seven trials comprising 2120 participants with TRD were included. The more efficacious interventions compared to sham controls included high-frequency left followed by low-frequency right sup-threshold (HFL-LFR-sup-rTMS, RR = 5.29, 95% CI: 1.24-22.50), high-frequency left sup-threshold (HFL-sup-rTMS, RR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.74-5.05), low-frequency right sup-threshold (LFR-sup-rTMS, RR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.50-4.90), low-frequency right followed by high-frequency left sup-threshold (LFR-HFL-sup-rTMS, RR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.62-4.53), and high-frequency left sub-threshold (HFL-sub-rTMS, RR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.18-3.10) rTMS. The estimated relative ranking of treatments suggested that HFL-LFR-sup-rTMS (84.4%) might be the most efficacious among all rTMS strategies. No treatments showed a lower acceptability than the sham control. Limitations: Subgroup analysis was not conducted to compare the efficacy of rTMS treatment between bipolar and unipolar depression, and small-study effects possibly introduced bias. Conclusion: Treatment with HFL-LFR-sup-rTMS, HFL-sup-rTMS, LFR-sup-rTMS, LFR-HFL-sup-rTMS, or HFL-sub-rTMS is more efficacious than the sham control. HFL-LFR-sup-rTMS and HFL-sup-rTMS may be the two best among the most efficacious rTMS treatments.

AB  - ObjectiveImmune system dysregulation is hypothesised to be central to the aetiopathogenesis of schizophrenia; however, the role of sterile inflammation remains unclear. Damage associated molecular patterns are key initiators of sterile inflammation and are detectable in peripheral blood.MethodsA defined systematic search of the Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus was performed to identify adult case-control studies published between January 1990 and June 2022. Three studies consisting of 242 cases and 83 controls met inclusion for the systematic review and meta-analysis of HMGB1 while twenty-eight studies consisting of 1,544 cases and 1,248 healthy controls were included for S100B.ResultsA significant standardised mean difference in peripheral S100B and HMGB1 concentrations was detected between cases and controls. S100B subgroup analysis determined the largest significant effect size for unmedicated individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.ConclusionThis study provides evidence that peripheral S100B and HMGB1 concentrations are elevated in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia when compared with healthy controls. These results should be interpreted with caution as significant heterogeneity was present during meta-analysis of S100B in the entire sample and in sub-group analysis. The persistence of significant heterogeneity throughout subgroup analysis indicates that the current diagnostic groupings may be a barrier to understanding human behaviours and emotions.

AB  - Speech emotion recognition (SER) has grown to be one of the most trending research topics in computational linguistics in the last two decades. Speech being the primary communication medium, understanding the emotional state of humans from speech and responding accordingly have made the speech emotion recognition system an essential part of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. Although there are a few review works carried out for SER, none of them discusses the development of SER system for the Indo-Aryan or Dravidian language families. This paper focuses on some studies carried out for the development of an automatic SER system for Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. Besides, it presents a brief study of the prominent databases available for SER experiments. Some remarkable research works on the identification of emotion from the speech signal in the last two decades have also been discussed in this paper.

AB  - Phytoremediation is currently an active field of research focusing chiefly on identifying and characterizing novel and high chelation action super-accumulators. In the last few years, molecular tools have been widely exploited to understand better metal absorption, translocation, cation, and tolerance mechanisms in plants. Recently more advanced CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering technology is also employed to enhance detoxification efficiency. Further, advances in molecular science will trigger the understanding of adaptive phytoremediation ability plant production in current global warming conditions. The enhanced abilities of nucleases for genome modification can improve plant repair capabilities by modifying the genome, thereby achieving a sustainable ecosystem. The purpose of this manuscript focuses on biotechnology's fundamental principles and application to promote climate-resistant metal plants, especially the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system for enhancing the phytor-emediation of harmful contamination and pollutants.

AB  - Help-seeking behaviors (HSBs) refer to approaches taken by individuals towards their health and symptoms, and they are supported by healthcare professionals. Outreach interventions aimed at older people in rural communities can mitigate difficulties in implementing HSBs and help them remain healthy. This systematic review investigated evidence regarding family medicine-involved outreach aimed at HSBs among older individuals in rural areas. We searched three databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science) for international and original interventional articles regarding family physicians involved in outreach to older people in rural or underserved areas between April 2000 and October 2022. The articles were analyzed and summarized based on the setting, country, health issues, and outreach outcomes. Of the 376 studies identified, four were included in this review. Our findings showed that family physician-involved outreach to rural and underserved areas improved health outcomes, including anxiety, subjective physical function, and diabetic care. The challenges of outreach interventions include the duration and continuity of outreach, the active participation of family physicians and patients in the outreach programs, and the focus of outreach participants. Although the number of studies included was small, family physician-involved outreach to rural and underserved areas was shown to improve various health outcomes.

AB  - Fingers of sport climbers are exposed to high mechanical loads. This work focuses on the fingers of a 52-year-old active elite climber who was the first in mankind to master 8B (V13), 8B+ (V14) and 8C (V15) graded boulders, bringing lifelong high-intensity loads to his hands. It is therefore hypothesized that he belongs to a small group of people with the highest accumulative loads to their fingers in the climbing scene. Fingers were analyzed by means of ultrasonography, X-rays and physical examination. Soft tissue and bone adaptations, as well as the onset of osteoarthritis and finger stiffness, were found, especially in digit III, the longest and therefore most loaded digit. Finally, this article aims to provide an overview of the current literature in this field. In conclusion, elite sport climbing results in soft tissue and bone adaptations in the fingers, and the literature provides evidence that these adaptations increase over one's career. However, at later stages, radiographic and clinical signs of osteoarthritis, especially in the middle finger, seem to occur, although they may not be symptomatic.

AB  - The social act of eating together has been influenced and mediated by technologies in recent decades. This phenomenon has been investigated in different academic fields, but the topic is still in an incipient dimension, and there is a lack of consensus regarding terminology and definitions. The study aimed to characterize the main scientific findings regarding digital forms of commensality in the 21st century and to identify possible relationships between these practices and public health. A scoping review was conducted to identify papers published in different languages between 2001 and 2021. A total of 104 publications that combined commensality and technology in all contexts were included. Most studies were qualitative; from the Design and Technology field; used social media and video platforms or prototypes/augmented reality gadgets; and used different terms to refer to digital forms of commensality, allowing the analysis of the construction of field definitions over time. The intersections with health were observed from impacts on family/community engagement, culinary skills development, and mental health and eating habits. These practices also structured specific social interactions, such as virtual food communities and commensality, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper indicates the consistent growth of these practices and recommends the development of future research for theoretically and longitudinally deeper evaluations of the impacts of these new ways of eating together, especially regarding their effects on human health.

AB  - Background: Various studies have highlighted the correlation between social frailty and depressive symptoms in the elderly. However, evidence of how these two domains influence each other is not clear. The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the current literature examining social frailty and depressive symptoms. Method: We conducted a scoping review allowing for the inclusion of multiple methodologies to examine the extent and range of this research topic. Result: The search initially yielded 617 results, 14 of which met the inclusion criteria. Five studies were identified from China, six were identified from Japan, two were identified from Korea, one was identified from Ghana, and one was from Asia. The evidence reviewed indicated that five studies met category 5 criteria, and the others met level 3 criteria. The findings from these studies showed that there is a significant relationship between social frailty and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: This scoping review shows that worse social frailty contributes to a significant degree of depression. Further research on screening social frailty and possible interventions in community and medical settings to prevent the elderly from developing depressive symptoms is needed.

AB  - Assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) are employed by single individuals and couples who are not otherwise able to conceive spontaneously. While the use of ARTs is increasing, research is lacking on the attempts made by adolescent offspring conceived via ARTs to integrate their ART conception into their identity and negotiate a connection with, and autonomy from, their parents. The present article reviews studies investigating adolescent development and the parent-adolescent relationship in diverse family forms created by ARTs (mainly heterosexual and lesbian parent families), and discusses the results in light of attachment, identity development, and emotional distance regulation theories. Overall, the results indicate that the psychological adjustment of adolescents conceived via ARTs is not undermined by the manner of their conception, and that they enjoy positive relationships with their parents with no difference from those enjoyed by spontaneously conceived adolescents. However, it remains unknown whether the development of a reproductive identity in adolescence is likely to influence adolescents' interest in searching for or contacting their donors, surrogates, and/or donor siblings. The results suggest the relevance of considering the parent-adolescent relationship, disclosure, and identity formation issues when planning psychological counseling and support interventions with ART parents and their adolescent offspring, and emphasize the need to further investigate these aspects in diverse ART families, including single-, gay-, bisexual-, and trans*-parent families.

KW  - AFFORDABILITY
AB  - Several high-income countries are currently experiencing an unprecedented and multifaceted housing crisis. The crisis is escalating rapidly, and its negative ramifications are shared disproportionately by migrant and refugee communities. Although housing is often cited as an important social determinant of health, the relationship between housing inequalities and health outcomes in the context of migrant and refugee populations remain under-explored, particularly in high-income countries. This paper presents a protocol for a mixed-methods systematic review which will synthesize the evidence on the key housing and health inequalities faced by migrant and refugee populations in high-income countries. It will inform the identification of pathways linking housing inequalities to health outcomes. The protocol for this systematic review was developed with guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for mixed-methods systematic reviews using a convergent integrated approach to synthesis and integration, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies reporting the association of housing inequalities with physical and mental health outcomes among refugee and migrant populations in high-income countries will be included. Medline, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus and CINAHL will be searched for peer-reviewed literature. This will be supplemented by gray literature searches using Google Scholar, MedNar and WHOLIS. Two reviewers will independently screen and select studies, assess the methodological quality and conduct data extraction. This systematic review will elucidate the different pathways linking housing inequalities and health outcomes, which may guide the development of targeted housing and public health interventions to improve the health and wellbeing of migrant and refugee populations. The review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022362868).

AB  - As proposed by Triplett in 1898 and evidenced by a recent series of lab and field studies, racing against other competitors consistently results in increased performance compared to when racing alone. To explain this phenomenon, we will explore the process of self-regulation, a process relevant to pacing, which is linked to athletes' emotions and facilitates their sports performance optimization. We will apply the cyclical model of Self-regulation of Learning to pacing and sports performance settings and explore the role of the social environment (in particular, opponents but also coaches) in each phase of the self-regulatory model. It seems that the social environment could be considered as a significant self-regulatory and sports performance facilitator. More specifically, athletes can focus on their social environment (opponents) when they have to set goals and select appropriate strategies to achieve them (forethought phase), monitor and manage their actions and their emotions (performance phase), and make self-judgements and choose self-reactions (self-reflection). Moreover, the social environment (coaches) can observe, step in, and facilitate these intricate processes. These findings could guide athletes and their coaches towards more effective pacing acquisition and development, and better sports performance, which could be of particular relevance for youth athletes or athletes with disabilities impacting on their self-regulatory skills.

AB  - Introduction: Climate change exacerbates existing sociopolitical and economic vulnerabilities, undermining livelihoods, inflating the risk of conflict, and making it difficult for people to remain stable. In 2019, around 25 million new displacements occurred due to natural disasters. This review aims to summarize the existing evidence regarding the impact of climate change on the health of African immigrants. Methods: Nine databases were systematically searched using a strategy developed in collaboration with a subject librarian. Potentially relevant articles were identified, screened, and reviewed by at least two reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving conflicts where necessary. Data were extracted from relevant articles using a standardized form. Results: Seven studies (three cross-sectional, two qualitative, one cohort, and one need assessment report) were identified; they included different categories of African migrants and reported on various aspects of health. The included articles report on climate change, e.g., flooding, drought, and excess heat, resulting in respiratory illness, mental health issues, malnutrition, and premature mortality among African immigrants. Conclusion: This review suggests climate change adversely affects the physical, mental, and social health of African immigrants. It also highlights a knowledge gap in evidence related to the impact of climate change on the health of African immigrants.

AB  - Since the industrial revolution, fossil fuel combustion has led to a 30 %-increase of the atmospheric CO2 con-centration, also increasing the ocean partial CO2 pressure. The consequent lowered surface seawater pH is termed ocean acidification (OA) and severely affects marine life on a global scale. Cellular and molecular re-sponses of marine species to lowered seawater pH have been studied but information on the mechanisms driving the tolerance of adapted species to comparatively low seawater pH is limited. Such information may be obtained from species inhabiting sites with naturally low water pH that have evolved remarkable abilities to tolerate such conditions. This review gathers information on current knowledge about species naturally facing low water pH conditions and on cellular and molecular adaptive mechanisms enabling the species to survive under, and even benefit from, adverse pH conditions. Evidences derived from case studies on naturally acidified systems and on resistance mechanisms will guide predictions on the consequences of future adverse OA scenarios for marine biodiversity.

AB  - Parents are often regarded as one of the significant social agents who are important to the participation of physical activity (PA) among children and adolescents. However, within the literature, the relationships between parental influences and child and adolescent PA have been inconclusive and discordant. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to quantify and synthesize the associations between parental social influences (positive parental influence, punishment, and discouragement) and the PA level of children and adolescents. Through a systematic literature search using PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, and SPORTDiscus databases, we identified 112 eligible studies and subsequently extracted 741 effect sizes for our analysis. Multilevel meta-analysis showed that the corrected zero-order correlation of positive parental influence was positive and statistically significant, r = 0.202, SE = 0.014, t = 14.975, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.176, 0.228]. Further moderation analysis also found that this was significantly moderated by parental gender (maternal vs. paternal), respondent of influence measure (parent-reported vs. child-reported), and type of PA measure (subjective vs. objective). The corrected zero-order correlations of negative parental influences (i.e., punishment and discouragement) were not statistically significant, and no significant moderation effects were observed. The findings of our meta-analysis showed that children and adolescents had higher PA levels when their parents supported PA participation by exerting positive social influence. Punishment and discouragement against PA by parents did not appear to be significantly associated with the PA level of children and adolescents. The findings of negative parental social influence were mixed and required further investigations.

AB  - Agricultural drought is still difficult to anticipate even though there have been developments in remote sensing technology, especially satellite imagery that is useful for farmers in monitoring crop conditions. The availability of open and free satellite imagery still has a weakness, namely the level of resolution is low and coarse with atmospheric disturbances in the form of cloud cover, as well as the location and period for taking images that are different from the presence of weather stations on Earth. This problem is a challenge for researchers trying to monitoring agricultural drought conditions through satellite imagery. One approach that has recently used is high computational techniques through machine learning, which is able to predict satellite image data according to the conditions of mapping land types and plants in the field. Furthermore, using time series data from satellite imagery, a predictive model of crop cycles can be regarding future crop drought conditions. So, through this technology, we can encourage farmers to make decisions to anticipate the dangers of agricultural drought. Unfortunately, exploration of the use of machine learning for classification and prediction of agricultural drought conditions has not conducted, and the existing methods can still improve. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of methods that used to monitor agricultural drought using remote sensing and machine learning, which are the subjects of future research.

AB  - Ergonomic risk assessment is critical for identifying working posture hazardous to the health of construction workers. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are predominant non-fatal injuries in the construction industry owing to manual handling activities and poor working conditions. However, there is a lack of scientific synopsis aiming to better understand the emerging research focus in this field. To fill the research gap, this study performed a scientometric evaluation of the bibliometric data on ergonomic risk assessment from the Web of Science database using VOSviewer software. The purpose of this study is to analyze the co-occurrence network of keywords, co-authorship network, most active countries, and the sources of publication. The results indicate that research related to risk assessment in construction has fluctuating growth, peaking in 2020 with significant advancements in the USA, China, and Canada. WMSDs, risk factors, construction workers, and ergonomics are hot research topics in this field. Furthermore, the research gaps of previous studies and suggestions for future research have been provided to bridge the knowledge gap. We believe that this scientometric review provides useful reference points for early-stage researchers as well as beneficial in-depth information to experienced practitioners and scholars in the construction industry.

AB  - A growing body of research has examined the effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but the findings of the available studies were conflicting. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive function in AD patients. Searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases from the inception of indexing until 12 November 2021. Cochrane risk assessment tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included literature. From 1942 search records initially identified, 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered eligible for systematic review and meta-analysis. Included studies involved 503 participants in 16 exercise groups (mean age: 69.2-84 years) and 406 participants (mean age: 68.9-84 years) in 15 control groups. There was a significant effect of aerobic exercise on increasing mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score in AD patients [weighted mean difference (WMD), 1.50 (95% CI, 0.55 to 2.45), p = 0.002]. Subgroup analyses showed that interventions conducted 30 min per session [WMD, 2.52 (95% CI, 0.84 to 4.20), p = 0.003], less than 150 min per week [WMD, 2.10 (95% CI, 0.84 to 3.37), p = 0.001], and up to three times per week [WMD, 1.68 (95% CI, 0.46 to 2.89), p = 0.007] increased MMSE score significantly. In addition, a worse basal cognitive status was associated with greater improvement in MMSE score. Our analysis indicated that aerobic exercise, especially conducted 30 min per session, less than 150 min per week, and up to three times per week, contributed to improving cognitive function in AD patients. Additionally, a worse basal cognitive status contributed to more significant improvements in cognitive function.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of intimate partner violence against women in China remains high. Understanding associated risk factors will help inform prevention. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify associated risk factors of intimate partner violence against women in mainland China. Methods: Nine English and Chinese databases were searched from 1 August 2008-2 August 2022. Reference lists of relevant studies supplemented the initial results. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence was used to assess article quality. Study results were combined in a narrative synthesis. Results: Nineteen eligible studies were identified. Examples of key intimate partner violence risk factors included: partner's low education or income, unhealthy habits (gambling), women's marital status, poor health or education, women's or partner's childhood abuse or witnessing thereof at home, or multiple children and husband dominance. Conclusions: Despite the significant changes in Chinese policies and the new law, IPV continues, and this review has highlighted vulnerable women who need identification and protection. Further study is needed of individual (e.g., psychological well-being), relationship/family, and society/cultural variables.

AB  - Objectives Neurocognitive deficits are central in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation has proven effective in alleviating these deficits, with medium effect sizes. However, sizeable attrition rates are reported, with the reasons still uncertain. Furthermore, cognitive remediation is not part of routine mental health care. We conducted a systematic review to investigate factors that influence access and engagement of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for peer-reviewed articles including a cognitive remediation arm, access, and engagement data, and participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders aged 17-65 years old. Duplicates and studies without a distinct cognitive remediation component, protocol papers, single case studies, case series, and reviews/meta-analyses were excluded. Results We included 67 studies that reported data on access and engagement, and extracted quantitative and qualitative data. Access data were limited, with most interventions delivered on-site, to outpatients, and in middle- to high-income countries. We found a median dropout rate of 14.29%. Only a small number of studies explored differences between dropouts and completers (n = 5), and engagement factors (n = 13). Dropouts had higher negative symptomatology and baseline self-efficacy, and lower baseline neurocognitive functioning and intrinsic motivation compared to completers. The engagement was positively associated with intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, educational level, premorbid intelligence quotient, baseline neurocognitive functioning, some neurocognitive outcomes, and therapeutic alliance; and negatively associated with subjective cognitive complaints. Qualitative results showed good acceptability of cognitive remediation, with some areas for improvement. Conclusions Overall, access and engagement results are scarce and heterogeneous. Further investigations of cognitive remediation for inpatients, as well as remote delivery, are needed. Future clinical trials should systematically explore attrition and related factors. Determining influential factors of access and engagement will help improve the implementation and efficacy of cognitive remediation, and thus the recovery of people with schizophrenia.

AB  - Various functions in the central nervous system, such as growth, development, and cognition can be influenced by vitamins and minerals, which are capable of helping to maintain brain health and function throughout life. Cognition is understood as the aspects related to knowledge, learning, and understanding, as well as the ability to develop these functions. A possible association between low levels of vit D and deficit in the performance of cognitive functions in healthy humans or with some pathological condition is discussed. Because of this, the present systematic review analyzed only randomized clinical trials carried out in healthy non-athlete adults about intellectual and/or mental processes involving cognitive functions to identify whether these individuals with different levels of vit D are capable of interfering with the performance of the cognitive function. To do so, we adopted the PRISMA method criteria and registered it in the PROSPERO database. The search was performed in PubMed (MEDLINE), PsycINFO, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, 2,167 records were identified. The 5 most frequent cognitive domains in the selected studies were: processing speed, attention, verbal learning/memory, executive function, and general cognitive functions. We found that there are positive changes in the following domains: verbal memory and verbal working memory, learning memory, attention, executive function, and also cognitive function in general. We highlight the following suggestions for improvements that vitamin D supplementation may promote in the cognitive domains of healthy adults: a) low doses between 400 and 600 IU/d seem to be more effective when compared to doses between 2,400 and 5,000 IU/d and b) food fortification and enrichment with vit D, need further studies, as they seem to be more or as effective as synthetic supplementation. We evident that there is a need for trials that evaluate the control of vit D levels for healthy adult individuals is important, as they have the potential to minimize health problems, especially those involved in the reduction of cognitive abilities. Thus, the development of more clinical trials to obtain satisfactory answers on this topic needs to be encouraged.

AB  - Embracing a growth mindset is essential to students' academic improvement. This manuscript aims to better understand the existing literature on the role and effects of the growth mindset in mathematics teaching and learning. It provides an updated perspective on the research regarding the growth mindset in mathematics education. The dataset comprises 85 journal articles published from 2012 to 2022 retrieved from the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus databases. The current study applies a methodology based on bibliometric analysis techniques. The analysis reveals and corroborates several patterns from the research trends, journals, countries, and authors that have significant impacts on the research field. The findings show that USA, UK, and Norway are the most productive countries in publishing research on the topic. Moreover, the results of the thematic analysis indicate that the topics discussed among most of the articles in the dataset include engagement, implementation, persistence, children, fluid intelligence, and skills. The longitudinal trends in research themes based on study keywords illustrate an evolution in the research from the concept of mindsets to implicit theories on the growth mindset alongside academic achievement. Lastly, this study also provides an overview of the conceptual structure underlying studies on the growth mindset, which offers valuable insights into potential research topics for academics and practitioners seeking to explore the growth mindset in the future.

AB  - Background Indigenous populations across the world are more likely to suffer from poor health outcomes when compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Although these disparities have many sources, one protective factor that has become increasingly apparent is the continued use and/or revitalization of traditional Indigenous lifeways: Indigenous language in particular. This realist review is aimed at bringing together the literature that addresses effects of language use and revitalization on mental and physical health. Methods Purposive bibliographic searches on Scopus were conducted to identify relevant publications, further augmented by forward citation chaining. Included publications (qualitative and quantitative) described health outcomes for groups of Indigenous people who either did or did not learn and/or use their ancestral language. The geographical area studied was restricted to the Americas, Australia or New Zealand. Publications that were not written in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese or German were excluded. A realist approach was followed to identify positive, neutral or negative effects of language use and/or acquisition on health, with both qualitative and quantitative measures considered. Results The bibliographic search yielded a total of 3508 possible publications of which 130 publications were included in the realist analysis. The largest proportion of the outcomes addressed in the studies (62.1%) reported positive effects. Neutral outcomes accounted for 16.6% of the reported effects. Negative effects (21.4%) were often qualified by such issues as possible cultural use of tobacco, testing educational outcomes in a student's second language, and correlation with socioeconomic status (SES), health access, or social determinants of health; it is of note that the positive correlations with language use just as frequently occurred with these issues as the negative correlations did. Conclusions Language use and revitalization emerge as protective factors in the health of Indigenous populations. Benefits of language programs in tribal and other settings should be considered a cost-effective way of improving outcomes in multiple domains.

AB  - Sexual violence is a phenomenon that negatively impacts the victims' physical and psychological health and well-being. Sex offenders tend not to take responsibility for their actions, have difficulties in emotion regulation and impulse control, paraphilias or other disorders, so they are a difficult group to treat. In addition, the available psychological treatment programs tend to have inconsistent and, sometimes, undesirable results. This systematic review aimed to analyse the recidivism rates of sex offenders treated in community settings. According to the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search in three databases, EBSCOhost, PubMed, and Web of Science, and a manual search was performed. A total of 319 empirical studies using quantitative methodologies were identified, 27 of which were selected for full-text analysis. In the end, 15 studies were included, published between 1996 and 2020. The objectives, intervention approach, instruments used, and the main results and conclusions were extracted from each study. The studies explored different types of sex offenders, such as: violent sex offenders (e.g., rapists), child abusers, and child abusers with pedophilia (and/or other paraphilias). Results showed that most of the programs had a cognitive-behavioral approach (n = 13). Overall, the interventions appear to be effective in reducing recidivism rates, and some of them led to improvements in other outcomes, such as cognitive distortions, accepting responsibility, victim awareness and empathy, emotional regulation, and offense supportive attitudes. Limitations and implications for future studies were discussed.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of exercise programmes with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation in adults. Introduction: Nicotine addiction is mediated by dopamine. Exercise can also activate the dopamine reward system. Therefore, exercise may effectively facilitate NRT to reduce cigarette cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Inclusion criteria: Clinical trials between 2000 and 2022 used exercise protocols of any intensity for smoking cessation, in current smokers or recent quitters of both genders, aged 18-70, without severe diseases and pregnancy. Mental disorders were not excluded, as exercise can improve mental health status. Therefore, it may be as effective among people with mental health issues as the general population in preventing nicotine cravings and supporting abstinence. Methods: Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Medline) were searched for papers in English using the terms "nicotine replacement therapy', "exercise, " and "smoking cessation. " Titles and abstracts were screened for potentially eligibility before full texts were reviewed. Sample size, gender, study duration, and age was then extracted. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI's) GRADE approach. Results: Seventeen studies were identified with a total of 3,191 participants. Three studies are not a randomised control study. There was moderate-high quality evidence that exercise can aid NRT in promoting smoking cessation in the short term. Several studies reported temporary reductions in cravings; however, only one trial reported a decrease in cigarette consumption due to exercise intervention and one demonstrated increased smoking abstinence at 1 year of the intervention. Conclusion: Exercise with NRT aids smoking cessation in the short term, but no evidence suggests its efficacy in the long term when combined. Future trials should include larger sample sizes and strategies to increase exercise adherence.

AB  - Purpose of Review Traditional conceptualizations of both nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) typically rely on static and unidirectional, linear associations between key biopsychosocial vulnerabilities. Instead, we argue that utilizing a complex dynamic systems view of NSSI and BPD will advance the field, as such conceptual models allow for analysis of bottom-up effects for key vulnerabilities on disorder and behavior emergence, as well as top-down effects of the emergent disorder on underlying vulnerabilities. Recent Findings Following the presentation of a novel framework highlighting momentary and developmental dynamics, we explore several advances in the field that exhibit key dynamic qualities or inform dynamic conceptualizations of NSSI and BPD. At the momentary dynamic level, several advances are being made with multimethod and repeated assessment approaches, as well as advanced bidirectional and complex modeling procedures. Additional progress is being made at the developmental dynamic level, although several questions have arisen regarding the problem of onset and subsequent trajectory, particularly with issues such as pain perception and the interplay between interpersonal, emotional, and behavioral symptoms before and after treatment. Summary Self-injury and BPD both exhibit substantial momentary and developmental dynamics in underlying vulnerabilities, including potential variance in momentary dynamics as a function of psychopathological developmental stage (e.g., onset versus maintenance versus recovery). Recent work has highlighted the necessity of utilizing multimodal research to encapsulate a holistic view of the interplay of several vulnerability factors, the developmental importance of assessment timing, and the need to examine the dynamic interplay between affect, behavior, and interpersonal experiences in BPD and/or NSSI. Research also indicated substantial variation in key vulnerability factors at both between- and within-person levels, highlighting the utility of harnessing statistical models that allow for the simultaneous incorporation of numerous variables at both levels and across several time points. As such, by using a complex dynamic systems conceptualization, we can begin to better understand integrated connections between key vulnerabilities, how they collectively interact in the short term, and how changes in the dynamic interplay between vulnerabilities may arise over the long term and with successful treatment.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder predominately affecting midbrain dopaminergic neurons that results in a broad range of motor and non-motor symptoms. Sleep complaints are among the most common non-motor symptoms, even in the prodromal period. Sleep alterations in Parkinson's disease patients may be associated with dysregulation of circadian rhythms, intrinsic 24-h cycles that control essential physiological functions, or with side effects from levodopa medication and physical and mental health challenges. The impact of circadian dysregulation on sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease is not fully understood; as such, we review the systems, cellular and molecular mechanisms that may underlie circadian perturbations in Parkinson's disease. We also discuss the potential benefits of chronobiology-based personalized medicine in the management of Parkinson's disease both in terms of behavioural and pharmacological interventions. We propose that a fuller understanding of circadian clock function may shed important new light on the aetiology and symptomatology of the disease and may allow for improvements in the quality of life for the millions of people with Parkinson's disease.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the existing evidence on the effect of night-shift work and its subtypes (permanent and rotating) on cardiovascular risk factors: diabetes, lipid disorders, being overweight, hypertension, smoking habits, sedentariness, and occupational psychosocial stressors.MethodA Web of Sciences and Cochrane review library search was conducted to identify systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis dealing with the quantification of the link between night-shift work and the studied cardiovascular risk factors in working populations. We used the AMSTAR 2 to evaluate the quality of each review. The main results of the included systematic reviews were compiled in a summary structured around the different cardiovascular risk factors.ResultsAfter selection, 33 systematic reviews were included: nine for diabetes, four for lipid disorders, nine for being overweight, four for hypertension, two for smoking habits, three for occupational psychosocial stressors and two for sedentariness. The results confirmed an excess risk of diabetes of about 10% regardless of the type of night work. A stated excess risk of being overweight at around 25% was also highlighted for shift workers overall, which could reach 38% among night-shift workers. An increased risk of obesity, estimated at 5% for night-shift workers and at 18% for rotating shift workers, was observed. An excess risk of hypertension was estimated at around 30% when considering the broad definition of shift work and when night periods were included in rotating shifts. The literature provided inconsistent results for the link between lipid disorders and night-shift work. Shift workers appeared to be more likely to smoke. The link between shift work and occupational psychosocial stressors was scarcely explored in the available studies. Sedentariness was scarcely considered in systematic reviews, which prevents any firm conclusions.ConclusionThe consequences of night work in terms of diabetes, being overweight/obesity and hypertension are established. Monitoring of these cardiovascular risk factors for these night-shift workers could be implemented by practitioners. In contrast, the links with lipid disorders, sedentariness, smoking habits, and occupational psychosocial stressors warrant further investigation.Systematic review registration, PROSPERO (ID CRD42021275212)

AB  - Background: The evidence available on the association between social support and prevention of depression has been basically obtained from observational studies. Aim: We evaluated the effectiveness of social support-based interventions for the prevention of depression in people without clinical depression. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) of randomized controlled trials (RCT), which were searched for in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, WOS, PsycINFO, OpenGrey and other sources from the inception dates to June 8, 2022. We selected RCTs that assessed the effectiveness of social support-based interventions as compared to controls, included subjects without baseline clinical depression, and measured as results a reduction in depressive symptoms and/or the incidence of new cases of depression. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated from random effects models. Results: Nine RCTs involving 927 patients from North America, Asia and Europe were included. The pooled SMD was -0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.82 to -0.04; p = .031]. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results. Heterogeneity was substantial [I-2 = 80% (95% CI: 64% to 89%)]. A meta-regression model that included usual care as comparator and the continent (Europe), explained 53% of heterogeneity. Eight RCTs had a moderate overall risk of bias and one had a high risk of bias. Follow-up was > 1 year in only three RCTs. There was no statistical evidence of publication bias. The quality of evidence, as measured on GRADE guidelines, was low. Conclusion: Social support-based interventions had a small preventive effect on depression. Longer RCTs with a low risk of bias are necessary.

AB  - Background The Syrian conflict has had a profound impact on Syrian children and adolescents. We sought to determine the extent and range of literature on the conflict's health effects on this vulnerable population. Methods A scoping review describing the impact of the Syrian conflict on children was undertaken while utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Extension for Scoping Reviews methodology. Qualitative thematic analyses were undertaken to both identify patterns of morbidity and mortality and gaps in evidence. Results A total of 982 articles meeting search criteria were identified between 1 January 2011 and 30 April 2021. After iterative screening, 12 were identified from academic databases and 4 were identified from grey literature and hand searching, yielding a total of 16 studies for final, full-text analysis. Four distinct themes recurred in the literature; these include children suffering from violent injury, a resurgence of communicable diseases, malnutrition and micronutrient deficiency and impacts on their mental health. Conclusions The health of children and adolescents in Syria has been significantly impacted by the indiscriminate attacks against civilians, flagrant human rights violations and the disintegration of the national health care system. Neonates were largely absent from the literature. The themes from this scoping review can inform health programming priorities by aid organizations.

AB  - Despite the high prevalence and clinical importance of comorbid psychosis in epilepsy, its neurobiological mechanisms remain understudied. This narrative mini-review aims to provide an overview of recent updates in in vivo neuroimaging studies on psychosis in epilepsy, including structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional and molecular imaging, and to discuss future directions in this field. While the conventional morphological analysis of structural MRI has provided relatively inconsistent results, advanced methods, including brain network analysis, hippocampal subregion volumetry, and machine learning models, have recently provided novel findings. Diffusion MRI, for example, has revealed a reduction in white matter integrity mainly in the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as a disruption of brain white matter networks. Functional neuroimaging, such as perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), often identifies hyperactivity in various brain regions. The current limitations of these more recent studies may include small and sometimes heterogeneous samples, insufficient control groups, the effects of psychoactive drugs, and the lack of longitudinal analysis. Further investigations are required to establish novel treatments and identify clinical diagnostic or disease-monitoring biomarkers in psychosis in epilepsy.

AB  - Background Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal-recessive disorder that manifests in paralysis and skeletal muscle weaknesses. This neuromuscular problem is caused by degeneration of the spinal cord anterior horn cells. Main body of the abstract SMA leads to a decreased motoric function that affects patients' daily activity and eventually induces the psychological burden. Given the increasing psychological burden of the patients and their families, this review summarizes the studies assessing the psychological burden of SMA patients and their families. We aimed to highlight the leading causes of their psychological burden. We systematically searched literature from the period 2011 to 2020 in two electronic databases by using the keywords "Spinal Muscular Atrophy", "Psychology", "Caregivers", and "Burden", then filtered it with the eligibility criteria and screened the abstract of the studies. By searching, screening, and filtering the studies, we included seven studies in this review. This review showed an increasing psychological burden in SMA patients, moreover for the parents. The dependency mainly causes the psychological burden since they eagerly struggle to achieve an everyday life. Conclusion Health professionals' understanding capability regarding the mental condition of patients and their families is a potential aspect that can create better care. This review is encouraging for researchers and clinicians to have an enormous understanding of SMA.

AB  - Self-regulation, the ability to control thoughts, emotions, and behavior for goal-directed activities, shows rapid development in infancy, toddlerhood, and preschool periods. Early self-regulatory skills predict later academic achievement and socioemotional adjustment. An increasing number of studies suggest that screen media use may have negative effects on children's developing self-regulatory skills. In this systematic review, we summarized and integrated the findings of the studies investigating the relationship between young children's screen media use and their self-regulation. We searched the ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science databases and identified 39 relevant articles with 45 studies. We found that screen time in infancy is negatively associated with self-regulation, but findings were more inconsistent for later ages suggesting that screen time does not adequately capture the extent of children's screen media use. The findings further indicated that background TV is negatively related to children's self-regulation, and watching fantastical content seems to have immediate negative effects on children's self-regulatory skills. We suggest that future studies should take the content and context of children's screen media use into account and also focus on parent- and home-related factors such as parental behaviors that foster the development of self-regulatory skills.

AB  - Background According to the perseverative cognition (PC) hypothesis, the repetitive chronic activation of the cognitive representations of stressors are associated with a concomitant prolonged and sustained physiological stress response, including sleep disruption. Purpose We conducted a systematic review and structural equation modeling meta-analysis (meta-SEM) on PC as mediator of the association between perceived stress and subjective sleep disturbance (i.e., difficulties falling asleep or maintaining sleep). Methods PubMed, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, and PsycInfo were searched up to September 2021. To test mediation, only longitudinal studies assessing the predictor (perceived stress) at T0, the mediator (PC) at T1, and the outcome (sleep disturbance) at T2, were eligible. Results Findings on 3,733 individuals (k = 8) showed a significant component effect of perceived stress on PC (beta = 0.340, p < .001), which in turn was related to sleep disturbance (beta = 0.258, p < .001). The direct effect of stress on sleep disturbance was significant (beta = 0.133, p < .001). Lastly, the indirect effect between stress and sleep disturbance via PC supported the mediation hypothesis (beta = 0.09, 95% CI 0.078-0.100). The mediation path remained significant (beta = 0.03, 95% CI 0.020-0.036) after adjusting for baseline sleep disturbance. Further leave-one-out sensitivity and control analyses confirmed that all direct and indirect effects were not driven by any single study included in the meta-analysis, as well as their robustness when controlling for sex and age, respectively. Conclusions Overall, results of this meta-analysis indicate that PC may be one of the mechanisms explaining how perceived stressful experiences lead to subjective sleep disturbance.
   Lay Summary The repetitive chronic activation of the cognitive representations of stressors, known as perseverative cognition (PC), is associated with a concomitant prolonged and sustained physiological stress response, with may include sleep disturbance. This study investigates the mediating role of PC in the association between perceived stress and subjective indices of sleep disturbance using structural equation modeling meta-analysis (meta-SEM).

Findings on eight studies (n = 3,733 individuals) showed a significant component effect of perceived stress on PC, which in turn was related to sleep disturbance. The direct effect of stress on sleep disturbance was significant. Finally, the indirect effect between stress and sleep disturbance via PC supported the mediation hypothesis. Results of this meta-analysis suggest that PC may be one of the mechanisms explaining how perceived stressful experiences lead to subjective sleep disturbance.

Studies (n = 4) reporting on ischaemic stroke and major bleeding events were included in the meta-analysis. Data extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Discrepancies were resolved by consulting a third reviewer.Results: Low rates of AF were reported among people with SMI suggesting under-recognition or recording gaps. People with SMI and AF were less likely to receive oral anticoagulation therapy compared to the general pop-ulation. When receiving warfarin, those with bipolar disorder experienced poor anticoagulation control as measured by time in INR therapeutic range. Pooled analysis of risk estimates showed that in patients with identified AF, SMI was not significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (HR: 1.09; 95%CI: 0.85 to 1.40; I2 = 60%, p = 0.04) or major bleeding (HR: 1.11; 95%CI: 0.95 to 1.28; I2 = 57%, p = 0.03) when adjusted for underlying stroke and bleeding risks using the CHA2DS2VASc and HASBLED scales respectively.Conclusion: More research is needed to examine the prevalence, management and outcomes of AF in this pop-ulation, and to evaluate the effect of the introduction of the novel anti-coagulants on these metrics over time.

AB  - Purpose Fitspiration (also known as "fitspo") aims to inspire individuals to exercise and have healthy habits, but emerging research indicates that exposure to it can have a negative impact on body image. This study aims to analyze the relationship between individuals' exposure to fitspiration content and body image measures or associated variables (e.g., appearance comparison). Materials and methods A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed papers published in English between 2000 and August 2022 was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar, based on the PICOS model. To be included, studies had to analyze the relationship between exposure to fitspiration content (I) and body image or associated variables (O) in adolescents and adults (P). Study methodological quality was assessed using an adaptation of the EPHPP Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Outcome data were synthesized narratively and by vote counting. Results Twenty articles met the eligibility criteria and were included. Nineteen studies analyzed the relationship between fitspiration and body image, twelve analyzed the association between exposure to fitspiration and physical appearance comparison tendencies, and nine analyzed the association between fitspiration content and mood. One study analyzed the association between frequency of viewing fitspiration content and motives for exercise. Results showed that exposure to "fitspiration" increased individuals' body dissatisfaction, physical appearance comparisons, and negative mood, especially in younger populations. Conclusions Fitspiration has been seen as a new and prolific digital trend, considered beneficial for health. However, our results showed that fitspo is associated with negative body image, especially in younger populations that are more exposed to this content. Most of the studies were conducted in females and young age participants, which limits the extrapolation of results by gender and age. Future studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings.

AB  - Objective. - The effectiveness of programs integrating trained and paid peer helpers on symptoms, quality of life and recovery of persons with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia is still poorly understood. The factors influencing the integration of peer helpers into healthcare teams are also poorly understood.Method. - A systematic review of the literature was performed. We systematically searched multiple electronic databases for articles: (i) exploring the effectiveness of the intervention of trained and paid peer helpers in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (ii) reporting barriers and facilitators to the integration of peer helpers.Results. - Forty-eight articles were included, 24 on the effectiveness of the intervention of peer helpers, 18 on barriers and 13 on facilitators to the integration of peer helpers in health teams. Of them, 25 were based upon qualitative methods (7 concerning the effectiveness of the intervention of peer helpers, 14 the barriers and 7 the facilitators to their integration); 23 were based upon quantitative methods (9 studies focused on the effectiveness of peer helper intervention, 2 on barriers and 6 on integration facilitators). The 23 quantitative studies included 8 randomized controlled trials.Conclusion. - In spite of their heterogeneity, the results suggest that that interventions of peer helpers have a positive impact on the recovery, quality of life, social functioning, physical health and clinical outcome of persons with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. The results also showed that the integration of peer helpers is favored by caregivers' awareness about the role of peer helpers and knowledge about the recovery model. The results highlight the need for peer helpers to have a well-defined role and to be supervised, preferably by another peer helper.(c) 2022

AB  - In recent years, the field of psychology has received more attention from researchers that work in the area of translation studies. This review set out to delve into the role of translation students' critical thinking, as a construct of cognitive psychology, and emotion regulation, as a positive psychological construct, in translation performance. The positive and significant relationship between translation students' critical thinking skill and their translation performance has been verified in the literature. Moreover, studies have revealed that emotion regulation and its regulator components, such as emotional intelligence, intuition, resilience, and professional expertise can significantly influence translation performance. This review can be beneficial for translation trainees, translation trainers, and curriculum designers to raise their awareness about the role of critical thinking and emotion regulation in translation studies.

AB  - With the respect to the key factors, namely the psychological state of individuals and organizations, psychological capital (PsyCap) is widely used in various fields, such as management decisions and organizational behavior. To fully show the related studies and their knowledge development and mapping path, in this paper, we examine 2,786 papers about the PsyCap related research from 1970 to 2021. Based on the bibliometric analysis and main path demonstration (the tools are Cite-Space and Pajke, respectively), we derive some conclusions as follows: (1) the publication number about the PsyCap study is growing rapidly and it is a highly cross-cutting research topic. (2) The main authors come from Australia, the United States, and China, and also are the core researchers. (3) Refinement and measurement in the PsyCap study are constant and hot topics. (4) Stress, performance and well-being issues among students, health care workers and corporate employees are core research themes, and team organization, creativity, innovation, and COVID-19 are hot topics in this field. The bibliometric analysis are quantitatively analyzed to provide scholars with a more comprehensive insight into PsyCap research. The main path demonstration helps scholars to understand the main lines and key nodes of development in the field of psychological capital.

AB  - AimsPeople with severe mental illness (SMI) have a greater risk of dying from colorectal cancer (CRC), even though the incidence is lower or similar to that of the general population This pattern is unlikely to be solely explained by lifestyle factors, while the role of differences in cancer healthcare access or treatment is uncertain MethodsWe undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis on access to guideline-appropriate care following CRC diagnosis in people with SMI including the receipt of surgery, chemo- or radiotherapy. We searched for full-text articles indexed by PubMed, EMBASE, PsychInfo and CINAHL that compared CRC treatment in those with and without pre-existing SMI (schizophrenia, schizoaffective, bipolar and major affective disorders). Designs included cohort or population-based case-control designs. ResultsThere were ten studies (sample size = 3501-591 561). People with SMI had a reduced likelihood of surgery (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.92-0.97; p = 0.005; k = 4). Meta-analyses were not possible for the other outcomes but in results from individual studies, people with SMI were less likely to receive radiotherapy, chemotherapy or sphincter-sparing procedures. The disparity in care was greatest for those who had been psychiatric inpatients. ConclusionsPeople with SMI, including both psychotic and affective disorders, receive less CRC care than the general population. This might contribute to higher case-fatality rates for an illness where the incidence is no higher than that of the general population. The reasons for this require further investigation, as does the extent to which differences in treatment access or quality contribute to excess CRC mortality in people with SMI.

AB  - Muscles are the actuators of all human actions, from daily work and life to communication and expression of emotions. Myography records the signals from muscle activities as an interface between machine hardware and human wetware, granting direct and natural control of our electronic peripherals. Regardless of the significant progression as of late, the conventional myographic sensors are still incapable of achieving the desired high-resolution and non-invasive recording. This paper presents a critical review of state-of-the-art wearable sensing technologies that measure deeper muscle activity with high spatial resolution, so-called super-resolution. This paper classifies these myographic sensors according to the different signal types (i.e., biomechanical, biochemical, and bioelectrical) they record during measuring muscle activity. By describing the characteristics and current developments with advantages and limitations of each myographic sensor, their capabilities are investigated as a super-resolution myography technique, including: (i) non-invasive and high-density designs of the sensing units and their vulnerability to interferences, (ii) limit-of-detection to register the activity of deep muscles. Finally, this paper concludes with new opportunities in this fast-growing super-resolution myography field and proposes promising future research directions. These advances will enable next-generation muscle-machine interfaces to meet the practical design needs in real-life for healthcare technologies, assistive/rehabilitation robotics, and human augmentation with extended reality.

AB  - N-alpha-acetylation is a frequently occurring post-translational modification in eukaryotic proteins. It has manifold physiological consequences on the regulation and function of several proteins, with emerging studies suggesting that it is a global regulator of stress responses. For decades, in vitro biochemical investigations into the precise role of the intrinsically disordered protein alpha-synuclein (alpha S) in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) were performed using non-acetylated alpha S. The N-terminus of alpha-synuclein is now unequivocally known to be acetylated in vivo, however, there are many aspects of this post-translational modifications that are not understood well. Is N-alpha-acetylation of alpha S a constitutive modification akin to most cellular proteins, or is it spatio-temporally regulated? Is N-alpha-acetylation of alpha S relevant to the as yet elusive function of alpha S? How does the N-alpha-acetylation of alpha S influence the aggregation of alpha S into amyloids? Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge and discuss prevailing hypotheses on the impact of N-alpha-acetylation of alpha S on its conformational, oligomeric, and fibrillar states. The extent to which N-alpha-acetylation of alpha S is vital for its function, membrane binding, and aggregation into amyloids is also explored here. We further discuss the overall significance of N-alpha-acetylation of alpha S for its functional and pathogenic implications in Lewy body formation and synucleinopathies.

KW  - THERMOELASTICITY
KW  - WAVES
AB  - In this study, a novel model is introduced when the Hall effect associated with a strong magnetic field is taken into account when the electrons and holes interact in the processes of semiconductor material. The plasma-elastic-thermal waves are investigated in the context of diffusive processes during optical-generated transport processes. The variable of thermal conductivity is obtained during graduated temperature due to the thermal impact of fallen light. The governing equations of the novel model are investigated in a unidimensional (1D) way when the electronics and elastic deformations have occurred. The Laplace transforms are used to convert the main dimensionless physical fields according to the initial conditions into the Laplace domain. When certain thermal, mechanical, holes, and electronic conditions are used, the analytical solutions of the fundamental fields can be produced to the outer surface of the semiconductor medium. Mathematically, the Laplacian computational inversion algorithm with a numerical approximation is used to achieve the fundamental physical quantities numerically in the time domain. The influences of several parameters (thermal relaxation times, Hall impact, and thermal conductivity parameters) on thermal conditions, mechanical stress, holes charge carrier field, and carrier density are prescribed with the help of graphical diagrams that are discussed theoretically.

AB  - This systematic review aims to discover the plausible mechanism of Ozone in A.D., to boost translational research. The main focus of our review lies in understanding the effects of ozone pollution on the human brain and causing degenerative disease. Owing to the number of works carried out as preclinical evidence in associ-ation with oxidative stress and Alzheimer's disease and the lack of systematic review or meta-analysis prompted us to initiate a study on Alzheimer's risk due to ground-level ozone. We found relevant studies from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Proquest, DOAJ, and Scopus, narrowing to animal studies and the English language without any time limit. The searches will be re-run before the final analysis. This work was registered in Prospero with Reg ID CRD42022319360, followed the PRISMA-P framework, and followed the PICO approach involving Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison, and Outcomes data. Bibliographic details of 16 included studies were studied for Exposure dose of ozone, duration, exposure, and frequency with control and exposure groups. Pri-mary and secondary outcomes were assessed based on pathology significance, and results were significant in inducing Alzheimer-like pathology by ozone. In conclusion, ozone altered oxidative stress, metabolic pathway, and amyloid plaque accumulation besides endothelial stress response involving mitochondria as the critical factor in ATP degeneration, caspase pathway, and neuronal damage. Thus, ozone is a criteria pollutant to be focused on in mitigating Alzheimer's Disease pathology.

AB  - Nowadays speech synthesis or text to speech (TTS), an ability of system to produce human like natural sounding voice from the written text, is gaining popularity in the field of speech processing. For any TTS, intelligibility and naturalness are the two important measures for defining the quality of a synthesized sound which is highly dependent on the prosody modeling using acoustic model of synthesizer. The purpose of this review survey is firstly to study and analyze the various approaches used traditionally (articulatory synthesis, formant synthesis, concatenative speech synthesis and statistical parametric techniques based on hidden Markov model) and recently (statistical parametric based on deep learning approaches) for acoustic modeling with their pros and cons. The approaches based on deep learning to build the acoustic model has significantly contributed to the advancement of TTS as models based on deep learning are capable of modelling the complex context dependencies in the input data. Apart from these, this article also reviews the TTS approaches for generating speech with different voices and emotions to makes the TTS more realistic to use. It also addresses the subjective and objective metrics used to measure the quality of the synthesized voice. Various well known speech synthesis systems based on autoregressive and non-autoregressive models such as Tacotron, Deep Voice, WaveNet, Parallel WaveNet, Parallel Tacotron, FastSpeech by global tech-giant Google, Facebook, Microsoft employed the architecture of deep learning for end-to-end speech waveform generation and attained a remarkable mean opinion score (MOS).

AB  - Coal mine pollution is a serious threat to the mine safe production and occupational health of miners. Chemical dust suppression can effectively reduce the concentration of coal dust and suppress the re-entrainment of dust. This paper discusses the research progress of three kinds of traditional dust suppressants: the wetting-type, cohesive type, and condensed type. In order to meet dust suppression and environmental protection requirements, 7 kinds of new type dust suppressants, such as compound, ecological environmental protection, polymer, functional, microbes, and enzymes, have been developed by the predecessors. And all kinds of dust suppressant mechanism and main performance index have been summarized. Through the analysis of the research results from 1985 to 2021, it is found that the compound and environment-friendly dust suppressants have gradually become the research focus in this field, accounting for 17.93% and 26.21% of the total number of achievements. In the recent 5 years, new materials, such as microbe suppressant, urease suppressant, and nanomaterials, have gradually emerged. Because of their natural and environmental protection characteristics, it could be predicted that they will become the future development trend in this field. However, there are still some problems to be improved, such as expensive price and complex preparation technology.

AB  - Background Exposure to endocrine disruptors, such as phthalates, may impact bone mineral density (BMD) through a variety of mechanisms. Studies of phthalate exposure and BMD in humans are scarce. Objectives To synthesize published data on the association between phthalate metabolites and BMD in humans and to provide methodological suggestions for future research. Methods A single investigator searched PubMed for relevant studies, including observational studies of phthalate exposure and BMD in children and postmenopausal women. Twelve studies were screened with 5 meeting the eligibility criteria and included for review. A quality assessment form was used as a quality measure and key information was extracted from the included studies. Results In one prospective study among postmenopausal women, higher levels of monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP) and monocarboxynonyl phthalate (MCNP) were significantly associated with lower BMD among nonusers of hormone therapy (HT). In cross-sectional studies of postmenopausal women, monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) were negatively associated with BMD, and MCNP was positively associated with BMD, but these results were not replicated across studies. In studies of fetal exposure to phthalates and childhood BMD, significant positive associations between MCPP and BMD in children at age 12 years were found in 1 study, while associations were null in the other study. Conclusions Studies among postmenopausal women provide suggestive evidence of an association between urinary phthalate metabolite concentration and decreased BMD. Results from studies of childhood BMD are inconclusive given the limited data and their limitations. More research is needed to address limitations and further investigate the association between phthalate exposure and human BMD.

AB  - IntroductionThere has been growing interest in using real-time location systems (RTLS) in residential care settings. This technology has clinical applications for locating residents within a care unit and as a nurse call system, and can also be used to gather information about movement, location, and activity over time. RTLS thus provides health data to track markers of health and wellbeing and augment healthcare decisions. To date, no reviews have examined the potential use of RTLS data in caring for older adults with cognitive impairment living in a residential care setting. ObjectiveThis scoping review aims to explore the use of data from real-time locating systems (RTLS) technology to inform clinical measures and augment healthcare decision-making in the care of older adults with cognitive impairment who live in residential care settings. MethodsEmbase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), APA PsycINFO (Ovid) and IEEE Xplore databases were searched for published English-language articles that reported the results of studies that investigated RTLS technologies in persons aged 50 years or older with cognitive impairment who were living in a residential care setting. Included studies were summarized, compared and synthesized according to the study outcomes. ResultsA total of 27 studies were included. RTLS data were used to assess activity levels, characterization of wandering, cognition, social interaction, and to monitor a resident's health and wellbeing. These RTLS-based measures were not consistently validated against clinical measurements or clinically important outcomes, and no studies have examined their effectiveness or impact on decision-making. ConclusionThis scoping review describes how data from RTLS technology has been used to support clinical care of older adults with dementia. Research efforts have progressed from using the data to track activity levels to, most recently, using the data to inform clinical decision-making and as a predictor of delirium. Future studies are needed to validate RTLS-based health indices and examine how these indices can be used to inform decision-making.

AB  - Despite their increasing ubiquity in people's lives and incredible advantages in instantly interacting with others, social media's impact on subjective well-being is a source of concern worldwide and calls for up-to-date investigations of the role social media plays in mental health. Much research has discovered how habitual social media use may lead to addiction and negatively affect adolescents' school performance, social behavior, and interpersonal relationships. The present study was conducted to review the extant literature in the domain of social media and analyze global research productivity during 2013-2022. Bibliometric analysis was conducted on 501 articles that were extracted from the Scopus database using the keywords social media addiction and problematic social media use. The data were then uploaded to VOSviewer software to analyze citations, co-citations, and keyword co-occurrences. Volume, growth trajectory, geographic distribution of the literature, influential authors, intellectual structure of the literature, and the most prolific publishing sources were analyzed. The bibliometric analysis presented in this paper shows that the US, the UK, and Turkey accounted for 47% of the publications in this field. Most of the studies used quantitative methods in analyzing data and therefore aimed at testing relationships between variables. In addition, the findings in this study show that most analysis were cross-sectional. Studies were performed on undergraduate students between the ages of 19-25 on the use of two social media platforms: Facebook and Instagram. Limitations as well as research directions for future studies are also discussed.

AB  - The research and clinical applications of exercise therapy to the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasing. Pain is among the important symptoms affecting the daily motor function and quality of life of PD patients. This paper reviewed the progress of research on different exercise therapies for the management of pain caused by PD and described the role and mechanism of exercise therapy for pain relief. Aerobic exercise, strength exercise, and mind-body exercise play an effective role in pain management in PD patients. The pain suffered by PD patients is divided into central neuropathic, peripheral neuropathic, and nociceptive pain. Different types of pain may coexist with different mechanistic backgrounds and treatments. The analgesic mechanisms of exercise intervention in PD-induced pain include altered cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity, the attenuation of neuronal apoptosis, and dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic analgesic pathways, as well as the inhibition of oxidative stress. Current studies related to exercise interventions for PD-induced pain suffer from small sample sizes and inadequate research of analgesic mechanisms. The neurophysiological effects of exercise, such as neuroplasticity, attenuation of neuronal apoptosis, and dopaminergic analgesic pathway provide a sound biological mechanism for using exercise in pain management. However, large, well-designed randomized controlled trials with improved methods and reporting are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of exercise therapy for PD pain.

AB  - Background The management of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure is a major global health challenge, particularly among the most disadvantaged populations. Beyond the biomedical management of these diseases, comprehensive support that takes into account the peoples' economic and social situation is fundamental. The objective of this scoping review is to create an inventory and an analysis of the different types of support for these chronic diseases among disadvantaged, immigrant or minority populations to contribute to a better definition and characterization of what should be global support for these vulnerable populations suffering from these diseases. Methods A search of PubMed, PsycINFO, Sages Journals and Web of Science was conducted (between March and May 2021) for articles published between January 2000 and May 2021. Articles were selected after screening titles, abstracts and full texts according to our 5 inclusion criteria. Results We included 16 articles. The diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure support programs described in these articles operate to improve physical and mental health and access to care. The approaches of these interventions are focused on the training and participation of people and the implementation of support actions adapted to the person. The majority of these interventions have a real attachment to the community. Conclusions This review of the literature shows that support for people with chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity or high blood pressure is based on three pillars: empowerment, peer mediation and holistic and tailor-made support for the individual. The empowerment approach, which considers the capacities and resources of individuals and whose goal is to strengthen their ability to act on their health, appears to be entirely suited to the support of these chronic diseases. This review underlines the importance of moving away from a biomedical approach to a holistic approach truly focused on the person, their capacities and their needs.

AB  - The aim of this review is to investigate the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cognitive decline in distinct cognitive domains, and to perform a complementary study description through the bibliometric analysis. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched from inception to 15 December 2021 to identify longitudinal studies that examined the association of MetS with incident decline, in order to prevent reverse causality. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis checklist was used to conduct the present systematic review. Thirty studies were included and results were analyzed across the cognitive domains of global cognition, memory, executive functions, attention, visuoconstructive abilities, and language. The majority of the studies reviewed did not report statistically significant results for most cognitive domains investigated, and decline in specific cognitive domains was not consistently associated with the presence of MetS. Meta-analyses were not conducted due to the high degree of between-study heterogeneity regarding the MetS definitions, the cognitive domains examined, the specific tests used for each cognitive domain and the different measures of association used. Bibliometric analysis revealed that most studies are conducted by research teams from USA and China, and that cognitive tasks that reflect real-life abilities are rarely examined. Future studies should employ larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, a global consensus for MetS definition and standardized tests of the above mentioned cognitive domains as well as problem-solving tasks with high sensitivity and specificity to clarify the impact of MetS on cognition and its underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Aims Mental health-related stigma and discrimination are a complex and widespread issue with negative effects on numerous aspects of life of people with lived experience of mental health conditions. Research shows that social contact is the best evidence-based intervention to reduce stigma. Within the context of a rapid development of remote technology, and COVID-19-related restrictions for face-to-face contact, the aim of this paper is to categorise, compare and define indirect social contact (ISC) interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination in mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods MEDLINE, Global Health, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched using a strategy including terms related to 'stigma and discrimination', 'intervention', 'indirect social contact', 'mental health' and 'low- and middle-income countries'. Relevant information on ISC interventions was extracted from the included articles, and a quality assessment was conducted. Emerging themes were coded using a thematic synthesis method, and a narrative synthesis was undertaken to present the results. Results Nine studies were included in the review overall. One study was ineffective; this was not considered for the categorisation of interventions, and it was considered separately for the comparison of interventions. Of the eight effective studies included in synthesis, interventions were categorised by content, combination of stigma-reducing strategies, medium of delivery, delivery agents, target condition and population, as well as by active or passive interaction and follow-up. Most of the interventions used education and ISC. Recovery and personal experience were important content components as all studies included either one or both. Cultural adaptation and local relevance were also important considerations. Conclusions ISC interventions were effective in overall terms for both the general public and healthcare providers, including medical students. A new definition of ISC interventions in LMICs is proposed. More research and better reporting of intervention details are needed to explore the effectiveness of ISC strategies in LMICs, especially in regions where little relevant research has been conducted.

AB  - This systematic review assesses participatory approaches to motivating positive change among health workers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The mistreatment of clients at health centres has been extensively documented, causing stress among clients, health complications and even avoidance of health centres altogether. Health workers, too, face challenges, including medicine shortages, task shifting, inadequate training and a lack of managerial support. Solutions are urgently needed to realise global commitments to quality primary healthcare, country ownership and universal health coverage. This review searched 1243 titles and abstracts, of which 32 were extracted for full text review using a published critical assessment tool. Eight papers were retained for final review, all using a single methodology, 'Health Workers for Change' (HWFC). The intervention was adapted to diverse geographical and health settings. Nine indicators from the included studies were assessed, eliciting many common findings and documenting an overall positive impact of the HWFC approach. Health workers acknowledged their negative behaviour towards clients, often as a way of coping with their own unmet needs. In most settings they developed action plans to address these issues. Recommendations are made on mainstreaming HWFC into health systems in LMICs and its potential application to alleviating stress and burnout from COVID-19.

AB  - BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the vulnerabilities of certain groups of people have been highlighted, such as people with intellectual disability (ID). Although related research on ID has developed rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the quantitative analysis of those research results has not been systematically performed through bibliometric analysis. Bibliometric analysis is a useful and rigorous method to explore large volumes of research data, and it allows researchers to extract quantitative information on distribution by author, time, country, and journal. AimThe aim of the present study is to comprehensively analyze the current status and developing trends in publications on ID research related to and conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA bibliometric analysis was performed using the Web of Science database. Biblioshiny software was used to analyze and visualize the following information: main information of dataset, annual scientific production, journals which published the most relevant sources, most-cited authors, most-cited countries, most-cited global documents, word-cloud of keywords authors have used, and both the co-occurrence and co-citation networks. ResultsA total of 450 publications were included. The average number of citations per document was 5.104. Among the top three journals, Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities published 32 articles, Journal of Intellectual Disability Research published 29 articles, and British Journal of Learning Disabilities published 17 articles. The article with the title COVID-19 and People with Intellectual Disability: Impact of a Pandemic was the most cited with total 144 citations The United Kingdom had the most publications and had strong cooperative relationships with the United States, Canada, and Australia. The most popular keywords included mental health, autism, developmental disability, and lockdown. Thematic map analysis identified several possible clusters, including telemedicine, physical activities, and mental health. ConclusionThe present study provides a better understanding in this research field and may help clinicians, researchers and stakeholders to obtain more comprehensive view of ID and COVID-19. The insights gained from this analysis could inform future research.

AB  - tRFs are small tRNA derived fragments that are emerging as novel therapeutic targets and regulatory molecules in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders. These are derived from precursor or mature tRNA, forming different subtypes that have been reported to be involved in neurological disorders like stroke, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, Parkinson's, MELAS, autism, and Huntington's disorder. tRFs were earlier believed to be random degradation debris of tRNAs. The significant variation in the expression level of tRFs in disease conditions indicates their salient role as key players in regulation of these disorders. Various animal studies are being carried out to decipher their exact role; however, more inputs are required to transform this research knowledge into clinical application. Future investigations also call for high-throughput technologies that could help to bring out the other hidden aspects of these entities. However, studies on tRFs require further research efforts to overcome the challenges posed in quantifying tRFs, their interactions with other molecules, and the exact mechanism of function. In this review, we are abridging the current understanding of tRFs, including their biogenesis, function, relevance in clinical therapies, and potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of these neurological disorders.

AB  - Background The risk for problematic gambling and associated high-risk behaviors is elevated during adolescence and emerging adulthood. Activities with gambling-like features and novel forms of gambling may place youth at an increased risk for problem gambling. Aim and method The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the association between both activities with gambling-like features and novel gambling activities and problem gambling among youth while examining the role of psychopathology and cognitive processes. Six databases (PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, Social Work Abstracts, Technology Collection, and Scopus) were searched in November 2021 for peer-reviewed articles investigating the association between the aforementioned variables among youth up to the age of 25 years. Risk of bias was assessed using the Observational Study Quality Evaluation. Findings Forty-five articles were included in the review. Positive associations were observed between engagement in activities with gambling-like features (e.g., video games, social casino games, loot boxes) and problem gambling. Increased involvement with novel forms of gambling (e.g., online sports betting, fantasy sports, and esports betting) were also associated with a greater risk for problematic gambling. Males reported higher rates of engagement in these activities and a greater risk of problem gambling than females. Impulsivity, risk taking, cognitive distortions, and specific emotional vulnerabilities were associated with an increased risk of problem gambling. Conclusions Despite the need for additional longitudinal research controlling for relevant confounders, these findings underline how engagement in activities with gambling-like features are relevant in the developmental trajectory toward problem gambling.

KW  - China
KW  - EMPLOYEE ALIENATION
AB  - Background: Work alienation is a common feeling of estrangement from the work and its context. Nurses are prone to feel alienated due to the high risk of infection, heavy workload, and the persistence of stress at high levels. Work alienation has serious negative outcomes, organizationally as well as personally. In recent years, the issue of work alienation among nurses has received considerable attention in China, but no systematic reviews have yet been published and its epidemiological status among Chinese nurses remains unclear. Objective: To systematically evaluate the status and distribution characteristics of work alienation among nurses in China. Methods: CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, CENTRAL, Wanfang, SinoMed, CNKI, and VIP were searched for cross-sectional studies before 10 January 2022 on the current status of work alienation among nurses. Two investigators independently screened the articles, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of literature bias. Stata16.0 software was used for analysis. Results: A total of 12 studies were included, with 7,265 nurses involved. Meta-analysis results showed that the score of work alienation was 35.43 [95%CI (31.82, 39.04)]. Subgroup analysis showed that the scores of male and female nurses were 37.62 and 35.79 respectively; the scores of junior, undergraduate, and graduate nurses were 34.90, 37.15, and 40.02 respectively; the scores of primary, intermediate, and senior nurses were 36.95, 35.38, and 33.11 respectively; the scores of unmarried andmarried nurses were 38.59 and 36.70 respectively; the scores of nurses who had worked for 1 similar to <6 years, 6 similar to 10 years, and more than 10 years were 37.46, 36.69, and 32.89 respectively; the scores of nurses with salary <5,000 yuan, 5,000 similar to 10,000 yuan, and more than 10,000 yuan were 40.25, 37.19 and 34.52 respectively; and the scores of nurses in emergency department and intensive care units, internal medicine, surgery, and pediatrics were 37.25, 38.73, 36.28, and 31.98 respectively. Conclusion: Chinese nurses had a moderate level of work alienation. The scores of nurses in the following categories were quite high: male, higher education levels, low-professional titles, unmarried, shorter clinical working time, lower income, working in internal medicine, and working in the emergency department and intensive care units. Managers should take e ective measures as soon as possible to reduce the occurrence of nurses' sense of work alienation.

AB  - Horticultural crops are used for a variety of purposes, including nourishment and aesthetics. Human nutrition relies heavily on these plants for carbohydrates, proteins, organic acids, vitamins, and minerals. Drought, flood, nutrient inadequacy, heat, light, metal stress, and other abiotic stresses restrict crop plant development and output. A variety of tactics are used to improve abiotic stress tolerance, including the production of genetically modified cultivars by incorporating gene constructions to improve performance under stress. Nanotechnology is a multifaceted field that could be applied in every branch of research comprising medicine, industry and agriculture. Soil and water nanoremediation, plant nanoprotection and plant nanonutrition are some of the agricultural applications. To accomplish sustainable progress in horticultural plants challenged with various environmental challenges, numerous definitive directions have been developed to secure public acceptance and convenient utilization of nanoparticles. Even with the rapid increase in nanoparticle use in several applications, there is still a dearth of information on the actual outcomes of nanoparticle interaction with plants. This review assesses the role of nanomaterials in horticultural crops under abiotic stress, with a focus on recent research. In addition, this review focuses on explaining the broad roles of several nanoparticles in enhancing abiotic stress tolerance in horticulture plants.

AB  - Background Smartphone addiction has become a social problem that affects the healthy growth of adolescents, and it is frequently reported to be correlated with self-esteem, self-control, and social support among adolescents.
   Methods A meta-analysis was conducted by searching the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WANFANG DATA, and Chongqing VIP Information Co., Ltd. (VIP) databases. Stata 16.0 was used to analyse the overall effect and test the moderating effect.
   Results Fifty-six studies were included, involving a total of 42,300 participants. Adolescents' smartphone addiction had a moderately negative correlation with self-esteem (r = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.29 to -0.22, p < 0.001), a strong negative correlation with self-control (r = -0.48, 95% CI = -0.53 to -0.42, p < 0.001), and a weak negative correlation with social support (r = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.23 to -0.09, p < 0.001). Moderation analysis revealed that the correlation between adolescents' smartphone addiction and self-esteem was strongest when smartphone addiction was measured with the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale for College Students (MPATS; r = -0.38). The correlation between adolescents' smartphone addiction and self-control was strongest when self-control was measured with the Middle school students' Self-control Ability Questionnaire (MSAQ; r = -0.62). The effect of dissertations on smartphone addiction, self-control, and social support among adolescents was significantly larger than that of journal articles. The correlation between adolescents' smartphone addiction and social support was strongest when smartphone addiction was measured with the Mobile Phone Addiction Index (MPAI; r = -0.24). However, the correlations between adolescents' smartphone addiction and self-esteem, self-control, and social support were not affected by age or gender.
   Conclusion There was a strong relationship between smartphone addiction and self-esteem, self-control, and social support among adolescents. In the future, longitudinal research should be carried out to better investigate the dynamic changes in therelationship between smartphone addiction and self-esteem, self-control, and social support.

AB  - Introduction: Parental conditional regard involves parents giving or withdrawing affection and approval, depending on children's and adolescents' compliance with parental expectations, to shape behaviors and traits. Research grounded in self-determination theory suggests parental conditional regard harms psychological development. Using self-determination theory as a theoretical foundation for investigating outcomes associated with parental conditional regard, the present study consolidated meta-analytic associations between parental conditional regard and four theoretically important individual difference correlates: introjected self-regulation, contingent self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and relatedness.
   Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted using the PsycINFO, ProQuest, and EBSCO databases for English-language, peer-reviewed published studies and unpublished studies. Eligible studies reported an association between parental conditional regard and the four theoretically derived correlates or another correlate of interest in pre-adolescent children, adolescents, or young adults. The results were based on a random-effects model for meta-analyses and the Q statistic for moderator analyses.
   Results: Across 31 samples in total, greater parental conditional regard was significantly associated with more introjected regulation (r = .33), contingent self-esteem (r = .29), and level of depressive symptoms (r = .22); and less relatedness (r = -.24). Moderator results for parental conditional regard type found parental conditional regard's association with introjected regulation was significantly stronger for studies measuring giving regard (parental conditional positive regard) than withdrawing regard (parental conditional negative regard). The association of parental conditional regard with depressive symptoms was significantly stronger for studies measuring parental conditional negative regard than parental conditional positive regard.
   Conclusions: The meta-analytic results provide theoretical and empirical support for the connections between self-determination and the impact of parental conditional regard.

AB  - Background: Heautoscopy refers to a pathological experience of visual reduplication of one's body with an ambiguous sense of self-location and a disturbing sensation of owning the illusory body. It has been recognized to occur in the course of strikingly diverse psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, space-occupying lesions, frequently of the temporal or parietal lobes, migraine, epilepsy, and depression. The literature on the subject suffers from numerous conceptual inconsistencies, scarcity of clinical data, and a lack of theoretical integratory framework that could explain the uniqueness of these symptoms. Aims: In the study, we aimed to review all case reports on heautoscopy we could cull from the literature with an attempt to extract common factors and to foster a theoretical synthesis. Methods: All medical and psychological databases were rigorously searched, along with reference lists of the preselected articles. First-person reports were classified according to aspects of bodily self-consciousness primarily affected: body ownership, self-location, sense of agency and consequently, collated with their etiological backgrounds. Results: Out of over 140 case studies, a total of only 9 patients with heautoscopy were selected as satisfying functional criteria, carefully distinguishing heautoscopy from other typically conflated full-body anomalies: autoscopy, out-of-body experience, or feeling of presence. Numerous cases turned out to be mislabeling autoscopy or out-of-body experience as heautoscopy. In addition, several problems with existing neuroimaging experiments were identified. Conclusion: Phenomenological analysis revealed that from the patients' perspective, heautoscopy resembles a somatesthetic-proprioceptive illusion, rather than a cognitive delusion, and occurs much less frequently than reported. A most peculiar symptom, described by some as a sense of "bilocation, " appears to stem from dynamic shifts in self-location and expanded body ownership, rather than an expanded first-person perspective. Although extremely rare in its pure form, heautoscopy gives a unique opportunity to explore the brain limits to the plasticity of bodily boundaries and the origin of the first-person spatial perspective.

AB  - Nanotechnology (NT) refers to the generation and application of nanoparticles (NPs). Research in NT has been ongoing for several decades and has resulted in a wide range of materials at the nano-scale. Globally, NPs serve various domestic, pharmaceuticals, aviation, textiles, and other industrial purposes. These particles are currently used in kitchen utensils, medical applications, energy-related research, aircraft, etc. The future of our planet depends on NT. Numerous molecular indicators of genetic and autoimmune diseases, malignant tumors, and a wide range of other disorders can currently be diagnosed using NPs. Drug delivery to specific tissues and organs with controlled drug release and accumulation parameters is achieved through NPs. In addition, NPs have been used as active components in some cases. For example, photodynamic therapy's incorporation and heating are photosensitizers and hyper-thermic tumor killing through NPs. Despite numerous beneficiary use and economic success of NPs, their toxic effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have also gained attention. Excessive exposure to NPs in sectors, such as agriculture, industry, etc. has generated negative health effects in humans. The review highlights about NPs in great detail. The paper discusses their sources, usage, toxicity and health effects, transportation, analysis, and treatment. It represents a summary of recent research developments and achievements in the field of NT and substantial gap areas that need to be addressed.

AB  - BackgroundMultiple studies have examined the effects of compulsory community treatment (CCT), amongst them there were three randomized controlled trials (RCT). Overall, they do not find that CCT affects clinical outcomes or reduces the number or duration of hospital admissions more than voluntary care does. Despite these negative findings, in many countries CCT is still used. One of the reasons may be that stakeholders favor a mental health system including CCT. AimThis integrative review investigated the opinions of stakeholders (patients, significant others, mental health workers, and policy makers) about the use of CCT. MethodsWe performed an integrative review; to include all qualitative and quantitative manuscripts on the views of patients, significant others, clinicians and policy makers regarding the use of CCT, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials (via Wiley), and Google Scholar. ResultsWe found 142 studies investigating the opinion of stakeholders (patients, significant others, and mental health workers) of which 55 were included. Of these 55 studies, 29 included opinions of patients, 14 included significant others, and 31 included mental health care workers. We found no studies that included policy makers. The majority in two of the three stakeholder groups (relatives and mental health workers) seemed to support a system that used CCT. Patients were more hesitant, but they generally preferred CCT over admission. All stakeholder groups expressed ambivalence. Their opinions did not differ clearly between those who did and did not have experience with CCT. Advantages mentioned most regarded accessibility of care and a way to remain in contact with patients, especially during times of crisis or deterioration. The most mentioned disadvantage by all stakeholder groups was that CCT restricted autonomy and was coercive. Other disadvantages mentioned were that CCT was stigmatizing and that it focused too much on medication. ConclusionStakeholders had mixed opinions regarding CCT. While a majority seemed to support the use of CCT, they also had concerns, especially regarding the restrictions CCT imposed on patients' freedom and autonomy, stigmatization, and the focus on medication.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on travel and quarantine measures made people turn to self-medication (SM) to control the symptoms of their diseases. Different studies were conducted worldwide on different populations, and their results were different. Therefore, this global systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of self-medication. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases of Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched without a time limit. All eligible observational articles that reported self-medication during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I-2 statistics. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of self-medication. The methodological quality of the articles was evaluated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Fifty-six eligible studies were reviewed. The pooled prevalence of self-medication was 48.6% (95% CI: 42.8-54.3). The highest and lowest prevalence of self-medication was in Asia (53%; 95% CI: 45-61) and Europe (40.8%; 95% CI: 35-46.8). Also, the highest and lowest prevalence of self-medication was related to students (54.5; 95% CI: 40.8-68.3) and healthcare workers (32.5%; 16-49). The prevalence of self-medication in the general population (48.8%; 40.6-57) and in patients with COVID-19 (41.7%; 25.5-58). The prevalence of self-medication was higher in studies that collected data in 2021 than in 2020 (51.2 vs. 48%). Publication bias was not significant (p = 0.320). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, self-medication was highly prevalent, so nearly half of the people self-medicated. Therefore, it seems necessary to provide public education to control the consequences of self-medication.

AB  - The relationship between cognitive demands and postural control is controversial. Mental fatigue paradigms investigate the attentional requirements of postural control by assessing balance after a prolonged cognitive task. However, a majority of mental fatigue research has focused on cognition and sports performance, leaving balance relatively underexamined. The purpose of this paper was to systematically review the existing literature on mental fatigue and balance control. We conducted a comprehensive search on PubMed and Web of Science databases for studies comparing balance performance pre- to post-mental fatigue or between a mental fatigue and control group. The literature search resulted in ten relevant studies including both volitional (n = 7) and reactive (n = 3) balance measures. Mental fatigue was induced by various cognitive tasks which were completed for 20-90 min prior to balance assessment. Mental fatigue affected both volitional and reactive balance, resulting in increased postural sway, decreased accuracy on volitional tasks, delayed responses to perturbations, and less effective balance recovery responses. These effects could have been mediated by the depletion of attentional resources or impaired sensorimotor perception which delayed appropriate balance-correcting responses. However, the current literature is limited by the number of studies and heterogeneous mental fatigue induction methods. Future studies are needed to confirm these postulations and examine the effects of mental fatigue on different populations and postural tasks. This line of research could be clinically relevant to improve safety in occupational settings where individuals complete extremely long durations of cognitive tasks and for the development of effective fall-assessment and fall-prevention paradigms.

AB  - Academic procrastination - habitually delaying work with academic tasks to the extent that the delays become detrimental to performance, wellbeing, and health - represents a substantial personal, systemic, and societal problem. Still, efforts to prevent and reduce it are surprisingly scarce and often offered as treatment regimens rather than preventive efforts. Based on the principles of functional analysis and a broad examination of factors that are important for academic procrastinatory behaviors, this paper aims to describe a strategy for analyzing individual controlling conditions for procrastination and give parallel advice on how to change those controlling conditions. Both are ideographic, allowing for individual and dynamic analyses of factors responsible for instigating and maintaining procrastination, as well as tailor-made remedies that address controlling conditions in preventive and curative efforts to reduce procrastination. Although functional analysis integrates well with important research findings in the procrastination field, this approach suggests new criteria for identifying procrastinatory behaviors and an alternative model for analyzing their control conditions. We conclude that a functional approach may supplement procrastination research and efforts to prevent and alleviate this detrimental habit.

AB  - The prevalence of buying/shopping disorder (B/SD) has been increasing in the last two decades, and this disorder has a substantial negative impact on general functioning and quality of life. Therefore, a systematic review of the studies dedicated to the efficacy and tolerability of therapeutic interventions, both psychological and pharmacological, might help clinicians to decide on the most evidence-based treatment for these patients. In order to further increase the clinical usefulness of the current review, GRADE-based recommendations were formulated, where enough evidence was found to support such an approach. A number of five electronic databases were searched for single case reports, case series, open-label and double-blind, placebo/active intervention-controlled trials, but other secondary reports (i.e., systematic reviews and meta-analyses) were also included in this analysis. Studies with unspecified designs or those that do not report either qualitatively or quantitively the evolution of B/SD core manifestations were excluded. All data included in the secondary analysis were evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklists. A total number of 24 manuscripts (i.e., 12 clinical trials, eight case reports, and four reviews) were included. Most of the reviewed studies were of moderate quality, representing a certain limitation of this review and preventing the formulation of high-validity recommendations. Psychotherapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) seems to be the main intervention supported by the current evidence, followed by the combination of antidepressants and CBT, and serotoninergic antidepressants as monotherapy. There is an obvious need to further develop good-quality trials with a more significant number of participants with B/SD and longer follow-up periods.

AB  - The global accumulation of plastic waste has reached crisis levels. The diverse and multilayered impacts of plastic on biological health prompts an evaluation of these effects from a One Health perspective, through which the complexity of these processes can be integrated and more clearly understood. Plastic particles ranging from nanometers to meters in size are found throughout every ecosystem on Earth, from the deepest marine trenches to the highest mountains. Plastic waste affects all layers of biological organization, from the molecular and cellular to the organismal, community, and ecosystem-levels. These effects are not only mediated by the physical properties of plastics, but also by the chemical properties of the plastic polymers, the thousands of additives combined with plastics during manufacturing, and the sorbed chemicals and microbes that are transported by the plastic waste. Using a One Health framework we provide an overview of the following themes: 1) ways in which plastic impacts global health across levels of biological organization, 2) how the effects of plastic interact between layers of biology, and 3) what knowledge gaps exist in understanding the effects of plastic within and between biological scales. We also propose potential solutions to address this growing crisis, with an emphasis on One Health perspectives that consider the oneness of animals, humans, and the environment.

AB  - Delirium, an acute brain dysfunction, is a common and serious complication in burn patients. The occurrence of delirium increases the difficulty of patient treatment, is associated with various adverse outcomes, and increases the burden on the patient's family. Many scholars have studied the factors that cause delirium, but the causes, pathogenesis, and treatment of delirium in burn patients have not been fully revealed. There is no effective pharmacological treatment for delirium, but active preventive measures can effectively reduce the incidence of delirium in burn patients. Therefore, it is necessary to study the relevant factors affecting the occurrence of delirium in burn patients. This study was conducted on December 20, 2021 by searching the PubMed database for a narrative review of published studies. The search strategy included keywords related to "burns," "delirium," and "risk factors." We reviewed the characteristics of delirium occurrence in burn patients and various delirium assessment tools, and summarized the risk factors for the development of delirium in burn patients in terms of personal, clinical, and environmental factors, and we found that although many risk factors act on the development of delirium in burn patients, some of them, such as clinical and environmental factors, are modifiable, suggesting that we can estimate the exposure of burn patients to risk factors by assessing their likelihood of delirium occurring and to make targeted interventions that provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of burn delirium.

AB  - Background: This overview is conducted to evaluate the effect of telerehabilitation on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).Methods: A comprehensive search was performed through the [MeSH] keywords (heart diseases, coronary disease, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass, heart failure, cardiac rehabilita-tion and telemedicine) until January 20, 2021 in databases of Science Direct, Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. Finally, 20 reviews were entered into the analysis.Results: The results of meta-analyses showed that receiving telerehabilitation program by telemedicine method has a positive effect on the physical dimension and changing the mental status of patients following this inter-vention depends on age so that the use of these technologies in heart patients with younger ages promotes mental status. On the other hand, increasing the duration of the intervention 18 months or more affects the physical dimension and 12 months or more affects promoting overall HRQOL. Among the various types of Telemedicine methods, telephone support has a greater effect on promoting the physical dimension.Conclusion: The ability to use virtual technology is less at older ages, so age conditions of patients should be considered in choosing this type of intervention. The living place of the people and the level of access to ad-vanced care, seem to play an important role in changing outcomes and choosing this type of intervention be-cause the main purpose of telerehabilitation is to provide treatment care in areas with low access levels.

AB  - Emergency first responders (EFRs) such as police officers, firefighters, paramedics and logistics personnel often suffer high turnover due to work-related stress, high workloads, fatigue, and declining professional wellbeing. As attempts to counter this through resilience programmes tend to have limited success, there is a need for further research into how organisational policies could change to improve EFRs' professional wellbeing. Aim: To identify the factors that may contribute to or affect EFRs' professional wellbeing. Methods: A systematic literature review has been carried out. Three databases (Science Direct, ProQuest, and PubMed) were searched using keywords developed based on the PICo (population, interest, and context) framework. A total of 984 articles were extracted. These were then critically appraised for the quality of the evidence presented, leading to a total of five being ultimately included for review. Results: Thematic analysis revealed that although EFRs may be exposed daily to traumatic events, factors that contribute to a decline in professional wellbeing emerge from within the organisational environment, rather than from the event itself. Conclusion: The study concludes that organisational and team relations factors significantly impact EFRs ability to cope with stress. As such, organisational policy should evolve to emphasise team relations over resilience programmes.

AB  - Cigarette smokers try to quit using several strategies including electronic cigarette use (vaping). An alternative, easy and cheap method is exercise. However, little is known about the efficacy of aerobic exercise (AE) to augment smoking and vaping cessation. This study aimed to systematically review and discuss the reported effects of AE on long-term vaping and smoking cessation in randomized control trials (RCTs). RCTs were searched on different databases. The outcome measures included long-term vaping or smoking cessation and maximal or peak oxygen uptake (VO2max/peak) after vaping- or smoking cessation. Meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effects of AE on long-term vaping and smoking cessation, and the effects of AE on VO2max/peak. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 was used to assess trials quality. Thirteen trials were included (5 high, 2 moderate and 6 low quality). Although two high quality trials revealed that 3 vigorous supervised AE sessions a week for 12 to 15 weeks increased the number of long-term successful quitters, the meta-analysis including the other trials showed that AE did not significantly increase success rate of long-term quitters. However, VO2max/peak was improved at the end of treatment. There were no trials on AE and vaping cessation. No evidence was found that AE promotes long-term smoking cessation. Nevertheless, AE improved VO2max and/or VO2peak in quitters.

AB  - Suicide is a leading cause of death all over the world. Suicide prevention is possible and should be pursued through a variety of strategies. The importance of the arts for positive health outcomes has been increasingly evidenced. This scoping review aimed to identify the possible role of the performing arts-defined as a type of art performed through actions such as music, dance, or drama executed alive by an artist or other participant in the presence of an audience,-in suicide prevention programs. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ProQuest Psychology Database, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using terms in English for publications of original studies that included performing arts in suicide prevention programs. Thirty-five studies conducted between 1981 and 2021 were identified, of which only five were randomized clinical trials and four quasi-randomized studies. Interventions used different performing arts to improve awareness, self-efficacy, and soft skills relevant to suicide prevention. Studies were addressed mainly to gatekeepers but also directly to at-risk populations. While the study designs do not allow inferences to be drawn about the effectiveness of performing arts in preventing suicide, the review found that performing arts have been successfully implemented in suicide prevention programs. Research to evaluate the possible therapeutic benefit is warranted.

AB  - Almost all diseases have a genetic basis. However, several disorders stem from a combination of genes and environ-mental conditions. In the present study, databases including PubMed, Scopus and Google scholar were searched and reviewed and those relevant studies that investigated the association between environmental and genetic factors with the incidence of diseases were extracted and used. At the final step, it is concluded that in many cases, disorders have a multifactorial etiology. Having a gene related to a specific disorder is not the only reason for contracting the disease. Both genes and environmental factors play a role in human disease etiology. Everything outside of DNA, may affect health and even in many people with a positive family history of a specific disorder, environmental factors can facilitate or prevent the occurrence of the disease. Therefore, living a healthy lifestyle is important in reducing exposure to dis-eases, and long-life expectancy.

AB  - Context: Unaffordable or insecure housing is associated with poor health in children and adults. Tenant-based housing voucher programs (voucher programs) limit rent to 30% or less of household income to help households with low income obtain safe and affordable housing. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of voucher programs in improving housing, health, and other health-related outcomes for households with low income. Design: Community Guide systematic review methods were used to assess intervention effectiveness and threats to validity. An updated systematic search based on a previous Community Guide review was conducted for literature published from 1999 to July 2019 using electronic databases. Reference lists of included studies were also searched. Eligibility Criteria: Studies were included if they assessed voucher programs in the United States, had concurrent comparison populations, assessed outcomes of interest, were written in English, and published in peer-reviewed journals or government reports. Main Outcome Measures: Housing quality and stability, neighborhood opportunity (safety and poverty), education, income, employment, physical and mental health, health care use, and risky health behavior. Results: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Compared with low-income households not offered vouchers, voucher-using households reported increased housing quality (7.9 percentage points [pct pts]), decreased housing insecurity or homelessness (-22.4 pct pts), and decreased neighborhood poverty (-5.2 pct pts). Adults in voucher-using households had improved health care access and physical and mental health. Female youth experienced better physical and mental health but not male youth. Children who entered the voucher programs under 13 years of age had improved educational attainment, employment, and income in their adulthood; children's gains in these outcomes were inversely related to their age at program entry. Conclusion: Voucher programs improved health and several health-related outcomes for voucher-using households, particularly young children. Research is still needed to better understand household's experiences and contextual factors that influence achievement of desired outcomes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to rapidly review the literature on the prevalence of menstrual disorders in female athletes from different sports modalities. Articles were searched in the Web of Science and PubMed database in May 2022. A total of 1309 records were identified, and 48 studies were included in the final stage. The menstrual disorders described in the included studies were primary (in 33% of included studies) and secondary amenorrhea (in 73% of included studies) and oligomenorrhea (in 69% of included studies). The prevalence of menstrual disorders among the studies ranged from 0 to 61%. When data were pooled according to discipline (mean calculation), the highest prevalence of primary amenorrhea was found in rhythmic gymnastics (25%), soccer (20%) and swimming (19%); for secondary amenorrhea in cycling (56%), triathlon (40%) and rhythmic gymnastics (31%); and oligomenorrhea in boxing (55%), rhythmic gymnastics (44%) and artistic gymnastics (32%). Based on the results of this review, the study supports the literature of the higher prevalence of menstrual disorders in gymnastics and endurance disciplines. However, team sports modalities such as volleyball and soccer also presented a considerable percentage of menstrual disorders compared to the general population. It reinforces the importance of coaches and physicians paying attention to athletes' menstrual cycle as the occurrence of menstrual disorders can be associated with impairment on some health components.

AB  - Objective: To gather current evidence on the impact of antipsychotics on long-term mortality in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: We systematically searched for articles in Embase, PubMed, and PsycINFO reporting the long-term mortality (follow-up 4 1 year) of patients with schizophrenia who were using any antipsychotics. We then conducted multiple meta-analyses to determine differences in long-term mortality between different types of antipsychotics. Results: We identified 45 articles that provided unadjusted long-term mortality rates, including 46,171 deaths during 2,394,911 person-years. The pooled mortality rate was 9.9 (95 degrees/0CI = 7.4-12.7) per 1,000 person-years. The unadjusted crude mortality rate of antipsychotic drug users was lower than that of non-users (risk ratio [RR] = 0.546, 95 degrees/0CI = 0.480-0.621), first-generation antipsychotics caused higher all-cause mortality than second-generation antipsychotics (RR = 1.485, 95 degrees/0CI = 1.361-1.620), and polypharmacy had better effects than monotherapy on long-term mortality (RR = 0.796, 95 degrees/0CI = 0.689-0.921). As for the causes of death, heart disease and cardiovascular disease ranked highest among cause-specific mortality (5.6 per 1,000 person-years). Conclusion: Since antipsychotics had a beneficial effect on long-term mortality in schizophrenia, greater precaution should be taken with patients who do not take them. However, since disease severity, comorbidities, and other confounding factors cannot be fully controlled, further research and verification are needed.

AB  - Context: COVID-19 was declared 'a global pandemic' by the World Health Organization in March 2020. India's lockdown, one of the harshest in the world, came with additional challenges for women. This paper aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related pathways on the first thousand days of life in the Integrated Child Development Scheme and the public distribution ecosystem in India. Data sources: Using Cochrane guidelines, electronic databases, namely Google Scholar and PubMed-NCBI, were searched for evidence between 1 March 2020 and 1 May 2022. A total of 73 studies were identified in initial search; 20 met the inclusion criteria and, thus, were included in the research analysis. Primary studies were conducted throughout pan-India in rural, urban, and semi-urban areas to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related pathways on the first 1000 days of life. The impact of social security, food insecurity, service delivery, nutrition of pregnant and nursing mothers (P&NMs), and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) varied between geographies and within geographies. Most of the primary studies were conducted at small scale, while only three studies were pan-Indian. The majority of studies were conducted on the mental health of P&NMs and pre-natal and post-natal service delivery disruption. The paucity of the available literature highlights the need to undertake research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic-related pathways on 1000 days of life in India and worldwide. The best implementation practices were observed where cross-sectional programs were carried out in relation to health services and social security for P&NMs and children.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - A number of mobile health apps related to coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been developed, but research into app content analytics for effective surveillance and management is still in its preliminary stages. The present study aimed to identify the purpose and functions of the currently available COVID-19 apps using content analysis. The secondary aim was to propose directions for the future development of apps that aid infectious disease surveillance and control with a focus on enhancing the app content and quality. Prior to conducting an app search in the App Store and the Google Play Store, we reviewed previous studies on COVID-19 apps found in Google Scholar and PubMed to examine the main purposes of the apps. Using the five selected keywords based on the review, we searched the two app stores to retrieve eligible COVID-19 apps including those already addressed in the reviewed literature. We conducted descriptive and content analyses of the selected apps. We classified the purpose types of the COVID-19 apps into the following five categories: Information provision, tracking, monitoring, mental health management, and engagement. We identified 890 apps from the review articles and the app stores: 47 apps met the selection criteria and were included in the content analysis. Among the selected apps, iOS apps outnumbered Android apps, 27 apps were government-developed, and most of the apps were created in the United States. The most common function for the iOS apps (63.6%) and Android apps (62.5%) was to provide COVID-19-related knowledge. The most common function among the tracking apps was to notify users of contact with infected people by the iOS apps (40.9%) and Android apps (37.5%). About 29.5% of the iOS apps and 25.0% of the Android apps were used to record symptoms and self-diagnose. Significantly fewer apps targeted mental health management and engagement. Six iOS apps (6/44, 13.6%) and four Android apps (4/24, 16.7%) provided behavioral guidelines about the pandemic. Two iOS apps (2/44, 4.5%) and two Android apps (2/24, 8.3%) featured communication functions. The present content analysis revealed that most of the apps provided unilateral information and contact tracing or location tracking. Several apps malfunctioned. Future research and development of COVID-19 apps or apps for other emerging infectious diseases should address the quality and functional improvements, which should begin with continuous monitoring and actions to mitigate any technical errors.

AB  - The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is an essential endogenous signaling system that may be involved in the pathophysiology of chronic widespread pain (CWP) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Further research is required to understand the role of ECS in the development and maintenance of CWP and FMS. We provided the first systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the clinical relevance of ECS alterations in patients with CWP and FMS by comparing plasma and interstitial levels of endocannabinoids and N-acylethanolamines in patients and healthy controls. A systematic search was conducted to identify studies that measured plasma and/or interstitial levels of endocannabinoids and N-acylethanolamines in patients with CWP or FMS and healthy controls. A total of 8 studies were included for qualitative review, and 7 studies were included for meta-analysis. The findings identified increased plasma levels of oleoylethanolamide and stearoylethanolamide in patients with FMS compared with those in controls (P = 0.005 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and increased plasma levels of palmitoylethanolamide and interstitial levels of stearoylethanolamide in patients with CWP compared with those in controls (P = 0.05 and P = 0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in other ECS parameters. Most studies did not account for variables that may influence ECS function, including cannabis use, concomitant medication, comorbidities, physical activity, stress levels, circadian rhythm, sleep quality, and dietary factors, suggesting that future studies should explore the correlation between these variables and endocannabinoid activity. We highlight the importance of investigating endocannabinoid activity in CWP and FMS because it will underpin future translational research in the area.

AB  - The food delivery service is the most typical and visible example of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce. More consumers are using food delivery services for various reasons during the COVID-19 pandemic, making this business model viral worldwide. In the post-pandemic era, offering food delivery services will become the new normal for restaurants. Although a growing number of publications have focused on consumer behavior in this issue, no review paper has addressed current research and industry trends. Thus, this paper aims to review the literature published from 2020 to the present (October 2022) on consumers' use of food delivery services during the pandemic. A thematic review was conducted, with 40 articles searched from Scopus and Web of Science being included. Quantitative findings showed current research trends, and thematic analyses formed eight themes of factors influencing consumer behavior: (1) technical and utilitarian factors, (2) system-related attributes, (3) emotional and hedonic factors, (4) individual characteristics, (5) service quality, (6) risk-related factors, (7) social factors, and (8) food-related attributes. The paper also emphasizes COVID-19-related influences and suggests promising future research directions. The results offer insights into industry practices and starting points for future research.

AB  - ASD consists of a set of permanent neurodevelopmental conditions, which are studded with social and communication differences, limited interests, and repetitive behaviors. Individuals with ASD have difficulty reading eye gestures and expressions, and may also have stereotyped or repetitive language, excessive adherence to routines, fixed interests, and rigid thinking. However, sexuality in adolescents and young adults with ASD is still a poorly studied and neglected issue. This review aims to evaluate sexual function and behavior in individuals with ASD to foster a greater understanding of this important, although often overlooked, issue. This review was conducted by searching peer-reviewed articles published between 01 June 2000 and 31 May 2022 using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database, and Web of Science. A comprehensive search was conducted using the terms: "Autism" OR "ASD" AND "Sexuality" OR "Romantic relation" OR "sexual behavior" AND/OR "sexual awareness". After an accurate revision of 214 full manuscripts, 11 articles satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This review found that, although individuals with ASD may have sexual functioning, their sexuality is characterized by higher prevalence rates of gender dysphoria and inappropriate sexual behavior. Furthermore, sexual awareness is reduced in this patient population, and the prevalence of other variants of sexual orientation (i.e., homosexuality, asexuality, bisexuality, etc.) is higher in adolescents with ASD than in non-autistic peers. Sexual health and education should be included in the care path of patients with ASD in order to improve their quality of life and avoid/reduce inappropriate and risky behaviors.

AB  - While there have been ongoing calls to reform child welfare so that it better meets children's and families' needs, to date there have been no comprehensive summaries of child welfare reform strategies. For this systematic scoping review, we summarized authors' recommendations for improving child welfare. We conducted a systematic search (2010 to 2021) and included published reviews that addressed authors' recommendations for improving child welfare for children, youth, and families coming into contact with child welfare in high-income countries. A total of 4758 records was identified by the systematic search, 685 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, and 433 reviews were found to be eligible for this scoping review. Reviews were theoretically divided, with some review authors recommending reform efforts at the macro level (e.g., addressing poverty) and others recommending reform efforts at the practice level (e.g., implementing evidence-based parenting programs). Reform efforts across socioecological levels were summarized in this scoping review. An important next step is to formulate what policy solutions are likely to lead to the greatest improvement in safety and well-being for children and families involved in child welfare.

AB  - The circumventricular organs (CVOs) are unique areas within the central nervous system. They serve as a portal for the rest of the body and, as such, lack a blood-brain barrier. Microglia are the primary resident immune cells of the brain parenchyma. Within the CVOs, microglial cells find themselves continuously challenged and stimulated by local and systemic stimuli, even under steady-state conditions. Therefore, CVO microglia in their typical state often resemble the activated microglial forms found elsewhere in the brain as they are responding to pathological conditions or other stressors. In this review, I focus on the dynamics of CVO microglia, using the pineal gland as a specific CVO example. Data related to microglia heterogeneity in both homeostatic and unhealthy environments are presented and discussed, including those recently generated by using advanced single-cell and single-nucleus technology. Finally, perspectives in the CVO microglia field are also included. Summary Statement Microglia in circumventricular organs (CVOs) continuously adapt to react differentially to the diverse challenges they face. Herein, I discuss microglia heterogeneity in CVOs, including pineal gland. Further studies are needed to better understand microglia dynamics in these unique brain areas.

AB  - This rapid review assessed the suicide risk and risk factors of men who are survivors of sexual assault. We searched three academic databases (Cochrane, Medline and PsycINFO) for peer-reviewed articles in English published between 2010 and 2022. We rated the quality of the evidence based on the National Health and Medical Research Council Levels of Evidence. One systematic review and 16 papers featuring primary studies were included relating to suicide rates and risk. Findings suggest men who have been sexually assaulted (as a child or adult) are at increased risk of suicidal thoughts, attempts and behaviours compared with men who have not been sexually assaulted. Factors such as frequency of abuse and other concurrent forms of childhood abuse may further increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. This evidence base was rated as good. The strength of this evidence supports a need for targeted suicide prevention in this high risk group.

AB  - Whether animals have subjective experiences about the content of their sensory input, i.e., whether they are aware of stimuli, is a notoriously difficult question to answer. If consciousness is present in animals, it must share fundamental characteristics with human awareness. Working memory and voluntary/endogenous attention are suggested as diagnostic features of conscious awareness. Behavioral evidence shows clear signatures of both working memory and voluntary attention as minimal criterium for sensory consciousness in mammals and birds. In contrast, reptiles and amphibians show no sign of either working memory or volitional attention. Surprisingly, some species of teleost fishes exhibit elementary working memory and voluntary attention effects suggestive of possibly rudimentary forms of subjective experience. With the potential exception of honeybees, evidence for conscious processing is lacking in invertebrates. These findings suggest that consciousness is not ubiquitous in the animal kingdom but also not exclusive to humans. The phylogenetic gap between animal taxa argues that evolution does not rely on specific neural substrates to endow distantly related species with basic forms of consciousness.

AB  - People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDDs) are disproportionately vulnerable to poorer oral health due to their complex needs specifically sensory processing difficulties. This leads to increased maladaptive behaviours and psychophysiology responses of dental anxiety amplified by the overstimulating aspects of the dental environment. Although, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that sensory adaptions are an effective strategy for individuals with IDDs in a wide range of settings, there is a lack of high-quality evidence detailing the effectiveness in a dental setting. The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of sensory adaptive dental environments (SADE) to reduce dental anxiety, corresponding negative behaviours and psychophysiology responses in children and young people with IDDs. The systematic review will include all Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) that investigate the effectiveness of SADE compared to control (no intervention), waitlist or usual care (regular dental environment) to reduce dental anxiety and the corresponding negative behaviours and psychophysiology responses in children and young people (upto the ages of 24 years) with IDDs. This review will be conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Databases including MEDLINE (Ovid), The Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science and OT Seeker will be searched using appropriate keywords. Additionally, citation searching will be conducted. Screening based on titles and abstracts will be done after de-duplication, followed by full-text reading for selection based on the inclusion criteria. Data extracted from the included studies will be tabulated and assessed for risk of bias. If applicable, a meta-analysis of the pooled data will be conducted. The review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022322083).

AB  - The objective of domestic violence intervention programs is to address perpetrator behavior. However, the suitability and effectiveness of these programs in confronting problematic behavior for ethnically diverse groups is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to cohesively examine whether such programs are effective in reducing recidivism, changing perpetrator behavior, and addressing mental health issues for culturally diverse groups. Several databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles that included culturally specific components or ethnically diverse cohorts in offender intervention programs. 10 articles met the inclusion criteria. The findings demonstrate greater effectiveness of programs with greater cultural engagement: through culturally trained facilitators, addressing the cultural and patriarchal norms relevant to the specific client group, and discussion of gender roles and attitudes to gender equality specific to the cultural context. Such programs achieved some positive outcomes including: reduced recidivism, improved mental health, and better attitudes to gender equality. However, the findings are limited to a few ethnically diverse groups, and not all studies measured all outcomes listed above. This review suggests the development and implementation of suitable offender intervention programs that address perpetrator behavior and mental health in ethnically diverse client groups. When culturally relevant and effective programs are implemented, it could lead to men's modification of perpetrating behavior and create safer family relationships.

AB  - There is widespread recognition that the world of work is changing, and agreement is growing that the occupational safety and health (OSH) field must change to contribute to the protection of workers now and in the future. Discourse on the evolution of OSH has been active for many decades, but formalized support of an expanded focus for OSH has greatly increased over the past 20 years. Development of approaches such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'s Total Worker Health (R) concept and the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Healthy Workplace Framework are concrete examples of how OSH can incorporate a new focus with a wider view. In 2019, NIOSH initiated a multi-year effort to explore an expanded focus for OSH. This paper is a report on the outputs of a three-year cooperative agreement between NIOSH and The University of Texas School of Public Health, which led to subject matter expert workshops in 2020 and an international conference of global interest groups in 2021. This article traces the background of these meetings and identifies and assesses the lessons learned. It also reviews ten thematic topics that emerged from the meetings: worker health inequalities; training new OSH professionals; future OSH research and practice; tools to measure well-being of workers; psychosocial hazards and adverse mental health effects; skilling, upskilling and improving job quality; socioeconomic influences; climate change; COVID-19 pandemic influences; and strategic foresight. Cross-cutting these themes is the need for systems and transdisciplinary thinking and operationalization of the concept of well-being to prepare the OSH field for the work of the future.

AB  - Objective:This systematic review assessed the quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on the treatment of insomnia disorder and their reporting of recommendations, while summarizing the evidence and providing guidance on an algorithmic approach to appropriate pharmacological treatment. Methods:The PubMed and EMBASE databases, guideline repositories, and specialist association websites were searched. The quality of the CPGs was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument, complemented by the AGREE-REX (Appraisal of Guidelines REsearch and Evaluation-Recommendations EXcellence). A multidisciplinary team identified the key clinical questions that a clinician would consider when taking an algorithmic approach to the use of medication for patients with insomnia disorder. By using a meta-synthesis approach, recommendations from the CPGs were characterized and summarized via a recommendation matrix. Results:A total of 10 records that met the inclusion criteria were included and appraised. Four CPGs were rated as high and 3 CPGs were rated as moderate in overall quality. Most of the CPGs recommended pharmacotherapy only if cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or other nonpharmacological interventions were unavailable, unsuccessful, or declined by patients. Recommendations on types of medicines and dose and duration of treatment varied and were nonspecific. Few of the CPGs provided recommendations on pharmacotherapy in special populations. Conclusions:Indications for starting medications are the only common thread in all of the reviewed CPGs. The CPGs diverged in the choice of first-line pharmacotherapy, and most of the CPGs did not provide recommendations on all subsequent clinical considerations.

AB  - Simple Summary A plethora of studies have highlighted the profound role of the gut microbiome in human health. However, there is a lack of studies on female health. Given that females may be more likely to be affected by some ailments such as osteoarthritis, heart disease, cancer, and anxiety, it is imperative to study the effect of the gut microbiome and its role in female health. It is evident that the presence/ratio of microbial species is altered in polycystic ovarian syndrome, cancer, pregnancy, and menopause. Thus, potential probiotics should be developed and the administration of certain bacterial species should be considered, as novel independent or adjunct therapies for various female-related pathologies. Strategies such as the modulation of the gut microbiome via diet and through supplementation with pre/pro/postbiotics in various female health-related issues should be undertaken. The possession of two X chromosomes may come with the risk of various illnesses, females are more likely to be affected by osteoarthritis, heart disease, and anxiety. Given the reported correlations between gut microbiome dysbiosis and various illnesses, the female gut microbiome is worthy of exploration. Herein, we discuss the composition of the female gut microbiota and its dysbiosis in pathologies affecting the female population. Using PubMed, we performed a literature search, using key terms, namely: "gut microbiome", "estrogen", "menopause", "polycystic ovarian syndrome", "pregnancy", and "menstruation". In polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus, Firmicutes, Streptococcus, and the ratio of Escherichia/Shigella was found to be increased while that of Tenericutes ML615J-28, Tenericutes 124-7, Akkermansia, Ruminococcaceae, and Bacteroidetes S24-7 was reduced. In breast cancer, the abundance of Clostridiales was enhanced, while in cervical cancer, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Dialister were enhanced but Bacteroides, Alistipes, and members of Lachnospiracea, were decreased. In ovarian cancer, Prevotella abundance was increased. Interestingly, the administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus fermentum ameliorated PCOS symptoms while that of a mix of Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Lactobacillus brevis W63, Bifidobacterium lactis W52, Lactobacillus salivarius W24, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactococcus lactis W19, Lactobacillus casei W56, and Lactococcus lactis W58 alleviated vascular malfunction and arterial stiffness in obese postmenopausal women, and finally, while further research is needed, Prevotella maybe protective against postmenopausal bone mass loss. As several studies report the therapeutic potential of probiotics and since the gut microbiota of certain female pathological states has been relatively characterized, we speculate that the administration of certain bacterial species as probiotics is warranted, as novel independent or adjunct therapies for various female pathologies.

AB  - Ketamine has rapid yet often transient antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Different strategies have been proposed to prolong these effects. Maintenance ketamine treatment appears promising, but little is known about its efficacy, safety, and tolerability in depression. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library and identified three randomised controlled trials, eight open-label trials, and 30 case series and reports on maintenance ketamine treatment. We found intravenous, intranasal, oral, and possibly intramuscular and subcutaneous maintenance ketamine treatment to be effective in sustaining antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant depression. Tachyphylaxis, cognitive impairment, addiction, and serious renal and urinary problems seem uncommon. Despite the methodological limitations, we conclude that from a clinical view, maintenance ketamine treatment seems to be of therapeutic potential. We recommend both controlled and naturalistic studies with long-term follow-up and sufficient power to determine the position of maintenance ketamine treatment within routine clinical practice.

AB  - IntroductionIn the past three decades, there has been increasing interest in assessing children's Executive Functions (EF). However, studies on the conceptualization and operationalization of this construct are incongruent and guidance for clinicians and researchers aiming to assess EF is insufficient due to measurement variability. AimsThe purpose of this article was to examine current theories and models of EF in children, identify their assessment instruments, issues, and challenges, and discuss their impact on children's cognitive, behavioral, social and/or emotional development. MethodsThis narrative review reflected on English and French scholarly articles on EF assessment in children. References were identified through searches of PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and APA PsychNet throughout the last two decades up to June 2022. ResultsThere are commonalities despite divergence in the definition and operationalization of EF. Assessment of EF requires psychometric tests as well as rating scales that must be integrated and interpreted considering the child's biological makeup, environmental background, and cultural specificities. ConclusionCurrent EF theories, assessment tools, issues, and challenges were discussed in addition to the impact of their components' dysfunctions on children's development. Further studies should be conducted to develop new measurement methods and technologies to improve the ecological and ethological validity of youth assessment, treatment, and interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Patient safety in long-term care is becoming an increasingly popular subject in the scientific literature. Organizational problems such as shortages of medical staff, insufficient numbers of facilities or underfunding increase the risk of adverse events, and aging populations in many countries suggests that these problems will become more and more serious with each passing year. The objective of the study is to identify interventions that can contribute to increasing patient safety in long-term care facilities. Method: A systematic review of secondary studies was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Searches were conducted in Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via OVID) and Cochrane Library. The quality of the included studies was assessed using AMSTAR2. Results: Ultimately, 10 studies were included in the analysis. They concerned three main areas: promoting safety culture, reducing the level of occupational stress and burnout, and increasing the safety of medication use. Promising methods that have an impact on increasing patient safety include: preventing occupational burnout of medical staff, e.g., by using mindfulness-based interventions; preventing incidents resulting from improper administration of medications, e.g., by using structured methods of patient transfer; and the use of information technology that is more effective than the classic (paper) method or preventing nosocomial infections, e.g., through programs to improve the quality of care in institutions and the implementation of an effective infection control system. Conclusions: Taking into account the scientific evidence found and the guidelines of institutions dealing with patient safety, it is necessary for each long-term care facility to individually implement interventions aimed at continuous improvement of the quality of care and patient safety culture at the level of medical staff and management staff.

AB  - Background: Intelligence scores in males with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) remain a major issue in clinical practice. We performed a literature review and meta-analysis to further delineate the intellectual functioning of dystrophinopathies. Method: Published, peer-reviewed articles assessing intelligence, using Wechsler Scales, of males with DMD or BMD were searched from 1960 to 2022. Meta-analysis with random-effects models was conducted, assessing weighted, mean effect sizes of full-scale IQ (FSIQ) scores relative to normative data (Mean = 100, Standard Deviation = 15). Post hoc we analysed differences between performance and verbal intelligence scores. Results: 43 studies were included, reporting data on 1472 males with dystrophinopathies; with FSIQ scores available for 1234 DMD (k = 32) and 101 BMD (k = 7). DMD males score, on average, one standard deviation below average (FSIQ = 84.76) and significantly lower than BMD (FSIQ = 92.11). Compared to a previous meta-analysis published in 2001, we find, on average, significantly higher FSIQ scores in DMD. Conclusion: Males with Duchenne have, on average, significantly lower FSIQ scores than BMD males and the general population. Clinicians must consider lower intelligence in dystrophinopathies to ensure good clinical practice.

In this study, we have explored the diffusion of neuroscience and different neuroscience methods (e.g., electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, eye tracking) through and within education fields. A total of 549 existing scholarly articles and 25,886 references on neuroscience in the field of education (NIE) from the Web of Science Core Collection databases were examined during the following two periods: 1995-2013 and 2014-2022. The science mapping software Vosviewer and Bibliometrix were employed for data analysis and visualization of relevant literature. Furthermore, performance analysis, collaboration network analysis, co-citation network analysis, and strategic diagram analysis were conducted to systematically sort out the core knowledge in NIE. The results showed that children and cognitive neuroscience, students and medical education, emotion and empathy, and education and brain are the core intellectual themes of current research in NIE. Curriculum reform and children's skill development have remained central research issues in NIE, and several topics on pediatric research are emerging. The core intellectual themes of NIE revealed in this study can help scholars to better understand NIE, save research time, and explore a new research question. To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the earliest documents to outline the NIE core intellectual themes and identify the research opportunities emerging in the field.

AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine body constitution (TCMBC) reflects a person's vulnerability to diseases. Thus, identifying body constitutions prone to depression can help prevent and treat depression. The review aimed to assess and summarize the existing evidence that explores the relationship between TCMBC and depression. Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, MEDLINE, PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed, Embase, VIP, CINAHL, and CMJ were searched from inception to April 2021. Observational studies assessing the association between TCMBC and depression were selected. The quality of the included studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Eighteen studies were included in the systematic review and thirteen in the meta-analysis. The pooled odd ratios of developing depression for Qi-stagnation, Qi-deficiency, Yang-deficiency, Yin-deficiency, and Balanced constitutions were 3.12 (95% CI, 1.80-5.40; I-2 = 94%), 2.15 (95% CI, 1.54-3.01; I-2 = 89%), 1.89 (95% CI, 0.71-5.03; I-2 = 81%), 1.41 (95% CI, 0.91-2.20; I-2 = 57%), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40-0.90; I-2 = 94%), respectively. The findings suggest that the evaluation of a person's TCMBC could be useful the in prevention and treatment of depression. However, more case-control and cohort studies are required to further confirm the association between TCMBC and depression.

AB  - The last decades have seen a rise in the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) approaches to modulate brain activity and associated behavior. Concurrently, eye tracking (ET) technology has improved to allow more precise quantitative measurement of gaze behavior, offering a window into the mechanisms of vision and cognition. When combined, tDCS and ET provide a powerful system to probe brain function and measure the impact on visual function, leading to an increasing number of studies that utilize these techniques together. The current pre-registered, systematic review seeks to describe the literature that integrates these approaches with the goal of changing brain activity with tDCS and measuring associated changes in eye movements with ET. The literature search identified 26 articles that combined ET and tDCS in a probe-and-measure model and are systematically reviewed here. All studies implemented controlled interventional designs to address topics related to oculomotor control, cognitive processing, emotion regulation, or cravings in healthy volunteers and patient populations. Across these studies, active stimulation typically led to changes in the number, duration, and timing of fixations compared to control stimulation. Notably, half the studies addressed emotion regulation, each showing hypothesized effects of tDCS on ET metrics, while tDCS targeting the frontal cortex was widely used and also generally produced expected modulation of ET. This review reveals promising evidence of the impact of tDCS on eye movements and associated psychological function, offering a framework for effective designs with recommendations for future studies.

AB  - Objective: The present study aimed to systematically analyze the risk factors for RBD. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies derived from the articles published in eight electronic databases before December 1, 2021. The primary outcome was the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and heterogeneity was quantified using I2. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were used to explore sources of heterogeneity. Egger's test and sensitivity analysis were performed. The PROSPERO ID number of the present study is CRD42021293942. Results: We identified 26 studies (44,230 subjects) among 2022 citations, and 13 factors were considered. Male sex (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.13-1.64), smoking (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.26-1.50), depression (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.66-2.56), antidepressant use (OR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.98-2.82), duration of neuropsychiatric disorders(OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.13-1.73), levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD, OR = 60.15, 95% CI = 23.95-96.35) and observable motor dysfunction (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 0.65-4.22) were associated with a higher risk of RBD. Tertiary education and above (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.35-0.96) was associated with a lower RBD risk. Men (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.10-1.78, I2 = 0%, P = 0.005) and older individual (OR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.03-4.43, I2 = 60%, P = 0.002) were more likely to have iRBD. Conclusion: Six modifiable risk factors and one protective factor were associated with RBD. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms and to develop preventative strategies.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate emotion recognition and processing in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in order to update the state of current literature on this important but undervalued topic. We identified 15 papers published between 2012 and 2022 that meet the inclusion criteria. Paper search, selection, and extraction followed the PRISMA guidelines. We used a narrative synthesis approach in order to report a summary of the main findings taken from all papers. The results collected are still ambiguous: some studies did not find any differences between MCI and healthy controls (HC) groups in emotion recognition and processing, and other results reported emotion-specific deficits in emotion recognition regarding MCI patients (both regarding negative and neutral emotions). It is essential to underline that these findings could not be generalized to the whole MCI population due to the heterogeneous use of measures and composition of the sample. This does not allow us to make a comprehensive comparison between the results. Our suggestion for future research is to align the results using the same type of tests and emotion recognition assessment.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a newly discovered way of programmed cell death, mainly caused by the accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides in cells, which is morphologically, biochemically and genetically different from the previously reported apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. Studies have found that ferroptosis plays a key role in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and vascular dementia, which suggest that ferroptosis may be involved in regulating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. At present, on the underlying mechanism of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases is still unclear, and relevant research is urgently needed to clarify the regulatory mechanism and provide the possibility for the development of agents targeting ferroptosis. This review focused on the regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis and its various effects in neurodegenerative diseases, in order to provide reference for the research on ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Considering the great role those affective variables play in language learning, it seems wise to hypothesize whether teacher and learner emotions are contagious in the language classroom or not. The existing literature on emotion contagion in other fields of study accepts this hypothesis and reveals significant points about the verbal and non-verbal cues for emotion contagion in class. The present paper introduces and defines the topic and goes on with summarizing the procedure of transmitting the emotion. Then, it reviews the existing research on emotion contagion in different areas and creates a link between them and the L2 studies. It draws attention to the dearth of research on emotion contagion in the second language acquisition (SLA) domain and emphasizes the need for innovative dynamic approaches to research to explore emotion contagion in the ecology of the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom. It also reviews the limited body of research in this regard in the SLA domain and shows how the significant findings can be useful for L2 educators. The findings of these studies show that more relevant studies in the future can be hoped to provide insightful remarks about how different emotions are transmitted between the teacher and students or among students in L2 classes. These studies are supposed to adopt a dynamic approach as well as a longitudinal data collection and analysis procedure. These can have implications for teacher education programs in the English language teaching (ELT) domain.

AB  - Background The efficacy and safety of adjunctive therapy are unclear in bipolar depression. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of second-generation antipsychotic, lamotrigine, lithium, or valproate therapy used in adjunction with lamotrigine, lithium, or valproate monotherapy in bipolar depression. A literature search of major electronic databases was conducted in February 2021, and all articles published until then were eligible. Two researchers independently screened relevant publications, extracted data, and evaluated methodological quality according to the Cochrane criteria. Results Five studies met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis revealed significant differences in the following outcomes: (i) remission rates from depressive episodes (risk ratio [RR]: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.50, p = 0.04), (ii) improvement in depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.21, 95% CI 0.09-0.34, p = 0.001), (iii) improvement in quality of life (SMD: 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.37, p = 0.005), and (iv) rate of adverse events during the study period (RR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.22, p = 0.008). There was no significant difference between adjunctive therapy and monotherapy in the emergence of suicide-related behaviors, dropout rate during the study period, or rate of manic switching. Conclusions Our results suggest that adjunctive second-generation antipsychotics, lamotrigine, lithium, or valproate increase both the benefits and risks in patients with bipolar depression, although there is no significant difference in severe adverse events. Adjunctive therapy should be provided through shared decision-making while considering the patients' condition in clinical settings.

AB  - Background An increasing number of children, adolescents and adults with intellectual disabilities and/or autism are being admitted to general psychiatric wards and cared for by general psychiatrists. Aims The aim of this systematic review was to consider the likely effectiveness of in-patient treatment for this population, and compare and contrast differing models of in-patient care. Method A systematic search was completed to identify papers where authors had reported data about the effectiveness of in-patient admissions with reference to one of three domains: treatment effect (e.g. length of stay, clinical outcome, readmission), patient safety (e.g. restrictive practices) and patient experience (e.g. patient or family satisfaction). Where possible, outcomes associated with admission were considered further within the context of differing models of in-patient care (e.g. specialist in-patient services versus general mental health in-patient services). Results A total of 106 studies were included and there was evidence that improvements in mental health, social functioning, behaviour and forensic risk were associated with in-patient admission. There were two main models of in-patient psychiatric care described within the literature: admission to a specialist intellectual disability or general mental health in-patient service. Patients admitted to specialist intellectual disability in-patient services had greater complexity, but there were additional benefits, including fewer out-of-area discharges and lower seclusion rates. Conclusions There was evidence that admission to in-patient services was associated with improvements in mental health for this population. There was some evidence indicating better outcomes for those admitted to specialist services.

This paper summarizes the current state of kink research, including prevalence rates; marginalization and stigma; key biological, psychological, and social research findings; clinical issues; and recommendations for further research. Theoretical frameworks, such as minority stress, serious leisure, sexual orientation, personal growth, and sensation-seeking theories appear to be useful frameworks outside of approaches that assume psychopathology as an etiological factor. Studies find the following results: higher levels of sensation-seeking; kink activities generating states of flow and transient hypofrontality; notable levels of gender, sexual orientation, and relationship style diversity in kink samples; and higher levels of minority stress-related suicidality.

AB  - Autistic children with sensory processing differences successfully navigate and engage in meaningful family daily occupations within home and community environments through the support of their family. To date however, much of the research on autistic children with sensory processing differences, has primarily been deficit focused, while much of the caregiver research has focused on issues of distress, burden, effort, and emotional trauma in coping with their child's diagnosis. This study aimed to conduct a qualitative evidence synthesis, using a meta-ethnographic approach to explore the gap identified in understanding successful occupational experiences of family participation and daily family routines when supporting an autistic child with sensory processing differences and to offer an alternative strengths-based perspective. Inclusion criteria were studies which were peer-reviewed qualitative design, published from 2000 to 2021, and that concerned parents/caregivers' perspectives of family occupations of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Studies were electronically searched in eight databases from October to December 2021 and 23 studies were identified which met the inclusion criteria. Noblit and Hare's seven step approach for conducting analysis in meta-ethnography was used, and three themes identified: (1) sensory processing differences in daily life, (2) what is hard about hard, and (3) orchestrating family life. Results identified the centrality of sensory experiences in understanding family life. Living with unpredictability while orchestrating certainty through routines was core to successful participation. This review provides insights into how parents negotiate the complexities of constructing family life when living with an autistic child. The results can inform the design of future interventions that specifically address the relationship between meaningful participation in family occupations and daily routines and sensory processing in autistic children.

AB  - Background Sentiment expression and detection are crucial for effective and empathetic human-robot interaction. Previous work in this field often focuses on non-verbal emotion expression, such as facial expressions and gestures. Less is known about which specific prosodic speech elements are required in human-robot interaction. Our research question was: what prosodic elements are related to emotional speech in human-computer/robot interaction? Methods The scoping review was conducted in alignment with the Arksey and O'Malley methods. Literature was identified from the SCOPUS, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and PsycINFO databases in May 2021. After screening and de-duplication, data were extracted into an Excel coding sheet and summarised. Results Thirteen papers, published from 2012 to 2020 were included in the review. The most commonly used prosodic elements were tone/pitch (n = 8), loudness/volume (n = 6) speech speed (n = 4) and pauses (n = 3). Non-linguistic vocalisations (n = 1) were less frequently used. The prosodic elements were generally effective in helping to convey or detect emotion, but were less effective for negative sentiment (e.g., anger, fear, frustration, sadness and disgust). Discussion Future research should explore the effectiveness of commonly used prosodic elements (tone, loudness, speed and pauses) in emotional speech, using larger sample sizes and real-life interaction scenarios. The success of prosody in conveying negative sentiment to humans may be improved with additional non-verbal cues (e.g., coloured light or motion). More research is needed to determine how these may be combined with prosody and which combination is most effective in human-robot affective interaction.

AB  - Empathy is essential for human survival and social interaction. Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been used to improve empathy in healthy populations, its therapeutic efficacy remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of MBIs on empathy in a healthy population and the potential factors affecting the efficacy of MBIs. The literature search focused on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CNKI from inception to September 2022. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies reporting the effects of using MBIs on empathy in healthy populations were included. A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Results of the meta-analysis showed that MBIs improved empathy (SMD, 0.372, 95% CI, 0.164-0.579, p = 0.001) in the healthy population compared with that in the control group. Moreover, results of the subgroup analysis showed that intervention dose (over 24 h vs. under 24 h), format (online vs. offline), and types (different types) were important factors affecting treatment outcomes. This comprehensive review suggests that MBIs are effective treatment for empathy in healthy population. Future research should markedly focus on large-sample, rigorously designed experiments to explore the long-term effects of MBIs on empathy and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of MBIs. This study provides a reference for the daily application of MBIs.

AB  - Introduction Lethal means safety counseling (LMSC) is an evidence-based suicide prevention intervention during which providers encourage patients to limit their access to lethal means (e.g., firearms, medications). Despite agreement about the importance of LMSC, it is underutilized in clinical practice.
   Methods To better understand the individual and contextual factors that influence LMSC and its implementation, we conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies examining stakeholder perceptions of the intervention. PubMed and PsycInfo were searched up to February 2021 using terms related to: (1) LMSC, firearms, or medications; (2) suicide, safety, or injury; and (3) qualitative methodology. Two coders used thematic synthesis to analyze findings from eligible papers, including developing a codebook and coding using an inductive and iterative approach (reliability k > 0.70). Confidence in review findings were evaluated using the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) Approach. Subthemes were assigned to domains in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.
   Findings Of the 19 papers identified, 18 discussed LMSC for firearms and 1 focused exclusively on LMSC for medications. The firearm-related studies explored perspectives of a variety of stakeholders (patients, providers, members of the firearms community, healthcare leaders, and family members) across multiple settings (emergency departments, pediatric and adult primary care, and outpatient mental health). Seven overarching themes emerged, including the: (1) importance of firearms to owners' identities and perceptions of ownership as a value and right, which can lead to perceived cultural tensions in clinical settings; (2) importance of patients understanding the context and rationale for LMSC; (3) value of providers showing cultural competency when discussing firearms; (4) influence of safety and risk beliefs on firearm behaviors; (5) need to navigate logistical concerns when implementing LMSC; (6) value of individualizing LMSC; (7) potential for trusted family members and friends to be involved in implementing LMSC.
   Conclusion This synthesis of the qualitative literature informs clinical, operational, and research endeavors aimed at increasing the reach and effectiveness of LMSC. Future research should address the perspectives of individuals underrepresented in the literature (e.g., those from racial/ethnic minority groups) and further examine stakeholders' perceptions of LMSC for medication.

AB  - Background: To explain what cognitive capacity shapes uncertainty in advanced illness by identifying the types of evidence, mapping underlying cognitive processes to uncertainty, and outlining future directions for research and interventions.
   Design: A systematic scoping review of mixed study designs was carried out following the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and using qualitative content analysis.
   Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched for original studies published in full and in English through December 2021 that reported on uncertainty in illness and related cognitions, cognitive science, or cognitive functions.
   Results: After screening 978, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria for review. We found the cognitive capacity of mental time travel - to relive the past or foresee life in the future - interacted with episodic memory retrieval to inform decision-making, and prospection to imagine, predict or prepare for future outcomes to determine lesser or greater uncertainty in advanced illness.
   Conclusions: Mental time travel is a fundamental cognitive function when the future is limited by an advanced illness, to review life as a meaningful narrative. The role of mental time travel to construct or make sense of uncertain futures inherent in advanced illness can inform theory and targets for intervention.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by communication and social interaction deficits, and by restricted interests and stereotyped, repetitive behavior patterns. ASD has a strong genetic component and a complex architecture characterized by the interplay of rare and common genetic variants. Recently, increasing evidence suggest a significant contribution of immune system dysregulation in ASD. The present paper reviews the latest updates regarding the altered immune landscape of this complex disorder highlighting areas with potential for biomarkers discovery as well as personalization of therapeutic approaches. Cross-talk between the central nervous system and immune system has long been envisaged and recent evidence brings insights into the pathways connecting the brain to the immune system. Disturbance of cytokine levels plays an important role in the establishment of a neuroinflammatory milieu in ASD. Several other immune molecules involved in antigen presentation and inflammatory cellular phenotypes are also at play in ASD. Maternal immune activation, the presence of brain-reactive antibodies and autoimmunity are other potential prenatal and postnatal contributors to ASD pathophysiology. The molecular players involved in oxidative-stress response and mitochondrial system function, are discussed as contributors to the pro-inflammatory pattern. The gastrointestinal inflammation pathways proposed to play a role in ASD are also discussed. Moreover, the body of evidence regarding some of the genetic factors linked to the immune system dysregulation is reviewed and discussed. Last, but not least, the epigenetic traits and their interactions with the immune system are reviewed as an expanding field in ASD research. Understanding the immune-mediated pathways that influence brain development and function, metabolism, and intestinal homeostasis, may lead to the identification of robust diagnostic or predictive biomarkers for ASD individuals. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches could be developed, ultimately aiming to improve their quality of life.

AB  - Objective Physical activity interventions are potential strategies to enhance psychosocial health of children and adolescents. Interventions are performed at diverse settings (e.g., school, home, community), but little research has addressed whether and how the effectiveness of these programs vary by setting type. The aim of this review is to summarize the psychosocial effects of physical activity programs for preschoolers, children, and adolescents at various intervention settings. Data Source A systematic search of five electronic databases, MEDLINE-PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Scopus was performed. Study inclusion and exclusion criteria Included studies had participants between 3-18 years, physical activity intervention duration of at least four weeks, experimental design, and at least one psychosocial health outcome. Data Extraction Data on participants, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and findings were extracted. Data Synthesis Data were synthesized by the intervention setting; school, home, and community. Results Of the thirty-five included studies, 74% were performed at schools. Although fewer studies used community (17%)- and home-based (9%) interventions, these were similarly effective in improving psychosocial health as school-based interventions. Conclusions Community- and home-based intervention settings may be underutilized despite being similarly effective as school-based settings. A large proportion of time is spent out of school during weekends and summer-break. Community- and home-based physical activity programs may be pragmatic strategies to deliver improvements in psychosocial health of preschoolers, children, and adolescents.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Whether ketamine is as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) among patients with major depressive episode remains unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze data about clinical efficacy and safety for ketamine and ECT in patients with major depressive episode.
   DATA SOURCES PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase were systematically searched using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and text keywords from database inception through April 19, 2022, with no language limits. Two authors also manually and independently searched all relevant studies in US and European dinical trial registries and Google Scholar.
   STUDY SELECTION Included were studies that involved (1) a diagnosis of depression using standardized diagnostic criteria, (2) intervention/comparator groups consisting of ECT and ketamine, and (3) depressive symptoms as an efficacy outcome using standardized measures.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction was completed independently by 2 extractors and cross-checked for errors. Hedges g standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used for improvement in depressive symptoms. SMDs with corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using fixed- or random-effects models. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Efficacy outcomes included depression severity, cognition, and memory performance. Safety outcomes included serious adverse events (eg, suicide attempts and deaths) and other adverse events.
   RESULTS Six clinical trials comprising 340 patients (n = 162 for ECT and n = 178 for ketamine) were included in the review. Six of 6 studies enrolled patients who were eligible to receive ECT, 6 studies were conducted in inpatient settings, and 5 studies were randomized clinical trials. The overall pooled SMD for depression symptoms for ECT when compared with ketamine was -0.69 (95% CI, -0.89 to -0.48; Cochran Q, P = .15;I-2 = 39%), suggesting an efficacy advantage for ECT compared with ketamine for depression severity. Significant differences were not observed between groups for studies that assessed cognition/memory or serious adverse events. Both ketamine and ECT had unique adverse effect profiles (ie, ketamine: lower risks for headache and muscle pain; ECT: lower risks for blurred vision, vertigo, diplopia/nystagmus, and transient dissociative/depersonalization symptoms). Limitations included low to moderate methodological quality and underpowered study designs.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that ECT may be superior to ketamine for improving depression severity in the acute phase, but treatment options should be individualized and patient-centered.

AB  - Criticality is the singular state of complex systems poised at the brink of a phase transition between order and randomness. Such systems display remarkable in-formation-processing capabilities, evoking the compelling hypothesis that the brain may itself be critical. This foundational idea is now drawing renewed inter-est thanks to high-density data and converging cross-disciplinary knowledge. Together, these lines of inquiry have shed light on the intimate link between crit-icality, computation, and cognition. Here, we review these emerging trends in criticality neuroscience, highlighting new data pertaining to the edge of chaos and near-criticality, and making a case for the distance to criticality as a useful metric for probing cognitive states and mental illness. This unfolding progress in the field contributes to establishing criticality theory as a powerful mechanistic framework for studying emergent function and its efficiency in both biological and artificial neural networks.

AB  - Mitophagy impairment and oxidative stress are cardinal pathological hallmarks in Parkinson's disease (PD), a common age-related neurodegenerative condition. The specific interactions between mitophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have attracted considerable attention even though their exact interplay in PD has not been fully elucidated. We highlight the interactions between ROS and mitophagy, with a focus on the signalling pathways downstream to ROS that triggers mitophagy and draw attention to potential therapeutic compounds that target these pathways in both experimental and clinical models. Identifying a combination of ROS inhibitors and mitophagy activators to provide a physiologic balance in this complex signalling pathways may lead to a more optimal outcome. Deciphering the exact temporal relationship between mitophagy and oxidative stress and their triggers early in the course of neurodegeneration can unravel mechanistic clues that potentially lead to the development of compounds for clinical drug trials focusing on prodromic PD or at-risk individuals.

AB  - Substance use disorders (SUDs) constitute a growing global health crisis, yet many limitations and challenges exist in SUD treatment research, including the lack of objective brain-based markers for tracking treatment outcomes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a neurophysiological technique for measuring brain activity, and although much is known about EEG activity in acute and chronic substance use, knowledge regarding EEG in relation to abstinence and treatment outcomes is sparse. We performed a scoping review of longitudinal and pre-post treatment EEG studies that explored putative changes in brain function associated with abstinence and/or treatment in individuals with SUD. Following PRISMA guidelines, we identified studies published between January 2000 and March 2022 from online databases. Search keywords included EEG, addictive substances (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine), and treatment related terms (e.g., abstinence, relapse). Selected studies used EEG at least at one time point as a predictor of abstinence or other treatment-related outcomes; or examined pre- vs. post-SUD intervention (brain stimulation, pharmacological, behavioral) EEG effects. Studies were also rated on the risk of bias and quality using validated instruments. Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. More consistent findings included lower oddball P3 and higher resting beta at baseline predicting negative outcomes, and abstinence-mediated longitudinal decrease in cue-elicited P3 amplitude and resting beta power. Other findings included abstinence or treatment-related changes in late positive potential (LPP) and N2 amplitudes, as well as in delta and theta power. Existing studies were heterogeneous and limited in terms of specific substances of interest, brief times for follow-ups, and inconsistent or sparse results. Encouragingly, in this limited but maturing literature, many studies demonstrated partial associations of EEG markers with abstinence, treatment outcomes, or pre-post treatment-effects. Studies were generally of good quality in terms of risk of bias. More EEG studies are warranted to better understand abstinence- or treatment-mediated neural changes or to predict SUD treatment outcomes. Future research can benefit from prospective large-sample cohorts and the use of standardized methods such as task batteries. EEG markers elucidating the temporal dynamics of changes in brain function related to abstinence and/or treatment may enable evidence-based planning for more effective and targeted treatments, potentially pre-empting relapse or minimizing negative lifespan effects of SUD.

AB  - QT prolongation is a heart rhythm condition that impacts the lives of many people and when severe can be lifethreatening. QT prolongation has been linked to variations in several genes, but it can also arise in the course of treatments with medications such as certain antipsychotics and antidepressants. However, it is unclear whether the risk of medication-induced QT prolongation (MIQTP) depends on specific genetic vulnerability. Here, we review the available literature on the interplay between genetic risk and medication exposure in the context of psychiatric treatment. A review was conducted on the genetic contribution to MIQTP in psychiatric patients. A literature search was conducted on the PubMed platform with 8 papers meeting criteria for review. A total of 3,838 patients from 8 studies meeting criteria for a psychotic or mood disorder were included in this review. All studies found evidence for the genetic contribution to MIQTP. The specific genes identified in these studies included the NOS1AP, ABCB1, KCNH2, SLC22A23, EPB41L4A, LEP, CACNA1C, CERKL, SLCO3A1, BRUNOL4, NRG3, NUBPL, PALLD, NDRG4 and PLN genes. The findings highlight both the importance of monitoring heart parameters in psychiatry and the possible role for genetic profiling to increase the treatment safety.

AB  - Chronic high-level heavy metal exposure increases the risk of developing different neurodegenerative diseases. Chronic excessive manganese (Mn) exposure is known to lead to neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, some evidence suggests that autophagy dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. Over the past decade, the DNA-sensing receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream signal-efficient interferon gene stimulator (STING), as well as the molecular composition and regulatory mechanisms of this pathway have been well understood. The cGAS-STING pathway has emerged as a crucial mechanism to induce effective innate immune responses by inducing type I interferons in mammalian cells. Moreover, recent studies have found that Mn2+ is the second activator of the cGAS-STING pathway besides dsDNA, and inducing autophagy is a primitive function for the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. However, overactivation of the immune response can lead to tissue damage. This review discusses the mechanism of neurotoxicity induced by Mn exposure from the cGAS-STING-autophagy pathway. Future work exploiting the cGAS-STING-autophagy pathway may provide a novel perspective for manganese neurotoxicity.

The high prevalence of neurological disorders, which are the main diseases that cause disability and dependency around the world, makes neurological disorders especially relevant. This systematic mapping review aimed to map the knowledge of spirituality experienced by people with neurological/neurodegenerative disorders and its influence on outcomes and the ability to cope with the disease. Following specified methodological criteria, a total of 13 articles were selected. The spiritual dimension should be considered a fundamental component of the quality of life and well-being of neurological patients as it can significantly influence their ability to cope with their disease.

AB  - Background/Objectives: There have been concerns that clozapine treatment may undermine the capacity of the body to fight infection and increase the vulnerability to contracting COVID-19. This review of recent cohort studies investigated (1) whether people with a severe psychiatric disorder are at increased risk of COVID-19 and complications, (2) the immunological response of clozapine-users who contract COVID-19, and (3) patients' perspectives on COVID-19 and the pandemic response. Methods: A systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, Pubmed, and PsycINFO databases using PRISMA guidelines using "COVID-19", "clozapine", and "vaccination" terms. Results: 18 studies (out of 330 identified) met all criteria (N = 119 054 including 8045 on clozapine). There was no strong evidence that clozapine users may be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing complications after adjusting for medical comorbidities. Hematological studies showed temporary reductions in neutrophils in COVID-19-positive patients and vaccination suggesting a clozapine effect in defence against infection. Vaccination studies did not report major adverse effects. Increased plasma levels of clozapine and neutropenia however point to COVID-19-related interference of clozapine metabolism. Patient surveys reported limited impact on mental health and positive attitudes regarding pandemic response. Conclusion: This review did not find compelling evidence that the immune system of clozapine users put them at risk of COVID-19 and further complications. Evidence of drug-infection interactions however points to the importance of adhering to consensus guidelines about clozapine therapy during the pandemic. More evidence using longitudinal designs is required to examine the longer-term effects of COVID-19 and vaccination in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Introduction Patients with chronic kidney disease treated with hemodialysis (HD) have lower cognitive abilities compared to the age-matched healthy population. Recently, physical exercise and cognitive training have been presented as possible interventions to improve cognitive abilities both in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases. To date, there is no general overview of the current knowledge on how these interventions affect cognitive abilities in HD patients and what tests are used to measure these effects. Methods Three electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled studies of physical exercise or cognitive training interventions that examined effects on cognitive abilities/performance in HD patients. Results Six articles were included. All included studies used physical exercise as an intervention, with one study also including tablet-based cognitive training. Four studies included an intradialytic approach and two included a home-based intervention. Intervention lasted. A significant intervention effect was observed in three studies compared with the control condition. Conclusion The present review suggests that physical exercise might improve or at least not worsen cognitive performance in HD patients, whereas the effect of cognitive training has not yet been adequately studied. There is a need for more sensitive and specific cognitive tests to adequately measure the effects of interventions in the HD population.

In this narrative review, our aim is to describe the pathophysiology of climacturia, its predictive factors, and the existing conserva-tive and surgical treatment options in the modern era. Peer-reviewed publications on the post-prostatectomy climacturia were identified through a PubMed search, with terms included climacturia, arousal incontinence, post prostatectomy incontinence, orgasm and radical prostatectomy. While the pathophysiology of climacturia remains poorly understood and predictive factors poorly elucidated, men expe-riencing climacturia often report significant bother and reduction in quality of life. Various treatment options have been investigated for this condition, with conservative measures including pelvic floor physical therapy and variable penile tension loops, and operative strate-gies including the Mini-Jupette and traditional bladder slings. As providers of comprehensive urologic care for prostate cancer survivors, it is incumbent upon urologists to query patients about bothersome climacturia and offer these evidence-based treatment options.

AB  - Cortical morphology is a key determinant of cognitive ability and mental health. Its development is a highly intricate process spanning decades, involving the coordinated, localized expression of thousands of genes. We are now beginning to unravel the genetic architecture of cortical morphology, thanks to the recent availability of large-scale neuroimaging and genomic data and the development of powerful biostatistical tools. Here, we review the progress made in this field, providing an overview of the lessons learned from genetic studies of cortical volume, thickness, surface area, and folding as captured by neuroimaging. It is now clear that morphology is shaped by thousands of genetic variants, with effects that are region- and time-dependent, thereby challenging conventional study approaches. The most recent genome-wide association studies have started discovering common genetic variants influencing cortical thickness and surface area, yet together these explain only a fraction of the high heritability of these measures. Further, the impact of rare variants and non-additive effects remains elusive. There are indications that the quickly increasing availability of data from whole-genome sequencing and large, deeply phenotyped population cohorts across the lifespan will enable us to uncover much of the missing heritability in the upcoming years. Novel approaches leveraging shared information across measures will accelerate this process by providing substantial increases in statistical power, together with more accurate mapping of genetic relationships. Important challenges remain, including better representation of understudied demographic groups, integration of other 'omics data, and mapping of effects from gene to brain to behavior across the lifespan.

AB  - Objectives: Acupuncture therapy has been used for cognitive impairment-related diseases, however, there are still few studies on the overall trend of acupuncture therapy on cognitive impairment based on bibliometric analysis. The purpose of this study was to explore the research trend of the impact of acupuncture on cognitive impairment in the past 15 years, analyze the research trends and hotspots, and provide new ideas and theoretical basis for future research directions. Methods: From the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), the relevant literature on the treatment of cognitive impairment with acupuncture from 2007 to 2022 was retrieved. Then, based on the Cite Space and VOS viewer software of the Java platform, the cooperation between countries and institutions in this field, the co-citation of journals and documents, and the cooperation between authors and authors, etc. were analyzed. In addition, the co-occurrence and burst analysis of keywords are also carried out, and a visual knowledge map is drawn. Results: As of August 08, 2022, a total of 394 records related to the treatment of cognitive impairment with acupuncture were identified. The analysis results show: The number and rate of annual publications have steadily increased, with some fluctuations from year to year. The countries that contribute the most to this field are China and the USA. Among them, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and Capital Medical University are tied for first place in terms of the number of published papers. Tao Jing is the most prolific author and the number one cited author. Conclusions: The number of publications on acupuncture for cognitive impairment is expected to increase rapidly in future research, suggesting a bright future for the field. Future research hotspots will focus on pain, injury, protocol, diagnosis, guidelines, etc. It is also necessary to strengthen cross-regional and cross-country cooperation among various academic groups.

AB  - The persistent difficulty in conceptualizing the relationship between addictive and other mental disorders stands out among the many challenges faced by the field of Psychiatry. The different philosophies and schools of thought about, and the sheer complexity of these highly prevalent clinical conditions make progress inherently difficult, not to mention the profusion of competing and sometimes contradictory terms that unnecessarily exacerbate the challenge. The lack of a standardized term adds confusion, fuels stigma, and contributes to a "wrong door syndrome" that captures the difficulty of not only diagnosing but also treating addictive and other mental disorders in an integrated manner. The World Association on Dual Disorders (WADD) proposes the adoption of the term "Dual Disorder" which, while still arbitrary, would help harmonize various clinical and research efforts by rallying around a single, more accurate, and less stigmatizing designation.

AB  - Subthreshold depression (StD) is very common, with an estimated global incidence of 25%, and is associated with other clinical conditions. Nonpharmacological interventions have been demonstrated to be effective, but which one is best should be further investigated. This study aims to compare and rank the efficacy of non -pharmacological interventions in adults with StD. Ten databases were searched, and comparisons were made using a random-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist framework. The assumption of local con-sistency was assessed by using the node-splitting method. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to separately rank each intervention. A total of 32 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The results showed that psychotherapy, as an intervention class, had significantly positive effects compared to control groups (SMD =-0.78, 95% CI:-1.06,-0.49) and had the highest rank (SUCRA, 79.0%; mean rank, 1.6). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as an individual intervention, had significantly positive effects relative to all control groups and had the highest rank (SUCRA, 82.5%; mean rank, 3.1). We speculate that psychotherapy, especially CBT, may be the most effective nonpharmacological intervention to improve StD in adults. More RCTs examining the efficacy of different nonpharmacological interventions are needed.

AB  - Parvalbumin (PV) is a calcium binding protein expressed by inhibitory fast-spiking interneurons in the cerebral cortex. By generating a fast stream of action potentials, PV+ interneurons provide a quick and stable inhibitory input to pyramidal neurons and contribute to the generation of gamma oscillations in the cortex. Their fast-firing rates, while advantageous for regulating cortical signaling, also leave them vulnerable to metabolic stress. Chandelier (Ch) cells are a type of PV+ interneuron that modulate the output of pyramidal neurons and synchronize spikes within neuron populations by directly innervating the pyramidal axon initial segment. Changes in the morphology and/or function of PV+ interneurons, mostly of Ch cells, are linked to neurological disorders. In ASD, the number of PV+ Ch cells is decreased across several cortical areas. Changes in the morphology and/or function of PV+ interneurons have also been linked to schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bipolar disorder. Herein, we review the role of PV and PV+ Ch cell alterations in ASD and other psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Understanding Theory of Mind should begin with an analysis of the problems it solves. The traditional answer is that Theory of Mind is used for predicting others' thoughts and actions. However, the same Theory of Mind is also used for planning to change others' thoughts and actions. Planning requires that Theory of Mind consists of abstract structured causal representations and supports efficient search and selection from innumerable possible actions. Theory of Mind contrasts with less cognitively demanding alternatives: statistical predictive models of other people's actions, or model-free reinforcement of actions by their effects on other people. Theory of Mind is likely used to plan novel interventions and predict their effects, for example, in pedagogy, emotion regulation, and impression management.

AB  - Background Suicide is a major public health problem and a cause of premature mortality. With a view to prevention, a great deal of research has been devoted to the determinants of suicide, focusing mostly on individual risk factors, particularly depression. In addition to causes intrinsic to the individual, the social environment has also been widely studied, particularly social isolation. This paper examines the social dimension of suicide etiology through a review of the literature on the relationship between suicide and social isolation. Methods Medline searches via PubMed and PsycINFO were conducted. The keywords were "suicid*" AND "isolation." Results Of the 2,684 articles initially retrieved, 46 were included in the review. Conclusions Supported by proven theoretical foundations, mainly those developed by E. Durkheim and T. Joiner, a large majority of the articles included endorse the idea of a causal relationship between social isolation and suicide, and conversely, a protective effect of social support against suicide. Moreover, the association between suicide and social isolation is subject to variations related to age, gender, psychopathology, and specific circumstances. The social etiology of suicide has implications for intervention and future research.

An early childhood home visiting professional works with families to encourage positive parent-child interactions, family goal setting, and family well-being and health. Determining the essential components of coaching home visitors will help advance this field. Because coaching in the home visiting field is emergent, this article draws on literature from the early childhood field with an emphasis on applications for home visiting. We gleaned six themes that may represent common features of coaching. This article presents a compilation of common themes identified in literature reviews on coaching professionals across the early childhood field that warrant further development and evaluation by home visiting practitioners and researchers regardless of the home visiting model. The discussion concludes with recommendations to stimulate research and practice on coaching home visitors.

AB  - ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) have been widely used in several fields, and they have the potential to be a novel fertilizer to promote plant growth. For the effective use of ZnO NPs, it is necessary to understand their influence mechanisms and key interactions with the soil physical and biological environment. In this review, we sum-marize the fate and transport of ZnO NPs applied via soil treatment or foliar spray in plant-soil systems and discuss their positive regulation mechanisms in plants and microbes. The latest research shows that the for-mation, bioavailability, and location of ZnO NPs experience complicated changes during the transport in soil -plant systems and that this depends on many factors. ZnO NPs can improve plant photosynthesis, nutrient element uptake, enzyme activity, and the related gene expression as well as modulate carbon/nitrogen meta-bolism, secondary metabolites, and the antioxidant systems in plants. Several microbial groups related to plant growth, disease biocontrol, and nutrient cycling in soil can be altered with ZnO NP treatment. In this work, we present a systematic comparison between ZnO NP fertilizer and conventional zinc salt fertilizer. We also fill several knowledge gaps in current studies with the hope of providing guidance for future research.

AB  - Background: Studies conducted in the health sector have determined a positive relationship between job satisfaction and work engagement. However, this paper reveals that this relationship turns into a negative or non-significant relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the reasons for inconsistency in research findings in this critical period through a meta-analysis.Methods: This study was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and PICO framework. Online databases including Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, ProQuest, Google Scholar, and additional records from other databases were searched without any time limitation, and all studies published in English that reported the correlation between work engagement and job satisfaction were included in the analysis. In total, 36 individual correlation coefficients were synthesized. R statistical language was used to analyze the data.Result: A total of 36 studies with a sample size of 16,087 were synthesized. The overall effect size was found as r = 0.57 (95% CI [0.50-0.64]). While the moderating effect of national culture was not statistically significant, presence of COVID-19 as the significant moderator explained 37.08% of effect size heterogeneity. Such that the presence of COVID-19 has transformed the positive relationship between work engagement and job satisfaction into a negative but statistically non-significant relationship.Conclusion: This study empirically challenges the existing assumptions about the positive link between work engagement and job satisfaction. The results of the research can be a guide for managers and policymakers. Specifically, based on these results, different mechanisms can be put in place to support work engagement and, in turn, job satisfaction in the COVID-19 process.

AB  - Introduction Bullying victimization has consistently been highlighted as a risk factor for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) in young people. This systematic review of prospective, community-based studies explored associations between bullying victimization (traditional/face-to-face and cyber) across the full spectrum of self-harm and suicidality, in children and young people aged up to (and including) 25 years. Importantly, associations by sex/gender were explored. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Scopus were searched for articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Articles were screened by title, abstract and full text. Quality appraisal was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. Data were synthesized narratively. The protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021261916) and followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Results A total of 35 papers were included, across 17 countries. Results were presented by bullying type: traditional/face-to-face (n = 25), cyber (n = 7) and/or an aggregate of both types (n = 7). Outcomes included suicidal ideation (n = 17), self-harm (n = 10), suicide attempt (n = 4), NSSI (n = 4), other (n = 7). Studies measured outcomes in under 18s (n = 24), 18-25-year-olds (n = 8) and both under 18s and 18-25-year-olds (n = 3). Studies exploring the role of sex/gender (20%) found some interesting nuances. Conclusions Some weak to strong associations between bullying and SITBs were found yet conclusions are tentative due to study heterogeneity (e.g., methods used, conceptualizations and operationalisations of exposures/outcomes). Future research should address methodological issues raised in this review, and further explore gender differences in bullying, including by bullying sub-types (e.g., overt or relational) and victim status (e.g., victim or bully-victim).

AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence against pregnant women is an important public health concern and human rights issue. According to the various findings of previous studies, this study was conducted to assess the pooled prevalence of intimate partner violence against Iranian women. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a literature search was conducted in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, MagIran, and Scientific Information Database without a time limit. Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochrane Q test statistics and the I-2 test, and the results were incorporated into a random effects model to estimate the prevalence of intimate partner violence. Data analysis was performed using R software version 4.3.2. Results: The overall prevalence of intimate partner violence was reported to be 51.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 45.0-58.1), and the prevalence rate of physical, sexual, and psychological intimate partner violence was 18.0% (95% CI 15.1-20.9), 22.1% (95% CI 17.7-26.60) and 43.2% (95% CI 36.6-49.8), respectively. The lowest level of physical, sexual, and emotional intimate partner violence rate was observed in district 1 of Iran (includes Tehran, the capital of Iran and the surrounding provinces). The rate of physical and sexual intimate partner violence prevalence decreased with the increased mean age of the husband (P=0.005) and the mean age of the wife (P=0.035), respectively. Conclusions: Studies included in this review report that more than half of Iranian women experience violence during pregnancy. In order to prevent adverse maternal and neonatal consequences, it is necessary to identify these women and introduce them to support centres.

AB  - Background Recent guidance has called for the reduction of restrictive practice use owing to growing concerns over the harmful physical and psychological effects for both patients and staff. Despite concerns and efforts, these measures continue to be used regularly to manage challenging behaviour in psychiatric in-patient settings. Aims To undertake a systematic review of patients' and staff members' experiences of restrictive practices in acute psychiatric in-patient settings. Method A systematic review and thematic synthesis was conducted using data from 21 qualitative papers identified from a systematic search across three electronic databases (PsycInfo, Embase and MEDLINE) and citation searching. The protocol for the review was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020176859). The quality of included papers was examined using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Results Four overarching themes emerged from the experiences of patients: the psychological effects, staff communication, loss of human rights and making changes. Likewise, the analysis of staff data produced four themes: the need for restrictive practices, the psychological impact, decision-making and making changes. Patient and staff experiences of restrictive practices were overwhelmingly negative, and their use carried harmful physical and psychological consequences. Lack of support following restraint events was a problem for both groups. Conclusions Future programmes seeking to improve or reduce restrictive practices should consider the provision of staff training covering behaviour management and de-escalation techniques, offering psychological support to both patients and staff, the importance of effective staff-patient communication and the availability of alternatives.

However, to date, inconsistent findings remain. MethodsA search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases was conducted until December 2021. Hedges g effect sizes were computed with a random-effects model. Meta-regressions were used to assess the potential confounding factors of between-study variability in effect sizes. ResultsThe meta-analysis included 41 studies, with a combined sample of 1,749 adult patients with TLE and 1,324 healthy controls (HCs). Relative to HCs, adult patients with TLE showed large impairments in ToM (g = -0.92) and cognitive ToM (g = -0.92), followed by medium impairments in affective ToM (g = -0.79) and FER (g = -0.77). Besides, no (statistically) significant differences were observed between the magnitude of social cognition impairment in adult with TLE who underwent and those who did not undergo epilepsy surgery. Meta-regressions exhibited that greater severity of executive functioning was associated with more severe ToM defects, and older age was associated with more severe FER defects. ConclusionsResults of this meta-analysis suggest that adult patients with TLE show differential impairments in the core aspects of social cognitive domains (including ToM and FER), which may help in planning individualized treatment with appropriate cognitive and behavioral interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Over the last decade, e-cigarette use has been on the rise but with growing health concerns. The objective of this systematic review was to update findings for chronic health outcomes associated with e-cigarette use from the 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report. Methods: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify studies comparing the chronic health effects of e-cigarette users (ECU) to non-smokers (NS), smokers, and/or dual users indexed between 31 August 2017 and 29 January 2021. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts. Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second one. Outcomes were synthesized in a narrative manner using counts and based on statistical significance and direction of the association stratified by study design and exposure type. Risk of bias and certainty of evidence was assessed. The protocol was prospectively registered on Open Science Framework . Results: A total of 180 articles were eligible. This review focused on 93 studies for the 11 most frequently reported outcomes and from which 59 reported on daily e-cigarette use. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low because of study design (84% cross-sectional) and exposure type (27% reported on exclusive ECU, i.e., never smoked traditional cigarettes). Overall, the summary of results for nearly all outcomes, including inflammation, immune response, periodontal and peri-implant clinical parameters, lung function, respiratory symptoms, and cardiovascular disease, suggested either non-significant or mixed results when daily ECU was compared to NS. This was also observed when comparing exclusive ECU to NS. The only notable exception was related to oral health where most (11/14) studies reported significantly higher inflammation among daily ECU vs. NS. Compared to the smokers, the exclusive-ECUs had no statistically significant differences in inflammation orperiodontal clinical parameters but had mixed findings for peri-implant clinical parameters. Conclusions: This review provides an update to the 2018 NASEM report on chronic health effects of e-cigarette use. While the number of studies has grown, the certainty of evidence remains very low largely because of cross-sectional designs and lack of reporting on exclusive e-cigarette exposure. There remains a need for higher quality intervention and prospective studies to assess causality, with a focus on exclusive e-cigarette use.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is among the most successful paradigms in both translational and reverse translational neuroscience. DBS has developed into a standard treatment for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) in recent decades, however, specific mechanisms behind DBS's efficacy and side effects remain unrevealed. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including neuronal firing rate and pattern theories that emphasize the impact of DBS on local circuitry but detail distant electrophysiological readouts to a lesser extent. Furthermore, ample preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that DBS influences neurotransmitter dynamics in PD, particularly the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS on striatal dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems; pallidum DBS on striatal dopaminergic and GABAergic systems; pedunculopontine nucleus DBS on cholinergic systems; and STN-DBS on locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic system. DBS has additionally been associated with mood-related side effects within brainstem serotoninergic systems in response to STN-DBS. Still, addressing the mechanisms of DBS on neurotransmitters' dynamics is commonly overlooked due to its practical difficulties in monitoring real-time changes in remote areas. Given that electrical stimulation alters neurotransmitter release in local and remote regions, it eventually exhibits changes in specific neuronal functions. Consequently, such changes lead to further modulation, synthesis, and release of neurotransmitters. This narrative review discusses the main neurotransmitter dynamics in PD and their role in mediating DBS effects from preclinical and clinical data.

AB  - Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is an emerging and promising approach to combat neurodegenerative diseases. While NSCs can differentiate into neural cell types, many therapeutic effects are mediated by paracrine, "drug-like" mechanisms. Neurodegenerative diseases are predominantly a burden of the elderly who commonly suffer from comorbidities and thus are subject to pharmacotherapies. There is substantial knowledge about drug-drug interactions but almost nothing is known about a potential impact of pharmacotherapy on NSCs. Such knowledge is decisive for designing tailored treatment programs for individual patients. Previous studies revealed preliminary evidence that the anti-depressants fluoxetine and imipramine may affect NSC viability and proliferation. Here, we derive a hypothesis on how commonly applied drugs, statins and antihypertensives, may affect NSC viability, proliferation, and differentiation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis looking at potential effects of commonly prescribed antihypertensive and antihyperlipidemic medication on NSC function. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched on according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Publications were assessed against a priori established selection criteria for relevancy. A meta-analysis was then performed on data extracted from publications eligible for full text review to estimate drug effects on NSC functions. Our systematic review identified 1,017 potential studies, 55 of which were eligible for full text review. Out of those, 21 were included in the qualitative synthesis. The meta-analysis was performed on 13 publications; the remainder were excluded as they met exclusion criteria or lacked sufficient data to perform a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists, an anti-hypertensive drug class [p < 0.05, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = -1.54; -0.35], and various statins [p < 0.05, 95% CI = -3.17; -0.0694] had an inhibiting effect on NSC proliferation. Moreover, we present preliminary evidence that L-type calcium channel blockers and statins, particularly lovastatin, may reduce NSC viability. Although the data available in the literature is limited, there are clear indications for an impact of commonly applied drugs, in particular statins, on NSC function. Considering the modes of action of the respective drugs, we reveal plausible mechanisms by which this impact may be mediated, creating a testable hypothesis, and providing insights into how future confirmative research on this topic may be conducted.

AB  - Remediation by algae is a very effective strategy for avoiding the use of costly, environmentally harmful chemicals in wastewater treatment. Recently, industries based on biomass, especially the bioenergy sector, are getting increasing attention due to their environmental acceptability. However, their practical application is still limited due to the growing cost of raw materials such as algal biomass, harvesting and processing limitations. Potential use of algal biomass includes nutrients recovery, heavy metals removal, COD, BOD, coliforms, and other disease-causing pathogens reduction and production of bioenergy and valuable products. However, the production of algal biomass using the variable composition of different wastewater streams as a source of growing medium and the application of treated water for subsequent use in agriculture for irrigation has remained a challenging task. The present review highlights and discusses the potential role of algae in removing beneficial nutrients from different wastewater streams with complex chemical compositions as a biorefinery concept and subsequent use of produced algal biomass for bioenergy and bioactive compounds. Moreover, challenges in producing algal biomass using various wastewater streams and ways to alleviate the stress caused by the toxic and high concentrations of nutrients in the wastewater stream have been discussed in detail. The technology will be economically feasible and publicly accepted by reducing the cost of algal biomass production and reducing the loaded or attached concentration of micropollutants and pathogenic microorganisms. Algal strain improvement, consortium development, biofilm formation, building an advanced cultivation reactor system, biorefinery concept development, and life-cycle assessment are all possible options for attaining a sustainable solution for sustainable biofuel production. Furthermore, producing valuable compounds, including pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and pigment contents generated from algal biomass during biofuel production, could also help reduce the cost of wastewater management by microalgae.

AB  - Many studies have investigated whether sleep affects cognitively unmodulated reactivity to emotional stimuli. These studies operationalize emotion regulation by using subjective and/or objective measures to compare pre- and post-sleep reactivity to the same emotional stimuli. Findings have been inconsistent: some show that sleep attenuates emotional reactivity, whereas others report enhanced or maintained reactivity. Across-study methodological differences may account for discrepant findings. To resolve the questions of whether sleep leads to the attenuation, enhancement, or maintenance of emotional reactivity, and under which experimental conditions particular effects are observed, we undertook a synthesized narrative and meta-analytic approach. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant articles, using search terms determined a priori and search limits of language = English, participants = human, and dates = January 2006-June 2021. Our final sample included 24 studies that investigated changes in emotional reactivity in response to negatively and/or positively valenced material compared to neutral material over a period of sleep compared to a matched period of waking. Primary analyses used random effects modeling to investigate whether sleep preferentially modulates reactivity in response to emotional stimuli; secondary analyses examined potential moderators of the effect. Results showed that sleep (or equivalent periods of wakefulness) did not significantly affect psychophysiological measures of reactivity to negative or neutral stimuli. However, self-reported arousal ratings of negative stimuli were significantly increased post-sleep but not post-waking. Sub-group analyses indicated that (a) sleep-deprived participants, compared to those who slept or who experienced daytime waking, reacted more strongly and negatively in response to positive stimuli; (b) nap-exposed participants, compared to those who remained awake or who slept a full night, rated negative pictures less negatively; and (c) participants who did not obtain substantial REM sleep, compared to those who did and those exposed to waking conditions, had attenuated reactivity to neutral stimuli. We conclude that sleep may affect emotional reactivity, but that studies need more consistency in methodology, commitment to collecting both psychophysiological and self-report measures, and should report REM sleep parameters. Using these methodological principles would promote a better understanding of under which conditions particular effects are observed.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are a class of incurable and debilitating diseases characterized by progressive degeneration and death of cells in the central nervous system. They have multiple underlying mechanisms; however, they all share common degenerative features, such as mitochondrial dysfunction. According to recent studies, neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Selective autophagy of mitochondria, called mitophagy, can specifically degrade excess or dysfunctional mitochondria within cells. In this review, we highlight recent findings on the role of mitophagy in neurodegenerative disorders. Multiple studies were collected, including those related to the importance of mitochondria, the mechanism of mitophagy in protecting mitochondrial health, and canonical and non-canonical pathways in mitophagy. This review elucidated the important function of mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases, discussed the research progress of mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases, and summarized the role of mitophagy-related proteins in neurological diseases. In addition, we also highlight pharmacological advances in neurodegeneration.

AB  - BackgroundIn extant literature, the concept of social isolation has been explored primarily in the context of older adults. However, people with cancer may also experience social isolation, and there is a need for increased clarity regarding this phenomenon in this population. ObjectiveTo conceptualize social isolation in adult cancer care. MethodsPubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were systematically searched using the key terms "cancer," "social isolation," "social alienation," and "social exclusion" for studies (from the earliest date available to June 2022). The main disciplines involved were psychology, nursing, medicine, and public health. Rodgers' evolutionary concept analysis was employed to clarify the antecedents, attributes, and consequences of social isolation in adults with cancer. ResultsA total of 60 eligible articles were reviewed entirely and the main findings were categorized into antecedents, attributes, and consequences. The antecedents of social isolation were classified into six categories: cancer-related physiological changes, cognitive beliefs, psychological wellbeing, unsatisfactory social supports or relationships, restrictions associated with receiving treatments, and social-level barriers. Attributes were characterized according to behavior or social avoidance and negative affective experiences, while consequences were attributed to low therapeutic compliance, poor health conditions and mental health problems, and low quality of life. White's heuristic model is a potential theoretical context applicable to social isolation in adults with cancer. ConclusionThis concept analysis provides a basis for developing multidimensional assessment tools and measures to alleviate social isolation in adults with cancer, a complex and varied phenomenon. However, while this review contributes to the current knowledge on social isolation in people with cancer, studies should further investigate the relationships among attributes associated with social isolation.

AB  - Making a treatment choice can effectively enhance the placebo effect. The choice effect is more pronounced in contexts where placebo effects without choice are weaker.
   Background Choice has been proposed as a method of enhancing placebo effects. However, there have been no attempts to systematically evaluate the magnitude, reliability, and moderators of the influence of choice on the placebo effect. Purpose To estimate the effect size of choice on the placebo effect and identify any moderators of this effect. Methods Web of Science, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed were systematically searched from inception to May 2021 for studies comparing placebo treatment with any form of choice over its administration (e.g., type, timing) to placebo treatment without choice, on any health-related outcome. Random-effects meta-analysis was then used to estimate the effect size associated with the influence of choice on the placebo effect. Meta-regression was subsequently employed to determine the moderating effect of factors such as type of choice, frequency of choice, and size of the placebo effect without choice. Results Fifteen independent studies (N = 1,506) assessing a range of conditions, including pain, discomfort, sleep difficulty, and anxiety, met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis revealed that choice did significantly enhance the placebo effect (Hedges' g = 0.298). Size of the placebo effect without choice was the only reliable moderator of this effect, whereby a greater effect of choice was associated with smaller placebo effects without choice. Conclusions Treatment choice can effectively facilitate the placebo effect, but this effect appears more pronounced in contexts where the placebo effect without choice is weaker. Because most evidence to date is experimental, translational studies are needed to test whether providing choice in clinical scenarios where placebo effects are weaker may help boost the placebo effect and thereby improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Background: Heatwaves have received major attention globally due to their detrimental effects on human health and the environment. The frequency, duration, and severity of heatwaves have increased recently due to changes in climatic conditions, anthropogenic forcing, and rapid urbanization. Australia is highly vulnerable to this hazard. Although there have been an increasing number of studies conducted in Australia related to the heatwave phenomena, a systematic review of heatwave vulnerability has rarely been reported in the literature.
   Objectives: This study aims to provide a systematic and overarching review of the different components of heatwave vulnerability (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) in Australia.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA protocol. Peer-reviewed English language articles published between January 2000 and December 2021 were selected using a combination of search keywords in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Articles were critically analyzed based on three specific heatwave vulnerability components: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.
   Results and discussion: A total of 107 articles meeting all search criteria were chosen. Although there has been an increasing trend of heat-related studies in Australia, most of these studies have concentrated on exposure and adaptive capacity components. Evidence suggests that the frequency, severity, and duration of heatwaves in Australian cities has been increasing, and that this is likely to continue under current climate change scenarios. This study noted that heatwave vulnerability is associated with geographical and climatic factors, space, time, socioeconomic and demographic factors, as well as the physiological condition of people. Various heat mitigation and adaptation measures implemented around the globe have proven to be efficient in reducing the impacts of heatwaves.
   Conclusion: This study provides increased clarity regarding the various drivers of heatwave vulnerability in Australia. Such knowledge is crucial in informing extreme heat adaptation and mitigation planning.

AB  - Rapid technological advancement has altered the demands of user experience (UX) in product design. However, research has shown that there is a gap and paucity of conceptual and practical models in this research field that may serve as guidelines for the design of immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR) applications. Identifying the variables and components that influence the enhancement of AR design is critical for creating a great UX. The literature indicated that emotion is the primary driver of the UX. Therefore, this study proposed a conceptual design model for AR mobile application that incorporates user interface, interaction, and content design elements while taking their emotions into consideration in order to improve the UX. The focus of this study is to evaluate the proposed conceptual design model of augmented reality mobile application design (ARMAD) through expert reviews. Feedbacks from the expert reviewers are compiled and illustrated in order to refine the initial ARMAD model. The findings showed that majority of the expert reviewers agreed that the conceptual design model is suitable to be used as guideline in designing AR applications that enhances the UX through emotional elicitation. Accordingly, ARMAD model has been refined according to the feedback and suggestions from the expert reviewers. This model will provide researchers and practitioners insight into the essence of AR design that influence the user experience.

AB  - The pandemic is aggravating health inequalities, particularly mental health inequalities, while revealing the social determinants of these inequalities, including migration as a social determinant that mediates the interaction of social, economic, cultural, institutional, and structural factors with health indicators. Therefore, it is of most relevance to identify the multiple interconnected factors that influence the mental health and well-being of migrant populations. A scoping review was developed to map the research performed in this area and to identify any gaps in knowledge, following the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. MEDLINE, Scopus, and WHO Global Health research databases on COVID-19 were searched from January 2020 to October 2021. The review followed the inclusion criteria Population/Concept/Context (PCC): Population-Adult International migrants (including refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented migrants); Concept-determinants of (and factors influencing) mental health and well-being; Context-COVID-19 anywhere in the world. Of the sixty-five selected studies, eleven were from European countries and were the focus of this review with special attention to health inequalities experienced by migrants in Europe. The results cover a diversity of themes related to the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of migrants (country-level environmental factors, social determinants of mental health, mental health indicators and outcomes), responses (such as solidarity and resilience), populations, and study methods. The evidence found can inform recommendations and interventions focused on health promotion and mitigation of the inequalities accentuated by the pandemic.

Despite the immense challenges facing these youth, many harness cultural and personal strengths to protect and promote their wellbeing. To support this for all youth, it is critical to understand what contributes to their wellbeing. This review aims to identify components contributing to wellbeing for Indigenous youth in CANZUS nations. Five databases were searched from inception to August 2022. Papers were eligible if they: focused on Indigenous youth in CANZUS nations; included views of youth or proxies; and focused on at least one aspect of wellbeing. We identified 105 articles for inclusion (Canada n = 42, Australia n = 27, Aotearoa New Zealand n = 8, USA n = 28) and our analysis revealed a range of thematic areas within each nation that impact wellbeing for Indigenous youth. Findings highlight the unique challenges facing Indigenous youth, as well as their immense capacity to harness cultural and personal strengths to navigate into an uncertain future. The commonalities of Indigenous youth wellbeing across these nations provide valuable insights into how information and approaches can be shared across borders to the benefit of all Indigenous youth and future generations.

AB  - mHealth interventions in cancer care are being increasingly applied in various settings. Nevertheless, there is a phenomenon wherein individuals show different usage patterns, which could affect the effectiveness of the intervention. In general, it is important to know the predictors of app adherence and usage patterns to improve the design and content (i.e., tailoring). The aim of this scoping review was to provide an overview of predictors of adherence to cancer-related mHealth apps in cancer patients. A systematic literature search was conducted in March 2021 in the electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, and PsychINFO without limitation in year, focusing on cancer patients undergoing oncological or follow-up treatment using mHealth apps. The initial database search yielded a total of N = 8035 records. After title, abstract, and full-text screening, 10 articles met inclusion criteria. Studies were published between 2013 and 2020. Studies focused on children and adolescents (2/10) as well as adults (8/10). The predictors identified could be categorized into sociodemographic variables, cancer-related factors and others. This study provides an initial insight into relevant predictors of app adherence in cancer patients. However, no clear predictor of increased app adherence was found. Further research of usage patterns is therefore needed so that mHealth interventions can be tailored during development.

AB  - Objectives: To identify, critically appraise and synthesise the qualitative literature on the experiences of informal carers of people with long-term conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: A qualitative systematic literature review. Data Sources: Eight electronic databases were systematically searched (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Nursing and Allied Health and ASSIA) along with Google Scholar and handsearching via secondary sources. Study selection: Eligible studies had to include the experiences of informal carers (adults who are 65 or older), use a qualitative methodology and had to be written in English. Data extraction and synthesis: Retrieved papers were quality assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist and ranked for quality. Thematic analysis was used to synthesise the findings. Results: Fourteen studies were included, all from medical or nursing journals (n = 5 specifically gerontology). Four main themes were identified: (i) fear, (ii) uncertainty, (iii) burden and (iv) staying connected. Caregiving demands have increased for carers during the pandemic, as well as negative emotions such as fear and uncertainty. At the same time, less social support has been available, leading to concerns about carers' wellbeing and ability to cope. Conclusion: Carers' needs have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater practical and emotional support is needed for carers from both formal services and community sources that considers their changing needs and offers educational and emotional support for long-term wellbeing. Strengths and Limitations: (1) This is the first systematic review to explore in depth the experiences of informal carers caring for people with a range of long-term conditions and from an international context. (2) The review includes an analysis of the quality of the studies, as well as a study of their relative contributions. (3) Further research is needed to explore the physical, emotional and financial impact of the pandemic for bereaved carers which is not captured in this review due to the lack of empirical data available at the time of review.

We searched for articles in the following databases, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, and Web of Science, where we found 128 articles to qualitatively evaluate and 103 articles to quantitatively analyze. Sadism correlated with narcissism ((r) over bar = 0.26), Machiavellianism ((r) over bar = 0.43), and psychopathy ((r) over bar = 0.58). The most common themes across the studies were: (a) structural aspects of the Dark Tetrad; (b) online behavior; (c) aggressiveness; (d) moral beliefs and behavior; (e) video games; (f) sexual behavior, and (g) emotional functioning. The Dark Tetrad traits correlated with several dysfunctional behaviors and socially maladaptive outcomes. Finally, sadism is potentially more similar to psychopathy and Machiavellianism, than narcissism.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and compulsions and has been associated with psychosocial impairment. Indeed, a number of studies have highlighted impairments in both social cognitive functions and empathic skills in OCD, despite several inconsistencies. This study aimed to investigate social cognitive dysfunction and empathy deficits in patients with OCD using a meta-analytic approach. A literature search was conducted using the databases Pubmed, PsycINFO, ProQuest and Scopus to identify the relevant studies (January 1980 to March 2020). Following the systematic review of relevant OCD studies, a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. The current meta-analysis included 25 studies consisting of 1161 patients with OCD and 1329 healthy controls. OCD was associated with decreased performance in theory of mind (ToM). In the facial emotion recognition domain, patients with OCD significantly underperformed healthy controls only in their recognition of disgust. OCD was significantly related to reduced cognitive empathy. OCD was associated with medium-sized impairments in ToM and cognitive empathy, which can likely contribute to psychosocial impairment in this disorder. Further studies are needed to investigate state and trait-related factors using experimental measures of empathy.

Relevant works published on or before 1st September 2022 were identified through a search in five major databases in English and 19 articles (N = 18,977) finally met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted to compute the pooled effect size (correlation; r), and moderator analyses were performed using a random effects meta-analytic model. The studies yielded a significant inverse association between childhood exposure to family violence and telomere length, with a small effect size (r = -0.038, 95% CI [-0.070, -0.005], p = 0.025). Furthermore, the strength of this association was stronger in studies examining the co-occurrence of multiple types of violence than in those examining just one type (Q = 8.143, p = 0.004). These findings suggested that victims' telomere length may be negatively influenced by childhood exposure to family violence and that such impairment appears to be stronger for those who are exposed to multiple types of violence. Future studies are necessary to examine the moderating and mediating factors underlying the association between childhood exposure to family violence and telomere length.

AB  - Tribes are the most vulnerable, particularly in healthcare. Health research in a population helps to understand the trends of various diseases and other social determinants causing them. Our study aims to perform a bibliometric analysis of Tribal research in India from its status quo. Materials and Methods: Research articles on tribal health were retrieved from Scopus and analyzed using MS Office, VOS viewer, and Word Cloud generator from January 2000 to December 2020. The number of research publications published each year, the clustering pattern of contributing authors, the most popular journals, the leading publication, document type, domain research areas, and commonly used keywords were all considered in the study. Results: As a result of the search, 1249 research publications were found. According to our selection criteria, only 395 research papers were included in the analysis. Approximately 43 research publications were published in 2020, but only three articles were published in 2000. Almost 35.7% of articles were published in traditional medicine, and 15.7% and 14.7% of articles were published in nutrition and infectious diseases. Less than 1% of articles were published in Health Policy, and 1.5% were published in Health Systems. Conclusions: The study results showed that the research on tribes has now been improving in the following years. Research into tribal mental health and health care systems should be encouraged. Collaboration and funding may assist academic institutions in raising awareness of health issues in these populations.

In total, 20 studies meeting the eligibility criteria were reviewed after performing a search of the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. The results suggested that religious and spiritual beliefs, thoughts, and practices (e.g., spiritual coping activities) might have both beneficial and deleterious effects on the way adolescents deal with their medical condition, on their psychosocial adjustment, on their mental and physical health, and on their adherence to treatments. Mediating and moderating mechanisms explaining these relations were also evidenced. Suggestions for future research and practical implications for healthcare professionals are provided in the concluding section of this work.

AB  - Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterised by immune dysregulation affecting multiple organs. Current anti-inflammatory treatments used in SLE are associated with unwanted side-effects. Dietary supplementation has been suggested as a safe and effective addition to conventional treatment, but evidence of efficacy in SLE or preventing associated comorbidities is uncertain. Methods: We identified literature on clinical trials focused on nutritional interventions in SLE aiming to improve inflammation and comorbidities. A systematic-type search on Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Library, was conducted to identify nutritional interventions among SLE patients in the past 15 years that met our inclusion criteria. Results: We identified 2754 articles, of which 14 were eligible for inclusion based on our set criteria and were subsequently quality assessed. Vitamin D or E supplementation was associated with respective improvement of inflammatory markers or antibody production, but not disease activity scores in most studies. Despite their expected synergistic actions, the addition of curcumin on vitamin D supplementation had no additional effects on disease activity or inflammatory markers. Trials of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation presented significant reductions in ESR, CRP, disease activity, inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress, and improved lipid levels and endothelial function, while a low glycaemic index (GI) diet showed evidence of reduced weight and improved fatigue in patients. Conclusions: Different dietary guidelines can therefore be implicated to target specific SLE symptoms or therapeutic side-effects. This systematic review highlights the scarcity of larger and longer in duration trials with homogenous methodologies and verifiable outcomes to assess disease progression.

AB  - Emotions play an essential role in human life for planning and decision making. Emotion identification and recognition is a widely explored field in the area of artificial intelligence and affective computing as a means of empathizing with humans and thereby improving human machine interaction. Though audio visual cues are vital for recognizing human emotions, they are sometimes insufficient in identifying emotions of people who are good at hiding emotions or people suffering from Alexithymia. Considering other dimensions like Electroencephalogram (EEG) or text, along with audio visual cues can aid in improving the results in such situations. Taking advantage of the complementarity of multiple modalities normally helps capture emotions more accurately compared to single modality. However, to achieve precise and accurate results, correct fusion of these multimodal signals is solicited. This study provides a detailed review of different multimodal fusion techniques that can be used for emotion recognition. This paper proposes in-depth study of feature-level fusion, decision-level fusion and hybrid fusion techniques for identifying human emotions based on multimodal inputs and compare the results. The study concentrates on three different modalities i.e., facial images, audio and text for experimentation; at least one of which differs in temporal characteristics. The result suggests that hybrid fusion works best in combining multiple modalities which differ in time synchronicity.

AB  - Simple Summary Male infertility is a health problem affecting a huge number of couples worldwide. For many years, scientists have focused on protein-coding genes to explore the causes and mechanisms of male infertility. In addition, noncoding regions that are transcribed but do not lead to protein production have also been proven to play an important role in many cellular processes and diseases. The exact role of long noncoding RNAs on male infertility is not well understood. In order to address this gap, we performed a systematic review of the literature using two databases, and then a bioinformatics analysis to identify the most important long noncoding RNAs in male infertility, as well as their mechanism of action. At first, we identified 625 articles, but after selecting some of them according to the criteria that we defined, our final sample comprised 20 articles. After analyzing them, many long noncoding RNAs were found to be deregulated in male infertility or specific subtypes of it, paving the way for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind male infertility, or even for the improvement of diagnosis and therapy. Finally, an association was found between male infertility and cancer that requires further investigation in the future. Male infertility is a complex disorder affecting many couples worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate important cellular processes; however, a comprehensive understanding of their role in male infertility is limited. This systematic review investigates the differential expressions of lncRNAs in male infertility or variations in lncRNA regions associated with it. The PRISMA guidelines were used to search Pubmed and Web of Science (1 June 2022). Inclusion criteria were human participants, patients diagnosed with male infertility, and English language speakers. We also performed an in silico analysis investigating lncRNAs that are reported in many subtypes of male infertility. A total of 625 articles were found, and after the screening and eligibility stages, 20 studies were included in the final sample. Many lncRNAs are deregulated in male infertility, and interactions between lncRNAs and miRNAs play an important role. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the impact of variants found in lncRNA regions. Furthermore, eight lncRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in many subtypes of male infertility. After in silico analysis, gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analysis of the genes targeted by them revealed their association with bladder and prostate cancer. However, pathways involved in general in tumorigenesis and cancer development of all types, such as p53 pathways, apoptosis, and cell death, were also enriched, indicating a link between cancer and male infertility. This evidence, however, is preliminary. Future research is needed to explore the exact mechanism of action of the identified lncRNAs and investigate the association between male infertility and cancer.

AB  - High levels of oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Our objectives were to review the association between oxidative stress markers and neurocognitive functioning in schizophrenia. Electronic search of MEDLINE, ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases was carried out in September 2022 to identify relevant English language articles. Articles identified were grouped under the following themes: comparison of oxidative stress or antioxidant biomarkers between patients with schizophrenia and general population, association between biomarkers of oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, and clinical trials evaluating the effect of antioxidant compounds on cognitive functioning in schizophrenia. We reviewed 36 eligible papers: 30 observational studies and 6 intervention trials. Marked heterogeneity was noted in patient population, oxidative stress markers examined, and cognitive measures. Majority (83.3%) of the observational studies were cross-sectional in design; half of them (50%) were conducted on chronic, stable, medicated patients. Most of the observational studies showed increased levels of oxidative stress biomarkers and decreased antioxidant activity in schizophrenia compared to controls. A significant positive association was noted between markers of antioxidant activity and cognitive performance in this group. Treatment trials of antioxidant agents showed positive but inconsistent evidence for benefits on cognitive measures and clinical symptomatology in schizophrenia. Our findings are broadly consistent with the redox imbalance hypothesis in schizophrenia. The significant associations noted between antioxidant markers and cognitive functioning may have key neurobiological and therapeutic implications.

AB  - Background: Brain infections are serious neurological events that require immediate care, with around 171 districts of 19 states in India reporting cases every year. Along with the biomedical factors, psychosocial factors of health (BPS) are influential in the outcomes of brain infections as well. Materials and Methods: A scoping review was conducted to understand the psychosocial factors explored in brain infections in the last decade. Articles focusing on social, psychological, public health factors, sequelae, and rehabilitation of inflammatory conditions, both pathogenic and autoimmune were covered. The search was conducted using keywords related to brain infections in electronic databases: PubMed, EBSCO, ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Prisma-ScR guidelines were used to screen articles and the identified factors were categorized under eight psychosocial factors using Arksey and O'Malley's framework of analysis. Results: From a total of 6012 documents retrieved, 11 articles met the criteria. Global burden associated with brain infections, disability and death, the vulnerable population at risk of developing brain infections, gaps in existing literature, pathways to care, mental health, cognitive difficulty associated with infections and their sequelae were the major psychosocial factors identified. Conclusions: The review focussed to understand the multitude of psychosocial factors causing delay and damage in brain infections in LMIC context. Along with biomedical factors, there exist several psychosocial factors that could potentially influence the outcome of treatment in brain infections. However, only few have been explored, suggesting the need for more studies to inform the care and sustainable interventions at the macro level to improve the outcomes and reduce the burden in brain infections.

AB  - Background: A high prevalence of dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes has been reported across the world. Methods: A systematic search was carried out. We included original articles on any topic relevant to health, excluding mental health, in all languages. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Both reviewers independently screened and read all publications. We compared dual use with exclusive smoking of conventional cigarettes (ESCC). Results: Fifty-two publications (49 studies) were included. Thirteen papers/10 studies were prospective. There was great heterogeneity across studies. Many methodological weaknesses, such as inaccurate exposure measurement, lack of adjustment for former tobacco consumption, and lack of significance testing were identified. Most prospective studies found dual use to be at least as harmful as ESCC. The longest follow-up was six years. Most of the best available cross-sectional studies found dual use associated with the same and, in several studies, significantly higher risk of self-reported symptoms/disease than in ESCC. The intensity of cigarette smoking seems associated with worse health. Conclusion: Existing studies indicate that dual use is at least as, or probably even more, harmful than ESCC. Due to the predominance of cross-sectional studies and the methodological weaknesses we judged the overall certainty of the evidence as "low certainty".

AB  - Becoming a parent is a challenging transition, and stress factors may arise. This scoping review aims to map, from the literature, the structure, potential barriers, and facilitators to be considered when conducting a parenting programme for parents of children up to 3 years old. It followed the JBI methodology and included studies with parents of children up to 3 years old (Participants), studies about parenting programme structure, its potential barriers, and facilitators (Concept) in the healthcare or community setting (Context). Qualitative and/or quantitative study designs and grey literature publications between 2016 and 2021 were eligible. The search was performed in three stages in CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE with Full Text, and PubMed databases. It was also conducted in OpenGrey, ProQuest, Portuguese Open Access Scientific Repository, and Google Scholar. Fourteen articles were selected. The following aspects were identified regarding parenting programmes: benefits; structuring elements to be considered; facilitating factors and possible barriers to its development, and measurement instruments to assess the programme. Parenting programmes are important ways to contribute to a healthy, sustainable, and resilient society. It should be adapted to individuals, groups, and communities. They add value to parents, children, and society and should be carefully adapted to the group's needs.

AB  - Sleep has a major impact on a variety of human biological and cognitive functions. In particular, its impact on memory has attracted extensive research and has been amply demonstrated. However, it is still unclear whether sleep, or lack thereof, affects the ability to recognize faces. To clarify this, we conducted a scoping review on studies that included a face recognition memory task and any kind of sleep manipulation in adults without any sleep pathology. A systematic search and synthesis of peer-reviewed journal articles identified through the electronic databases Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, and PubMed was performed. A final sample of 18 articles, corresponding to 19 studies, met the eligibility criteria. The results of 13 articles suggested that sleep benefited face recognition ability, whereas two articles indicated a detrimental effect of sleep on performance, and four articles found no significant effects. This review highlights the high methodological variability between studies, in terms of sleep manipulation, retention interval, tasks used to probe face recognition, and other variables. In sum, although around one third of the studies show a beneficial effect of sleep on memory for faces, we suggest that future research should invest in replicating these findings with a stricter control of potentially confounding variables to allow stronger conclusions to be drawn.

AB  - Main objective of this review is critically evaluate the use of vitamins in the safety measure as well as treatments of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using recent findings of research on both humans and animals. The authors combed through the fundamental literature on association of vitamins (fat-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins and some quasi vitamins) with prevention/treatment of AD to create this narrative review. An online search was conducted in Science Direct, Google Scholar, EBSCO & PubMed, a manual search via catalogues and scientific journals for review the literature regarding the relationship between vitamins and AD and to comprehend the potential mechanisms that may clarify such a relationship. After evaluating the titles and abstracts of the preliminary 500 articles, 350 were chosen. After reading the full texts and accomplishing a supplemental search on "Related citations " and the references of the chosen articles, a total of 282 references were found. The two most frequently mentioned ways that vitamins may affect cognitive function in AD are (1) by influences on a particular plasma amino acid called homocysteine (Hcy) for B vitamins (B-6, B-9 & B-12), and (2) through antioxidant effects, decreasing the free radicals' contents which can impairment human cells, for vitamins B-2, C, D, E, as well as ss-carotene. These theories concerning potential mechanisms are mostly based on preclinical research and findings of links between dementia or cognitive decline and elevated Hcy levels or elevated markers of oxidative stress. The results from current studies show an effectiveness and safety of vitamin supplementation to avert mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as the initial phases of AD will likely rely on firstly which metabolic pathways are affected, secondly which vitamins are lacking and could correct the pertinent metabolic flaw, and thirdly, the modulating effect of nutrient-nutrient and nutrient-genotype interaction. Further emphasis on an accurate dietary strategy is needed to recognize the complete prospective of vitamin therapy in avoiding dementia and cognitive function as well as to avoid causing devastation.

AB  - Objective The association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS and suicidality is not well understood, partly because of variability in results. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the predictive value of HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome for incident suicidality. Methods A literature review was conducted of articles published between January 1, 2010, and October 31, 2021. The following databases were searched: Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus. The search terms included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), suicidal behavior, auto mutilation, and self-injurious behavior. Observational studies were screened following a registered protocol, and eligible ones were meta-analyzed and followed by meta-regression. Results A total of 43 studies were included in this systematic review, and a meta-regression included 170,234 participants. The pooled prevalence estimates of suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, and deaths by suicide were 22.3%, 9.6%, and 1.7%, respectively. The following significant risk factors for suicide ideation were found: substance use, depression, low quality of life, low social support, without HIV status disclosure, living alone, low level of memory problems, family history of suicide, and stage III of HIV. Risk factors for suicide attempts were depression and family history of suicide. An elevated risk for suicide-related death was found for people living with HIV (PLHIV) who had a psychiatric disorder and in studies conducted in hospital-based settings (versus national database studies or HIV clinic settings). Conclusions The risk of suicidality is high among PLHIV within all six World Health Organization regions during the modern antiretroviral therapy era. Assessment of socioeconomic and psychological factors is recommended for further management to prevent suicide among PLHIV. The present findings are useful for design of intervention protocols and development of clinical practice guidelines intended to manage the well-being of PLHIV worldwide.

AB  - Previous research demonstrated that there are observable sex differences in developing muscle fatigue when mental task during fatiguing activity is present; however, there is no available review on this matter. Therefore, this review aimed to summarize the findings of previous studies investigating the effect of mental task on muscle fatigue in men and women. To conduct the review, we utilized searches using the electronic databases Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCO Cinahl Ultimate. The studies included had no limited publication date and examined the effects of mental task on muscle fatigue in a healthy adult population of any age. The evaluation was performed using the following criteria: time to failure, or subjective scale in various modifications (visual analog scale-VAS, rate of perceived effort-RPE, rate of perceived fatigue-RPF, rate of perceived discomfort-RPD). A total of seven studies met the set criteria, which were subsequently analyzed. Heavy mental task (more demanding math tasks) can reduce the time to failure for both men and women, with the reduction being more pronounced for women than for men. For light mental task (simple math tasks), no reduction in time to failure was observed to a great extent. The mental task in any of the included studies did not affect the subjective perception of fatigue, effort, discomfort, or pain. Although the studies investigating the effect of mental task on sex differences in muscle fatigability are limited, based on our findings we can assume that in jobs requiring heavier mental task, women may be more prone to the faster development of muscle fatigue; thus, employers might consider paying attention to the possibility of adequate rest.

AB  - This study sought to determine data collection approaches in Australian cohort studies and explore the potential impact on reported prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) prevalence and patterns. Inclusion criteria were that studies related to a general Australian antenatal population where PAE was assessed and reported. Studies were excluded if they were not peer reviewed, examined the prevalence of PAE in pregnancies complicated by alcohol-use disorders, or were published in a language other than English. A systematic search of five electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus) was conducted. Risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool. Results were synthesised using MetaXL. Data from 16 separate birth cohorts (n = 78 articles) were included. Included cohorts were either general cohorts that included alcohol as a variable or alcohol-focused cohorts that were designed with a primary focus on PAE. PAE prevalence was estimated as 48% (95% CI: 38 to 57%). When subgroup analysis was performed, estimates of PAE prevalence when self-administered surveys and interviews were used for data collection were 53% (95% CI: 41% to 64%) and 43% (95% CI: 28% to 59%), respectively. Use of trained assessors was an influencing factor of the prevalence estimates when data were collected via interview. Alcohol-focused studies reported higher prevalence of PAE, regardless of method of survey administration. Where interviewer training is not possible, self-administered questionnaires will likely provide the most reliable PAE estimates. No funding sources are relevant to mention. Review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020204853).

AB  - Efforts to restore and reclaim coastal wetlands have led to the evolution of invasive alien plant species and coastal defenses across significant parts of the globe. Synergistic stresses on coastal environments are intensifying due to the implementation of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) and the rapid expansion of coastal protection. Combined with sea-level rise and other projected climate change impacts, coastal habitats are expected to face much greater pressures and habitat degradation. The lack of more extended timescale studies on IAPS and the insufficient knowledge about the ecological impacts of coastal armoring suggest that life cycle assessment (LCA) is still underutilized within the coastal environment. We examine quantitative methods for cause-effect evaluation of three major biodiversity loss drivers: biodiversity/habitat loss, greenhouse gases GHG warming and nutrient enrichment/eutrophication, which are pertinent to IAPS, and coastal armoring in wetlands. Though there has been a scarce application of LCA to measure anthropogenic impacts on coastal ecosystems, our analysis shows that impact indicators can be enhanced for all known drivers but at varying levels of cause-effect pathway coverage, ambiguity, and spatial coverage. Modeling methods for predicting the spatial distribution and severity of human-driven actions in the coastal environment are well developed. Such procedures could be deployed to create spatially explicit LCA fate factors. We emphasize unique research paradigms to make LCA a more thorough and rigorous environmental impact assessment tool by incorporating coastal biodiversity loss, especially IAPS and habitat loss, in a consistent manner. Stakeholder participation in coastal ecosystem management may help ameliorate budgetary concerns and enhance wetland restoration practices and implementations.

AB  - Despite rapid advances in the field of chronic pain, it remains extremely challenging in the clinic. Pain treatment strategies have not improved for decades as opioids remain the main prescribed drugs for chronic pain management. However, long-term use of opioids often leads to detrimental side effects. Therefore, uncovering the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of chronic pain may aid the discovery of novel therapeutics to benefit patients with chronic pain. Substantial evidence indicates downregulation of alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha 7 nAChR) in the sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia, and spinal cord dorsal horn in rodent models of chronic pain. Moreover, our recent study and results from other laboratories demonstrate that potentiation of alpha 7 nAChR attenuates pain behaviors in various murine models of chronic pain. This review summarized and discussed the preclinical evidence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of alpha 7 nAChR agonists and allosteric modulators in chronic pain. This evidence indicates that potentiation of alpha 7 nAChR is beneficial in chronic pain, mostly by alleviating neuroinflammation. Overall, alpha 7 nAChR-based therapy for chronic pain is an area with great promise, but more research regarding its detailed mechanisms is warranted.

AB  - Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly used to treat the symptoms of various neurologic and psychiatric conditions. People can undergo the procedure during reproductive years but the safety of DBS in pregnancy remains relatively unknown given the paucity of published cases. We thus conducted a review of the literature to determine the state of current knowledge about DBS in pregnancy and to determine how eligibility criteria are approached in clinical trials with respect to pregnancy and the potential for pregnancy. Methods: A literature review was conducted in EMBASE to identify articles involving DBS and pregnancy. Two reviewers independently analyzed the articles to confirm inclusion. Data extracted for analysis included conditions treated, complications at all stages of pregnancy, neonatal/pediatric outcomes, and DBS target. A second search was then conducted using The same two reviewers then assessed whether each trial excluded pregnant individuals, lactating individuals, or persons of childbearing age planning to conceive. Also assessed was whether contraception had to be deemed adequate prior to enrollment. Results: The literature search returned 681 articles. Following independent analysis and agreement of two reviewers, 8 pregnancy related DBS articles were included for analysis. These articles described 27 subjects, 29 pregnancies (2 with subsequent pregnancies), and 31 infants (2 twin pregnancies). There was 1 preterm birth at 35 weeks, and 3 patients who experienced discomfort from the DBS battery (i.e., impulse generator) placement site. All 27 patients had a DBS device implanted before they became pregnant, which remained in use throughout their pregnancy. There was exclusion of pregnant individuals from 68% of 135 interventional trials involving DBS. Approximately 44% of these trials excluded persons of childbearing age not on "adequate contraception " or wishing to conceive in the coming years. Finally, 22% excluded breastfeeding persons. Conclusion: The data from 29 pregnancies receiving DBS treatment during pregnancy was not associated with unexpected pregnancy or post-partum complication patterns. Many clinical trials have excluded pregnant individuals. Documentation of outcomes in larger numbers of pregnancies will help clarify the safety profile and will help guide study designs that will safely include pregnant patients.

AB  - Background Clinical practicum provides nursing students with more opportunities to learn their professional knowledge and develop basic nursing skills. Intensive care unit (ICU) is often used as one of the clinical practicum departments for nursing students. Due to the characteristic fast-paced working environments, high acuity of patient care, and technical complexities of an ICU, nursing students are more susceptible to experiencing stress and lack of confidence in these settings, which hinders their professionalization and affects patient care. Objective The study aimed to summarize and evaluate the nursing students' experience in an ICU during their practicum and to provide a supportive ICU clinical practicum environment for them. One of the main objectives was to increase the ICU specialty nurse reserve and improve nursing care in the ICU. Methods The following databases were searched for related qualitative publications in Chinese and English by systematic searches across January 2022, including the nursing students' experience in ICU during their practicum: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and so on. The qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. Two reviewers independently selected these studies and carefully evaluated the quality of each study. Meta-synthesis was then used to summarize the results. Results Eleven sub-themes and 3 themes were revealed in 9 studies: challenges of clinical practicum in the ICU, the expectation of support from multiple sources, and the importance and necessity of practicum in the ICU. Conclusion Performing one's practicum in ICU was considered by the nursing students in this review as a beneficial practicum despite the challenges involved. The appropriate guidance and monitoring should be given by hospital managers and college educators.

AB  - Introduction: The Nurturing Care Framework (NCF) describes "nurturing care" as the ability of nations and communities to support caregivers and provide an environment that ensures children's good health and nutrition, protects them from threats, and provides opportunities for early learning through responsive and emotionally supportive interaction. We assessed the extent to which Kenyan government policies address the components of the NCF and explored policy/decision makers' views on policy gaps and emerging issues.
   Methods: A search strategy was formulated to identify policy documents focusing on early childhood development (ECD), health and nutrition, responsive caregiving, opportunities for early learning and security and safety, which are key components of the NCF. We limited the search to policy documents published since 2010 when the Kenya constitution was promulgated and ECD functions devolved to county governments. Policy/decision-maker interviews were also conducted to clarify emerging gaps from policy data. Data was extracted, coded and analyzed based on the components of the NCF. Framework analysis was used for interview data with NCF being the main framework of analysis. The Jaccard's similarity coefficient was used to assess similarities between the themes being compared to further understand the challenges, successes and future plans of policy and implementation under each of the NCF domains.
   Results: 127 policy documents were retrieved from government e-repository and county websites. Of these, n = 91 were assessed against the inclusion criteria, and n = 66 were included in final analysis. The 66 documents included 47 County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) and 19 national policy documents. Twenty policy/decision-maker interviews were conducted. Analysis of both policy and interview data reveal that, while areas of health and nutrition have been considered in policies and county level plans (coefficients >0.5), the domains of early learning, responsive caregiving and safety and security face significant policy and implementation gaps (coefficients <= 0.5), particularly for the 0-3 year age group. Inconsistencies were noted between county level implementation plans and national policies in areas such as support for children with disabilities and allocation of budget to early learning and nutrition domains.
   Conclusion: Findings indicate a strong focus on nutrition and health with limited coverage of responsive caregiving and opportunities for early learning domains. Therefore, if nurturing care goats are to be achieved in Kenya, policies are needed to support current gaps identified with urgent need for policies of minimum standards that provide support for improvements across all Nurturing Care Framework domains.

AB  - Background The outbreak of coronavirus began in China in December 2019. It became a pandemic and a public health emergency. There have been numerous reports related to post-traumatic stress disorder outbreaks in the COVID-19 crisis. After a natural disaster, children are at a higher risk for post-traumatic stress disorder. The current study is a review of the scientific literature on the effect of COVID-19 on the prevalence of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in children. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases until February 02, 2022. The search strategy was based on a combination of the following keywords "child," "COVID-19," and "post-traumatic stress disorder." Results By searching the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases, 173 articles were retrieved. After reviewing the inclusion criteria and in terms of eligibility, 10 articles met the inclusion criteria out of the remaining 46 articles. Based on the findings, 80% of the articles were cross-sectional and 20% of them were longitudinal. The articles reviewed in this study reported an increase in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in children during or after the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions In summary, the findings of this review showed that restrictions and fears of COVID-19 had negative psychological effects on children. As well, one of the most important issues that arose at the time of the tragedy was that children were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Given that post-traumatic stress disorder can be treated, it is essential to choose the appropriate therapeutic intervention approach in order to better deal with the negative effects in children.

AB  - Background: Parents who lost their only child and cannot have a second child ( "Shidu ") have been a large population in China. Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in Shidu parents is of clinical and public health concern but the reported PGD prevalence varies widely. To facilitate the planning of grief counseling services, this meta-analysis estimated prevalence of PGD and its symptoms and identified subgroups at elevated risk for PGD. Methods: We searched English and Chinese literature databases to identify cross-sectional surveys reporting prevalence of PGD or PGD symptoms in Chinese Shidu parents. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data ( "JBI ") was used to assess risk of bias of included studies. Results: Seven studies with a total of 2,794 Shidu parents were included and their JBI scores ranged from five to eight. The pooled prevalence of PGD and PGD symptoms was 20.9% and 75.0%, respectively. Greater risk of PGD was observed in mothers [vs. fathers, OR (odds ratio) = 1.89, P = 0.001] and in parents with religious beliefs (vs. without religious beliefs, OR = 1.65, P = 0.040). More severe PGD symptoms were presented in parents whose only child died from accidents [vs. illness, MD (mean difference) = 3.99, P < 0.001]. Deceased children of PGD parents were older than those of non-PGD parents (MD = 1.64, P = 0.035) and PGD parents had a shorter duration since the loss than non-PGD parents (MD = -3.26, P = 0.013). Conclusions: PGD is prevalent among Shidu parents. Grief counseling services for Shidu parents would be more effective if they target those who are mothers and have religious beliefs and those whose children died from accidents, lost children are older, and loss occurs more recently.

AB  - Molecular neuroimaging studies provide mounting evidence that neuroinflammation plays a contributory role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). This has been the focus of a number of positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the 17-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which is expressed by microglia and serves as a marker of neuroinflammation. In this meta-analysis, we compiled and analyzed all available molecular imaging studies comparing cerebral TSPO binding in MDD patients with healthy controls. Our systematic literature search yielded eight PET studies encompassing 238 MDD patients and 164 healthy subjects. The meta-analysis revealed relatively increased TSPO binding in several cortical regions (anterior cingulate cortex: Hedges' g = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.84; hippocampus: g = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.81; insula: g = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.69; prefrontal cortex: g = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.59; temporal cortex: g = 0.39, 95% CI: -0.04, 0.81). While the high range of effect size in the temporal cortex might reflect group-differences in body mass index (BMI), exploratory analyses failed to reveal any relationship between elevated TSPO availability in the other four brain regions and depression severity, age, BMI, radioligand, or the binding endpoint used, or with treatment status at the time of scanning. Taken together, this meta-analysis indicates a widespread & SIM;18% increase of TSPO availability in the brain of MDD patients, with effect sizes comparable to those in earlier molecular imaging studies of serotonin transporter availability and monoamine oxidase A binding.

AB  - Question Effective prevention of suicide requires a comprehensive understanding of risk factors. Study selection and analysis Five databases were systematically searched to identify psychological autopsy studies (published up to February 2022) that reported on risk factors for suicide mortality among adults in the general population. Effect sizes were pooled as odds ratios (ORs) using random-effects models for each risk factor examined in at least three independent samples. Findings A total of 37 case-control studies from 23 countries were included, providing data on 40 risk factors in 5633 cases and 7101 controls. The magnitude of effect sizes varied substantially both between and within risk factor domains. Clinical factors had the strongest associations with suicide, including any mental disorder (OR=13.1, 95% CI 9.9 to 17.4) and a history of self-harm (OR=10.1, 95% CI 6.6 to 15.6). By comparison, effect sizes were smaller for other domains relating to sociodemographic status, family history, and adverse life events (OR range 2-5). Conclusions A wide range of predisposing and precipitating factors are associated with suicide among adults in the general population, but with clear differences in their relative strength. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021232878.

AB  - ObjectiveSuicide resilience is gaining increasing attention from researchers because of its potential role in preventing suicide. However, it has not been clearly analyzed, and there are various meanings and terms regarding this issue. The purpose of this analysis, therefore, was to conceptualize the concept of suicide resilience. MethodsWalker and Avant's method of concept analysis was used to identify the antecedents, attributes, and consequences of suicide resilience. The literature was searched using PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, CNKI, and WanFang databases with no limitation on publication date. The search included peer-reviewed journal articles and dissertations related to suicide resilience published in English or Chinese. Results52 articles were identified to provide information for this concept analysis. Five defining attributes of suicide resilience were identified: social support, coping strategies, psychological capital, meaning in life, and sense of responsibility. Antecedents of suicide resilience were high suicide risk events, and consequences of suicide resilience were keeping vulnerable individuals stay away from or overcoming suicidality. ConclusionsThe result of the analysis provided a more clear definition of suicide resilience. The identified defining attributes, antecedents, and consequences can be further tested and used to develop potential interventions. Future research is needed and will help to advance our understanding of the scope.

AB  - Ever since the dawn of antiquity, people have strived to improve their cognitive abilities. From the advent of the wheel to the development of artificial intelligence, technology has had a profound leverage on civilization. Cognitive enhancement or augmentation of brain functions has become a trending topic both in academic and public debates in improving physical and mental abilities. The last years have seen a plethora of suggestions for boosting cognitive functions and biochemical, physical, and behavioral strategies are being explored in the field of cognitive enhancement. Despite expansion of behavioral and biochemical approaches, various physical strategies are known to boost mental abilities in diseased and healthy individuals. Clinical applications of neuroscience technologies offer alternatives to pharmaceutical approaches and devices for diseases that have been fatal, so far. Importantly, the distinctive aspect of these technologies, which shapes their existing and anticipated participation in brain augmentations, is used to compare and contrast them. As a preview of the next two decades of progress in brain augmentation, this article presents a plausible estimation of the many neuroscience technologies, their virtues, demerits, and applications. The review also focuses on the ethical implications and challenges linked to modern neuroscientific technology. There are times when it looks as if ethics discussions are more concerned with the hypothetical than with the factual. We conclude by providing recommendations for potential future studies and development areas, taking into account future advancements in neuroscience innovation for brain enhancement, analyzing historical patterns, considering neuroethics and looking at other related forecasts.

AB  - Background: Social support is an important approach to improve the psychosocial health status and promote positive coping for caregivers of children with chronic diseases. Such an approach can reduce parenting stress, help resolve parenting difficulties through the use of various social support relationships. Methods: We performed an umbrella review methodology using the method of examination, analysis and synthesis of systematic reviews. A PRISMA flow diagram was used to show the search process. The Joanna Briggs Institute was used to appraise the quality of papers and a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Relevant English and Chinese systematic reviews were searched in Embase, PubMed, Web of science, OVID, CNKI, CBM, Wan Fang and Cochrane Library databases, until November 2021, June 2022. Results: Out of 1,905 records, we included fourteen systematic reviews for a synthesis. Evidence to promote social support for caregivers of children with chronic diseases was identified from four key aspects: (i) Intervention content; (ii) Intervention forms; (iii) Intervention time; and (iv) Sources of support. Conclusions: The findings of this review suggest that a combination of differing interventions, especially for early family, including the content of parenting training or education, attitude building and resource provision, which can implement online is recommend. More interventional studies and quantitative evidence syntheses are still needed. Impact: Adequate social support is essential to promote the psychological wellbeing of caregivers of children with chronic diseases. In the early stage of children's diseases, integrating different content and forms of interventions for caregivers' families and actively helping caregivers to identify available support resources can improve social support. The findings from this review can be used to guide caregivers of children with chronic diseases and provide evidence for healthcare professionals and social workers to carry out relevant interventions.

AB  - Objectives To examine the time delay between the age at onset of symptoms or episodes of bipolar disorders (BD) and the age at diagnosis of and/or receipt of clinical practice guideline recommended interventions for BD. Methods Systematic search of five databases to identify publications from January 2000 to July 2022 that reported one or more of the following reliable and valid estimates of latency: delay in help seeking (DHS), delay in diagnosis (DD) and duration of untreated BD (DUB). Eligible studies were included in random effects meta-analyses and multivariate meta-regression was used to assess factors associated with each latency construct. Results Screening of 1074 publications identified 59 eligible studies (reported in 66 publications) of >40,000 individuals that estimated DHS (8 studies), DD (20 studies) and/or DUB (45 studies). The median DHS, DD and DUB were 3.5 (IQR: 2.8, 8.48), 6.7 (IQR: 5.6, 8.9) and 5.9 years (IQR: 1.1, 8.2), respectively. Key factors associated with shorter DD included older age and residing outside North America; shorter DUB was associated with psychotic or manic onset and access to early intervention services. Conclusions Greater consensus on definitions of latency constructs and better-quality targeted research is required regarding DHS, DD and DUB. This review suggests that, while the peak age at onset of BD is 15-25, diagnosis and guideline recommended interventions (e.g., mood stabilizers) are likely to be delayed until age 25-35 years except for a minority of individuals with access to early intervention services.

AB  - Background: Neuroinflammation is a response that involves different cell lineages of the central nervous system, such as neurons and glial cells. Among the non-pharmacological interventions for neuroinflammation, photobiomodulation (PBM) is gaining prominence because of its beneficial effects found in experimental brain research. We systematically reviewed the effects of PBM on laboratory animal models, specially to investigate potential benefits of PBM as an efficient anti-inflammatory therapy.Methods: We conducted a systematic search on the bibliographic databases (PubMed and ScienceDirect) with the keywords based on MeSH terms: photobiomodulation, low-level laser therapy, brain, neuroinflammation, inflammation, cytokine, and microglia. Data search was limited from 2009 to June 2022. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. The initial systematic search identified 140 articles. Among them, 54 articles were removed for duplication and 59 articles by screening. Therefore, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria.Results: The studies showed that PBM has anti-inflammatory properties in several conditions, such as traumatic brain injury, edema formation and hyperalgesia, ischemia, neurodegenerative conditions, aging, epilepsy, depression, and spinal cord injury.Conclusion: Taken together, these results indicate that transcranial PBM therapy is a promising strategy to treat brain pathological conditions induced by neuroinflammation.

AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairments and blindness worldwide in the elderly and its incidence strongly increases with ages. The etiology of AMD is complex and attributed to the genetic modifiers, environmental factors and gene-environment interactions. Recently, the impacts of air pollution on the development of eye diseases have become the new area of focus, and disordered air exposure combined with inadequate health management has caused problems for the eye health, such as dry eye, glaucoma, and retinopathy, while its specific role in the occurrence of AMD is still not well understood. In order to summarize the progress of this research field, we performed a critical review to summarize the epidemiological and mechanism evidence on the association between air pollutants exposure and AMD. This review documented that exposure to air pollutants will accelerate or worsen the morbidity and prevalence of AMD. Air pollutants exposure may change the homeostasis, interfere with the inflamma-tory response, and take direct action on the lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in the macula. More attention should be given to understanding the impact of ambient air pollution on AMD worldwide.

AB  - ObjectiveAdolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) are considered to be at heightened risk for developing mental health problems in comparison to their peers due to the burden of living with a stigmatized condition and managing a chronic condition. Poorer mental health outcomes among ALHIV are associated with lower rates of adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART). It is necessary to improve mental wellness among ALHIV as this acts as a buffer against developing mental health problems which, if left untreated can evolve into mental health disorders. Research on mental wellness concepts among ALHIV is underdeveloped which is associated with a lack of appropriate measures of mental wellness. We conducted an integrative review to conceptualize mental wellness and consider the critical components for measuring mental wellness in ALHIV. MethodAn integrative review of published literature focusing on mental wellness of ALHIV in the African context was conducted. The process was guided by the PRISMA operational steps. As part of our problem identification phase, we drew on findings from a previous systematic review of mental wellness instruments and a qualitative photovoice study on exploring the experiences of ALHIV, to develop an initial framework of 13 mental wellness concepts and behaviors which informed the search strategy. ResultsThe review included 17 articles from which we identified six mental wellness concepts: Connectedness, Sense of Coherence (SOC), Self-esteem, Self-acceptance, Hope for the Future and Spirituality as well as six behaviors facilitating mental wellness: Coping, Resilience, Purpose in Life (goals), Self-efficacy, Adherence Self-efficacy, and Leisure Activities. All of these concepts and behaviors have been noted in our previous research (systematic review and qualitative work), with the exception of adherence self-efficacy. Based on the findings from this review and our previous work, we adapted the Salutogenic Model of Health developed by Antonovsky in 1987, to propose a Salutogenic Model of Mental Wellness (SMoMW) for ALHIV in the African context. This SMoMW may be used to develop an age and culturally appropriate measure of mental wellness for ALHIV. ConclusionThe findings from this review used to conceptualize mental wellness among ALHIV which can be used to develop a measurement of mental wellness.

AB  - For decades, aberrant dopamine transmission has been proposed to play a central role in schizophrenia pathophysiology. These theories are supported by human in vivo molecular imaging studies of dopamine transmission, particularly positron emission tomography. However, there are several downsides to such approaches, for example limited spatial resolution or restriction of the measurement to synaptic processes of dopaminergic neurons. To overcome these limitations and to measure complementary aspects of dopamine transmission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based approaches investigating the macrostructure, metabolism, and connectivity of dopaminergic nuclei, i.e., substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area, can be employed. In this scoping review, we focus on four dopamine MRI methods that have been employed in patients with schizophrenia so far: neuromelanin MRI, which is thought to measure long-term dopamine function in dopaminergic nuclei; morphometric MRI, which is assumed to measure the volume of dopaminergic nuclei; diffusion MRI, which is assumed to measure fiber-based structural connectivity of dopaminergic nuclei; and resting-state blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional MRI, which is thought to measure functional connectivity of dopaminergic nuclei based on correlated blood oxygenation fluctuations. For each method, we describe the underlying signal, outcome measures, and downsides. We present the current state of research in schizophrenia and compare it to other disorders with either similar (psychotic) symptoms, i.e., bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, or dopaminergic abnormalities, i.e., substance use disorder and Parkinson's disease. Finally, we discuss overarching issues and outline future research questions.

KW  - Vaccine hesitancy
KW  - WILLINGNESS
AB  - Aim Although multiple COVID-19 vaccines are approved for global use, vaccine hesitancy poses a substantial risk for global health. Therefore, the aim of this umbrella review is to identify those factors that influence COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in the general population. This is necessary to improve the effectiveness of future vaccination programmes. Methods PubMed, Embase, Scopus, PsycInfo, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, and PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) were searched on December 21, 2021. This review included reviews which investigated factors of intention, willingness, or hesitancy with regard to the COVID-19 vaccination in adult populations, with no restrictions on setting. Content-based structure was used to synthesise the extracted data. The findings were presented based on the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) Working Group Model for vaccine hesitancy. Results A total of 3,392 studies were identified, of which 31 met the inclusion criteria. The most frequently documented factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included contextual factors, such as sex, age, and social inequalities; individual and group factors, such as trust in the healthcare system, public health authorities, and governments, and history of vaccination; vaccine-specific factors, such as concern for vaccine safety, perceived vaccine barriers, perceived effectiveness of vaccines, and concern about the rapid development of the vaccine; and disease-specific factors, such as fear of being infected with COVID-19, perceived severity of COVID-19, and knowledge of COVID-19. Conclusion There are multiple factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Our findings lay the foundation to further understand COVID-19 vaccination uptake and provide possible targets for intervention programmes. However, there are gaps in research concerning certain populations, including vaccination in people with mental disorders.

AB  - A systematic review of qualitative studies was conducted to explore how parents perceive sleep quality in their infants aged 0-24 months and the factors that influence these perceptions. A systematic search of the databases Scopus, Embase, Cinahl, PsycInfo and MEDLINE, was undertaken to identify eligible peer-reviewed studies published between 2006-2021. Ten papers met inclusion criteria and were subsequently included in the review. Evaluation of papers with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist classified papers as weak, moderate or strong, with half considered strong. Thematic synthesis identified one superordinate theme, culture, and five interrelated subordinate themes regarding how parents perceive their infant's sleep and the factors that may influence these perceptions. These themes were: (1) Infants physical and emotional comfort; (2) Beliefs regarding safety; (3) Parental and familial wellbeing; (4) Perceived degree of infant agency; (5) Influence of external beliefs and opinions. The findings from this review may assist practitioners in providing parents with personalized and culturally sensitive information regarding infant sleep and may also inform antenatal and early intervention practices, subsequently minimizing parental distress regarding infant sleep patterns.

AB  - Background and Hypothesis Despite the accepted link between childhood adversity (CA) and psychotic disorders, evidence on the relationship between CA and poor functional outcome remains less consistent and has never been reviewed quantitatively. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically examine the association between CA and functional outcomes in people with psychotic disorders. Study Design The study protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021254201). A search was conducted across EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Libraries (CENTRAL) using search terms related to psychosis; CA (general, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect); and functional outcomes (social, occupational, and general functioning [GF]). We conducted random-effects models, sensitivity and heterogeneity analyses, meta-regressions, and we assessed quality. Study Results Our meta-analysis comprised 35 studies, including 10 568 cases with psychosis. General CA was negatively associated with GF (28 studies; r = -0.109, 95%CI = -0.161 to -0.05, P < .001), with greater effects in prospective data (10 studies; r = -0.151, 95% CI = -0.236 to -0.063, P = .001). General CA was also associated with social functioning (r = -0.062, 95% CI = -0.120 to -0.004, P = .018) but not occupational outcomes. All CA subtypes except sexual abuse were significantly associated with GF, with emotional and physical neglect showing the largest magnitudes of effect (ranging from r = -0.199 to r = -0.250). Conclusions This meta-analysis provides evidence for a negative association between general CA, specific subtypes, and general and social functional outcomes in people with psychosis.

AB  - The approach of evidence-based medicine has been extended to psychotherapy. More than 20 years ago, criteria for empirically supported psychotherapeutic treatments (ESTs) were defined. Meanwhile a new model for empirically supported psychotherapeutic treatments has been proposed. While the empirical status of psychodynamic therapy (PDT) was assessed in several reviews using the previous criteria, the proposed new model has not yet been applied to PDT. For this reason, we will carry out a systematic review on studies of PDT in common mental disorders applying the revised criteria of ESTs. As suggested by the new model we will focus on recent systematic quantitative reviews. A systematic search for meta-analyses on the efficacy of PDT in common mental disorders will be carried out. Meta-analyses will be selected and evaluated by at least two raters along the criteria of the new proposed model. In addition, systematic reviews and individual studies addressing mechanisms of change in PDT, effectiveness under real-world conditions, cost-effectiveness and adverse events will be systematically searched for and evaluated. Finally, quality of evidence, the extent to which benefits exceed harms and strength of recommendations will be assessed per disorder using GRADE.

AB  - Objective: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of exposure and response prevention (ERP) combined with medication on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Cochrane, Embase, and Science Direct databases were searched to include randomized controlled trials of ERP combined with medication for OCD that met the criteria. The Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale was used as the primary outcome indicator, and Depression scales were used as secondary outcome indicators. An evaluation of bias risk was conducted to identify possible sources of bias based on methodological and clinical factors. Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 16.0 software was used to perform meta-analysis of the extracted data. Results: A total of 21 studies with 1113 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that ERP combined with medication therapy was significantly better than medication therapy alone including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, clomipramine and risperidone (MD = -6.60, 95% CI: -8.35 to -4.84, P < 0.00001), but D-cycloserine (DCS) drugs do not enhance the effect of ERP intervention in patients with OCD (MD = 0.15, 95% CI: -0.87 to 1.17, P = 0.77). There is more significant maintenance by combined treatment method of medication plus ERP than medication treatment alone during the follow-up period (MD = -7.14, 95% CI: -9.17 to -5.10, P < 0.00001). DCS drugs did not enhance the effect of ERP intervention on depression in patients with OCD (SMD = -0.08, 95% CI: -0.31 to 0.15, P = 0.50). ERP combined with drug improved patients' depression levels significantly better than providing drug alone (SMD = -0.40, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.11, P = 0.006). Conclusion: Patients with OCD have significant improvement in symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression when ERP is combined with medication, however, not enough to prove that DCS can enhance ERP effectiveness.

AB  - Many studies have investigated impairments in two key domains of social cognition (theory of mind [ToM] and facial emotion recognition [FER]) in children and adolescents with epilepsy. However, inconsistent conclusions were found. Our objective was to characterize social cognition performance of children and adolescents with epilepsy. A literature search was conducted using Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases. The article retrieval, screening, quality assessment (Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale), and data extraction were performed independently by two investigators. A random-effects model was used to examine estimates. The meta-analysis included 19 studies, with a combined sample of 623 children and adolescents with epilepsy (mean [SD] age, 12.13 [2.62] years; 46.1% female) and 677 healthy controls [HCs]) (mean [SD] age, 11.48 [2.71] years; 50.7% female). The results revealed that relative to HCs, children and adolescents with epilepsy exhibited deficits in ToM (g = -1.08, 95% CI [-1.38, -0.78], p < 0.001, the number of studies [k] = 13), FER (g = -0.98, 95% CI [-1.33, -0.64], p < 0.001, k = 12), and ToM subcomponents (cognitive ToM: g = -1.04, 95% CI [-1.35, -0.72], p < 0.001, k = 12] and affective ToM: g = -0.73, 95% CI [-1.12, -0.34], p < 0.001, k = 8). In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in social cognition deficits between children and adolescents with focal epilepsy and generalized epilepsy. Meta-regressions confirmed the robustness of the results. These quantitative results further deepen our understanding of the two core domains of social cognition in children and adolescents with epilepsy and may assist in the development of cognitive interventions for this patient population.

AB  - With shrinking natural resources and the climate challenges, it is foreseen that there will be an imminent stress in agricultural outputs. Deep learning provides immense possibilities in allowing computational models to learn representation of data generated for precise application of agricultural inputs and the smart management of outputs. This will go a long way in addressing the global food security concerns. Present study demonstrates the discriminative and predictive power of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches that have been successfully applied to the various facets of engineering in agriculture; ranging from estimation of soil moisture, water stress determination, disease detection, weed identification, agro-produce quality evaluation and more. Realization of these approaches will preclude human judgment by the underlying iterations of deep learning framework resulting in an increased precision and universality. Broader acceptance and applicability of deep learning would require inclusion of ground-truth datasets and should feature integration of mechanisms for fusion of data from multiple provenances; thus making the models robust and field worthy.

AB  - A number of school-based mental health prevention programs have been found to be effective in research trials, but little is known about how to support implementation in real-life settings. To address this translational problem, this systematic review aims to identify effective strategies for enhancing the implementation of mental health prevention programs for children in schools. Four electronic databases were searched for empirical, peer-reviewed articles in English from January 2000 to October 2021 reporting the effects of implementation strategies for school-based universal mental health programs. Twenty-one articles were included in the narrative synthesis and assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Twenty-two strategies were found to be effective at improving program fidelity or adoption. The strategies with the strongest positive evidence base were those that involved monitoring and provision of feedback, engaging principals as program leaders, improving teachers' buy-in and organising school personnel implementation meetings. We recommend school-based practitioners trial strategies with positive findings from this review as part of their continuous quality improvement. This review highlights the pressing need for large-scale, randomised controlled trials to develop and trial more robust strategies to enhance adoption, as the five implementation studies found to measure adoption used qualitative methods limited by small samples sizes and case study designs.

AB  - Current suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were studied through systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched the following electronic databases using the relevant search terms: Medline, Embase, PubMed and Web of Science, with the search time as of January 31,2022. Forest plots were obtained using Stata statistical software and a random-effects model was used to conduct a meta-analysis of the prevalence of suicidal ideation. We found 21 eligible studies, 11 of which pro-vided suitable data for meta-analysis. 10 studies explored current suicidal ideation and reported a pooled prevalence of 20.4% (95%CI 14.0-26.8). Six studies examined suicide attempts, with a pooled prevalence of 11.4% (95%CI 6.2-16.6). The prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts varied by the study method used and by the study sites. This work highlights the need for real-time monitoring of suicidal ideation and suicide in psychiatric patients during the covid-19 pandemic r to inform clinical practice and help identify research questions for future epidemiological studies.

AB  - Abiotic stresses of various chemical contamination of physical, inorganic, organic and biotoxin origin and biotic stresses of bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal origins are the significant constraints in achieving higher aquaculture production. Testing and rapid detection of these chemical and microbial contaminants are crucial in identifying and mitigating abiotic and biotic stresses, which has become one of the most challenging aspects in aquaculture and culture-based fisheries. The classical analytical techniques, including titrimetric methods, spectrophotometric, mass spectrometric, spectroscopic, and chromatographic techniques, are tedious and sometimes inaccessiblewhen required. The development of novel and improved bioanalytical methods for rapid, selective and sensitive detection is a wide and dynamic field of research. Biosensors offer precise detection of biotic and abiotic stressors in aquaculture and culture-based fisheries within no time. This review article allows filling the knowledge gap for detection and monitoring of chemical and microbial contaminants of abiotic and biotic origin in aquaculture and culture-based fisheries using nano(bio-) analytical technologies, including nano(bio-)molecular and nano(bio-)sensing techniques.

MethodsWe included reviews and articles on the SWB of older adults in the Web of Science Core Collection published from 2002 to 2021. We used CiteSpace to draw a knowledge map of the authors, institutions, countries, references, and keywords for visual analysis and used Microsoft Excel tables to count basic information details. ResultsA total of 354 papers were included, and the number of papers published over the past two decades showed a pattern of growth. The core force of publications was primarily attributed to studies conducted in Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania, which have relatively major issues of aging and good economic strength. However, links between states, institutions, and authors were relatively weak. Cluster analysis showed that the research field could be divided into eight topics: the application of social psychology in the study of the SWB of older adults, aging in older adults, health condition of older adults, achieving successful aging, interventions for SWB, age differences in SWB research, an economic perspective of SWB research and social support for older adults. Current research frontiers are socioeconomic status, community, intervention, participation, adjustment, validation, and personality. ConclusionThe results of the present study provided a comprehensive picture in the research field of SWB of older adults. It showed that the mechanism, especially the bidirectional effect, between the SWB of older adults and its influencing factors is still worthy of further exploration. More research on evidence-based and intervention strategies should be conducted in the future.

AB  - Purpose Eating disorders (EDs) are mental illnesses with severe consequences and high mortality rates. Notwithstanding, EDs are considered a niche specialty making it often difficult for researchers to publish in high-impact journals. Subsequently, research on EDs receives less funding than other fields of psychiatry potentially slowing treatment progress. This study aimed to compare research vitality between EDs and schizophrenia focusing on: number and type of publications; top-cited articles; geographical distribution of top-ten publishing countries; journal distribution of scientific production as measured by bibliometric analysis; funded research and collaborations. Methods We used the Scopus database, then we adopted the Bibliometrix R-package software with the web interface app Biblioshiny. We included in the analyses 1,916 papers on EDs and 6491 on schizophrenia. Results The ED field published three times less than schizophrenia in top-ranking journals - with letters and notes particularly lacking-notwithstanding a comparable number of papers published per author. Only 50% of top-cited articles focused on EDs and a smaller pool of journals available for ED research (i.e., Zones 1 and 2 according to Bradford's law) emerged; journals publishing on EDs showed an overall lower rank compared to the schizophrenia field. Schizophrenia research was more geographically distributed and more funded; in contrast, a comparable collaboration index was found between the fields. Conclusion These data show that research on EDs is currently marginalized and top-rank journals are seldom achievable by researchers in EDs. Such difficulties in research dissemination entail potentially serious repercussions on clinical advancements.

AB  - Background: Very few people seek in-person treatment for online behavioral addictions including gaming and gambling or problems associated with shopping, pornography use, or social media use. Web-based treatments have the potential to address low rates of help seeking due to their convenience, accessibility, and capacity to address barriers to health care access (eg, shame, stigma, cost, and access to expert care). However, web-based treatments for online behavioral addictions have not been systematically evaluated. Objective: This review aimed to systematically describe the content of web-based treatments for online behavioral addictions and describe their therapeutic effectiveness on symptom severity and consumption behavior.Methods: A database search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar was conducted in June 2022. Studies were eligible if the study design was a randomized controlled trial or a pre-post study with at least 1 web-based intervention arm for an online behavioral addiction and if the study included the use of a validated measure of problem severity, frequency, or duration of online behavior. Data on change techniques were collected to analyze intervention content, using the Gambling Intervention System of CharacTerization. Quality assessment was conducted using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. Results: The review included 12 studies with 15 intervention arms, comprising 7 randomized controlled trials and 5 pre-post studies. The primary focus of interventions was gaming (n=4), followed by internet use inclusive of screen time and smartphone use (n=3), gambling (n=3), and pornography (n=2). A range of different technologies were used to deliver content, including websites (n=6), email (n=2), computer software (n=2), social media messaging (n=1), smartphone app (n=1), virtual reality (n=1), and videoconferencing (n=1). Interventions contained 15 different change techniques with an average of 4 per study. The techniques most frequently administered (>30% of intervention arms) were cognitive restructuring, relapse prevention, motivational enhancement, goal setting, and social support. Assessment of study quality indicated that 7 studies met the criteria for moderate or strong global ratings, but only 8 out of 12 studies evaluated change immediately following the treatment. Across included studies, two-thirds of participants completed after-treatment evaluation, and one-quarter completed follow-up evaluation. After-intervention evaluation indicated reduced severity (5/9, 56%), frequency (2/3, 67%), and duration (3/7, 43%). Follow-up evaluation indicated that 3 pre-post studies for gaming, gambling, and internet use demonstrated reduced severity, frequency, and duration of consumption. At 3-month evaluation, just 1 pre-post study indicated significant change to mental health symptoms. Conclusions: Web-based treatments for online behavioral addictions use an array of mechanisms to deliver cognitive and behavioral change techniques. Web-based treatments demonstrate promise for short-term reduction in symptoms, duration, or frequency of online addictive behaviors. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of web-based treatments over the longer term due to the absence of controlled trials.

AB  - Objective: To study the similarities and differences in the clinical efficacy of aripiprazole and quetiapine in Chinese patients with bipolar depression through meta-analysis. Additionally, to provide evidence of aripiprazole in treatment for bipolar depression. Methods: We searched Chinese literature related to the study of aripiprazole and quetiapine in treatment for bipolar depression, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews, and case reports were excluded. The clinical efficacy between aripiprazole and quetiapine was synthesized and discussed. Result: A total of 1,546 subjects were included in 17 studies. The random effect model was used to review the data by RevMan 5.2. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the remission rate between patients treated with aripiprazole and quetiapine evidenced by the scale used to evaluate the patients being treated for bipolar depression (221/501 vs. 193/501, Z = 1.12, P = 0.26). But the results also showed that the remission rate of aripiprazole with lithium carbonate was significantly higher than quetiapine with lithium carbonate in the treatment of bipolar depression (111/232 vs. 69/232, Z = 3.92, P < 0.0001). The results showed that the effective rate of aripiprazole was similar to quetiapine (426/572 vs. 386/572, Z = 2.70, P = 0.007). Overall, there was no difference in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) score between patients treated with aripiprazole and quetiapine (Z = 1.68, P = 0.09). The results also show that the drop-out rate of aripiprazole was similar to quetiapine in the treatment of patients with bipolar depression (Z = 1.80, P = 0.07). Conclusion: As an atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole may be similar to quetiapine for treating bipolar depression with similar drop-out and higher remission rates when combined with lithium carbonate. However, the results of this study need to be read with caution given the poor quality of collected/analyzed literature.

AB  - Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a form of non-invasive neuromodulation that is increasingly used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD). However, treatment with rTMS could be optimized by identifying optimal treatment parameters or characteristics of patients that are most likely to benefit. This meta-analysis and meta-regression aims to identify sample and treatment characteristics that are associated with change in depressive symptom level, treatment response and remission. Methods: The databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the therapeutic efficacy of high-frequent, low-frequent, or bilateral rTMS for MDD compared to sham. Study and sample characteristics as well as rTMS parameters and outcome variables were extracted. Effect sizes were calculated for change in depression score and risk ratios for response and remission. Results: Sixty-five RCTs with a total of 2982 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Active rTMS resulted in a larger depressive symptom reduction than sham protocol (Hedges' g =-0.791 95% CI-0.977;-0.605). Risk ratios for response and remission were 2.378 (95% CI 1.882; 3.005) and 2.450 (95% CI 1.779; 3.375), respectively. We found no significant association between sample and treatment parameters and rTMS efficacy. Conclusions: rTMS is an efficacious treatment for MDD. No associations between sample or treatment characteristics and efficacy were found, for which we caution that publication bias, heterogeneity and lack of consistency in the definition of remission might bias these latter null findings. Our results are clinically relevant and support the use of rTMS as a non-invasive and effective treatment option for depression.

AB  - Background: Alexithymia is common in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although the estimated prevalence of alexithymia in patients with T2DM is widely reported, these results have not been synthesized. Aim: To systematically assess the prevalence and characteristics of alexithymia in patients with T2DM. Methods: We searched for relevant publications in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Database, and Weipu Database. The prevalence of alexithymia, the mean scores, and standard deviations of the total scale of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) were pooled using random effects meta-analysis in Stata 13.0, with studies stratified by study location in this meta-analysis. Results: This meta-analysis included thirteen articles. Pooled prevalence of alexithymia (TAS-20 total scores >= 61) were 43.0% (95%CI 35.0-51.0%), and the prevalence of alexithymia was higher in China (45.0%, 95%CI 36.0-54.0%) compared with non-China (41.0%, 95%CI 29.0-54.0%). The pooled mean score for the TAS-20 total scale was 57.70 (95% CI 55.25-60.15). Leave-one-out analysis showed that none of the studies significantly impacted the overall pooled results. Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated a high prevalence of alexithymia in patients with T2DM. Thus, clini-cians need to be aware of and assess appropriately for alexithymia in patients with T2DM.

Education is seen as an integral factor for this endeavour. The purpose of this paper is to review existing literature to determine both positive and negative attitudinal changes of health-care-related undergraduate students towards mental illness after a training intervention within higher education. Design/methodology/approach A search of papers written in the English Language was conducted between 2004 and 2021, using CINAHL, Eric, Educational Research Complete, Medline, psychINFO and SocIndex. Search terms used were undergraduate, attitudes or perceptions, mental illness/mental ill health, education, stigma and students. Findings In total, 24 studies were critically reviewed, which included experimental, descriptive and exploratory designs. The appraisal of papers used recognised evaluation tools to review the methodological quality. Findings suggest that overall, anti-stigma education has a significant positive effect for student attitudinal change. Research limitations/implications Mental health anti-stigma education is beneficial for changing attitudes, however, more bio-medically framed training is less powerful for initiating change. Learning from those with the lived experience appears to have a more sustainable impact as indicated in some of the studies. There is a need for more exploratory research to gain further knowledge on the critical educational mechanisms that may foster more long-term reframing of positive attitudes towards mental health. Practical implications Training providers need to consider the compelling evidence base surrounding anti-stigma pedagogy that supports the use of individuals with experience of mental ill health within the educational processes. Social implications Mental health stigma has potential for profound negative impact on individuals and at a wider societal level. Education is central to enable learners to consider their attitudes to mental illness to reduce stigmatising attitudes. Students on health-care-related courses are influential in becoming catalysts for change. Originality/value This paper has critically reviewed the literature examining the attitudes of health-care-related undergraduate students following anti-stigma education, offering insights into some of positive and negative attitudinal changes and opinions of the event. In particular contributing to an understanding on the important components for eradicating the stigma surrounding mental health.

AB  - Families of autistic children from underserved populations participate in support services at lower rates than other families. To better understand possible reasons for this inequity, we reviewed qualitative studies examining parent-reported barriers and facilitators to accessing and participating in support services. A systematic search identified 18 articles that met inclusion criteria. Resulting thematic analysis located three themes: (a) support service accessibility, (b) diversity of support services, and (c) community. Parents reported that financial pressures, geographic location, and service flexibility influenced their ability to obtain support services. Implications for service delivery and areas for future research are discussed. Lay abstract Families from underrepresented ethnic or racial groups and those with limited financial resources could experience more difficulty in accessing support services for their autistic child due to certain types of barriers. We searched academic journals, websites, and other sources for studies which looked at what barriers might be present for such families and what might help families access support services for their autistic child. The search found 18 studies. Results from each study were examined and coded into themes. Parents reported that accessibility, diversity of support services, and stigma influenced their experiences with support services. We discuss what these findings might mean for future research and for service delivery.

KW  - QUESTIONS
AB  - With the advent of Complex dynamic systems theory (CDST) in the field of second language question (SLA), the need for suitable CDST compatible methods for the investigation of temporal change in L2 affective variables has been felt more than before. One of the innovative methods for this purpose is latent growth curve modeling (LGCM), which has recently drawn the attention of SLA scholars. However, the application of this method is still a burgeoning demand in SLA. In response to this demand, the present study provides a review of the conceptualization, significance, and technical features of the implementation of LGCM. In doing so, this review suggests a number of practices via which LGCM has been introduced in SLA. Additionally, some practical implications are provided for SLA researchers to enhance their literacy of LGCM. Finally, future research suggestions for the progress of the use of this method in SLA are discussed.

AB  - To form truthful beliefs, individuals must expose themselves to varied viewpoints. And yet, people routinely avoid information that contradicts their prior beliefs-a tendency termed "se-lective exposure." Why? Prior research theorizes that exposure to opposing views triggers negative emotions; in turn, people avoid doing so. Here, we argue that understanding why in-dividuals find simple exposure to opposing perspectives aversive is an important and largely unanswered psychological question. We review three streams of research that offer relevant theories: self-threat borne of cognitive dissonance; naive realism (i.e., the illusion of personal objectivity); and reluctance to expend cognitive effort. While extant empirical research offers the strongest evidence for predictions from naive realism, more systematic research is needed to recon-cile these perspectives.

AB  - Objectives Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood, which may be related to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Our study aims to explore the association between ACEs and subsequent ADHD, and analyze the potential moderators. Methods Literature search was conducted by a combined computer-assisted and manual method. Studies were included if they had reported the association between ACEs and subsequent ADHD. Overall estimates of odds ratios (ORs) were obtained using random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regressions and further stratified analyses were conducted to examine potential moderator variables. Results Totals of 70 studies involving nearly 4 million participants from among 6,452 unique articles were included. In the primary analyses, ACEs were found to be associated with subsequent ADHD (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.54-1.83), and the negative effects of different forms of ACEs for ADHD were nonequivalent. Such as lived in the stepfamily, been adopted or fostered, and experienced sexual abuse were more deleterious than others. It was found that individuals who had experienced multiple ACEs or who are female were more vulnerable to ADHD. Conclusions The findings provide critical evidence for understanding the association between ACEs and ADHD. ACEs could increase the susceptibility of ADHD, especially for individuals who ever experienced multiple ACEs and females.

AB  - Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression are common, and there is preliminary evidence of substantial comorbidity. The extent of the association in the general population, however, has not yet been estimated meta-analytically. Therefore we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis (registered in PROSPERO: CRD42020164791). Until May 2020, Medline (via PubMed), PsycINFO, and Embase databases were systematically searched for studies on the association of hyperthyroidism and clinical depression, without language or date restrictions. Two reviewers independently selected epidemiological studies providing laboratory or ICD-based diagnoses of hyperthyroidism and diagnoses of depression according to operationalized criteria (e.g. DSM) or to cut-offs in established rating scales. All data, including study quality based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, were independently extracted by two authors. Odds ratios for the association of clinical depression and hyperthyroidism were calculated in a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis. Out of 3372 papers screened we selected 15 studies on 239 608 subjects, with 61% women and a mean age of 50. Relative to euthyroid individuals, patients with hyperthyroidism had a higher chance of being diagnosed with clinical depression: OR 1.67 ([95% CI: 1.49; 1.87], I-2: 6%; prediction interval: 1.40 to 1.99), a result supported in a number of sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The OR was slightly less pronounced for subclinical as opposed to overt hyperthyroidism (1.36 [1.06; 1.74] vs. 1.70 [1.49; 1.93]). This comorbidity calls for clinical awareness and its reasons need investigation and may include neurobiological mechanisms, common genetic vulnerability and a generally heightened risk for clinical depression in patients with chronic somatic disorders.

AB  - Background: Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity that involves pregnancy-related stressors on the maternal cardiovascular and metabolic systems. As nutrition is important to support optimal development of the placenta and for the developing fetus, maternal diets may play a role in preventing pre-eclampsia. The purpose of this scoping review is to map the maternal nutritional deficiencies and imbalances associated with pre-eclampsia incidence and discuss evidence consistency and linkages with current understandings of the etiology of pre-eclampsia.
   Methods: A narrative scoping review was conducted to provide a descriptive account of available research, summarize research findings and identify gaps in the evidence base. Relevant observational studies and reviews of observational studies were identified in an iterative two-stage process first involving electronic database searches then more sensitive searches as familiarity with the literature increased. Results were considered in terms of their consistency of evidence, effect sizes and biological plausibility.
   Results: The review found evidence for associations between nutritional inadequacies and a greater risk of pre-eclampsia. These associations were most likely mediated through oxidative stress, inflammation, maternal endothelial dysfunction and blood pressure in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Maternal nutritional risk factors for pre-eclampsia incidence with the strongest consistency, effect and biological plausibility include vitamin C and its potential relationship with iron status, vitamin D (both on its own and combined with calcium and magnesium), and healthy dietary patterns featuring high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, seafood and monounsaturated vegetable oils. Foods high in added sugar, such as sugary drinks, were associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia incidence.
   Conclusion: A growing body of literature highlights the involvement of maternal dietary factors in the development of pre-eclampsia. Our review findings support the need for further investigation into potential interactions between dietary factors and consideration of nutritional homeostasis and healthy dietary patterns. Further research is recommended to explore gestational age, potential non-linear relationships, dietary diversity and social, cultural contexts of food and meals.
   Plain language summary: Pre-eclampsia is a condition of high blood pressure during the second half of pregnancy with signs of damage to another organ system, often the liver and kidneys. It is a serious and potentially deadly disease and is the second top cause of deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth globally. Though the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is unclear, researchers have discovered that pre-eclampsia develops through abnormal development of the placenta, which is the interface between the growing baby and the mother in the womb. The placenta helps to transfer nutrients, oxygen and waste between the mother and fetus. Nutrition has important roles to play in the development of the placenta and certain vitamins and minerals have clinical properties that may help prevent pre-eclampsia. We conducted a review to summarize observational studies on maternal nutritional risk factors associated with the development of pre-eclampsia. Promising maternal dietary factors that fit with current understandings of how pre-eclampsia develops include vitamin C and its potential relationship with iron, calcium and vitamin D. Healthy dietary patterns with high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and seafood and monounsaturated vegetable oils are likely beneficial. Foods high in added sugar, such as sugary drinks, may be linked to higher rates of developing pre-eclampsia. Instead of focusing on single nutrient deficiencies, our findings support a broader approach to explore interrelationships between dietary factors and balanced healthy dietary intake for the prevention of pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Criminals targeting and exploiting older adults in online environments are of great concern. This study systematically retrieved and analyzed articles on the psychological characteristics of older adult victims of online fraud. First, we found that there was no evidence that older adults were more prevalent than other individuals of other ages among online fraud victims, and current researchers have focused more on why older adults are easy targets for fraud (susceptibility to being cheated). Second, research on psychological factors of older adults' susceptibility to online fraud has mainly focused on cognitive function, trust traits, and other personality traits, such as social loneliness, the Big Five personality traits, and self-control. Among them, most researchers claim that the cyber-cheating of older adults may be due to a decline in their cognitive function. However, there has not been a consensus on how cognitive function and physical and mental conditions affect older people who are cheated. Third, techniques (i.e., methods and techniques used by fraudsters) and experience (i.e., familiarity with internet technology or fraud) may be related to the susceptibility of older adults to fraud, and these studies have also not yet generated a consensus supported by reliable data. Based on the above research uncertainties, we propose that fraud prevention and control strategies for older adults should be applied with caution.

AB  - Neurofeedback (NF) aims to alter neural activity by enhancing self-regulation skills. Over the past decade NF has received considerable attention as a potential intervention option for many somatic and mental conditions and ADHD in particular. However, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated insufficient superiority of NF compared to treatment as usual and sham conditions. It has been argued that the reason for limited NF effects may be attributable to participants' challenges to self-regulate the targeted neural activity. Still, there is support of NF efficacy when only considering so-called "standard protocols, " such as Slow Cortical Potential NF training (SCP-NF). This PROSPERO registered systematic review following PRISMA criteria searched literature databases for studies applying SCP-NF protocols. Our review focus concerned the operationalization of self-regulatory success, and protocol-details that could influence the evaluation of self-regulation. Such details included; electrode placement, number of trials, length per trial, proportions of training modalities, handling of artifacts and skill-transfer into daily-life. We identified a total of 63 eligible reports published in the year 2000 or later. SCP-NF protocol-details varied considerably on most variables, except for electrode placement. However, due to the increased availability of commercial systems, there was a trend to more uniform protocol-details. Although, token-systems are popular in SCP-NF for ADHD, only half reported a performance-based component. Also, transfer exercises have become a staple part of SCP-NF. Furthermore, multiple operationalizations of regulatory success were identified, limiting comparability between studies, and perhaps usefulness of so-called transfer-exercises, which purpose is to facilitate the transfer of the self-regulatory skills into every-day life. While studies utilizing SCP as Brain-Computer-Interface mainly focused on the acquisition of successful self-regulation, clinically oriented studies often neglected this. Congruently, rates of successful regulators in clinical studies were mostly low (< 50%). The relation between SCP self-regulation and behavior, and how symptoms in different disorders are affected, is complex and not fully understood. Future studies need to report self-regulation based on standardized measures, in order to facilitate both comparability and understanding of the effects on symptoms. When applied as treatment, future SCP-NF studies also need to put greater emphasis on the acquisition of self-regulation (before evaluating symptom outcomes).

AB  - Second messenger systems, like the cyclic nucleotide, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, phosphoinositide, and arachidonic acid cascades, are involved in bipolar disorder (BD). We investigated their role on the development of novel therapeutic drugs using second messenger mechanisms. PubMed search and narrative review. We used all relevant keywords for each second messenger cascade combining it with BD and related terms and combined all with novel/innovative treatments/drugs. Our search produced 31 papers most were reviews, and focussed on the PI3K/AKT-GSK-3 beta/Nrf2-NF-kappa B pathways. Only two human randomized clinical trials were identified, of ebselen, an antioxidant, and celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, both with poor unsatisfactory results. Despite the fact that all second messenger systems are involved in the pathophysiology of BD, there are few experiments with novel drugs using these mechanisms. These mechanisms are a neglected and potentially major opportunity to transform the treatment of bipolar illness.

AB  - Background and aims: Compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD) which includes problematic pornography use (PPU) is a clinically relevant syndrome that has been included in the ICD-11 as impulse control disorder. The number of studies on treatments in CSBD and PPU increased in the last years. The current preregistered systematic review aimed for identifying treatment studies on CSBD and PPU as well as treatment effects on symptom severity and behavior enactment. Methods: The study was preregistered at Prospero International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021252329). The literature search done in February 2022 at PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycInfo, included original research published in peer-reviewed journals between 2000 to end 2021. The risk of bias was assessed with the CONSORT criteria. A quantitative synthesis based on effect sizes was done. Results: Overall 24 studies were identified. Four of these studies were randomized controlled trials. Treatment approaches included settings with cognitive behavior therapy components, psychotherapy methods, and psychopharmacological therapy. Receiving treatment seems to improve symptoms of CSBD and PPU. Especially, evidence for the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy is present. Discussion and conclusions: There is first evidence for the effectiveness of treatment approaches such as cognitive behavior therapy. However, strong conclusions on the specificity of treatments should be drawn with caution. More rigorous and systematic methodological approaches are needed for future studies. Results may be informative for future research and the development of specific treatment programs for CSBD and PPU.

AB  - Each year, 275 million children worldwide are exposed to domestic violence (DV) and suffer negative mental and physical health consequences; however, only a small proportion receive assistance. Pediatricians and child psychiatrists can play a central role in identifying threatened children. We reviewed experiences of DV screening in pediatric and child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to understand its feasibility and provide clues for its implementation. We performed bibliographic research using the Sapienza Library System, PubMed, and the following databases: MEDLINE, American Psychological Association PsycArticles, American Psychological Association PsycInfo, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. We considered a 20-year interval when selecting the articles and we included studies published in English between January 2000 and March 2021. A total of 23 out of 2335 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found that the prevalence of disclosed DV ranged from 4.2% to 48%, with most prevalence estimates between 10% and 20%. Disclosure increases with a detection plan, which is mostly welcomed by mothers (70-80% acceptance rates). Written tools were used in 55% of studies, oral interviews in 40%, and computer instruments in 20%. Mixed forms were used in three studies (15%). The most used and effective tool appeared to be the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) (30% of studies). For young children, parental reports are advisable and written instruments are the first preference; interviews can be conducted with older children. Our research pointed out that the current literature does not provide practical clinical clues on facilitating the disclosure in pediatric clinics and CAMHS. Further studies are needed on the inpatient population and in the field of children psychiatry.

AB  - Background and aims: The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the available literature on the relationship between gaming motivations and gaming disorder symptoms. Specifically, to (1) explore what gaming motivation questionnaires and classifications are used in studies on gaming disorder symptoms and (2) investigate the relationship between motivational factors and symptoms of gaming disorder. Method: An electronic database search was conducted via EBSCO (MEDLINE and PsycINFO) and the Web of Science Core Collection. All studies using validated measurements on gaming disorder symptoms and gaming motivations and available correlation co-efficients of the relationship between gaming disorder and gaming motivations were included. The meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Results: In total, 49 studies (k = 58 in-dependent sub-samples), including 51,440 participants, out of which 46 studies (k = 55 sub-samples, n = 49,192 participants) provided data for the meta-analysis. The synthesis identified fourteen different gaming motivation instruments, seven unique motivation models, and 26 motivational factors. The meta-analysis showed statistically significant associations between gaming disorder symptoms and 23 out of 26 motivational factors, with the majority of the pooled mean effect sizes ranging from small to moderate. Moreover, large heterogeneity was observed, and the calculated prediction intervals indicated substantial variation in effects across populations and settings. Motivations related to emotional escape were robustly associated with gaming disorder symptoms. Discussion and conclusions: The present meta-analysis reinforces the importance of motivational factors in understanding prob-lematic gaming behavior. The analysis showed significant heterogeneity in most outcomes, warranting further investigation. Registration detail: PROSPERO (CRD42020220050).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Various toxic substances can be generated from incinerators, exposing nearby residents, and epidemiological studies have shown wide variations in risk estimates for cancer risk in populations living close to incinerators.METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a liter-ature search and systematic review were conducted to identify studies conducted on general populations exposed to environ-mental incinerator emissions and cancer outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed according to the cancer types for which 2 or more studies were reported. Subgroup analysis was done for sex, the exposure estimation method, the study period, and the type of outcome.RESULTS: Eleven studies were found for the qualitative review and meta-analysis. Seven studies had a case-control design, and 4 had a cohort design. The pooled effect size was not significant for breast, colorectal, liver, lung, lymphohematopoietic, stom-ach, bladder, central nervous system, and laryngeal cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, sarcoma, leukemia, and all cancers. In the subgroup analysis, the pooled effect size of laryngeal cancer in females was 1.82 (95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 3.01), al-though only 2 studies were identified.CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis did not provide evidence of an increased risk for any cancer among populations living near waste incinerators, except for laryngeal cancer in females. However, since relatively few studies were reviewed and some cancer types showed significant increases in individual studies, this evidence needs to be updated regularly.

AB  - Background Periodontal disease represents a global public health concern, with a disproportionate burden being borne by vulnerable populations. One such group is people with severe mental illness (SMI), and this study examined whether periodontal health is poorer in people with SMI than the general population. Methods We conducted a systematic search for studies published before March 2021 on the periodontal health of people with SMI using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chongqing VIP. Outcomes were periodontitis, periodontal disease, and shallow and deep periodontal pockets. Results were compared with the general population. Results Seventeen studies had sufficient data for a random-effects meta-analysis, consisting of 4404 psychiatric patients and 95,411 controls. SMI was associated with an increased prevalence of periodontitis (odds ratio = 1.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-3.35) compared with the general population. People with SMI had 4.28 the odds of having periodontal disease compared with controls (95% CI = 2.54-7.21). They also had 3.65 the odds of shallow pockets (95% CI = 1.80-7.42) and 2.76 the odds of deep pockets (95% CI = 1.10-6.93). Conclusions Our findings highlight the increased prevalence and severity of periodontal disease in people with SMI. Oral health is often considered the gateway to overall health and should be a public health priority for this population.

TI  - Social causes and outcomes of acute transient psychotic disorder: A review of recent evidence
KW  - Acute and transient psychosis

KW  - social outcomes
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - ONSET
KW  - STABILITY
AB  - Background: Reports of increasing presentations of new cases of acute psychosis both locally, nationally and internationally during the COVID-19 pandemic, warranted further investigation. International case reports almost exclusively reported only clinical outcome (e.g. remission of psychotic symptoms), and fail to report on social precipitants or social outcomes. This is a common omission when investigating new psychosis cases such as acute and transient psychotic disorder (ATPD). In order to assess social impacts and outcomes, we conducted a rapid review of recent evidence. Aims: To conduct a rapid review of the recent evidence of social outcomes on new cases of psychosis emerging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Four databases (Medline, Embase, Psychinfo and Cochrane COVID-19) were searched for ATPD, psychosis and social outcomes in adults aged 18+. Duplicates were removed. There were no language limitations. Results: There were 24 papers consisting of 18 original data research papers and 6 reviews. Additionally, 33 papers/letters, reporting on 60 individual cases of psychosis emerging during the COVID-19 pandemic. These two sets of papers were reviewed separately. Many original data research papers and reviews were sub optimal in their quality, with 44% online surveys, with the remainder being routinely collected data. Conclusion: There is a consensus that clinical outcomes of ATPD and other brief psychotic disorders (BPD) are good in the short term. The focus only on symptomatic clinical presentation and outcomes, leaves a gap in our understanding regarding social stressors and longer term social outcomes. ATPD and BPD often may not come to the attention of Early Intervention in Psychosis services, and if they do, are discharged following symptomatic remission. Without an understanding of the social stress factors and social outcomes, opportunities may be missed to prevent increased social disability and future relapse with these presentations.

AB  - Background: Falls among psychiatric inpatients are common and have significant health consequences.The purpose of this study is to systematically review the published research on risk factors and consequences.
   Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant studies. A total of 18 studies were included in this systematic review. The heterogeneity and low quality of the reviewed studies limit the generalizability of the results.
   Results: Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors are reported. Some of these factors are unique to psychiatric inpatients such as acute mental state, psychotic symptoms, and bipolar disorder leading to cognitive distortions and risk-taking; psychotropic medications inducing side effects like sedation and orthostatic hypotension; while others are similar to those found among general medical inpatients.
   Conclusion: Given the clinical importance of a fall and its implication on residential treatment, there is a need for targeted fall prevention programs. In order to further identify and quantify these risks and consequences, prospective research and additional study designs, describing and recording risk factors in a systematic and standardized way with the underlying etiological processes in mind, are needed.

AB  - People bereaved by suicide are affected psychologically and physically and may be at greater risk of taking their own lives. Whilst researchers have explored the impact of suicide on family members and friends, the area of colleague suicide has been neglected and postvention guidance for supporting surviving colleagues is often poorly developed. This critical integrative review explored the impact of colleague suicide on surviving co-workers and reviewed postvention guidance for workplaces. Systematic searches found 17 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Articles were appraised for quality and extracted data were analysed using a thematic network method. Article quality was moderate. Two global themes were developed: impact of a colleague suicide comprised themes of 'suicide loss in the workplace'; 'professional identities and workplace roles'; 'perceptions of professional uniqueness'; and 'professional abandonment and silencing'. Postvention following a colleague suicide comprised 'individualised responses'; 'the dual function of stigma'; and 'complex pressure on managers'. A unifying global network 'after a colleague suicide' describes the relationships between all themes. A series of disconnects between existing postvention guidance and the needs of impacted workers are discussed. This review demonstrates the need for robust, systemic postvention for colleagues impacted by the complex issue of colleague suicide.

AB  - The primary objective of this review was to synthesize studies assessing the relationships between high temperatures and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related hospital encounters (i.e., emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations) in urban Canada and other comparable populations, and to identify areas for future research. Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus were searched between 6 April and 11 April 2020, and on 21 March 2021, to identify articles examining the relationship between high temperatures and CVD-related hospital encounters. Studies involving patients with pre-existing CVD were also included. English language studies from North America and Europe were included. Twenty-two articles were included in the review. Studies reported an inconsistent association between high temperatures and ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure, dysrhythmia, and some cerebrovascular-related hospital encounters. There was consistent evidence that high temperatures may be associated with increased ED visits and hospitalizations related to total CVD, hyper/hypotension, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and ischemic stroke. Age, sex, and gender appear to modify high temperature-CVD morbidity relationships. Two studies examined the influence of pre-existing CVD on the relationship between high temperatures and morbidity. Pre-existing heart failure, AMI, and total CVD did not appear to affect the relationship, while evidence was inconsistent for pre-existing hypertension. There is inconsistent evidence that high temperatures are associated with CVD-related hospital encounters. Continued research on this topic is needed, particularly in the Canadian context and with a focus on individuals with pre-existing CVD.

KW  - DISTRESS
AB  - Mental illness among medical students in particular, and higher education students in general, is very high. Many measures have been suggested in order to improve the situation, including training members of faculty and staff. However, to the best of our knowledge there seem to be no studies proposing training programmes for medical schools' faculty and staff in response to recognising students' psychological difficulties and symptoms in order to provide the relevant support. Also, in cases where such training for supporting medical students with psychological symptomatology exist, the efficacy of the approach employed is not known. By employing a careful literature search according to published guidelines for narrative literature reviews, this study aimed to fill in this identified gap in the literature. From the literature search, 14 articles were included in this review and the results show that no training tailored for faculty and staff in medical schools was identified. However, articles that related to higher education were included because they were useful in providing insights for medicine, and show the following: (a) faculty and staff acknowledged the importance of mental illness among students, (b) many of them discussed with their students psychological symptoms and provided support, (c) they tended to feel unprepared for recognising students' psychological symptoms successfully and providing support, (d) they embraced the idea of being trained, and (e) any training seemed to be helpful for members of faculty and staff. From the results of this narrative review, we propose the CReATE circular pathway to ensure a sustainable process of training and support for students' development.

KW  - CHALLENGES
AB  - Objective To compare and summarize the literature regarding infodemics and health misinformation, and to identify challenges and opportunities for addressing the issues of infodemics.
   Methods We searched MEDLINE (R), Embase (R), Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Scopus and Epistemonikos on 6 May 2022 for systematic reviews analysing infodemics, misinformation, disinformation and fake news related to health. We grouped studies based on similarity and retrieved evidence on challenges and opportunities. We used the AMSTAR 2 approach to assess the reviews' methodological quality. To evaluate the quality of the evidence, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines.
   Findings Our search identified 31 systematic reviews, of which 17 were published. The proportion of health-related misinformation on social media ranged from 0.2% to 28.8%. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram are critical in disseminating the rapid and far-reaching information. The most negative consequences of health misinformation are the increase of misleading or incorrect interpretations of available evidence, impact on mental health, misallocation of health resources and an increase in vaccination hesitancy. The increase of unreliable health information delays care provision and increases the occurrence of hateful and divisive rhetoric. Social media could also be a useful tool to combat misinformation during crises. Included reviews highlight the poor quality of published studies during health crises.
   Conclusion Available evidence suggests that infodemics during health emergencies have an adverse effect on society. Multisectoral actions to counteract infodemics and health misinformation are needed, including developing legal policies, creating and promoting awareness campaigns, improving health-related content in mass media and increasing people's digital and health literacy.

AB  - Introduction: Bereavement and grief are social phenomena influenced by a multitude of cultural factors. Prior studies of bereavement adjustment have primarily focused on bereaved survivors who identify racially as white; knowledge of the experience of grief and bereavement among racial/ethnic and other minority groups, particularly among Latino/a groups, in the United States is limited.Objective: The purpose of this review is to synthesize the literature documenting the bereavement experiences of the Latino/a community, evaluate the strength of the current evidence, and provide recommendations to guide future research.Method: A narrative review of research on grief and bereavement in the Latino/a community published between 1990 and 2021. Two authors used a thematic, deductive approach to categorize emergent prevalent themes from the literature and used The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) and The Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine-Evidence Quality Rating Scale (OCEBM) approaches to evaluate the strength of the qualitative and quantitative reports reviewed.Results: Searches revealed 26 reports that were categorized into six themes: cultural values, mourning rituals, immigration, spirituality, disparities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects of COVID-19 on Latino/a communities. Our evaluation concludes that the evidence in this area is weak, with limited methodologically rigorous research examining the influence of culture on bereavement among Latino/a groups.Conclusion: Research is needed to identify Latino/a groups' mental health, cultural, social, and family needs and how fulfillment of mourning rituals and other cultural factors may promote or impede bereavement adjustment. Investigation into factors that may protect bereaved survivors against adverse mental health outcomes is also needed. A better understanding of Latino/a grief and bereavement is a step toward the development of culturally competent interventions designed to promote the mental health and psychosocial adjustment of Latino/a mourners.

AB  - As the prevalence rates of autism and neurodegenerative dementia are rising, it has become a public health priority un-derstanding the factors that might contribute to the co-occurrence of the two conditions. To date, the literature about the intersection between autism and neurodegenerative dementia is still limited although growing. In this perspective article, we summarized the evidence on this topic, describing the behavioral features shared by autism and neurodegenerative dementia, including social communication difficulties, cognitive alterations, and emotional problems. In addition, we reviewed the results from recent studies on the prevalence of dementia in autistic older individuals. Last, we focused on possible shared mechanisms and pathological underpinnings for each condition. We highlighted the importance of understanding the strengths and the needs of autistic subjects who present comorbid dementia, in order to develop long term care resources and arrange appropriate intervention programs. Furthermore, we argued that the systematic study of potentially common etiopathological mechanisms could increase our knowledge about the pathological basis of autism and neurodegenerative dementia, to possibly develop targeted interventions.

AB  - Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients experience a variety of disease caused disabilities that makes them more vulnerable to the effects of disasters. This study aimed to review all existed studies about disasters and related disaster management planning about MS patients. Methods: The PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, ProQuest, science direct , and grey liter-ature databases were searched up to the mid of 2021. All obtained titles were assessed by the inclusion criteria. Abstracts of the relevant titles were reviewed and eligible articles/documents were included for full text review and data abstraction. Results: From 24616 Articles/documents, finally 15 documents (13 articles, and 2 books) were selected. In 8 articles (53%) specifically, focused on MS patients and, in the rest focused on them as a member of people with disabilities. Most studies (10, 71.4%), emphasized on the disaster induced stress effect on MS patients. In two books/book sections, the disaster preparedness plan for all types of disabilities was presented in general, and MS patients were mentioned as a member of the group of patients with disabilities. Conclusion: Despite the importance of planning in response to disasters to address specific problems of MS patients, there is a lack of proper planning. This is very important and there is an urgent need to develop appro-priate planning protocols for addressing the special conditions of MS patients in response to disasters.

AB  - (1) Introduction: Tourette syndrome (TS) and chronic tic disorder (CTD) are common neurodevelopmental/-psychiatric disorders. The aetiological factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of TS/CTD are still poorly understood. The possible risk factors for TS/CTD are considered to be a combination of genetic, immunological, psychological and environmental factors. A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to assess the association between aetiological factors and TS/CTD. (2) Methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang data, and CNKI, were searched to identify the etiological factors of children and adolescents (<= 18 years) with TS/CTD based on a case-control study. Quality assessments were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). (3) Results: According to sample sizes and NOS values, recent evidence may support that genetic factors (BTBD9 and AADAC), immunological factors (streptococcus and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections), environmental factors (conflict, history of perinatal diseases, and family history of neurological and psychiatric diseases and recurrent respiratory infections) and psychological factors (major life events) are associated with the pathogenesis of TS/CTD. (4) Conclusions: Some risk factors in different categories may be the etiological factors of TS/CTD, but there is a lack of studies on the interaction among the factors, which may require more attention in the future.

AB  - Background: First responders play a vital role in attending to people in suicidal crisis and influencing their care. Aims: To examine existing care pathways and models of care that could be used for people in a suicidal crisis who have come to the attention of first responders. Methods: A scoping review of academic and grey literature published between 2009 and 2019 was conducted, supplemented by consultation with experts, service providers and people with lived experience. Results: The search identified 703 studies. Twenty-three peer reviewed and grey literature articles, as well as one personal communication, were considered eligible for inclusion. Six models, covering 22 programs, were identified. No studies were identified that described care pathways, per se. Co-responder and safe haven models were associated with reduced hospital use and police detentions. Aftercare models were associated with improved well-being and reduction in symptoms. Co-responder, safe haven, and aftercare models were all rated positively by service users. No studies measured the impact on longer term suicidality. Limitations: Inclusion criteria were broad resulting in heterogeneity of studies and designs, limiting comparisons. Few studies employed standardised measurement protocols, reducing the ability to draw sound conclusions. Conclusion: Several novel programs have the potential to support individuals in crisis who encounter first responders.

AB  - With the increase in users of social media websites such as IMDb, a movie website, and the rise of publicly available data, opinion mining is more accessible than ever. In the research field of language understanding, categorization of movie reviews can be challenging because human language is complex, leading to scenarios where connotation words exist. Connotation words have a different meaning than their literal meanings. While representing a word, the context in which the word is used changes the semantics of words. In this research work, categorizing movie reviews with good F-Measure scores has been investigated with Word2Vec and three different aspects of proposed features have been inspected. First, psychological features are extracted from reviews positive emotion, negative emotion, anger, sadness, clout (confidence level) and dictionary words. Second, readablility features are extracted; the Automated Readability Index (ARI), the Coleman Liau Index (CLI) and Word Count (WC) are calculated to measure the review's understandability score and their impact on review classification performance is measured. Lastly, linguistic features are also extracted from reviews adjectives and adverbs. The Word2Vec model is trained on collecting 50,000 reviews related to movies. A self-trained Word2Vec model is used for the contextualized embedding of words into vectors with 50, 100, 150 and 300 dimensions.The pretrained Word2Vec model converts words into vectors with 150 and 300 dimensions. Traditional and advanced machine-learning (ML) algorithms are applied and evaluated according to performance measures: accuracy, precision, recall and F-Measure. The results indicate Support Vector Machine (SVM) using self-trained Word2Vec achieved 86% F-Measure and using psychological, linguistic and readability features with concatenation of Word2Vec features SVM achieved 87.93% F-Measure.

AB  - Evidence suggests that individuals with schizophrenia display a trait-state disjunction in affective experience characterized by severe trait-level disturbances yet relatively intact state-level experiences, but the extent to which trait-state disjunction is found in individuals at high risk (HR) for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders is unclear. Therefore, this meta-analysis provides an integrative evaluation of HR individuals' self-reported affective experiences across trait and state to identify which disturbances are most pronounced and for whom-a crucial objective for understanding affective vulnerability factors for schizophrenia. A literature search yielded 181 studies, totaling 995 effect sizes across 9,672 HR and 15,386 controls. Notably, a large amount of heterogeneity among effect sizes was observed. Multivariate models with robust variance estimation showed that HR (vs. control) participants had lower trait positive affect (PA) and higher trait negative affect (NA), with state-level disturbances being weaker than trait-level disturbances. Heightened NA generalized across methods used for eliciting and assessing affective experiences, whereas PA deficits were more variable and most severe for social processes. Moreover, the severity of PA and NA disturbances was greater for participants with higher levels of schizophrenia-spectrum risk. Overall, findings provide support for the trait-state disjunction in HR conditions along the schizophrenia spectrum, although the observed heterogeneity highlights the uncertainty of our findings and urges continued investigation in further explicating this heterogeneity. We outline an explanatory model for these findings and discuss important implications to facilitate future research on the role affective experience disturbances may play in the developmental pathway for schizophrenia.Public Significance StatementThis systematic review and meta-analysis reveal that individuals at high risk for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders self-report robustly heightened negative affect and nuanced positive affect deficits across trait and state. Trait-level disturbances were more pronounced compared to state-level disturbances, thereby demonstrating a trait-state disjunction in high-risk individuals similar to that of individuals with schizophrenia. Therefore, disturbances in affective experience may be considered a vulnerability factor for schizophrenia.

AB  - Background and aims: Asian countries are deemed to be high prevalence areas for gaming disorder (GD). This meta-analysis is the first to synthesize the overall prevalence of GD in East Asia and investigate characteristics that influence prevalence estimates. Methods: Systematic and independent searches were conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library since their inception to January 27, 2021. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality scale was used for quality assessment. A random effect model was used to calculate the overall GD prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: In total, 22 articles (26 studies) comprising 51,525 par-ticipants were included in this meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of GD in East Asia was 12%, 95% CI (10%-15%); this figure was adjusted to 6%, 95% CI (3%-9%) for a representative sample. Higher prevalence was observed in males than in females (16% vs. 8%, respectively, P < 0.05). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that studies among gamers or those without random sampling reported significantly higher prevalence rates. There were no significant differences between countries/regions, sample size, quality score, proportion of males, and scale used. Discussion and conclusions: The prevalence of GD in East Asia is higher than that in other world regions. Future studies should extend such epidemiological research to other regions to calculate the accurate prevalence of GD to benefit the local identification, prevention, policy formulation, and treatment efforts. Consid-ering its negative effects, effective preventive and treatment measures for GD in East Asia need greater attention.

AB  - The role of the school in promoting he-alth and preventing diseases among children and adolescents has long been recognized. Among the characteristics of schools with effects on health, child development, learning and school perfor-mance, the international literature has highligh-ted the school climate. However, in Brazil, rela-tively little research has been done in this field to date. In view of this scenario, this study aimed to describe the characteristics of Brazilian research into the school climate, paying special attention to the methods of measurement, to themes related to it and to research on the relationship between school climate and health in Brazil. To this end, we conducted a scope review with Brazilian theses and dissertations since 1987. The results showed the predominance of qualitative studies, with data from few schools, a wide variety of strate-gies and instruments used to measure the climate, with emphasis on the use of questionnaires, scales and interviews. There was also a relatively small participation of the health field, especially with regard to student health.

AB  - Background: Trauma survivors are at a high risk of developing mental health problems. Hence, mental help in the form of emergency psychology has to be availed in the aftermath of a traumatizing event. When studied in-depth, emergency psychology comprises protocols, strategies, and techniques that establish it as an interventional activity.Objective: The main of this review is to analyze how emergency psychology services are provided to people, to verify to what extent these interventions are homogeneous in the delivery methods and consequently, facilitate the creation of relevant measures. Consequently, the general view of emergency psychology is reviewed and analyzed to identify the protocols, guidelines, and strategies used.Methods: A search was done on the ScienceDirect, APA PsycINFO, Emerald, and Scopus databases for articles published from 1st January 2017 to 1st April 2022. The reference lists of the identified studies were also screened.Results: After the non-duplicate articles were removed and after filtering the articles according to inclusion criteria, 20 articles were included for the thematic analysis: nine research articles, 10 case study reports, and one randomized controlled trial (RCT). During the analysis, different aspects of emergency psychology were cate-gorized: Responders, Crisis Management and Structure, and types of psychological interventions. This catego-rization led to the identification of protocols, guidelines, and strategies that can be placed in a sequence to give a general direction of how an emergency psychology intervention is supposed to be carried out.Conclusions: The adopted protocols, guidelines and strategies may vary from one disaster management to another but the main goal will always remain the same.

AB  - Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is characterized by a recurrent pattern of angry/irritable emotional lability, argumentative/defiant behavior, and vindictiveness. Previous studies indicated that ODD typically might originate within a maladaptive family environment, or was at least maintained within such an environment. As such, the present review summarized pertinent research from the last 20 years that focused on the pathways connecting family risk factors to the development of child ODD symptoms. A systematic search of electronic databases was completed in August 2020, resulting in the inclusion of 62 studies in the review. The review established a multi-level framework to describe the mechanisms underlying the pathway from familial factors to ODD psychopathological symptoms: (a) the system level that is affected by the family's socioeconomic status and family dysfunction; (b) the dyadic level that is affected by conflict within the marital dyad and parent-child interactions; and (c) the individual level that is affected by parent and child factors. Additionally, from the perspective of family systems theory, we pay special attention to the interactions among and between the various levels of the pathway (moderation and mediation) that might be associated with the occurrence and severity of ODD symptoms. Considering future prevention and intervention efforts, this three-level model emphasizes the necessity of focusing on familial risk factors at multiple levels and the mechanisms underlying the proposed pathways.

AB  - Numerous factors affect reproduction, including stress, diet, obesity, the use of stimulants, or exposure to toxins, along with heavy elements (lead, silver, cadmium, uranium, vanadium, mercury, arsenic). Metals, like other xenotoxins, can cause infertility through, e.g., impairment of endocrine function and gametogenesis or excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The advancement of nanotechnology has created another hazard to human safety through exposure to metals in the form of nanomaterials (NMs). Nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit a specific ability to penetrate cell membranes and biological barriers in the human body. These ultra-fine particles (<100 nm) can enter the human body through the respiratory tract, food, skin, injection, or implantation. Once absorbed, NPs are transported to various organs through the blood or lymph. Absorbed NPs, thanks to ultrahigh reactivity compared to bulk materials in microscale size, disrupt the homeostasis of the body as a result of interaction with biological molecules such as DNA, lipids, and proteins; interfering with the functioning of cells, organs, and physiological systems; and leading to severe pathological dysfunctions. Over the past decades, much research has been performed on the reproductive effects of essential trace elements. The research hypothesis that disturbances in the metabolism of trace elements are one of the many causes of infertility has been unquestionably confirmed. This review examines the complex reproductive risks for men regarding the exposure to potentially harmless xenobiotics based on a series of 298 articles over the past 30 years. The research was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases searching for papers devoted to in vivo and in vitro studies related to the influence of essential elements (iron, selenium, manganese, cobalt, zinc, copper, and molybdenum) and widely used metallic NPs on male reproduction potential.

AB  - Lewy body disorders are characterized by oxidative damage to DNA and inclusions rich in aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein. Among other roles, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) repairs oxidative DNA damage, and APE1 polymorphisms have been linked to cases of Lewy body disorders. However, the link between APE1 and alpha-synuclein is unexplored. We report that knockdown or inhibition of APE1 amplified inclusion formation in primary hippocampal cultures challenged with preformed alpha-synuclein fibrils. Fibril infusions into the mouse olfactory bulb/anterior olfactory nucleus (OB/AON) elicited a modest decrease in APE1 expression in the brains of male mice but an increase in females. Similarly, men with Lewy body disorders displayed lower APE1 expression in the OB and amygdala compared to women. Preformed fibril infusions of the mouse OB/AON induced more robust base excision repair of DNA lesions in females than males. No fibril-mediated loss of APE1 expression was observed in male mice when the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine was added to their diet. These findings reveal a potential sex-biased link between alpha-synucleinopathy and APE1 in mice and humans. Further studies are warranted to determine how this multifunctional protein modifies alpha-synuclein inclusions and, conversely, how alpha-synucleinopathy and biological sex interact to modify APE1.

AB  - Art therapy has been widely offered to reduce symptoms of psychological disturbance. Pooled evidence about its effectiveness in epidemic contexts, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has not been yet established. This study reviewed the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of art therapy on children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and past epidemics. We searched PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), and CINAHL for articles on art therapy during COVID-19. Included studies reported improvements in measures of mental health, sleep quality, and psychological well-being in children with or without disabilities in the epidemic context. Results also showed that art therapy was highly feasible and accepted by children and adolescents as well as their families during epidemics in reviewed studies. Art therapy can be effective at improving various aspects of mental health, sleep quality, and psychological well-being. More empirical evidence is needed with larger sample sizes and longer duration of interventions.

AB  - Objective: To assess differences in blood inflammatory cytokines between people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and healthy controls (HC).Methods: Searches were performed from inception through April 14, 2021. Meta-analyses with random-effects models were used to calculate the standardized mean difference ([SMD], 95%CI), and potential sources of heterogeneity were explored trough meta-regressions and subgroup analysis.Results: The meta-analysis included 23 studies on the following 14 cytokines: tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, IL-1, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL15, interferon (IFN)-g and sCD14. There were significantly higher concentrations of IL-6 (n=462 AUD and 408 HC; SMD = 0.523; 95%CI 0.136-0.909; p = 0.008) in AUD than HC. No significant differences were found in the other 13 cytokines. Conclusion: We found that IL-6 levels were significantly higher in individuals with AUD than HC and that other cytokines were not altered. This can be explained by the small number of studies, their methodological heterogeneity, and confounding factors (active use, abstinence, quantity, and physical or psychiatric illnesses, for example). Despite a great deal of evidence about alcohol and inflammatory diseases, studies assessing the role of neuroimmune signaling in the development and severity of AUD are still lacking.

AB  - Service users' views and expectations of mental health nurses in a UK context were previously reviewed in 2008. The aim of this systematic review is to extend previous research by reviewing international research and work published after the original review. Five databases were searched for studies of any design, published since 2008, that addressed service user and carer views and expectations of mental health nurses. Two reviewers independently completed title and abstract, full-text screening and data extraction. A narrative synthesis was undertaken. We included 49 studies. Most included studies (n = 39, 80%) were qualitative. The importance of the therapeutic relationship and service users being supported in their personal recovery by mental health nurses were core themes identified across included studies. Service users frequently expressed concern about the quality of the therapeutic relationship and indicated that nurses lacked time to spend with them. Carers reported that their concerns were not taken seriously and were often excluded from the care of their relatives. Our critical appraisal identified important sources of bias in included studies. The findings of our review are broadly consistent with previous reviews however the importance of adopting a recovery approach has emerged as a new focus.

AB  - Objectives Accurate and complete study reporting allows evidence users to critically appraise studies, evaluate possible bias, and assess generalizability and applicability. We evaluated the extent to which recent studies on depression screening accuracy were reported consistent with Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) statement requirements. Methods MEDLINE was searched from January 1, 2018 through May 21, 2021 for depression screening accuracy studies. Results 106 studies were included. Of 34 STARD items or sub-items, the number of adequately reported items per study ranged from 7 to 18 (mean = 11.5, standard deviation [SD] = 2.5; median = 11.5), and the number inadequately reported ranged from 3 to 17 (mean = 10.1, SD = 2.5; median = 10.0). There were eight items adequately reported, seven partially reported, 11 inadequately reported, and four not applicable in >= 50% of studies; the remaining four items had mixed reporting. Items inadequately reported in >= 70% of studies related to the rationale for index test cut-offs examined, missing data management, analyses of variability in accuracy results, sample size determination, participant flow, study registration, and study protocol. Conclusion Recently published depression screening accuracy studies are not optimally reported. Journals should endorse and implement STARD adherence.

AB  - Social and communication skills play an important role in the relationship between healthcare professionals and their patients. In this field, it is plausible that clinical empathy and loneliness play an important role of influence. However, the knowledge about this roll is still scarce. The main purpose of this review was to collect findings reported on this matter in students and healthcare professionals. The review included: articles published in English or Spanish during the last fifty years that were indexed in MedLine or SCOPUS, with students or health professionals as participants, and where empathy and loneliness had been used as main measures. Eleven articles, published between 1986 and 2020, that met the abovementioned criteria were included in the analysis. From them, eight corresponded to observational studies and three to interventional studies. Eight studies included students and the other three included healthcare professionals in their study samples. A negative correlation between empathy and loneliness was found in four studies. Furthermore, loneliness in the family environment was described as a negative predictor of empathy towards patients. Training programs in empathic skills and group accompaniment proved not only effective in the improvement of empathy in students, but also in the reduction of loneliness. These findings confirm a close relationship between clinical empathy and loneliness. They also show that the improvement in empathic skills not only has a positive effect on the professional ethical behavior towards patients, but it also helps improving the professional's well-being by reducing loneliness.

AB  - The present systematic review aimed to evaluate the associations between welding fumes exposure and changes in oxidative stress [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA)] and DNA damage [8-hydroxy-2'- deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and DNA-protein crosslink (DPC)] markers in professional welders (PROSPERO CRD42022298115). Six electronic bibliographic databases were searched from inception through September 2021 to identify observational epidemiological studies evaluating the association between welding fumes exposures and changes in oxidative stress and DNA damage in professional welders. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence. A narrative synthesis of results was conducted using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) method. Pooled mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated in a random-effects meta-analysis for the outcomes of interest in the review. From 450 studies identified through the search strategy, 14 observational epidemiological studies were included in the review. Most studies reported significantly higher welding fumes levels in welders than in controls. The narrative synthesis results of SOD showed a significant difference between welders and controls, while the meta-analysis results of MDA did not show a significant difference between the studied groups (MD = 0.26; 95% CI,-0.03, 0.55). The meta-analysis results of 8-OHdG (MD = 9.38; 95% CI, 0.55-18.21) and DPC (MD = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.14-2) revealed significantly differences between the studied groups. The included studies were at high risk of exclusion and confounding bias. The certainty of the evidence for oxidative stress and DNA damage results were very low and moderate, respectively. Exposure to welding fumes and metal particles is associated with DNA damage in professional welders, and 8-OHdG and DPC might be considered reliable markers to assess DNA damage resulting from exposure to welding fumes. We recommend, however, that the evaluation of oxidative stress resulting from welding fumes exposure not be solely based on MDA and SOD.

AB  - Currently, there is no disease-modifying treatment available for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD) and that includes the highly controversial approval of the A beta-targeting antibody aducanumab for the treatment of AD. Hence, there is still an unmet need for a neuroprotective drug treatment in both AD and PD. Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for both AD and PD. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a peptide hormone and growth factor that has shown neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies, and the success of GLP-1 mimetics in phase II clinical trials in AD and PD has raised new hope. GLP-1 mimetics are currently on the market as treatments for type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 analogs are safe, well tolerated, resistant to desensitization and well characterized in the clinic. Herein, we review the existing evidence and illustrate the neuroprotective pathways that are induced following GLP-1R activation in neurons, microglia and astrocytes. The latter include synaptic protection, improvements in cognition, learning and motor function, amyloid pathology-ameliorating properties (A beta, Tau, and alpha-synuclein), the suppression of Ca2+ deregulation and ER stress, potent anti-inflammatory effects, the blockage of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis pathways, enhancements in the neuronal insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism, functional improvements in autophagy and mitophagy, elevated BDNF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) synthesis as well as neurogenesis. The many beneficial features of GLP-1R and GLP-1/GIPR dual agonists encourage the development of novel drug treatments for AD and PD.

AB  - The effects of organizational justice on workers' health have been investigated in several areas of work. However, the systematization of available information on the effects related to car-diovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes is scar-ce. This article aims to systematically review the association between organizational justice and CVD and metabolic disease in adult workers. The search strategy included the terms organizational justice, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and CVD. This study investigated the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS. The quality of the studies was assessed using the instrument developed by the National Institute of Health. Results: This study identified 1,959 titles. After evaluation, eight studies were selected. Individuals with a high perception of or-ganizational justice showed a lower risk of CVD and metabolic disease, whereas low organizatio-nal justice presented repercussions for the cardio-vascular and metabolic health of workers. The de-velopment of strategies to promote organizational justice must be prioritized and thus mitigate its impacts on workers and institutions.

In November 2020, multiple electronic databases (Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, PubMed, and Web of Science) were searched for articles published in English. Inclusion criteria were randomized-controlled trials reporting the effectiveness of any non-pharmacological interventions in reducing fear or anxiety levels in patients with third molar extraction. A total of 3015 studies by electronic search and 2 studies by hand search were identified. After screening, 21 studies were eligible for systematic review. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment of the included studies were performed by two independent investigators. The anxiety levels after intervention in each study were pooled and meta-analyzed by the random-effect model. A significant reduction in anxiety level was observed in non-pharmacological intervention groups (SMD = -0.32; 95% CI -0.57 to -0.07; p = 0.01). Subgroup analyses showed that a significant anxiety reduction by non-pharmacological interventions could be demonstrated by pooled data from studies using psychometric assessments, but not from studies using physiological assessments. Non-pharmacological interventions appear to reduce fear and anxiety levels in patients undergoing third molar extraction under local anesthesia.

AB  - Forest therapy involves visiting forests or conducting forest-based treatment activities to improve one's health. Studies have investigated the health benefits of forests, but consensus has not been reached. This study comprised a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine how forest therapy affects the physiological and psychological health of adults. The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, and Medline databases were searched on 31 August 2021. Systematic review and meta-analysis, risk evaluation, GRADE evaluation, and advertisement effect evaluation were performed for each article. The effect size was calculated by dividing blood pressure as a physiological indicator and depression as a psychological indicator. Of the 16,980 retrieved studies, 17 were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Of these, eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. The effect size of forest therapy on improving systolic and diastolic blood pressure was not significant; however, it significantly reduced depression. While the results have limited generalizability due to the inclusion of few studies, the effects of forest therapy on reducing depression have been confirmed. Since the application of forest therapy was heterogeneous in these studies, a moderator effect analysis or subgroup analysis in meta-analysis should be performed in the future.

AB  - Background Limited evidence is currently available on the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the prevalence and geographic distribution of PTSD symptoms after SCI. Methods After a search in the MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, two reviewers independently summarized relevant studies published through 20 October 2021. Observational studies were included. The studies were eligible if they assessed PTSD symptoms using standard self-report or clinician-based instruments. Data and results were reported using the overall prevalence and the odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results 24 articles (5646 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms ranged from 6.33% (95% CI, 2.73-13.97) to 61.76% (95% CI, 52.07-70.61). Pooled analysis demonstrated that the overall prevalence of PTSD symptoms in SCI patients was significantly higher in developing countries (41.64%; 95% CI, 31.11-52.55) than in developed countries (19.35%; 95% CI, 14.66-24.51) (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.42; p = .003). The highest prevalence of PTSD symptoms was reported in South Africa (56.25%; 95% CI, 47.01-65.08), followed by Sri Lanka (45.71%; 95% CI, 30.47-61.81), and Greece (43.55%; 95% CI, 31.94-55.91). By contrast, Norway (6.33%; 95% CI, 2.73-13.97), Switzerland/Germany (8.65%; 95% CI, 4.8-13.42), and Denmark (10.71%; 95% CI, 6.89-16.30) were found to have the lowest prevalence of PTSD symptoms after SCI. Conclusion Many traumatic SCI patients suffer from PTSD symptoms, and their prevalence seems to be higher in developing countries than in developed countries. These findings underscore the need to consider the psychological aspects of traumatic SCI.

AB  - Neuroethics is the study of how neuroscience impacts humans and society. About 15 years have passed since neuroethics was introduced to Japan, yet the field of neuroethics still seeks developed methodologies and an established academic identity. In light of progress in neuroscience and neurotechnology, the challenges for Japanese neuroethics in the 2020 s can be categorized into five topics. (1) The need for further research into the importance of informed consent in psychiatric research and the promotion of public-patient engagement. (2) The need for a framework that constructs a global environment for neuroscience research that utilizes reliable samples and data. (3) The need for ethical support within a Japanese context regarding the construction of brain banks and the research surrounding their use. It is also important to reconsider the moral value of the human neural system and make comparisons with non-human primates. (4) An urgent need to study neuromodulation technologies that intervene in emotions. (5) The need to reconsider neuroscience and neurotechnology from social points of view. Rules for neuroenhancements and do-it-yourself neurotechnologies are urgently needed, while from a broader perspective, it is essential to study the points of contact between neuroscience and public health.

Specially, there is a need to analyze in more detail the reputed longevity of plastics in the context of plastic degradation through oxidation and fragmentation reactions. Photo-oxidation of plastic debris by solar UV radiation (UVR) makes material prone to subsequent fragmentation. The fragments generated following oxidation and subsequent exposure to mechanical stresses include secondary micro-or nanoparticles, an emerging class of pollutants. The paper discusses the UV-driven photo-oxidation process, identifying relevant knowledge gaps and uncertainties. Serious gaps in knowledge exist concerning the wavelength sensitivity and the dose-response of the photo-fragmentation process. Given the heterogeneity of natural UV irradiance varying from no exposure in sedi-ments to full UV exposure of floating, beach litter or air-borne plastics, it is argued that the rates of UV-driven degra-dation/fragmentation will also vary dramatically between different locations and environmental niches. Biological phenomena such as biofouling will further modulate the exposure of plastics to UV radiation, while potentially also contributing to degradation and/or fragmentation of plastics independent of solar UVR. Reductions in solar UVR in many regions, consequent to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments for protecting strato-spheric ozone, will have consequences for global UV-driven plastic degradation in a heterogeneous manner across different geographic and environmental zones. The interacting effects of global warming, stratospheric ozone and UV radiation are projected to increase UV irradiance at the surface in localized areas, mainly because of decreased cloud cover. Given the complexity and uncertainty of future environmental conditions, this currently precludes reliable quantitative predictions of plastic persistence on a global scale.

AB  - Background: Living alone is one of the most common psychosocial factors that may have an impact on lifestyle management and health status. Although many previous cross-sectional studies have found that living alone increases the risk of depression. However, this risk has rarely been assessed on the basis of longitudinal studies. Therefore, we will explore this relationship on the basis of longitudinal studies. Methods: We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to May 2022. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled by a random-effects model using an inverse variance method. Results: Seven studies (six cohort studies and one case-control study) were included in our study. A total of 123,859 without a history of psychosis individuals were included, and the proportion of females was 65.3%. We applied a random-effects model to minimize the heterogeneity. Overall, the pooled data suggest that people living alone are associated with an increased risk of depression compared to those who do not live alone (OR 1.42, 95%CI 1.19-1.70). Conclusion: Compared to people who live with others, living alone increases the risk of depression. Only cross-sectional studies and a few longitudinal studies currently support this association; more high-quality studies will be required in the future to confirm this causal association.

AB  - Irregular or unnatural artificial light causes severe environmental stress on the survival and health of organisms, which is rapidly becoming a widespread new type of environmental pollution. A series of disruptive behaviors to body homeostasis brought about by light pollution, including metabolic abnormalities, are likely to be the result of circadian rhythm disturbances. Recently, the proposed role of light pollution in metabolic dysregulation has accelerated it into an emerging field. Hence, the regulatory role of light pollution in mammalian metabolic homeostasis is reviewed in this contribution. Light at night is the most widely affected type of light pollution, which disrupts metabolic homeostasis largely due to its disruption of daily food intake patterns, alterations of hormone levels such as melatonin and glucocorticoids, and changes in the rhythm of inflammatory factor pro-duction. Besides, light pollution impairs mammalian metabolic processes in an intensity-, photoperiod-, and wavelength-dependent manner, and is also affected by species, gender, and diets. Nevertheless, metabolic dis-orders triggered by light pollution are not irreversible to some extent. Potential interventions such as melatonin supplementation, recovery to the LD cycle, time-restricted feeding, voluntary exercise, wearing blue light-shied goggles, and bright morning light therapy open a bright avenue to prevent light pollution. This work will help strengthen the relationship between light information and metabolic homeostasis and provide new insights for the better prevention of metabolic disorders and light pollution.

AB  - Background Indigenous youth in Canada face profound health inequities which are shaped by the rippling effects of intergenerational trauma, caused by the historical and contemporary colonial policies that reinforce negative stereotypes regarding them. Moreover, wellness promotion strategies for these youth are replete with individualistic Western concepts that excludes avenues for them to access holistic practices grounded in their culture. Our scoping review explored strategies, approaches, and ways health and wellness can be enhanced by, for, and with Indigenous youth in Canada by identifying barriers/roadblocks and facilitators/strengths to enhancing wellness among Indigenous youth in Canada. Methods We applied a systematic approach to searching and critically reviewing peer-reviewed literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews [PRISMA-ScR] as a reporting guideline. Our search strategy focused on specific keywords and MeSH terms for three major areas: Indigenous youth, health, and Canada. We used these keywords, to systematically search the following electronic databases published in English between January 01, 2017, to May 22, 2021: Medline [Ovid], PubMed, ERIC, Web of Science, Scopus, and iportal. We also used hand-searching and snowballing methods to identify relevant articles. Data collected were analysed for contents and themes. Results From an initial 1695 articles collated, 20 articles met inclusion criteria for this review. Key facilitators/strengths to enhancing health and wellness by, for, and with Indigenous youth that emerged from our review included: promoting culturally appropriate interventions to engage Indigenous youth; using strength-based approaches; reliance on the wisdom of community Elders; taking responsibility; and providing access to wellness supports. Key barriers/roadblocks included: lack of community support for wellness promotion activities among Indigenous youth; structural/organizational issues within Indigenous communities; discrimination and social exclusion; cultural illiteracy among youth; cultural discordance with mainstream health systems and services; and addictions and risky behaviours. Conclusion This scoping review extracted 20 relevant articles about ways to engage Indigenous youth in health and wellness enhancement. Our findings demonstrate the importance of promoting health by, and with Indigenous youth, by engaging them in activities reflexive of their cultural norms, rather than imposing control measures that are incompatible with their value systems.

AB  - Driving is a complex neurobehavioural task necessitating the rapid selection, uptake, and processing of visual information. Eye movements that are critical for the execution of visually guided behaviour such as driving are also sensitive to the effects of psychotropic substances. The Embase (via Ovid), EBSCOHost, Psynet, Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were examined from January 01st, 2000 to December 31st, 2021. Study selection, data extraction and Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB2) assessments were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. The review was prospectively registered (CRD42021267554). In total, 36 full-text articles examined the effects of six principal psychotropic drug classes on measures of oculomotor parameters relevant to driving. Centrally depressing substances affect oculomotor responses in a dose-dependent manner. Psychostimulants improve maximal speed, but not accuracy, of visual search behaviours. Inhaled & UDelta;-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) increases inattention (saccadic inaccuracy) but does not consistently affect other oculomotor parameters. Al-terations to composite ocular parameters due to psychoactive substance usage likely differently compromises performance precision during driving through impaired ability to select and process dynamic visual information.

AB  - The purpose of the systematic review was to identify, evaluate, and synthesize evidence from available published literature examining the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on youth physical activity (PA). A systematic review of the literature was conducted for years 2020-2021. Published articles were searched in eight databases. Inclusion criteria included: availability of full-text, written in English language, and reported quantitative or qualitative results of original or secondary data on PA and COVID-19 related factors among youth (ages 5-17 years). A standard quality assessment tool assessed risk of bias and quality of included articles. The search retrieved 2,899 articles with 51 articles ultimately meeting inclusion criteria. The majority of articles (65 %) investigated change in PA from before to during the pandemic. Most evidence indicated an overall decrease in youth PA levels during the pandemic with differences observed among sub-populations (e.g., age, sex or gender), type, and location. Findings suggest pandemic-related closures hindered PA participation due to a high reliance on school-and sport-based PA. Programmatic strategies (e.g., activity breaks, active curriculum, free online activities/lessons) should include aligning intervention measures and geared towards evolving and ongoing PA promotion based on the latest findings.

AB  - Background The cerebellum is involved in regulating motor, affective, and cognitive processes. It is a promising target for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) intervention in stroke. Objectives To review the current evidence for cerebellar tDCS (ctDCS) in stroke, its problems, and its future directions. Methods We searched the Web of Science, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases. Eligible studies were identified after a systematic literature review of the effects of ctDCS in stroke patients. The changes in assessment scale scores and objective indicators after stimulation were reviewed. Results Eleven studies were included in the systematic review, comprising 169 stroke patients. Current evidence suggests that anode tDCS on the right cerebellar hemisphere does not appear to enhance language processing in stroke patients. Compared with the sham group, stroke patients showed a significant improvement in the verb generation task after cathodal ctDCS stimulation. However, with regard to naming, two studies came to the opposite conclusion. The contralesional anodal ctDCS is expected to improve standing balance but not motor learning in stroke patients. The bipolar bilateral ctDCS protocol to target dentate nuclei (PO10h and PO9h) had a positive effect on standing balance, goal-directed weight shifting, and postural control in stroke patients. Conclusions ctDCS appears to improve poststroke language and motor dysfunction (particularly gait). However, the evidence for these results was insufficient, and the quality of the relevant studies was low. ctDCS stimulation parameters and individual factors of participants may affect the therapeutic effect of ctDCS. Researchers need to take a more regulated approach in the future to conduct studies with large sample sizes. Overall, ctDCS remains a promising stroke intervention technique that could be used in the future.

AB  - is a progressive loss of physiological function that increases risk of disease and death. Among the many factors that contribute to human aging, mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as one of the most prominent features of the aging process. It has been linked to the development of various age-related pathologies, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitochondria has a complex quality control system that ensures mitochon-drial integrity and function. Perturbations in these mitochondrial mechanisms have long been linked to various age-related neurological disorders. Even though research has shed light on several aspects of the disease pathol-ogy, the underlying mechanism of age-related factors responsible for individuals developing this disease is still unknown. This review article aims to discuss the role of mitochondria in the transition from normal brain aging to pathological brain aging, which leads to the progression of PD. We have discussed the emerging evidence on how age-related disruption of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms contributes to the development of PD -related pathophysiology.(c) 2022 IBRO.

AB  - In the last four decades, mental health services for people with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) have seen asylums replaced by a balanced model of Community Mental Healthcare (CMH). Innovative approaches and strategies in the field of CMH have been extensively researched. However, this research has been hampered by issues limiting their capacity to inform clinicians and policymakers. We conducted an overview of meta-analyses of the effectiveness of innovative CMH models focussing on clinical and psychosocial outcomes in comparisons with standard care in adults with SMI. Based on the 12 eligible studies, we appraised, synthesised and graded the resulting evidence. There was moderate quality evidence that case management, Early Intervention Services (EIS) and caregiver-directed interventions were superior to standard care in reducing hospital admission. In relation to psychosocial outcomes, EIS showed high quality evidence of a small effect on global functioning. There was moderate quality evidence for a similar effect of Intensive Case Management, and for a large effect of family intervention. For quality of life, both EIS and self-management education had a small effect, with moderate quality. The level of research about effective CMH models is therefore substantial. However, several gaps related to innovative CMH not yet covered in meta-analytic synthesis, need to be filled.

AB  - Traditional video recommendation provides the viewers with customized media content according to their historical records (e.g., ratings, reviews). However, such systems tend to generate terrible results if the data is insufficient, which leads to a cold-start problem. An affective video recommender system (AVRS) is a multidiscipline and multimodal human-robot interaction (HRI) system, and it incorporates physical, physiological, neuroscience, and computer science subjects and multimedia resources, including text, audio, and video. As a promising research domain, AVRS employs advanced affective analysis technologies in video resources; therefore, it can solve the cold-start problem. In AVRS, the viewers' emotional responses can be obtained from various techniques, including physical signals (e.g., facial expression, gestures, and speech) and internal signals (e.g., physiological signals). The changes in these signals can be detected when the viewers face specific situations. The physiological signals are a response to central and autonomic nervous systems and are mostly involuntarily activated, which cannot be easily controlled. Therefore, it is suitable for reliable emotion analysis. The physical signals can be recorded by a webcam or recorder. In contrast, the physiological signals can be collected by various equipment, e.g., psychophysiological heart rate (HR) signals calculated by echocardiogram (ECG), electro-dermal activity (EDA), and brain activity (GA) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals, skin conductance response (SCR) by a galvanic skin response (GSR), and photoplethysmography (PPG) estimating users' pulse. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the AVRS domain. To analyze the recent efforts in the field of affective video recommendation, we collected 92 relevant published articles from Google Scholar and summarized the articles and their key findings. In this survey, we feature these articles concerning AVRS from different perspectives, including various traditional recommendation algorithms and advanced deep learning-based algorithms, the commonly used affective video recommendation databases, audience response categories, and evaluation methods. Finally, we conclude the challenge of AVRS and provide the potential future research directions.

AB  - IntroductionMinority-language speakers in the general population face barriers to accessing healthcare services. This scoping review aims to examine the barriers to healthcare access for minority-language speakers who have a neurodevelopmental disorder. Our goal is to inform healthcare practitioners and policy makers thus improving healthcare services for this population. Inclusion criteriaInformation was collected from studies whose participants include individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) who are minority-language speakers, their family members, and healthcare professionals who work with them. We examined access to healthcare services across both medical and para-medical services. MethodSearches were completed using several databases. We included all types of experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and descriptive studies, as well as studies using qualitative methodologies. Evidence selection and data extraction was completed by two independent reviewers and compared. Data extraction focused on the barriers to accessing and to utilizing healthcare for minority-language speakers with NDDs. The search process and ensuing results were fully reported using a diagram from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for scoping review. ResultsFollowing the database search, a total of 28 articles met our final selection criteria and two articles were hand-picked based on our knowledge of the literature, for a total of 30 articles. These studies revealed that minority-language speakers with NDDs and their families experience several barriers to accessing and utilizing healthcare services. These barriers, identified at the Systems, Provider and Family Experience levels, have important consequences on children's outcomes and families' well-being. DiscussionWhile our review outlined several barriers to access and utilization of healthcare services for minority-language speakers with NDDs and their families, our findings give rise to concrete solutions. These solutions have the potential to mitigate the identified barriers, including development and implementation of policies and guidelines that support minority-language speakers, practitioner training, availability of referral pathways to appropriate services, access to tools and other resources such as interpretation services, and partnership with caregivers. Further research needs to shift from describing barriers to examining the efficacy of the proposed solutions in mitigating and eliminating identified barriers, and ensuring equity in healthcare for minority-language speakers with NDDs.

AB  - Background Photovoice (PV) was conceptualized in the early 1990s to engage community members in capturing/communicating their lived experience narratives through photography. However, no meta-analyses in health research have assessed whether PV achieves its purported effects.
   Methods We carried forward any relevant references from a previous review identifying PV studies before 2008 and searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 2008 up unto October 2019. We included both published and grey literature, in any population or context. We assessed quality with the Effective Public Health Practice Project's (EPHPP) tool and pooled studies using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results Twenty-eight studies were included, showing significant post-treatment effects only for health knowledge (SMD, 95% CIs = 0.41, 0.09 to 0.73, n = 16) and community functions (SMD, 95% as = 0.22, 0.03 to 0.40, n = 4). Strong heterogeneity was indicated for health knowledge, potentially explained by a larger effect in ethnic minority populations. There was insufficient follow-up data for health knowledge, while in follow-up for community functions the post-treatment effect was lost.
   Conclusions PV's post-treatment effect on health knowledge did not translate into positive health behaviours or physical and mental health outcomes, longer-term community functions, or health service outcomes.

AB  - Adolescence is an important developmental period associated with increased risk for excessive alcohol use, but also high rates of recovery from alcohol use-related problems, suggesting potential resilience to long-term effects compared to adults. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the current evidence for a moderating role of age on the impact of chronic alcohol exposure on the brain and cognition. We searched Medline, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library databases up to February 3, 2021. All human and animal studies that directly tested whether the relationship between chronic alcohol exposure and neurocognitive outcomes differs between adolescents and adults were included. Study characteristics and results of age-related analyses were extracted into reference tables and results were separately narratively synthesized for each cognitive and brain-related outcome. The evidence strength for age-related differences varies across outcomes. Human evidence is largely missing, but animal research provides limited but consistent evidence of heightened adolescent sensitivity to chronic alcohol's effects on several outcomes, including conditioned aversion, dopaminergic transmission in reward-related regions, neurodegeneration, and neurogenesis. At the same time, there is limited evidence for adolescent resilience to chronic alcohol-induced impairments in the domain of cognitive flexibility, warranting future studies investigating the potential mechanisms underlying adolescent risk and resilience to the effects of alcohol. The available evidence from mostly animal studies indicates adolescents are both more vulnerable and potentially more resilient to chronic alcohol effects on specific brain and cognitive outcomes. More human research directly comparing adolescents and adults is needed despite the methodological constraints. Parallel translational animal models can aid in the causal interpretation of observed effects. To improve their translational value, future animal studies should aim to use voluntary self-administration paradigms and incorporate individual differences and environmental context to better model human drinking behavior.

AB  - Aim: This systematic review aimed to identify the most important social, environmental, biological, and/or genetic risk factors for intellectual disability (ID). Methods: Eligible were published prospective or retrospective comparative studies investigating risk factors for ID in children 4-18 years. Exclusions were single group studies with no comparator without ID and a sample size < 100. Electronic databases (Medline, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Campbell Collaboration, and CINAHL) were searched for eligible publications from 1980 to 2020. Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal instruments, appropriate for study type, were used to assess study quality and risk of bias. Descriptive characteristics and individual study results were presented followed by the synthesis for individual risk factors, also assessed using GRADE. Results: Fifty-eight individual eligible studies were grouped into six exposure topics: sociodemographic; antenatal and perinatal; maternal physical health; maternal mental health; environmental; genetic or biological studies. There were few eligible genetic studies. For half the topics, the certainty of evidence (GRADE) was moderate or high. Conclusion: Multiple studies have examined individual potential determinants of ID, but few have investigated holistically to identify those populations most at risk. Our review would indicate that there are vulnerable groups where risk factors we identified, such as low socioeconomic status, minority ethnicity, teenage motherhood, maternal mental illness, and alcohol abuse, may cluster, highlighting a target for preventive strategies. At-risk populations need to be identified and monitored so that interventions can be implemented when appropriate, at preconception, during pregnancy, or after birth. This could reduce the likelihood of ID and provide optimal opportunities for vulnerable infants.

AB  - Purpose of Review We review recent developments within digital phenotyping for mental health, a field dedicated to using digital data for diagnosing, predicting, and monitoring mental health problems. We especially focus on recent critiques and challenges to digital phenotyping from within the social sciences. Recent Findings Three significant strands of criticism against digital phenotyping for mental health have been developed within the social sciences. This literature problematizes the idea that digital data can be objective, that it can be unbiased, and argues that it has multiple ethical and practical challenges. Digital phenotyping for mental health is a rapidly growing and developing field, but with considerable challenges that are not easily solvable. This includes when, and if, data from digital phenotyping is actionable in practice; the involvement of user and patient perspectives in digital phenotyping research; the possibility of biased data; and challenges to the idea that digital phenotyping can be more objective than other forms of psychiatric assessment.

Studies that included information on repetition of the NSSI behaviour were also included. Altogether this amounts to 3900 randomized study participants with outcome data. Results Seven trials reported repetition of NSSI as an outcome measure which were classified into four categories. Problem-solving therapy is indicated as a promising therapy and has shown to significantly reduce repetition in participants who NSSI by overdosing than patients in the control treatment groups consisting of standard after care. Conclusion The data show that manualized cognitive therapy psychological intervention was more effective than TAU after care. However, these differences are not statistically significant with p = .15; CI 0.61, 1.0 which crosses the line of no effect. And psychodynamic interpersonal therapy is more effective than the standard treatment. Despite being only one study in this subgroup the analysis shows a statistical significance with p = .009, CI 0.08; 0.7.

AB  - Objective This study aims to systematically review all Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) with recommendations for peripartum depression in European countries. Methods A systematic review according to the PRISMA statement was conducted. CPGs focussing on peripartum depression or with at least one specific recommendation for peripartum depression from European countries were selected. Searching was conducted in electronic databases (MEDLINE and PsycINFO), and by contacting professional societies and international experts until November 24th, 2021. Characteristics of the included CPGs and their recommendations were extracted. A methodological quality assessment was conducted using the AGREE-II tool. Results A total of 239 records were identified after duplicate removal. Of these, 54 were examined for full-text inspection. The final selection yielded 14 CPGs from 11 European countries in 10 languages. Of them, 11 provided recommendations on pharmacological treatments, 10 on psychological treatment (e.g., cognitive-behavioural therapy), 10 on screening, 8 on diagnosis, 6 on other treatments (e.g., physical exercise), 5 on prevention, and 5 other recommendations (e.g., provide information). Regarding the overall methodological quality, only five (35.7%) guidelines were rated as of adequate quality, reaching a score >= 70% in the overall assessment of the AGREE-II instrument. Of the six AGREE-II domains, applicability scored the lowest and clarity of presentation scored the highest. Conclusion The absence of CPGs in most European countries, the discrepancy in recommendations and the low methodological quality of the guidelines may lead to disparities and inequalities in peripartum depression management in Europe. The COST Action Riseup-PPD highlights key considerations for future guideline developers.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Adolescents are noted to increasingly utilise social media for communication, and therefore, social media is where much of their psychosocial development takes place. The potential impact of social media on psychosocial development is complex and is an emerging field of research. A systematic review was conducted to investigate existing research relating to social media's effects on psychosocial development. Good practice in systematic review reporting was followed, aligned to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, and a team of five reviewers were involved in each stage of the review process to enhance objectivity and methodological rigour. The review included 20 studies, published between 2008 and 2019. The findings show a complex relationship between social media and adolescent psychosocial development. Social media was found to involve potential risks, in terms of excessive and problematic use, comparison, and cyberbullying. Social support, from both peers and parents, may buffer these negative impacts. Potential benefits of social media use include supporting identity development and the maintenance of existing peer relationships. Considering the growth of social media use, it is imperative to consider the development and provision of interventions and mental health care services to address the potential risks associated with increased social media use. Psychoeducation with adolescents and parents as to the risks, benefits, and constructive parental supervision of social media is also recommended. The review highlights the need for high-quality empirical research to further clarify the long-term impact of social media use, particularly within the South African context.

AB  - Self-transcendent emotions are positive emotions that arise out of other-focused appraisals. These emotions shift attention from the self to the needs and concerns of others. Limited work, however, focuses on self-transcendent emotions and the underlying cognitive and behavioural mechanisms by which they benefit organizations. We review the disparate streams of research on self-transcendent emotions and detail the thought-action repertoires of four self-transcendent emotions (compassion, gratitude, inspiration, and awe), explaining how each contributes to effective organizational functioning. Central to achieving this aim is the broaden-and-build theory. We show how the four self-transcendent emotions broaden cognitive processes and build the necessary resources leading to specific positive organizational outcomes. We conclude our review with four themes: (a) the importance of delineating levels of analysis in self-transcendent emotion research, (b) acknowledging contextual and cross-cultural differences shaping the experience of self-transcendent emotions, (c) addressing measurement concerns, and (d) the examination of other self-transcendent emotions. In effect, we synthesize the positive psychology and organizational behaviour literature, generating a framework that prompts theoretical and practical considerations for the role of self-transcendent emotions in organizations.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of horticultural therapy on depressive symptoms in the elderly and determine the potential moderators of the intervention effect. Methods: In early June 2022, randomized controlled trials and Quasi-experimental studies were searched on Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, CNKI, WANFANG DATA, and CQVIP. Three independent authors proposed the following inclusion criterion for this study: the elderly with applied horticultural therapy intervention compared to non-HT intervention. From a total of 3,068 records, only 34 studies met the inclusion criteria. After the full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the analysis. An assessment of the risk of bias was conducted using RoBINS-I and RoB 2 tools. The comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.3 tool was used for the meta-analysis. Results: Meta-analysis suggested that mean depression scores of elderly people who underwent horticultural therapy intervention were significantly lower than those who did not receive HT therapy. More significant effects were found for the elderly with mean age equal to or over 75 years instead of younger than 75 years, in randomized controlled trials instead of quasi-experimental studies, for studies with more than 20 participants receiving horticultural therapy at the same time and place instead of equal to or fewer than 20 horticultural therapy participants. Conclusions: This evidence supported that horticultural therapy had a significant positive effect on the depressive symptoms outcomes for the elderly. Therefore, our data revealed that horticultural therapy could be considered as a part of therapy in depressive symptoms reduction programs. Due to the high degree of heterogeneity and the limited number of studies, a future review is warranted to determine the effects of horticultural therapy on depressive symptoms reduction in the elderly.Systematic review registration, identifier: CRD42021272464.

AB  - Research in biosocial criminology and other related disciplines has established links between nutrition and aggressive behavior. In addition to observational studies, randomized trials of nutritional supplements like vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and folic acid provide evidence of the dietary impact on aggression. However, the exact mechanism of the diet-aggression link is not well understood. The current article proposes that the gut microbiome plays an important role in the process, with the microbiota-gut-brain axis serving as such a mediating mechanism between diet and behavior. Based on animal and human studies, this review synthesizes a wide array of research across several academic fields: from the effects of dietary interventions on aggression, to the results of microbiota transplantation on socioemotional and behavioral outcomes, to the connections between early adversity, stress, microbiome, and aggression. Possibilities for integrating the microbiotic perspective with the more traditional, sociologically oriented theories in criminology are discussed, using social disorganization and self-control theories as examples. To extend the existing lines of research further, the article considers harnessing the experimental potential of noninvasive and low-cost dietary interventions to help establish the causal impact of the gut microbiome on aggressive behavior, while adhering to the high ethical standards and modern research requirements. Implications of this research for criminal justice policy and practice are essential: not only can it help determine whether the improved gut microbiome functioning moderates aggressive and violent behavior but also provide ways to prevent and reduce such behavior, alone or in combination with other crime prevention programs.

AB  - This systematic review aims to summarize the current knowledge on biological effects of micro-and nanoplastics (MNPs) on human health based on mammalian systems. An extensive search of the literature led to a total of 133 pri-mary research articles on the health relevance of MNPs. Our findings revealed that although the study of MNP cytotox-icity and inflammatory response represents a major research theme, most studies (105 articles) focused on the effects of polystyrene MNPs due to their wide availability as a well characterised research material that can be manufactured with a large range of particle sizes, fluorescence labelling as well as various surface modifications. Among the 133 studies covered in this review, 117 articles reported adverse health effects after being exposed to MNPs. Mammalian in vitro studies identified multiple biological effects including cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, genotoxic-ity, embryotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, renal toxicity and even carcinogenicity, while rodent in vivo models confirmed the bioaccumulation of MNPs in the liver, spleen, kidney, brain, lung and gut, presenting adverse effects at different levels including reproductive toxic effects and trans-generational toxicity. In contrast, the remaining 16 studies indicated an insignificant impact of MNPs on humans. A few studies attempted to investigate the mechanisms or factors driving the toxicity of MNPs and identified several determining factors including size, concentration, shape, surface charge, attached pollutants and weathering process, which, however, were not benchmarked or considered by most studies. This review demonstrates that there are still many inconsistencies in the evaluation of the potential health effects of MNPs due to the lack of comparability between studies. Current limitations hindering the attainment of repro-ducible conclusions as well as recommendations for future research directions are also presented.

AB  - This paper aims to explore the contributions of research that include gender perspective in analysing the sexual experiences of women diagnosed with serious mental illness and to identify any barriers and systems that impede sexual fulfilment. We have developed a qualitative literature review using the PRISMA statement. The databases SCOPUS, WOS and PsychINFO were used in this review. Studies were included if they were published up to March 15, 2022, and only studies in English were included. An initial database search was preformed; upon screening for eligibility, there remained 16 studies that explored the sexual experiences of women with diagnoses of serious mental illness. The studies were analysed by a thematic synthesis. Data was coded line-by-line which generated descriptive themes, resulting in four synthesised findings. The four synthesised findings that derived from the reviewed studies were stigma and subjectivity, the experience of interpersonal relationships, the socialisation of women and the effects of psychiatric hegemony. A feminist perspective highlights the interrelationship between gender and stigma as it relates to serious mental illness and sexuality. A feminist perspective and an intersectional approach should be adopted at the intersubjective and structural level to account for the complexity of human experience and to subvert the heteropatriarchal system.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic review of the empirical literature that uses dual-task interference methods for investigating the on-line involvement of language in various cognitive tasks. In these studies, participants perform some primary task X putatively recruiting linguistic resources while also engaging in a secondary, concurrent task. If performance on the primary task decreases under interference, there is evidence for language involvement in the primary task. We assessed studies (N = 101) reporting at least one experiment with verbal interference and at least one control task (either primary or secondary). We excluded papers with an explicitly clinical, neurological, or developmental focus. The primary tasks identified include categorization, memory, mental arithmetic, motor control, reasoning (verbal and visuospatial), task switching, theory of mind, visual change, and visuospatial integration and wayfinding. Overall, the present review found that covert language is likely to play a facilitative role in memory and categorization when items to be remembered or categorized have readily available labels, when inner speech can act as a form of behavioral self-cuing (inhibitory control, task set reminders, verbal strategy), and when inner speech is plausibly useful as "workspace," for example, for mental arithmetic. There is less evidence for the role of covert language in cross-modal integration, reasoning relying on a high degree of visual detail or items low on nameability, and theory of mind. We discuss potential pitfalls and suggestions for streamlining and improving the methodology.

AB  - Visuospatial perspective taking (VSPT) concerns the ability to understand something about the visual relationship between an agent or observation point on the one hand and a target or scene on the other. Despite its importance to a wide variety of other abilities, from communication to navigation, and decades of research, there is as yet no theory of VSPT. Indeed, the heterogeneity of results from different (and sometimes the same) VSPT tasks point to a complex picture suggestive of multiple VSPT strategies, individual differences in performance, and context-specific factors that together have a bearing on both the efficiency and accuracy of outcomes. In this article, we review the evidence in search of patterns in the data. We found a number of predictors of VSPT performance but also a number of gaps in understanding that suggest useful pathways for future research and, possibly, a theory (or theories) of VSPT. Overall, this review makes the case for understanding VSPT by better understanding the perspective taker rather than the target agents or their perception.

AB  - Objective The physical health of individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) is generally far worse than the general population. Emerging electronic and mobile health (e-& mHealth) technology may provide new ways to offer interventions in order to reduce modifiable lifestyle risk factors in this vulnerable population. This scoping review aimed to assess the state of knowledge about the use of e-& mHealth technology-based interventions to address modifiable lifestyle risk factors amongst individuals with SMI. Method EMBASE, Medline (Ovid) and PsycINFO were searched to identify papers published up to July 2021. Extended PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews were followed to report the results. Results A total of 85 papers were identified, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. These interventions were effective in bringing about positive and clinically significant impacts in weight loss, diet, smoking cessation, and physical activity for some participants. However, many participants did not experience these benefits. Overall, participants indicated that they were satisfied with, and receptive to e-& mHealth interventions. Conclusion The evidence base for the use of technology-based interventions to improve modifiable lifestyle risk factors for people with SMI is very limited. More rigorous research on the use of technological tools is needed to determine how more users could benefit from them. Further research and intervention development should be undertaken in collaboration with people with SMI to ensure that unique requirements and preferences are included.

AB  - Glyphosate is the active ingredient in glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), such as RoundupTM, the most widely used herbicides in the world. Glyphosate targets an essential enzyme in plants that is not found in animals. However, both glyphosate and GBHs are rated as Group 2A, probable human carcinogens, and also have documented effects on reproduction, acting as endocrine disruptive chemicals. We have reviewed reports of the effects of glyphosate and GBHs on mammalian nervous system function. As with several other herbicides, GBHs exposure has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's Disease and death of neurons in the substantia nigra. There is also some evidence implicating RoundupTM in elevated risk of autism. Other studies have shown the effects of GBHs on synaptic transmission in animal and cellular studies. The major mechanism of action appears to be oxidative stress, accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, some gut bacteria utilize the enzyme used by plants, and glyphosate and GBHs use has been shown to alter the gut microbiome. There is a large and growing body of evidence that the gut microbiome alters susceptibility to great number of human diseases, including nervous system function. The weight of the evidence indicates that in addition to cancer and reproductive effects, glyphosate and GBHs have significant adverse effects on the brain and behavior and in-crease the risk of at least some serious neurological diseases.

AB  - Background Employment is intrinsic to recovery from mental health conditions, helping people live independently. Systematic reviews indicate supported employment (SE) focused on competitive employment, including individual placement and support (IPS), is effective in helping people with mental health conditions into work. Evidence is limited on cost-effectiveness. We comprehensively reviewed evidence on the economic case for SE/IPS programmes. Methods We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, IBSS, Business Source Complete, and EconLit for economic and return on investment analyses of SE/IPS programmes for mental health conditions. Traditional vocational rehabilitation, sheltered work, and return to work initiatives after sickness absence of less than 1 year were excluded. Studies were independently screened by two reviewers. We assessed quality using the Consolidate Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. The protocol was preregistered with PROSPERO-CRD42020184359. Results From 40,015 references, 28 studies examined the economic case for IPS, four IPS augmented by another intervention, and 24 other forms of SE. Studies were very heterogenous, quality was variable. Of 41 studies with quality scores over 50%, 10 reported cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, (8 favourable to SE/IPS), 14 net monetary benefits (12 positive), 5 return on investment (4 positive), and 20 cost per employment outcome (14 favorable, 5 inconclusive, 1 negative). Totally, 24 of these 41 studies had monetary benefits that more than outweighed the additional costs of SE/IPS programmes. Conclusions There is a strong economic case for the implementation of SE/IPS programmes. The economic case is conservative as evidence on long-term impacts of programmes is limited.

AB  - IntroductionTo mitigate morbidity, mortality, and impacts of heat-related illnesses (HRIs) on health, it was vital to implement a comprehensive framework for HRI prevention and control. A recognized tool from the field of trauma prevention known as the Haddon matrix was applied. The matrix states that any event is affected by three factors: host, agent, and environment. In addition, another recognized tool known as the combined model was used in this study. The combined model is a three-dimensional model that includes the idea for the three axes of Haddon's matrix with the methodology of the community risk reduction (CRR) model. Aim of the studyTo identify the environmental and individual risk factors of HRIs based on the Haddon matrix and the recommended prevention strategies by the CRR tool by using the combined model. MethodologyAn extensive literature review was conducted to assess all the risk factors associated with HRI, as well as preventive measures. Then the Haddon matrix was used to structure, separating human factors from technical and environmental details and timing. After that, the combined model was used to set all responses and mitigation measures for each element obtained from the Haddon matrix tool. ConclusionProjected increases in heat stress over the globe require the formulation and implementation of evidence-based HRI mitigation and preventive measures. In this study, we implemented the combined model that was utilized as a systematic strategy for the more theoretical framework of Haddon's matrix. Using the Haddon matrix to determine the HRI risk factors and the combined model to mitigate its impact was practical and helpful in planning, preparedness, and mitigating the HRIs during Hajj, provided a broad approach equivalent to the Swiss cheese model, and would facilitate an informed decision.

AB  - An increased risk of developing stress, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular diseases, rhinitis, skin and eye irri-tations and headaches has been particularly reported among office workers. Some of these complaints have been linked to the existence of poor indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in the workplaces. In this context, inter-vention studies can offer new insights to tackle poor IEQ issues and to identify effective measures to reduce IEQ-related risks. This review summarizes the main characteristics of environmental intervention studies that have been performed in office settings and the respective findings on the beneficial effects on the promotion of health, well-being, comfort, and productivity among office workers. The study design followed PRISMA guidelines and the search for peer-review articles was conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases. Firstly, 513 records were identified, resulting in 23 articles included in the review after the application of the study eligibility criteria and identification of additional important works within the subject. The revised experimental studies were mainly focused on changes in ventilation systems via replacement of air filters and modifications in the rate of outdoor air supplied or temperature set-points. Some studies also included in-terventions based on the implementation of air cleaning and biophilic strategies. Both objective (e.g., physio-logical examinations) and subjective (e.g., questionnaires) measures have been used to assess the effects on office workers' outcomes. Overall, the findings presented here confirm that interventions aiming at improving IEQ in offices can be effective in improving health, well-being and productivity among office workers.

AB  - Implemented social distancing measures may have forestalled the spread of COVID-19, yet they suppressed the natural human need for contact. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult sexual wellbeing and sexual behavior. An extensive search in Pubmed, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases based on PRISMA guidelines was conducted. After applying specific eligibility criteria, screening resulted in 38 studies. Results were drawn from 31,911 subjects and outlined the negative effect of the pandemic in sexual frequency, function, satisfaction, and the behavioral changes regarding masturbation and internet-based practices. Meta-analyses of the drawn data on 1,343 female, and 1,372 male subjects quantified the degree of sexual function change during the COVID-19 pandemic vs. prior the pandemic. A random effects model revealed the significant negative impact of the pandemic on female sexual function (SMD: 0.76, 95% CI:0.74 to 1.59), while no significant change was found for the males (SMD: 0.25, 95% Cl: -0.03 to 0.52). Significant heterogeneity was identified across included studies (p < 0.00001, I-2 = 97%, I-2 = 90% for females and males, respectively). As part of the global health, sexual wellbeing should be on the focus of clinicians and researchers.

AB  - Background: Psychiatric disorders have seriously affected human life, one of the risk genes related to psychosis is the methylenetetrahydrofolatereductase (MTHFR) gene. This gene has a potential role in psychiatric disorders. Therefore, a meta-analysis is conducted to investigate the correlations between two prevalent MTHFR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), MTHFR C677T, A1298C, severe psychological disorders (schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder). Methods: A total of 81 published studies were screened and selected by a search of electronic databases up to April 2022. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association between MTHFR polymorphism and psychiatric disorders susceptibility by using random effect models. Results: We found that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is significantly related to schizophrenia and major depression in the overall population. MTHFR C677T has been linked to an increased risk of bipolar disorder in the recessive model (TT vs. CT + CC). Ethnic subgroup analysis shows that schizophrenia and major depression significantly correlate with MTHFR C677T and A1298C in Asian populations but not Caucasians. Besides, schizophrenia is correlated substantially with MTHFR C677T in the African population. However, the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is only marginally linked to major depression. Conclusion: Findings of the current study revealed that MTHFR may contribute to the common pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases and that its variants may be essential in controlling the expression of psychosis-related genes. This study could help the researchers and health specialists in the early diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - As a newly emerging field, connectomics has greatly advanced our understanding of the wiring diagram and organizational features of the human brain. Generative modeling-based connectome analysis, in particular, plays a vital role in deciphering the neural mechanisms of cognitive functions in health and dysfunction in diseases. Here we review the foundation and development of major generative modeling approaches for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and survey their applications to cognitive or clinical neuroscience problems. We argue that conventional structural and functional connectivity (FC) analysis alone is not sufficient to reveal the complex circuit interactions underlying observed neuroimaging data and should be supplemented with generative modeling-based effective connectivity and simulation, a fruitful practice that we term "mechanistic connectome." The transformation from descriptive connectome to mechanistic connectome will open up promising avenues to gain mechanistic insights into the delicate operating principles of the human brain and their potential impairments in diseases, which facilitates the development of effective personalized treatments to curb neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders encompass complex aberrations of cognition and affect and are among the most debilitating and poorly understood of any medical condition. Current treatments rely primarily on interventions that target brain function (drugs) or learning processes (psychotherapy). A mechanistic understanding of how these interventionsmediate their therapeutic effects remains elusive. From the early 1990s, non-invasive functional neuroimaging, coupled with parallel developments in the cognitive neurosciences, seemed to signal a new era of neurobiologically grounded diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry. Yet, despite three decades of intense neuroimaging research, we still lack a neurobiological account for any psychiatric condition. Likewise, functional neuroimaging plays no role in clinical decision making. Here, we offer a critical commentary on this impasse and suggest how the field might fare better and deliver impactful neurobiological insights.

AB  - Background: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 2-7 % of children globally and is associated with a myriad of difficulties that have long-term consequences. Most children and adolescents live in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), but there are few reports and no consolidation of findings on ADHD treatment outcomes in this population. We conducted a review of ADHD treatment literature for children and adolescents living in LMICs.Methods: Studies were identified using databases (PsychoINFO, Pubmed, MEDLINER, EMBASE, Global Health, Academic Search Complete, Google Scholar). The initial search produced 139 articles. These were filtered for language, title, abstract, and full-text keyword identification to yield a final 20 articles to be included in this review. Results: Reports on outcomes of both psychological and pharmacological treatment were relatively sparse, particularly the former, which mostly referred to parent training and multimodal programs in pre-school chil-dren. Most evidence exists for the benefit of methylphenidate-IR with a few reports on other agents, including clonidine, atomoxetine, and lisdexamfetamine. Methylphenidate is the most common agent to treat ADHD in youth in LMICs. Younger age, combined subtype, and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder were associated with poorer treatment outcome.Conclusion: Access to treatment for ADHD is overall limited in LMICs and varied among individual countries. Pharmacological treatments were generally more available than psychological interventions. Several barriers including stigma, cost, and lack of resources were reported to impact treatment acceptance. More research in LMICs is needed to improve and expand mental health services in these regions.

AB  - Introduction: Spatial navigation is a complex cognitive function that declines in older age. Finding one's way around in familiar and new environments is crucial to live and function independently. However, the current literature illustrates the efficacy of spatial navigation interventions in rehabilitative contexts such as pathological aging and traumatic injury, but an overview of existing training studies for healthy older adults is missing. This scoping review aims to identify current evidence on existing spatial navigation interventions in healthy older adults and analyze their efficacy. Methods: To identify spatial navigation interventions and assessments and investigate their effectiveness, four electronic databases were searched (Pubmed, Web of Science, CINAHL and EMBASE). Two independent reviewers conducted a screening of title, abstract and full-texts and performed a quality assessment. Studies were eligible if (1) published in English, (2) the full text was accessible, (3) at least one group of healthy older adults was included with (4) mean age of 65 years or older, (5) three or more spatial navigation-related training sessions were conducted and (6) at least one spatial ability outcome was reported. Results: Ten studies were included (N = 1,003, age-range 20-95 years, 51.5% female), only healthy older adults (n = 368, mean age & GE; 65) were assessed further. Studies differed in sample size (n = 22-401), type of training, total intervention duration (100 min-50 h), and intervention period (1-16 weeks). Conclusion: The spatial navigation abilities addressed and the measures applied to elicit intervention effects varied in quantity and methodology. Significant improvements were found for at least one spatial ability-related outcome in six of 10 interventions. Two interventions achieved a non-significant positive trend, another revealed no measurable post-training improvement, and one study did not report pre-post-differences. The results indicate that different types of spatial navigation interventions improve components of spatial abilities in healthy older adults. The existing body of research does not allow conclusions on transferability of the trained components on everyday life spatial navigation performance. Future research should focus on reproducing and extending the promising approaches of available evidence. From this, valuable insights on healthy aging could emerge.

AB  - Caribbean reefs have undergone large-scale losses in coral cover in past decades, sparking a search for species that are resilient under stress. Porites astreoides has been considered a "winner" and a key player in sustaining coral cover in the Caribbean as more sensitive species struggle. However, P. astreoides has recently declined in abundance, raising concern about its status as a winner. Here, we reviewed the ecophysiology of P. astreoides in response to environmental stress to elucidate whether this species could thrive in the future of Caribbean reefs. We examined ecophysiological variables of P. astreoides related to photosynthesis, growth, recruitment, tissue condition, and microbiome in response to temperature, pH, macroalgal competition, depth, and sedimentation. Overall, P. astreoides was sensitive to environmental stress and each physiological feature showed varying levels of sensitivity. Coral-algal photosynthesis and coral tissue condition could withstand single events of thermal stress but reflected a metabolic imbalance that hinders recovery from repeated bleaching events, compromising long-term success. Colony growth was particularly vulnerable to low pH and macroalgal competition. Recruitment was unaffected, or even favored, by depth and could tolerate high temperatures, but it was sensitive to exposure to macroalgae, especially in combination with abiotic stressors. The response of the microbiome of P. astreoides to stressors is still poorly understood. In relation to other corals, P. astreoides was frequently reported as the most sensitive species in the reviewed literature. The success of P. astreoides is tightly integrated into the future of Caribbean reefs, which could be losing an old winner.

AB  - The seas confront organisms with a suite of abiotic stressors that pose challenges for physiological activity. Variations in temperature, hydrostatic pressure, and salinity have potential to disrupt structures, and functions of all molecular systems on which life depends. During evolution, sequences of nucleic acids and proteins are adaptively modified to "fit" these macromolecules for function under the particular abiotic conditions of the habitat. Complementing these macromolecular adaptations are alterations in compositions of solutions that bathe macromolecules and affect stabilities of their higher order structures. A primary result of these "micromolecular" adaptations is preservation of optimal balances between conformational rigidity and flexibility of macromolecules. Micromolecular adaptations involve several families of organic osmolytes, with varying effects on macromolecular stability. A given type of osmolyte generally has similar effects on DNA, RNA, proteins and membranes; thus, adaptive regulation of cellular osmolyte pools has a global effect on macromolecules. These effects are mediated largely through influences of osmolytes and macromolecules on water structure and activity. Acclimatory micromolecular responses are often critical in enabling organisms to cope with environmental changes during their lifetimes, for example, during vertical migration in the water column. A species' breadth of environmental tolerance may depend on how effectively it can vary the osmolyte composition of its cellular fluids in the face of stress. Micromolecular adaptations remain an under-appreciated aspect of evolution and acclimatization. Further study can lead to a better understanding of determinants of environmental tolerance ranges and to biotechnological advances in designing improved stabilizers for biological materials.

AB  - As COVID-19 becomes endemic, identifying vulnerable population groups for severe infection outcomes and defining rapid and effective preventive and therapeutic strategies remains a public health priority. We performed an umbrella review, including comprehensive studies (meta-analyses and systematic reviews) investigating COVID-19 risk for infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality in people with psychiatric disorders, and outlined evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for overcoming potential barriers that psychiatric patients may experience in preventing and managing COVID-19, and defining optimal therapeutic options and current research priorities in psychiatry. We searched Web of Science, PubMed, and Ovid/PsycINFO databases up to 17 January 2022 for the umbrella review. We synthesized evidence, extracting when available pooled odd ratio estimates for the categories "any mental disorder" and "severe mental disorders." The quality of each study was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 approach and ranking evidence quality. We identified four systematic review/meta-analysis combinations, one meta-analysis, and three systematic reviews, each including up to 28 original studies. Although we rated the quality of studies from moderate to low and the evidence ranged from highly suggestive to non-significant, we found consistent evidence that people with mental illness are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and most importantly mortality, but not of ICU admission. The risk and the burden of COVID-19 in people with mental disorders, in particular those with severe mental illness, can no longer be ignored but demands urgent targeted and persistent action. Twenty-two recommendations are proposed to facilitate this process.

AB  - Objectives: The general aim of this systematic review is to synthesize, analyze, and critically review existing studies concerning the relationship between sociodemographic, intrapersonal, and work-related factors and burnout, as well as psychological wellbeing among psychotherapists. Methodology: We performed a structured literature search utilizing the PRISMA framework in the following databases: Web of Science, Scopus, MedLine, PsyARTICLES, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. The most relevant inclusion criteria were quantitative and peer-reviewed articles published in English. Results: After the selection process, we accepted 52 articles for further systematic review. Thirty-eight studies examined burnout among psychotherapists, while the other 14 studies focused on psychological wellbeing in this sample. Conclusions; Burnout and wellbeing among psychotherapists are related to numerous sociodemographic (e.g., age, gender), intrapersonal (e.g., coping, personality), and work-related characteristics, including work settings and professional support in this profession (e.g., supervision or personal therapy). However, the high heterogeneity observed between studies in terms of burnout and wellbeing operationalization and measurement warrants more consistent and advanced methodological models of these theoretical constructs in the future in this specific sample.

AB  - Robust research continues to broaden and deepen the field's understanding of immigrants' ethnic-racial identity and mental health. We highlight opportunities to pioneer the literature by questioning "who" is meant by immigrant (clearly defining generational status, going beyond covariate and difference -based approaches, focusing on immigrants from under-studied ethnic-racial backgrounds), "what" is meant by iden-tity (ethnic/heritage/native, conjoined with multiple identities such as national, regional, politicized), "where" experiences are taking place (globalization, differences in how immigrants are defined and viewed across contexts), and the "why" or importance of continuing this work (identity as resilience against mental health risks). Targeting under-researched in-tersections among the "who-what-where-why" can build knowledge and insight for researchers and practitioners who work with immigrant families, and perhaps for immigrants themselves.

AB  - Background Attention on harmful effects of psychological interventions for adult post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has increased, yet a comprehensive meta-analysis is lacking. Aims To summarise incidences and relative risks of deterioration, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) in trials of psychological interventions for adult PTSD. Method We searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Web of Science and PTSDpubs from inception to 21 April 2022 for sufficiently large (n >= 20) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the incidence of harms. Results We included 56 RCTs (4230 patients). Incidences of harms were generally low (0-5%). Psychological interventions were associated with decreased risk of deterioration relative to passive (RR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.15-0.28) and active control conditions (RR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.92). Decreased risk was even more pronounced in sensitivity analyses on trials exclusively delivering treatments face to face. When compared with other psychological interventions, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) was associated with decreased risk of SAEs (RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.95) and with no differential risk of deterioration and AEs. Conclusions The current evidence base suggests that psychological interventions are safe for most adults with PTSD. In none of the analyses were psychological interventions associated with an increased risk of harm compared with control conditions. TF-CBT was found at least as safe as other psychological interventions. Individual face-to-face delivery might be the safest delivery format. However, more data are needed to draw firmer conclusions. We encourage research teams to routinely and thoroughly assess and report the incidence of harms and their causes.

AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children and adolescents, is typically managed with medications which are associated with negative side effects. Therefore, non-pharmacological treatments, such as physical activity, are an attractive option. The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the effects of acute physical activity on cognition in children and adolescents with ADHD. A comprehensive search of three literature databases yielded 14 studies for inclusion. An overall meta -analysis was conducted alongside sub-group analyses for cognitive domain, physical activity characteristics, and timing of cognitive measurements. Results revealed a small beneficial effect of physical activity on cognitive function (SMD = 0.18, [0.12,0.25], p < 0.01). Sub-group analyses revealed beneficial effects of physical activity on the domains of cognitive flexibility (SMD = 0.21, [0.09,0.32], p < 0.01), attention (SMD = 0.20, [0.09,0.32], p = 0.001), and inhibitory control (SMD = 0.18, [0.03,0.33], p = 0.02), but not memory (p = 0.87). Cognitive benefits also differed depending on physical activity duration (< 10 min, p = 0.27; 11-20 min, SMD = 0.23, [0.14,0.31], p < 0.01; > 20 min, SMD = 0.13, [-0.00,0.26], p = 0.05), and modality (running, SMD = 0.21, [0.12,0.29], p < 0.01; 'other', SMD = 0.39, [0.18,0.61], p < 0.01; cycling, p = 0.35), and the timing of cognitive measurement following physical activity (immediately, SMD = 0.17, [-0.01,0.35], p = 0.06; 2-10 min, SMD = 0.21, [0.12,0.30], p < 0.01; > 10 min, SMD = 0.19, [-0.09,0.47], p = 0.19). Overall, physical activity has a positive acute effect on subsequent cognition in children and adolescents with ADHD, though effects may be domain specific and influenced by the duration and modality of physical activity. These findings have practical implications for those interested in using physical activity to enhance cognition in children and adolescents with ADHD.

AB  - Objectives: Previous studies have evaluated the effects of probiotic/prebiotic/synbiotic supplementation on blood glucose profiles among diabetic patients. However, the results were inconsistent. Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic searching from PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Central was conducted to identify high-quality clinical trials investigating the effect of probiotic/prebiotic/synbiotic supplementation on blood glucose profiles [including fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)] up to December 2020. Subgroup analyses by types or durations of probiotic/prebiotic/synbiotic supplementation were con-ducted to investigate the different effects among different populations. Results: A total of 39 trials with 3517 participants were included in the final analyses. Among patients with type II diabetes (T2DM), the summarized standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confi-dential intervals (95% CIs) of FBG, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR were-0.30 (95% CI:-0.65 to 0.05),-0.59 (95% CI:-0.88 to-0.30), and-0.68 (95% CI:-1.13 to-0.23), respectively. Among patients with gestational diabetes (GDM), the summary SMDs of FBG, HbA1c and HOMA-IR were-0.67 (95% CI:-1.23 to-0.11),-0.24 (95% CI:-0.57 to 0.08), and-1.06 (95% CI:-1.72 to-0.40), respectively. Similar im-provements in blood glucose profiles were also found among persons with prediabetes or gestational woman with normal glucose, but not among patients with type I diabetes. Subgroup analyses showed similar results of probiotic supplementation for patients with T2DM and probiotic/synbiotic supple-mentation for patients with GDM. Conclusion: Probiotic/prebiotic/synbiotic supplementation might improve the blood glucose profiles among patients with T2DM/GDM, persons with prediabetes, or gestational woman with normal glucose. Trials with more sophisticated design are needed to validate the results in the future. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42020161975.
