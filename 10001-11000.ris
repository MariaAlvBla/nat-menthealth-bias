AB  - Diabetes has become common lifestyle disorder associated with obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Environmental factors like physical inactivity, polluted surroundings and unhealthy dieting also plays a vital role in diabetes pathogenesis. As the current anti-diabetic drugs possess unprecedented side effects, traditional herbal medicine can be used an alternative therapy. The paramount challenge with the herbal formulation usage is the lack of standardized procedure, entangled with little knowledge on drug safety and mechanism of drug action. Heavy metal contamination is a major environmental hazard where plants tend to accumulate toxic metals like nickel, chromium and lead through industrial and agricultural activities. It becomes inappropriate to use these plants for phytotherapy as it may affect the human health on long term consumption. This review discuss about the environmental risk factors related to diabetes and better implication of medicinal plants in anti-diabetic therapy using network pharmacology. It is an in silico analytical tool that helps to unravel the multi-targeted action of herbal formulations rich in secondary metabolites. Also, a special focus is attempted to pool the databases regarding the medicinal plants for diabetes and associated diseases, their bioactive compounds, possible diabetic targets, drug-target interaction and toxicology reports that may open an aisle in safer, effective and toxicity-free drug discovery.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the ability of nonpharmacologic adjuvant interventions to alleviate pain in male patients during flexible cystoscopy (FC) under local anesthesia. Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched to identify eligible clinical trials from inception to 31 December 2020, with no language restrictions. Two independent reviewers used Cochrane Collaboration tools to assess the selection criteria, methodological rigor and risk of bias. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14.2. Results: In total, 717 studies were initially identified, and fourteen randomized controlled trials were ultimately included. We observed that patients who underwent FC with higher irrigation pressures had significantly lower pain scores on the visual analog scale than their counterparts with lower irrigation pressure during FC (weight mean difference (WMD): -1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.72 to -1.14) with no between-study heterogeneity (p = 0.661). There were no significant differences in pain between immediate or delayed FC groups under the same local anesthetic (standard mean difference (SMD): -0.19; 95% CI: -0.39 to 0.01). A pooled analysis of three studies including 340 male patients showed that men who observed the cystoscopy on the monitor had significantly lower pain ratings compared to those who did not view the operation on the monitor (SMD: -0.64; 95% CI: -1.14 to -0.15). Two studies, including a total of 272 patients, assessed the influence of listening to music on pain and anxiety in male patients during FC. Our meta-analysis found that music significantly improved patient pain (WMD: -0.92; 95% CI: -1.29 to -0.54). Hand-holding and urination during FC also relieved pain and anxiety in male patients undergoing FC. Conclusions: We observed that elevated irrigation pressure, real-time cystoscopy visualization, and music therapy alleviated pain in male patients undergoing FC. Well-designed trials are needed to confirm our findings.

AB  - Phosphate-solubilizing microbes (PSMs) drive the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus (P) and hold promise for sustainable agriculture. However, their global distribution, overall diversity and application potential remain unknown. Here, we present the first synthesis of their biogeography, diversity and utility, employing data from 399 papers published between 1981 and 2017, the results of a nationwide field survey in China consisting of 367 soil samples, and a genetic analysis of 12986 genome-sequenced prokaryotic strains. We show that at continental to global scales, the population density of PSMs in environmental samples is correlated with total P rather than pH. Remarkably, positive relationships exist between the population density of soil PSMs and available P, nitrate-nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon in soil, reflecting functional couplings between PSMs and microbes driving biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and carbon. More than 2704 strains affiliated with at least nine archaeal, 88 fungal and 336 bacterial species were reported as PSMs. Only 2.59% of these strains have been tested for their efficiencies in improving crop growth or yield under field conditions, providing evidence that PSMs are more likely to exert positive effects on wheat growing in alkaline P-deficient soils. Our systematic genetic analysis reveals five promising PSM genera deserving much more attention.

AB  - The movements an organism makes provide insights into its internal states and motives. This principle is the foundation of the new field of computational ethology, which links rich automatic measurements of natural behaviors to motivational states and neural activity. Computational ethology has proven transformative for animal behavioral neuroscience. This success raises the question of whether rich automatic measurements of behavior can similarly drive progress in human neuroscience and psychology. New technologies for capturing and analyzing complex behaviors in real and virtual environments enable us to probe the human brain during naturalistic dynamic interactions with the environment that so far were beyond experimental investigation. Inspired by nonhuman computational ethology, we explore how these new tools can be used to test important questions in human neuroscience. We argue that application of this methodology will help human neuroscience and psychology extend limited behavioral measurements such as reaction time and accuracy, permit novel insights into how the human brain produces behavior, and ultimately reduce the growing measurement gap between human and animal neuroscience.

First, we introduce and discuss the search for plausible causal pathways that link the end of marriage to distal health outcomes. Second, we suggest that the socioeconomic status disruptions that follow divorce represent a plausible causal pathway and emphasize the need for more psychological science in this area of study. Although there is substantial literature that demonstrates that divorced adults, especially divorced women, experience significant financial disruptions, the research in this area remains broad and largely the province of family sociology and demography. Research is needed to better understand adults' psychological and behavioral responses to changes in their financial situation after the end of marriage.

AB  - Background: Insomnia is one of the common problems in patients with maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Previous studies have reported the beneficial effects of auricular acupressure (AA) for insomnia in patients with MHD. This study aimed to critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of AA for insomnia in patients with MHD. Methods: Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database, Wanfang Data, Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were systematically searched from inception to April 30, 2020, to identify any eligible randomized controlled trials. MHD patients with insomnia were included regardless of age, gender, nationality, or race. The experimental interventions included AA alone or AA combined with other therapies. The control interventions included placebo, no treatment, or other therapies. The primary outcome was sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RevMan 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Eight studies involving 618 participants were included for statistical analysis. A meta-analysis showed no significant difference of PSQI global score after 8 weeks of AA treatment compared with estazolam (p = 0.70). Other narrative analyses revealed that PSQI global score was significantly attenuated after AA treatment in comparison with mental health education (p = 0.03, duration of 4 weeks; p = 0.02, duration of 8 weeks), AA plus routine nursing care compared with routine nursing care alone (p < 0.0001), and AA plus footbath compared with footbath alone (p = 0.01), respectively. A meta-analysis showed that AA could significantly increase the response rate (reduction of PSQI global score by 25% and more) in comparison with estazolam (p = 0.01). Other narrative analyses reported that the response rate was significantly increased after AA treatment compared with sham AA (p = 0.02), AA compared with mental health education (p = 0.04), and AA plus routine nursing care compared with routine nursing care alone (p = 0.0003), respectively. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that AA may be an alternative treatment for insomnia in patients with MHD. However, more large-scale, high-quality trials are still warranted to confirm these outcomes.

AB  - Background The coverage of postpartum care is not ideal, and has not been used very well due to not enough attention being paid to the puerperal women and newborns, especially in developing countries. Practice guidelines on postpartum care provide beneficial practice guidance and help to reduce maternal mortality. However, little is known about the credibility and consistency of those guidelines. This systematic review was conducted to summarize main postpartum care indications and appraise methodological quality of guidelines. Methods Seven literature databases and guideline development institutions and organizations of obstetrics and maternity care were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed guideline quality using the AGREE II instrument, and synthesized consistent and non-consistent recommendations using the content analysis approach. Results Twenty-nine guidelines were included and a total of eight postpartum care indications were identified. Most guidelines focused on care indications and interventions including exclusive breastfeeding, maternal nutrition, home visit, infant or newborn care and sexuality, contraception, and birth spacing. However, indications such as pain or weight management, pelvic floor muscle training, abdominal rehabilitation, and mental health got less attention. Additionally, the overall quality of all involving postpartum care guidelines is relatively good and acceptable. Conclusions Guidelines developed by NICE, RANO, and WHO indicated higher methodological quality. For postpartum care indications, most guidelines are incomplete. Variation in practice guidelines for postpartum care recommendations exists. In the future, implementation research into shared decision-making, as well as further high-quality research to broaden the evidence base for postpartum care indications is recommended.

AB  - Background Outbreaks of zoonotic diseases that transmit between animals and humans, against a backdrop of increasing levels of forced migration, present a major challenge to global public health. This review provides an overview of the currently available evidence of how displacement may affect zoonotic disease and pathogen transmission, with the aim to better understand how to protect health and resilience of displaced and host populations. Methods A systematic review was conducted aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Between December 2019 - February 2020, PubMed, Web of Science, PLoS, ProQuest, Science Direct and JSTOR were searched for literature. Studies were included based on a focus on zoonotic disease risks in displacement and/or humanitarian emergencies, and relevance in terms of livestock dependency of the displaced populations. Evidence was synthesised in form of a table and thematic analysis. Results Of all records, 78 papers were selected for inclusion. Among the included studies, the majority were based on secondary data, including literature reviews (n=43) and case studies (n=5), while the majority of papers covered wide geographical areas such as the Global South (n=17) and Africa (n=20). The review shows significant gaps in the literature, which is specifically lacking primary data on zoonotic diseases in displacement. Risk factors for the transmission of zoonoses in displacement are based on generic infectious disease risks, which include the loss of health services, increased population density, changes in environment, reduced quality of living conditions and socio-economic factors. Regardless of the presence of these disease drivers during forced migration however, there is little evidence of large-scale zoonotic disease outbreaks linked directly to livestock in displacement. Conclusion Due to the lack of primary research, the complex interlinkages of factors affecting zoonotic pathogen transmission in displacement remain unclear. While the presence of animals may increase the burden of zoonotic pathogens, maintaining access to livestock may improve livelihoods, nutrition and mental health, with the potential to reduce people's vulnerability to disease. Further primary interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral research is urgently required to address the evidence gaps identified in this review to support policy and program development.

AB  - Social interactions can trigger emotional contagion between individuals resulting in behavioral synchrony. Emotional contagion can be a very effective and attractive strategy in communication and advertising, and understanding the mechanisms underlying emotional contagion can help marketers to improve their commercial approaches or develop better ones. The purpose of this study is to review and classify the various methodologies and theoretical approaches on emotional contagion, identify the best practices in this domain, and identify ways of gaging and measuring emotional contagion. The study is based on a mini literature review. We identify different mechanisms and approaches to emotional contagion described in the literature. Emotional contagion can be triggered by facial expressions, indirect human interactions, and/or by observing other people's behavior in direct and indirect interactions. Furthermore, emotional contagion can be triggered physiologically or neurologically by synchronizing with the emotional state of others during human interactions. Regarding the assessment and measurement of emotional contagion, we argue that methods based on neuroscience tools are much more accurate and effective than methods based on traditional research approaches. The study identifies guidelines for research on commercial communication through emotional contagion that can be especially interesting for academia and marketing practitioners. The findings are important for field marketers interested in developing new individualized approaches in their commercial strategies and marketing in general. In addition, the study can become the basis of research that further refines and compares the efficacy of the various techniques and tools involved.

AB  - Extracellular adenosine is produced with increased metabolic activity or stress, acting as a paracrine signal of cellular effort. Adenosine receptors are most abundant in the brain, where adenosine acts through inhibitory A(1) receptors to decrease activity/noise and through facilitatory A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R) to promote plastic changes in physiological conditions. By bolstering glutamate excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation, A(2A)R also contribute to synaptic and neuronal damage, as heralded by the neuroprotection afforded by the genetic or pharmacological blockade of A(2A)R in animal models of ischemia, traumatic brain injury, convulsions/epilepsy, repeated stress or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases. A(2A)R overfunction is not only necessary for the expression of brain damage but is actually sufficient to trigger brain dysfunction in the absence of brain insults or other disease triggers. Furthermore, A(2A)R overfunction seems to be an early event in the demise of brain diseases, which involves an increased formation of ATP-derived adenosine and an up-regulation of A(2A)R. This prompts the novel hypothesis that the evaluation of A(2A)R density in afflicted brain circuits may become an important biomarker of susceptibility and evolution of brain diseases once faithful PET ligands are optimized. Additional relevant biomarkers would be measuring the extracellular ATP and/or adenosine levels with selective dyes, to identify stressed regions in the brain. A(2A)R display several polymorphisms in humans and preliminary studies have associated different A(2A)R polymorphisms with altered morphofunctional brain endpoints associated with neuropsychiatric diseases. This further prompts the interest in exploiting A(2A)R polymorphic analysis as an ancillary biomarker of susceptibility/evolution of brain diseases.

AB  - Background: Over 250 million children in low- and middle-income countries are at risk of not achieving their fullest developmental potential due to co-occurring risks such as poor nutrition and inadequate learning opportunities. Early intervention programs integrating the aspects of nurturing care, that is, good health, adequate nutrition, safety and security, responsive caregiving, and learning opportunities, may ameliorate against the negative impact of these adverse conditions.
   Methods: This meta-analytic review updates the evidence base of parenting interventions comprising stimulation and responsive caregiving components on developmental outcomes for children under age 2 years in low- and middle-income countries. It also describes and assesses the moderation effects of population characteristics and implementation features on the intervention effectiveness. Studies were identified based on previous systematic reviews and an updated literature search in eight databases and the gray literature up to December 2020. A random-effect model was used to explore the pooled effect sizes accounted for by the intervention for developmental outcome of cognition, language, motor, and social-emotional capacities. Exploratory moderation analyses were also conducted.
   Results: Twenty-one randomized controlled trials representing over 10,400 children from 12 low- and middle-income countries and regions across three continents (Africa, Latin America, and Asia) were identified. The interventions showed overall small-to-moderate effects on children's cognitive development (ES = 0.44; 95% CI = [0.30, 0.57]); language development (ES = 0.33; 95% CI = [0.18, 0.49]); and motor skills (ES = 0.21; 95% CI = [0.10, 0.32]). The overall effect on social-emotional development was non-significant (ES = 0.17; 95% CI = [-0.01, 0.34]). Effect sizes (ES) varied significantly across the studies. Parenting programs that targeted vulnerable groups, including rural communities and caregivers with lower education levels, had more significant effects on children's development. Group sessions (vs. individual visits) and high program dose (>= 12 sessions) were also associated with stronger effects on child development. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of the workforce and training on programmatic outcomes.
   Conclusion: The findings indicate that parenting interventions that encourage nurturing care are effective in improving the early development of children, especially among vulnerable populations. We discuss opportunities to strengthen the implementation of research-based parenting interventions in such contexts.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are organophosphate pesticides, which interrupt the chemicals involved in the endocrine system and cause lifelong disorders in women's reproductive system. The current study was designed to systematically evaluate the association between GBH exposure and the female reproductive tract. According to PRISMA Guidelines, the systematic review was performed, searching online databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus, throughout April 2020. Studies with Rodent, lamb, and fish or exposed to GBH to affect the female reproductive system were selected. All studies were in the English language. Two investigators independently assessed the articles. The first author's name, publication date, animal model, age, sample size, gender, dose, duration, and route of exposure and outcomes were extracted from each publication. The present review summarizes 14 publications on uterus alterations and oocytes, histological changes ovary, and assessed mRNA expression, protein expression, serum levels progesterone, and estrogen and intracellular Reaction Oxygen Species (ROS) in rodents, fish, and lamb exposed to GHB exposure. Most of the studies reported histological changes in ovarian and uterus tissue, alterations in serum levels, and increased oxidative stress level following exposure to GBH. Additionally, due to alterations in the reproductive systems (e.g., histomorphological changes, reduction of the mature follicles, higher atretic follicles, and interstitial fibrosis), it seems the GBH-induced female these alterations are both dose- and time-dependent. The present findings support an association between GBH exposure and female reproductive system diseases. However, more studies are needed to identify the mechanisms disrupting the effects of GBH and their underlying mechanisms. Considering the current literature, it is recommended that further investigations be focused on the possible effects of various pesticides on the human reproductive system.

AB  - Worldwide, water resources have an impact on all forms of life as lotic systems are networks that interconnect water resources and land. They are important for navigation, water supplies, agriculture, recreation, and industrial development and help to regulate changes in climate and support social, spiritual, educational, and ecosystem health services. These ecosystems are, however, facing both natural and anthropogenic threats. Anthropogenic threats are driven by population increase, economic development, and catchment degradation. They are now the most threatened resources worldwide, and in Africa in particular. To design proper management strategies, the causes and impacts of the threats must be properly diagnosed. Monitoring and assessment approaches that show degradation and integrate it over time are essential to generate data and information required by water managers for decision making. Biomonitoring using macroinvertebrates is an effective tool in this regard, because it integrates causes of degradation and aquatic biotic responses to the impacts thereof. This review summarises the needs, challenges, and legal implications of biomonitoring in Africa using lessons from countries with successful biomonitoring as benchmarks.

AB  - Degenerative diseases alter brain activity and functional connectivity. In this issue of the Neuroscience Letters, Yin and others (2021) [6] present data showing increased activity in lobules VIII and IX of the cerebellar vermis in Parkinson's patients with visuospatial disorders. The study refines the fMRI mapping of the cerebellum, but the functional interpretation of the findings remains complex. The architecture and connectivity of the cerebellum set it apart from the rest of the brain and should be considered when interpreting the functional connectivity data. In degenerative diseases, the cerebellum suffers from the same pathology as the cerebral cortex; hence, it is unlikely that changes in the cerebellum could ameliorate clinical symptoms in degenerative diseases. Clinical, surgical data indicate that the primary function of the cerebellum is motor, not cognition or affective. The cerebellar anatomy buttresses these observations. The cerebellum receives direct motor-related inputs but no direct information from the sensory system. Hence, it likely contributes to the behavioral components of emotions and cognition.

AB  - Monitoring of chemicals in the aquatic environment by chemical analysis alone cannot completely assess and predict the effects of chemicals on aquatic species and ecosystems. This is primarily because of the increasing number of (unknown) chemical stressors and mixture effects present in the environment. In addition, the ability of ecological indices to identify underlying stressors causing negative ecological effects is limited. Therefore, additional complementary methods are needed that can address the biological effects in a direct manner and provide a link to chemical exposure, i.e. (eco)toxicological tests. (Eco)toxicological tests are defined as test systems that expose biological components (cells, individuals, populations, communities) to (environmental mixtures of) chemicals to register biological effects. These tests measure responses at the sub-organismal (biomarkers and in vitro bioassays), whole-organismal, population, or community level. We performed a literature search to obtain a state-of-the-art overview of ecotoxicological tests available for assessing impacts of chemicals to aquatic biota and to reveal datagaps. In total, we included 509 biomarkers, 207 in vitro bioassays, 422 tests measuring biological effects at the whole-organismal level, and 78 tests at the population- community- and ecosystem-level. Tests at the whole-organismal level and biomarkers were most abundant for invertebrates and fish, whilst in vitro bioassays are mostly based on mammalian cell lines. Tests at the community- and ecosystem-level were almost missing for organisms other than microorganisms and algae. In addition, we provide an overview of the various extrapolation challenges faced in using data from these tests and suggest some forward looking perspectives.Although extrapolating the measured responses to relevant protection goals remains challenging, the combination of ecotoxicological experiments and models is key for a more comprehensive assessment of the effects of chemical stressors to aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an established form of neuromodulation with a long history of promising applications. Earliest reports of VNS in the literature date to the late 1800's in experiments conducted by Dr. James Corning. Over the past century, both invasive and non-invasive VNS have demonstrated promise in treating a variety of disorders, including epilepsy, depression, and post-stroke motor rehabilitation. As VNS continues to rapidly grow in popularity and application, the field generally lacks a consensus on optimum stimulation parameters. Stimulation parameters have a significant impact on the efficacy of neuromodulation, and here we will describe the longitudinal evolution of VNS parameters in the following categorical progression: (1) animal models, (2) epilepsy, (3) treatment resistant depression, (4) neuroplasticity and rehabilitation, and (5) transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS). We additionally offer a historical perspective of the various applications and summarize the range and most commonly used parameters in over 130 implanted and non-invasive VNS studies over five applications.

AB  - BackgroundNatural disasters are increasingly affecting a larger segment of the world's population. These highly disruptive events have the potential to produce negative changes in social dynamics and the environment which increase violence against children. We do not currently have a comprehensive understanding of how natural disasters lead to violence against children despite the growing threat to human populations and the importance of violence as a public health issue. The mapping of pathways to violence is critical in designing targeted and evidence-based prevention services for children. We systematically reviewed peer-reviewed articles and grey literature to document the pathways between natural disasters and violence against children and to suggest how this information could be used in the design of future programming.MethodsWe searched 15 bibliographic databases and six grey literature repositories from the earliest date of publication to May 16, 2018. In addition, we solicited grey literature from humanitarian agencies globally that implement child-focused programming after natural disasters. Peer-reviewed articles and grey literature that presented original quantitative or qualitative evidence on how natural disasters led to violence against children were included. The authors synthesized the evidence narratively and used thematic analysis with a constant comparative method to articulate pathways to violence.ResultsWe identified 6276 unduplicated publications. Nine peer-reviewed articles and 17 grey literature publications met the inclusion criteria. The literature outlined five pathways between natural disasters and violence, including: (i) environmentally induced changes in supervision, accompaniment, and child separation; (ii) transgression of social norms in post-disaster behavior; (iii) economic stress; (iv) negative coping with stress; and (v) insecure shelter and living conditions.ConclusionsService providers would benefit from systematic documentation to a high-quality standard of all possible pathways to violence in tailoring programming after natural disasters. The identified pathways in this review provide a foundation for designing targeted prevention services. In addition, the positive coping strategies within certain affected families and communities can be leveraged in implementing strength-based approaches to violence prevention.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have profound mental health impact, including in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region. Some populations might be at higher risk of experiencing negative mental health impacts and may encounter increased barriers to accessing mental health care. The pandemic and related restrictions have led to changes in care delivery, including a rapid shift to the use of e-mental health and digital technologies. It is therefore essential to consider needs and opportunities for equitable mental health care delivery to the most at-risk populations. This rapid scoping review: 1) identifies populations in the APEC region that are at higher risk of the negative mental health impacts of COVID-19, 2) identifies needs and gaps in access to standard and e-mental health care among these populations, and 3) explores the potential of e-mental health to address these needs. Methods We conducted a rapid scoping review following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We searched Medline, Embase and PsychInfo databases and Google Scholar using a search strategy developed in consultation with a biomedical librarian. We included records related to mental health or psychosocial risk factors and COVID-19 among at-risk groups; that referred to one or more APEC member economies or had a global, thus generalizable, scope; English language papers, and papers with full text available. Results A total of 132 records published between December 2019 and August 2020 were included in the final analysis. Several priority at-risk populations, risk factors, challenges and recommendations for standard and e-mental health care were identified. Results demonstrate that e-mental health care can be a viable option for care delivery but that specific accessibility and acceptability considerations must be considered. Options for in-person, hybrid or "low-tech" care must also remain available. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for equitable standard and e-mental health care. It has also highlighted the persistent social and structural inequities that contribute to poor mental health. The APEC region is vast and diverse; findings from the region can guide policy and practice in the delivery of equitable mental health care in the region and beyond.

AB  - Microorganisms that survive in extreme environmental conditions are known as 'extremophiles'. Recently, extremophiles draw an impression in biotechnology/pharmaceutical researches/industries because of their novel molecules, known as 'extremolytes'. The intriguing phenomenon of microbial radiation resistance probably arose independently throughout their evolution of selective pressures (e.g. UV, X-ray, Gamma radiation etc.). Radia-tion produces multiple types of damage/oxidation to nucleic acids, proteins and other crucial cellular compo-nents. Most of the literature on microbial radiation resistance is based on acute gamma-irradiation experiments performed in the laboratory, typically involving pure cultures isolation and their application on bioremediation/ therapeutic field. There is much less information other than bioremediation and therapeutic application of such promising microbes we called as 'new era'. Here we discus origin and diversity of radiation resistance bacteria as well as selective mechanisms by which microorganisms can sustain in radiation rich environment. Potential uses of these radiations resistant microbes in the field of bioremediation, bioactive compounds and therapeutic in-dustry. Last but not the least, which is the new aspect of radiation resistance microbes. Our review suggest that resistance to chronic radiation is not limited to rare specialized strains from extreme environments, but can occur among common microbial taxa, perhaps due to overlap molecular mechanisms of resistance to radiation and other stressors. These stress tolerance potential make them potential for radionuclides remediation, their extremolytes can be useful as anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative agents. In current scenario they can be useful in various fields from natural dye synthesis to nanoparticles production and anti-cancer treatment.

AB  - Employment is a valued occupation that offers a sense of meaning, identity, and belonging. For people with severe and enduring mental illness, employment has also been associated with personal recovery and decreased use of mental health services. However, this population continues to be underrepresented in the labor market. Sustainable employment is often challenging for people with severe and enduring mental illness, due to a combination of personal, organizational and systemic issues. While Individual Placement and Support is an evidence-based model of employment support known to improve job attainment for people with mental illness, job retention and sustained workforce participation continue to be challenges. This narrative literature review was undertaken to address the question: "What vocational service models and approaches improve job tenure for this population?" CinAHL, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library were searched for the period 2005-2020, using key terms and subject headings, including "severe mental illness," "psychiatric disabilit*," "job tenure," and "job retention." Several adjunct interventions may enhance job retention, including skills training, cognitive interventions, psychological interventions, and supported education, while social firms offer a different approach focused on creating new, sustainable job opportunities. Peer support and support from family and friends also appear to be important, and emerging evidence suggests that employment specialist practices, technology, self-management, and workplace accommodations may each also influence job tenure. Service providers could make more use of these non-clinical vocational approaches to improve employment retention for people with severe and enduring mental illness.

AB  - Different styles of social interaction are one of the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Social differences among individuals with ASD often include difficulty in discerning the emotions of neurotypical people based on their facial expressions. This review first covers the rich body of literature studying differences in facial emotion recognition (FER) in those with ASD, including behavioral studies and neurological findings. In particular, we highlight subtle emotion recognition and various factors related to inconsistent findings in behavioral studies of FER in ASD. Then, we discuss the dual problem of FER - namely facial emotion expression (FEE) or the production of facial expressions of emotion. Despite being less studied, social interaction involves both the ability to recognize emotions and to produce appropriate facial expressions. How others perceive facial expressions of emotion in those with ASD has remained an under-researched area. Finally, we propose a method for teaching FER [FER teaching hierarchy (FERTH)] based on recent research investigating FER in ASD, considering the use of posed vs. genuine emotions and static vs. dynamic stimuli. We also propose two possible teaching approaches: (1) a standard method of teaching progressively from simple drawings and cartoon characters to more complex audio-visual video clips of genuine human expressions of emotion with context clues or (2) teaching in a field of images that includes posed and genuine emotions to improve generalizability before progressing to more complex audio-visual stimuli. Lastly, we advocate for autism interventionists to use FER stimuli developed primarily for research purposes to facilitate the incorporation of well-controlled stimuli to teach FER and bridge the gap between intervention and research in this area.

AB  - Objectives: Emergency departments (EDs) currently face a widely acknowledged issue of workplace violence (WPV) against healthcare workers (HCWs). WPV in the ED occurs in different forms and from different types of instigators; its prevalence also varies in different regions of the world. This study investigates the incidence of WPV among ED staff and identifies the types of instigators involved.
   Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: Using PubMed and SCOPUS databases, a search for WPV against ED physicians and nurses was conducted, yielding 301 articles. Studies were excluded if measuring violence between HCWs or against prehospital personnel. Studies assessing WPV not in the ED, such as domestic violence that occurred before arrival to the ED, and studies investigating violence involving alcohol/drug use or individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis were also excluded. This study used a random-effects meta-analysis to examine the prevalence of WPV in the ED, including types of violence, instigators, and professions of the victims.
   Results: In total, 26 articles were selected for this study. There were 9072 cases of WPV in the ED; 6575 (72%) cases involved verbal violence and 1639 (18%) related to physical abuse. Among the ED workers involved, 2112 (36.5%) were physicians, 3225 (55.7%) were nurses and 455 (7.8%) other ED staff. There were 2578 instigators, of whom 1340 (52%) were family members, 700 (27%) were patients and 538 (21%) were other relatives/friends. The overall prevalence of verbal violence was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.82, I-2 = 87%), suggesting 77% of ED staff reported exposure to WPV. The prevalence of violence from patients as instigators was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.18-31, I-2 = 93%).
   Conclusions: WPV in the ED is a serious issue as most nurses and physicians are significantly exposed to verbal and/or physical abuse. Further studies should focus on factors influencing the different types of WPV, which ED professions are most at risk and interventions to prevent WPV in the ED.

AB  - Global climate change is a key driver of change in coastal waters with clear effects on biological communities and marine ecosystems. Human activities in combination with climate change exert a tremendous pressure on marine ecosystems and threaten their integrity, structure, and functioning. The protection of these ecosystems is a major target of the 14th United Nations sustainable development goal "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development." However, due to the complexity of processes and interactions of stressors, the status assessment of ecosystems remains a challenge. Holistic food web models, including biological and environmental data, could provide a suitable basis to assess ecosystem health. Here, we review climate change impacts on different trophic levels of coastal ecosystems ranging from plankton to ecologically and economically important fish and shellfish species. Furthermore, we show different food web model approaches, their advantages and limitations. To effectively manage coastal ecosystems, we need both a detailed knowledge base of each trophic level and a holistic modeling approach for assessment and prediction of future scenarios on food web-scales. A new model approach with a seamless coupling of physical ocean models and food web models could provide a future tool for guiding ecosystem-based management.

AB  - The cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration remain poorly defined. Recent clinical trial failures, difficult diagnosis, uncertain etiology, and lack of curative therapies prompted us to re-examine other hypotheses of neurodegenerative pathogenesis. Recent reports establish that mitochondrial and calcium dysregulation occur early in many neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and others. However, causal molecular evidence of mitochondrial and metabolic contributions to pathogenesis remains insufficient. Here we summarize the data supporting the hypothesis that mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction result from diverse etiologies of neuropathology. We provide a current and comprehensive review of the literature and interpret that defective mitochondrial metabolism is upstream and primary to protein aggregation and other dogmatic hypotheses of NDDs. Finally, we identify gaps in knowledge and propose therapeutic modulation of Ca-m(2+) exchange and mitochondrial function to alleviate metabolic impairments and treat NDDs.

AB  - This article presents a current knowledge synthesis of empirical studies on cross-cultural psychotherapy since 1980. Guided by a critical review framework, our search in seven relevant databases generated 80 studies published in English. Main themes are organized into (1) therapists' cultural competence (n = 46); (2) therapy process in cross-cultural dyads (n = 22); and (3) cross-cultural differences in gender, sexual orientation, or social class (n = 12). Compared to previous reviews on cross-cultural psychotherapy, the findings of this review highlight a broad range of methodological rigor in both quantitative and qualitative studies. Most studies examined actual therapy participants rather than participants in analog studies, thus emulating more therapy-near experiences in cross-cultural psychotherapy research. Also, several studies explored cross-cultural compositions beyond racial and ethnic majority therapist-minority client dyads, and included therapists of color as the participants, exploring reverse power dynamics in therapy and giving voices to foreign-born therapists. The therapy process research provides rich and full descriptions around the dynamic and interactional therapy process in cross-cultural dyads, which can be used to foster cultural sensitivities among therapists in their practice and training. We discuss the limitations of the studies included in the review and its implications for psychotherapy practice, training, and future research.

AB  - People with neurodevelopmental disorders are often considered unsuitable or incapable of working in open employment. When employment is available, tasks are often limited, and opportunities for career development are restricted. Policy and funding constraints leave people with disabilities without an opportunity to develop skills due to the additional time and costs for employers. To overcome these barriers, virtual environments have been proposed as a safe and reliable solution for training. An important prerequisite for a wider uptake of training in virtual environments are demonstrations that the training leads to improved performance in the real world. This is particularly true for people with neurodevelopmental disorders, as transferring learnings from one context to another can be challenging. A systematic review was conducted to assess whether training in virtual environments can be used to improve real-world vocational skills in people with neurodevelopmental disorders. After a systematic search in six databases, eight out of the initially identified 1,806 articles met the inclusion criteria. The findings from these eight studies demonstrate that people with neurodevelopmental disorders can transfer vocational skills from virtual environments to real-world settings. With substantial technological improvements, a surge in accessibility, and improved affordability, there is a need to build upon the promising results identified in this review.

AB  - Introduction The claustrum is a structure involved in formation of several cortical and subcortical neural microcircuits which may be involved in such functions as conscious sensations and rewarding behavior. The claustrum is regarded as a multi-modal information processing network. Pathology of the claustrum is seen in certain neurological disorders. To date, there are not enough comprehensive studies that contain accurate information regarding involvement of the claustrum in development of neurological disorders. Objective Our review aims to provide an update on claustrum anatomy, ontogenesis, cytoarchitecture, neural networks and their functional relation to the incidence of neurological diseases. Materials and methods A literature review was conducted using the Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI MedLine, and eLibrary databases. Results Despite new methods that have made it possible to study the claustrum at the molecular, genetic and epigenetic levels, its functions and connectivity are still poorly understood. The anatomical location, relatively uniform cytoarchitecture, and vast network of connections suggest a divergent role of the claustrum in integration and processing of input information and formation of coherent perceptions. Several studies have shown changes in the appearance, structure and volume of the claustrum in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism, schizophrenia, and depressive disorders. Taking into account the structure, ontogenesis, and functions of the claustrum, this literature review offers insight into understanding the crucial role of this structure in brain function and behavior.

AB  - Previous research has shown the value of the sense of embodiment, i.e., being able to integrate objects into one's bodily self-representation, and its connection to (assistive) robotics. Especially, tactile interfaces seem essential to integrate assistive robots into one's body model. Beyond functional feedback, such as tactile force sensing, the human sense of touch comprises specialized nerves for affective signals, which transmit positive sensations during slow and low-force tactile stimulations. Since these signals are extremely relevant for body experience as well as social and emotional contacts but scarcely considered in recent assistive devices, this review provides a requirement analysis to consider affective touch in engineering design. By analyzing quantitative and qualitative information from engineering, cognitive psychology, and neuroscienctific research, requirements are gathered and structured. The resulting requirements comprise technical data such as desired motion or force/torque patterns and an evaluation of potential stimulation modalities as well as their relations to overall user experience, e.g., pleasantness and realism of the sensations. This review systematically considers the very specific characteristics of affective touch and the corresponding parts of the neural system to define design goals and criteria. Based on the analysis, design recommendations for interfaces mediating affective touch are derived. This includes a consideration of biological principles and human perception thresholds which are complemented by an analysis of technical possibilities. Finally, we outline which psychological factors can be satisfied by the mediation of affective touch to increase acceptance of assistive devices and outline demands for further research and development.

AB  - Implementation science is concerned with the study of adoption, implementation and maintenance of evidence-based interventions and use of implementation strategies to facilitate translation into practice. Ways to conceptualize and overcome challenges to implementing evidence-based practice may enhance the field of implementation science. The concept of mental models may be one way to view such challenges and to guide selection, use, and adaptation of implementation strategies to deliver evidence-based interventions. A mental model is an interrelated set of beliefs that shape how a person forms expectations for the future and understands the way the world works. Mental models can shape how an individual thinks about or understands how something or someone does, can, or should function in the world. Mental models may be sparse or detailed, may be shared among actors in implementation or not, and may be substantially tacit, that is, of limited accessibility to introspection. Actors' mental models can determine what information they are willing to accept and what changes they are willing to consider. We review the concepts of mental models and illustrate how they pertain to implementation of an example intervention, shared decision making. We then describe and illustrate potential methods for eliciting and analyzing mental models. Understanding the mental models of various actors in implementation can provide crucial information for understanding, anticipating, and overcoming implementation challenges. Successful implementation often requires changing actors' mental models or the way in which interventions or implementation strategies are presented or implemented. Accurate elicitation and understanding can guide strategies for doing so.

AB  - Objective: There have been multiple reports of increased joint hypermobility (JH) in functional somatic syndromes (FSS). We sought to evaluate the evidence for an association. Methods: A systematic search of the databases Medline and PsycINFO was conducted to identify all controlled studies from inception to February 2020 measuring the association of an FSS and JH. Records were identified and screened, and full-text articles assessed for eligibility by two independent authors. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modelling with the DerSimonian and Laird method. Results: We found 220 studies initially, which yielded 11 studies for inclusion in the qualitative review and 10 in the quantitative analysis - 5 studies on fibromyalgia, 3 on chronic fatigue syndrome and 3 on functional gastrointestinal disorder. Nine of the 11 studies found increased rates of JH in FSS compared to controls, though most studies were fair to poor in quality. Meta-analysis showed a weighted summary effect odds ratio of 3.27 (95% CI: 1.83, 5.84; p < 0.001) of JH in FSS, suggesting greater odds of FSS in individuals with JH than in those without. Conclusions: There is some evidence for an association between FSS and JH, but this is limited by the generally poor quality of studies and the narrow range of FSS studied. Better research is needed to confirm these findings as well as evaluate causation using prospective cohort studies.

AB  - Metal dyshomeostasis plays a significant role in various neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and many more. Like studies investigating the proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, microbiome, etc., for years, metallomics studies have focused on data from their domain, i.e., trace metal composition, only. Still, few have considered the links between other "omes," which may together result in an individual's specific pathologies. In particular, ASD have been reported to have multitudes of possible causal effects. Metallomics data focusing on metal deficiencies and dyshomeostasis can be linked to functions of metalloenzymes, metal transporters, and transcription factors, thus affecting the proteome and transcriptome. Furthermore, recent studies in ASD have emphasized the gut-brain axis, with alterations in the microbiome being linked to changes in the metabolome and inflammatory processes. However, the microbiome and other "omes" are heavily influenced by the metallome. Thus, here, we will summarize the known implications of a changed metallome for other "omes" in the body in the context of "omics" studies in ASD. We will highlight possible connections and propose a model that may explain the so far independently reported pathologies in ASD.

AB  - Hoarding disorder (HD) is relatively common within the community but remains notoriously difficult to treat, a phenomenon that could be related, at least in part, to the number of medical diagnoses typically co-occurring with the condition. In an effort to examine the potential link between treatment ambivalence in hoarding and certain co-occurring medical diagnoses, what follows is a comprehensive review of the empirical literature addressing HD, physical health, and medical conditions. A systematic search of scholarly databases (i.e., PubMed, PsycInfo, Google Scholar) identified nine relevant articles for review. Broadly, the research suggests that individuals with hoarding behaviors suffer from poorer health than those without hoarding tendencies, although clinically significant hoarding and levels of physical health were defined differently across studies. The review also identifies clinical correlates that could account for the link between HD and co-occurring medical conditions, such as obesity, impulsivity, executive dysfunction, and emotion regulation. Preliminary bidirectional hypotheses of HD and co-occurring medical conditions are presented in an effort to guide future research and theory-building in this area. Finally, limitations, directions for future research, and clinical implications are also discussed.

AB  - Background/Aim: Pathological processes associated with aging increase the risk of cognitive deficits. Frailty syndrome may significantly accelerate these pathological processes in elderly patients with heart failure. The objective of this review was to better understand the association between frailty syndrome and co-occurring cognitive decline in patients with heart failure. Methods: We conducted a systematic review based on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and CINAHL as databases. The search followed the method described by Webb and Roe. For inclusions, the studies were selected employing cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. The included studies had to evaluate frailty syndrome and cognitive impairments among participants with heart failure. As we were interested in older adults, the search was limited to individuals >65 years of age. The search was limited to primary research articles written in English published since the year 2000. Results: Of the 1,245 studies retrieved by the systematic review, 8 relevant studies were enclosed for the full-text review. Our review revealed that most studies of patients with HF demonstrated evidence of an association between greater frailty and cognitive impairment. In particular, six studies reported evidence for the significant association between higher levels of frailty and cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure. The remaining two studies failed to find an association between frailty and cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The development of frailty and cognitive impairment in heart failure is particularly important because this cardiovascular disease is a common cause of both morbidity and mortality in the world. The results of this review fill the existing gap in the literature related to the identification of clinical factors linked with frailty syndrome that contribute to cognitive impairment in patients with a diagnosis of heart failure. The prevalence of overlapping frailty and cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure, therefore, necessitates a routine assessment of these components in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Research using the integrated model of metacognition has suggested that the construct of metacognition could quantify the spectrum of activities that, if impaired, might cause many of the subjective disturbances found in psychosis. Research on social cognition and mentalizing in psychosis, however, has also pointed to underlying deficits in how persons make sense of their experience of themselves and others. To explore the question of whether metacognitive research in psychosis offers unique insight in the midst of these other two emerging fields, we have offered a review of the constructs and research from each field. Following that summary, we discuss ways in which research on metacognition may be distinguished from research on social cognition and mentalizing in three broad categories: (1) experimental procedures, (2) theoretical advances, and (3) clinical applications or indicated interventions. In terms of its research methods, we will describe how metacognition makes a unique contribution to understanding disturbances in how persons make sense of and interpret their own experiences within the flow of life. We will next discuss how metacognitive research in psychosis uniquely describes an architecture which when compromised - as often occurs in psychosis - results in the loss of persons' sense of purpose, possibilities, place in the world and cohesiveness of self. Turning to clinical issues, we explore how metacognitive research offers an operational model of the architecture which if repaired or restored should promote the recovery of a coherent sense of self and others in psychosis. Finally, we discuss the concrete implications of this for recovery-oriented treatment for psychosis as well as the need for further research on the commonalities of these approaches.

AB  - Background The effect of psychopathology on swallowing ability tends to be an overlooked issue in the assessment of dysphagic patients, possibly overshadowed by the given prominence to organic pathologies and the difficulties on the management of these patients. In addition, it should also be kept in mind that a great number of psychotropic drugs can affect swallowing adding problematic clinical issues in this area. Despite this, assessment of dysphagia should be considered as an extremely important issue, due to its impact on basic symptomatology, course of illness and quality of life. Objective This review aims to be an overview of relevant data on psychopathology associated with dysphagia and impairment of swallowing function. Materials and methods An extensive bibliographic search was carried out in different medical databases (PubMed and Psycharticles) to comprehensively identify the most relevant publications available on dysphagia in eating disorders published until December 2020, according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) method. Research articles, either theoretical or empirical-based, published in peer-reviewed journals and in English language, were included. Case reports were also considered in the analysis when it was appropriate for completeness purposes. Titles and abstracts were reviewed according to the eligibility criteria. Results In total, 260 published studies were identified and 40 were finally selected after removal of duplicates and relevance. Primarily we investigated the correlation between dysphagia and eating disorders, analysing the complex relationship between the two conditions. Then we provided an overview of the assessment of dysphagic symptoms in other psychiatric syndromes. Limits No exclusion criteria or statistical methods were applied nor was an assessment of study-level or outcome-level bias applicable for our purpose. The topic is vast and research bias could not be excluded; moreover, data available are heterogeneous and lacking systematic approach. Conclusions With this review, the authors want to provide an overview of the most considerable and clinically useful information about the topic, focusing on some key points to disentangle psychiatric components from the complexity of patient with dysphagia. It should be a relevant concern for all clinicians and should be always thoroughly assessed, considered its frequency in clinical practice and its implications in every kind of patients' morbidity, mortality and quality of life. Special attention should be paid to mentally ill patients, who might display complex and multiple comorbidities, as well as consequences of abnormal eating behaviours, occasionally exacerbated by psychotropic medications. More systematic studies are needed, while it seems clear that a multidisciplinary approach is pivotal in the assessment and management of dysphagic patients.

AB  - Autophagy is a catabolic pathway by which misfolded proteins or damaged organelles are engulfed by autophagosomes and then transported to lysosomes for degradation. Recently, a great improvement has been done to explain the molecular mechanisms and roles of autophagy in several important cellular metabolic processes. Besides being a vital clearance pathway or a cell survival pathway in response to different stresses, autophagy dysfunction, either upregulated or down-regulated, has been suggested to be linked with numerous neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Impairment at different stages of autophagy results in the formation of large protein aggregates and damaged organelles, which leads to the onset and progression of different neurodegenerative disorders. This article elucidates the recent progress about the role of autophagy in neurodegenerative disorders and explains how autophagy dysfunction is linked with the pathogenesis of such disorders as well as the novel potential autophagy-associated therapies for treating them.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Improved recovery protocols were implemented in surgical specialties over the last decade, which decreased anesthetic and surgical stress and the incidence of perioperative complications. However, these recovery protocols were introduced more slowly for cardiac surgeries. The most frequent complications in cardiac surgery are related to patient clinical status and the characteristics of the surgical procedures involved, which are becoming more varied and complex every day. The first version of the enhanced recovery program for cardiac surgery was published in 2019, but its recommendations were based on only a few studies, and scant research has evaluated its implementation. Randomized and controlled clinical trials for these protocols are scarce, so research that summarizes the results of studies with other methodological designs are useful in demonstrating their benefits in cardiovascular surgery services in Cuba and in other limited-resource settings.
   OBJECTIVE Estimate the effectiveness of improved recovery protocols in the perioperative evolution of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
   METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta analysis according to the guidelines of manual 5.1.0 for reviews of the Cochrane library. We included observational and quasi experimental studies published from January 2015 through May 2020 that compared enhanced recovery protocols with conventional treatments in patients older than 18 years, and used a quality score to evaluate them. We used the following sources: the Cochrane Library, PubMed, LILACS, SciELO, EBSCO, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Clinical Key, ResearchGate and HINARI. The following keywords were used for the database searches in English: ERAS, protocols and cardiac surgery, enhanced recovery after cardiac surgery, ERACS, clinical pathway recovery and cardiac surgery, perioperative care and cardiac surgery. We used the following search terms for databases in Spanish: protocolos de recuperacion precoz and cirugia cardiaca, protocolos de recuperacion mejorada and cirugia cardiaca, cuidados perioperatorios and cirugia cardiaca, programas de recuperacion precoz and cirugia cardiovascular. Methodological quality of included investigations was evaluated using the surgical research methodology scale. Meta-analyses were performed for perioperative complications, intensive care unit and hospital stays, and hospital readmission within 30 days of surgery. We calculated effect sizes of the interventions and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We used mean differences and confidence intervals for continuous variables, and for qualitative variables we calculated relative risk (RR). Random effects analysis was used. Heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the Q statistic and the I-2 statistic.
   RESULTS We selected 15 studies (a total of 5059 patients: study group, n = 1706; control group, n = 3353). The average quality score for the 15 articles included was 18.9 (out of a maximum of 36 according to the scale) and 66.6% had a score >= 18. With improved recovery protocols in cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative complications decreased (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.52-0.98) as did hospital readmission within 30 days after surgery (RR = 0.51; 95% CI 95% CI: 0.31-0.86). Differences in extubation time, hospital stay and length of stay in intensive care units were less marked, but always favored the group in which the enhanced protocols were implemented.
   CONCLUSIONS Improved recovery protocols in cardiac surgery increase quality of care evidenced by reductions in perioperative complications and decreased incidence of hospital readmission in the month following surgery.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis aggregated and examined the treatment effect of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) (transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation) on cognitive functions in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI). A systematic search was conducted using databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, EMBASE) for studies with keywords related to non-randomized and randomized control trials of NIBS among people with TBI. Nine out of 1790 NIBS studies with 197 TBI participants (103 active vs. 94 sham) that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the present study were finally selected for meta-analysis using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 3). Results showed that the overall effect of NIBS on cognition in people with TBI was moderately significant (g = 0.304, 95% CI = 0.055 to 0.553) with very low heterogeneity across studies (I-2 = 0.000, Tau = 0.000). Specifically, significant and marginally significant moderate effect sizes were found for cognitive sub-domains including attention, memory, and executive function. The present findings suggest that NIBS is moderately effective in improving cognitive functions among people with TBI. In particular, NIBS may be used as an alternative and/or an adjunct treatment to the traditional approach in rehabilitating cognitive functions in people with TBI.

AB  - Sesamum indicum L is an excellent source of unsaturated fatty acids and secondary metabolites. Most commonly used in Eastern and African countries, easily available and cheap source of vital nutrients. The aim of this review was to identify scientific evidences regarding the hypolipidemic and ant oxidative potential of sesame seed and its derivatives. Electronic search of Google scholar, Medline and PubMed databases are conducted. Elevated levels of plasma lipids and cholesterol is known as hyperlipidemia, increased lipids levels are directly associated with vascular and metabolic disorders. Hyperlipidemia is the most common risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. Sesame seed is loaded with vitamin E, sesamin, sesamolin, sesamol, lignans and phytoestrogen, these constituents have potential to reduce hperlipidimia, hypercholesterolimia and elevated triglycerides levels. They also act as antioxidants to prevent lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. Mechanism behind hypolipidemic effect of sesame seed, is its ability to increase superoxide dismutase SOD and glutathione peroxidase (antioxidants) activity, reduction in triglycerides and Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. Previous studies suggested that Sesamum indicum L. is highly effective to manage hyperlidemia and dislipidemia due to its lipid ameliorating and antioxidative effect.

AB  - Grain oriented steels are widely used for electrical machines and components, such as transformers and reactors, due to their high magnetic permeability and low power losses. These outstanding properties are due to the crystalline structure known as Goss texture, obtained by a suitable process that is well-known and in widespread use among industrial producers of ferromagnetic steel sheets. One of the most interesting research areas in this field has been the development of non-destructive methods for the quality assessment of Goss texture. In particular, the study of techniques that can be implemented in industrial processes is very interesting. Here, we provide an overview of techniques developed in the past, novel approaches recently introduced, and new perspectives. The reliability and accuracy of several methods and equipment are presented and discussed.

AB  - This umbrella review of reviews examined the evidence on the work and health impacts of working in an epidemic/pandemic environment, factors associated with these impacts, and risk mitigation or intervention strategies that address these factors. We examined review articles published in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase between 2000 and 2020. Data extracted from the included reviews were analyzed using a narrative synthesis. The search yielded 1524 unique citations, of which 31 were included. Included studies were focused on health care workers and the risk of infection to COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses, mental health outcomes, and health care workers' willingness to respond during a public health event. Reviews identified a variety of individual, social, and organizational factors associated with these work and health outcomes as well as risk mitigation strategies that addressed study outcomes. Only a few reviews examined intervention strategies in the workplace such as physical distancing and quarantine, and none included long-term outcomes of exposure or work during an epidemic/pandemic. Findings suggest a number of critical research and evidence gaps, including the need for reviews on occupational groups potentially exposed to or impacted by the negative work and health effects of COVID-19 in addition to health care workers, the long-term consequences of transitioning to the post-COVID-19 economy on work and health, and research with an equity or social determinants of health lens.

AB  - We propose several different types of construction principles for new classes of Toda field theories based on root systems defined on Lorentzian lattices. In analogy to conformal and affine Toda theories based on root systems of semi-simple Lie algebras, also their Lorentzian extensions come about in conformal and massive variants. We carry out the Painleve integrability test for the proposed theories, finding in general only one integer valued resonance corresponding to the energy-momentum tensor. Thus most of the Lorentzian Toda field theories are not integrable, as the remaining resonances, that grade the spins of the W-algebras in the semi-simple cases, are either non-integer or complex valued. We analyze in detail the classical mass spectra of several massive variants. Lorentzian Toda field theories may be viewed as perturbed versions of integrable theories equipped with an algebraic framework.

AB  - Given health threats of climate change, a comprehensive review of the impacts of ambient temperature and ar pollution on suicide is needed. We performed systematic literature review and meta-analysis of suicide risks associated with short-term exposure to ambient temperature and air pollution. Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for English-language publications using relevant keywords. Observational studies assessing risks of daily suicide and suicide attempts associated with temperature, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m (PM10) and <= 2.5 mm (PM2.5), ozone (O-3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) were included. Data extraction was independently performed in duplicate. Random-effect meta-analysis was applied to pool risk ratios (RRs) for increases in daily suicide per interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure. Meta-regression analysis was applied to examine effect modification by income level based on gross national income (GNI) per capita, national suicide rates, and average level of exposure factors. In total 2274 articles were screened, with 18 studies meeting inclusion criteria for air pollution and 32 studies for temperature. RRs of suicide per 7.1 degrees C temperature was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.13). RRs of suicide per IQR increase in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 were 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.05), 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.03), and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.07). O-3, SO2, and CO were not associated with suicide. RR of suicide was significantly higher in higher-income than lower-income countries (1.09, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.11 and 1.20, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.26 per 7.1 degrees C increased temperature, respectively). Suicide risks associated with air pollution did not significantly differ by income level, national suicide rates, or average exposure levels. Research gaps were found for interactions between air pollution and temperature on suicide risks.

AB  - Background: People living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are exposed to multiple risk factors for cognitive impairment and frequently report cognitive difficulties. However, the presence of cognitive impairment in IBD has not been systematically reviewed. Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we performed a systematic multidatabase search for crosssectional and longitudinal studies comparing adults with IBD versus healthy controls for domain-specific cognitive function or scores on multidomain cognitive screening tools. For any domain reported by 3 or more studies, we conducted random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the standardized mean difference between groups; lower scores reflected poorer performance. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and study quality assessed using an IBD-modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: Of 8302 articles screened, 12 studies (n = 687) were included in the qualitative synthesis and 11 in meta analyses. All studies were cross-sectional. Studies generally excluded people with active IBD and older adults. Despite no significant differences on multidomain screening tools such as the Mini Mental State Examination (-0.27 [95% confidence interval-0.68, 0.08], P = 0.14), people with IBD showed significant deficits compared with healthy controls in attention (standardized mean difference-0.36 [-0.60,-0.12], P = 0.003, I-2 = 0%), executive function (standardized mean difference-0.45 [-0.77,-0.13, P = 0.005, I-2 = 42.5%), and specifically in working memory (standardized mean difference-0.58 [-0.85,-0.30], P < 0.001, I-2 = 0%). Deficits in learning and recall were nonsignificant (P = 0.089) and other domains insufficient for meta-analysis. Conclusions: People with IBD show deficits in attention and executive function, particularly in working memory, suggesting that cognitive impairment is a potential extraintestinal manifestation of IBD.

AB  - Healthy living habits (healthy eating, regular physical activity, abstinence from smoking, restrictions on alcohol consumption, and stress management) can help prevent a significant number of diseases. The purpose of this study is to use a bibliometric analysis to analyze the relationships between countries, institutions and authors through lifestyle studies from 2016 to 2020 to find out the latest research trends. This study utilized bibliometric data collected through Scopus including thesis titles, authors, agencies, countries/regions, publication years, and keywords. Data were analyzed using the VOS viewer (Vers. 1.6.13; Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) and the findings were used to visualize similarity mapping techniques. Publication of lifestyle-related research papers has steadily increased between 2016 and 2020. The country/region most actively conducting such research was the United States, also home to the majority of institutions conducting work in the field. PloS ONE published the most lifestyle-related research under the field of Medicine. Identified keywords were related to risk measures, psychosocial factors, prevention, health promotion, and risk factors. Lifestyle research is a promising field of research worldwide and has great potential to improve human health, the environment, and quality of life. The findings are expected to promote future research and give direction to the advancement of the field of research by comprehensively analyzing and summarizing lifestyle research trends.

AB  - The present review will focus on evidence demonstrating the prioritization in visual processing of fear-related signals in the absence of awareness. Evidence in hemianopic patients without any form of blindsight or affective blindsight in classical terms will be presented, demonstrating that fearful faces, via a subcortical colliculo-pulvinar-amygdala pathway, have a privileged unconscious visual processing and facilitate responses towards visual stimuli in the intact visual field. Interestingly, this fear-specific implicit visual processing in hemianopics has only been observed after lesions to the visual cortices in the left hemisphere, while no effect was found in patients with damage to the right hemisphere. This suggests that the subcortical route for emotional processing in the right hemisphere might provide a pivotal contribution to the implicit processing of fear, in line with evidence showing enhanced right amygdala activity and increased connectivity in the right colliculo-pulvinar-amygdala pathway for unconscious fear-conditioned stimuli and subliminal fearful faces. These findings will be discussed within a theoretical framework that considers the amygdala as an integral component of a constant and continuous vigilance system, which is preferentially invoked with stimuli signaling ambiguous environmental situations of biological relevance, such as fearful faces.

AB  - Shift work (SW) encompasses 20% of the European workforce. Moreover, high blood pressure (BP) remains a leading cause of death globally. This review aimed to synthesize the magnitude of the potential impact of SW on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and hypertension (HTN). MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for epidemiological studies evaluating BP and/or HTN diagnosis among shift workers, compared with day workers. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed and the results were expressed as pooled mean differences or odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Forty-five studies were included, involving 117,252 workers. We found a significant increase in both SBD and DBP among permanent night workers (2.52 mmHg, 95% CI 0.75-4.29 and 1.76 mmHg, 95% CI 0.41-3.12, respectively). For rotational shift workers, both with and without night work, we found a significant increase but only for SBP (0.65 mmHg, 95% CI 0.07-1.22 and 1.28 mmHg, 95% CI 0.18-2.39, respectively). No differences were found for HTN. Our findings suggest that SW is associated with an increase of BP, mainly for permanent night workers and for SBP. This is of special interest given the large number of susceptible workers exposed over time.

AB  - Background: The voltage-dependent calcium channel alpha 1 subunit (CACNA1A) gene plays a major role in neuronal communication. Mutation in this gene results in altered Ca2+ ion influx that modify the neurotransmitter release resulting in the development of various neurological disorders like hemiplegic migraine with cortical spreading depression, epilepsy, episodic ataxia type 2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
   Objective: This review aimed in portraying the frequent mutations in CACNA1A gene causing hemiplegic migraine with cortical spreading depression, epilepsy, episodic ataxia type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
   Methodology: A systematic search has been adopted in various databases using the keywords "Calcium channel," "migraine," "epilepsy," "episodic ataxia," and "spinocerebellar ataxia" for writing this review that collectively focuses on mutations in the CACNA1A gene causing the common neurological diseases from 1975 to 2019.
   Conclusion: Every type of mutation has its own signature in gene functioning and understanding them might aid knowing more in disease progression.

AB  - Internationally, medical students' Internet Addiction (IA) is widely studied. As medical students use the Internet extensively for work, we asked how researchers control for work-related Internet activity, and the extent to which this influences interpretations of "addiction" rates. A search of PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted on the search phrase of "medical students" and "internet addiction" in March 2020. In total, 98 studies met our criteria, 88 (90%) used Young's Internet Addiction Test, and the studies' IA rates ranged widely. Little note was taken of work-related activity, and, when discussed, had little to no impact on the interpretation of Internet "addiction". Studies seldom accounted for work-related activities, researcher bias appears to influence their position, "usage" appears conflated with "addiction", and correlations between "addiction" and negative behaviours are frequently confused with one-way causation. In spite of IA's not being officially recognised, few researchers questioned its validity. While IA may exist among medical students, its measurement is flawed; given the use of the Internet as a crucial medical education tool, there is the risk that conscientious students will be labelled "addicted", and poor academic performance may be attributed to this "addiction".

AB  - Background: The homeless population are among the most vulnerable groups to experience suicide ideation and behavior. Several studies have shown that people who are homeless experience more significant suicidal ideation and behavior than the general population. However, there is limited information about what suicide interventions exist, to what extent they are grounded in robust research, and which intervention components effectively reduce suicidal ideation and behavior in the homeless community. This research aimed to characterise the current evidence base in the area of suicide prevention for homeless individuals. Methods: A scoping review guided by Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework was conducted and a narrative synthesis was performed. Pubmed, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Open Grey, and Bielefeld Academic Search Engine were searched up to 8 May 2020. Results: A total of 3209 records were identified through database and grey literature searching. Three studies are included in this review. Key outcomes identify suicide intervention prevention programmes; similarities and differences across interventions, and examples of staff training. A quality review of the studies was completed. Conclusion: A stark gap in the evidence of suicide specific prevention interventions targeted at homeless populations.

AB  - The world is facing an unprecedented challenge of the 21st century in the form of COVID-19 outbreak. People across the culture, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background are being affected by the rippling effects of this pandemic. The aim of this narrative review is to briefly describe the impact of the pandemic on mental health, the vicious cycle of social issues and psychological health caused and aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. We also aim to highlight certain interventions to overcome the mental health challenges posed by the pandemic. For this purpose, a thorough search of all databases was done to gather articles relevant to the objective of this narrative review. Keywords were used in combination and separately to identify the articles on the various psychosocial issues caused by the pandemic. Published articles in various databases like Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed etc., related to psychosocial effects due to COVID-19 were searched and summarized to justify and support the objective of this paper. The coming months will reveal the extent of damage this pandemic has caused to the socio-economic and health sectors across the globe. It is crucial to recognize the psychosocial impact of this pandemic and necessitate the measures to overcome them by mobilizing the resources we have at hand.

AB  - Distance running is a popular youth sport. This systematic review identified and examined the effects of youth distance running and lower extremity musculoskeletal injury. Scientific databases were searched from database inception to May 2020. Two hundred and fifty-eight full texts were screened, with nine articles retained for data extraction. Seven of the studies were case reports or case series. Two case reports involved an apophyseal hip fracture. No correlation was found between running mileage or gender and sustaining an injury. Middle school runners reported fewer injuries than high school runners. Cross country accounted for less than 10% of injuries in youth under 15 compared to other track activities. The main finding was a paucity of research. Available literature suggests youth can participate in distance running with minimal adverse effects. One exception may be increased vulnerability to growth plate injury. Additional research is needed, especially in those under 10, as literature in this population is nonexistent.

AB  - Objective: Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) incorporate principles of personal strengths with the view that mental health recovery transcends symptom relief. Severe psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, may benefit from such interventions. This study aims to gather the current evidence on the impact of PPIs on increasing well-being in patients on the schizophrenia spectrum and assess reductions in negative or positive symptoms. Methods: A systematic review of PPI studies with schizophrenia-spectrum patients was carried out following PRISMA recommendations. The PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for relevant publications in order to understand the possible effects of these interventions on well-being measures and psychotic symptoms in this population. Results: Nine studies (four controlled) were included. Meta-analysis of the controlled studies showed a significant effect (p = 0.04) for improvement of well-being (Z = 2.01). Overall, the reviewed evidence suggests well-being improvement. The effect on reduction of negative symptoms was unclear. Conclusion: Used as an adjunctive therapy, PPIs appear to be a promising resource for patients on the schizophrenia spectrum, with possible effects on well-being and symptom reduction.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-established pathological event in Parkinson's disease (PD). Proteins misfolding and its impaired cellular clearance due to altered autophagy/mitophagy/pexophagy contribute to PD progression. It has been shown that mitochondria have contact sites with endoplasmic reticulum (ER), peroxisomes and lysosomes that are involved in regulating various physiological processes. In pathological conditions, the crosstalk at the contact sites initiates alterations in intracellular vesicular transport, calcium homeostasis and causes activation of proteases, protein misfolding and impairment of autophagy. Apart from the well-reported molecular changes like mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy/mitophagy and oxidative stress in PD, here we have summarized the recent scientific reports to provide the mechanistic insights on the altered communications between ER, peroxisomes, and lysosomes at mitochondrial contact sites. Furthermore, the manuscript elaborates on the contributions of mitochondrial contact sites and organelles dysfunction to the pathogenesis of PD and suggests potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Purpose of Review Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a recently introduced approach to patient evaluation that consists of asking patients questions in real time and in their usual habitat. This method seeks to contribute to suicide prevention by providing psychiatrists with detailed information about suicidal thoughts and behavior, how these fluctuate over short periods of time, and the short-term risk factors presented by patients. We conducted a systematic review of published research using EMA to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. Recent Findings Several systematic reviews of EMA in mental health have been conducted to date, and the literature contains numerous theoretical papers and compilations on EMA and suicide phenomena. To date, however, no systematic reviews have explored the use of this tool to study suicidal thoughts and behavior. We performed a systematic review of five databases (i.e., PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) to identify studies on EMA and suicidal thoughts and behavior. An initial search revealed 544 articles. Following the study selection process, 35 studies were included in the review. Almost three-quarters of the studies were published in the last 4 years. The studies reviewed concluded that EMA was generally feasible and well accepted. EMA findings correlated well with the results of a retrospective assessment, though tended to over-represent symptom severity. Our review points to important aspects of suicidal thoughts and behavior, such as its wide fluctuation over short periods of time. Negative affect and disturbed sleep, among others, emerged as short-term predictors of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Therefore, EMA is a potentially useful tool in clinical practice, although not without drawbacks, such as participant fatigue with questionnaires and ethical concerns.

AB  - Starting from statistical data derived from the oncological field, some articles have high-lighted the importance of communication in the patient-caregiver dyad and have considered the various roles involved in a cancer diagnosis situation. Thus, the question of how to intervene in terms of "quality of life" from the time of diagnosis to the recovery or death of a cancer patient, beyond the sanitary and physical dimensions, has become relevant. Therefore, the present narrative review aims to offer an overview of the state of the art in terms of the psychological treatment modalities of cancer patients, from the diagnosis to the post-surgery period. A total of 67 articles were collected and analyzed, in relation to (1) psychological constructs employed in the oncological field, (2) intervention models and (3) quality of life and well-being measurement and evaluation tools. We described these articles, differentiating between those focusing on the role of (1) the patient, (2) the caregiver, (3) the patient-caregiver dyad and (4) healthcare professional roles. The oncological diagnosis and its repercussions in the lives of the patient and caregiver were explored and critical aspects that emerged from the literature were highlighted. In conclusion, the analysis allowed some considerations about the need to define research protocols and useful management strategies for increasing the overall health of patients with cancer diagnoses and the people who surround them.

AB  - Simple Summary Mounting evidence suggests a role for extracellular vesicles in cell-to-cell communication, in both physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, the molecular content of vesicles can be exploited for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Inflamed tissues and tumors are often characterized by hypoxic areas, where oxygen levels drop dramatically. Several studies demonstrated that hypoxic stress affects the release of vesicles and their content. This review is intended to provide an exhaustive overview on the relationship between hypoxia and vesicles in inflammatory diseases and cancer. Hypoxia is a severe stress condition often observed in cancer and chronically inflamed cells and tissues. Extracellular vesicles play pivotal roles in these pathological processes and carry biomolecules that can be detected in many biofluids and may be exploited for diagnostic purposes. Several studies report the effects of hypoxia on extracellular vesicles' release, molecular content, and biological functions in disease. This review summarizes the most recent findings in this field, highlighting the areas that warrant further investigation.

AB  - Background: Past research has yielded promising results on the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions to prevent eating disorders (EDs) in adolescents, but further information is needed to evaluate the public health impact of their large-scale dissemination. This article used an established framework to systematically review the extent to which indicators of the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance [cf. ReachEffectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM)-framework] of universal and targeted online ED prevention programmes are reported in the literature, in order to estimate their future dissemination potential. Methods: The literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO, and complemented by searching existing reviews and the reference lists of the studies included. Twenty-two studies published between 2000 and April 2019 met the inclusion criteria. We extracted data on a total of 43 indicators, within RE-AIM dimensions for each article, including qualitative coding of fostering and hindering factors. Results: Reach (55.0%) and implementation (54.0%) were the dimensions reported on most frequently, followed by effectiveness (46.8%), adoption (34.7%) and maintenance (18.2%). While internal validity indicators were frequently reported (e.g. sample size, effects and intervention intensity), most studies failed to report on elements of external validity, such as representativeness of participants and settings, adoption rates, implementation costs and programme sustainability. Conclusions: Evidence indicates that Internet-based ED prevention programmes can reach a large number of adolescents and can be feasibly implemented in school settings. However, given the paucity of large-scale dissemination studies available for review, the degree to which schools are willing to adopt preventive interventions, as well as the transferability of programmes to different settings and geographical regions remains unclear.

AB  - Many psychological treatments have been shown to be cost-effective and efficacious, as long as they are implemented faithfully. Assessing fidelity and providing feedback is expensive and time-consuming. Machine learning has been used to assess treatment fidelity, but the reliability and generalisability is unclear. We collated and critiqued all implementations of machine learning to assess the verbal behaviour of all helping professionals, with particular emphasis on treatment fidelity for therapists. We conducted searches using nine electronic databases for automated approaches of coding verbal behaviour in therapy and similar contexts. We completed screening, extraction, and quality assessment in duplicate. Fifty-two studies met our inclusion criteria (65.3% in psychotherapy). Automated coding methods performed better than chance, and some methods showed near human-level performance; performance tended to be better with larger data sets, a smaller number of codes, conceptually simple codes, and when predicting session-level ratings than utterance-level ones. Few studies adhered to best-practice machine learning guidelines. Machine learning demonstrated promising results, particularly where there are large, annotated datasets and a modest number of concrete features to code. These methods are novel, cost-effective, scalable ways of assessing fidelity and providing therapists with individualised, prompt, and objective feedback.

AB  - Objective Suicide and self-harm are widespread yet underreported. Risk assessment is key to effective self-harm and suicide prevention and management. There is contradicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of risk assessment tools in predicting self-harm and suicide risk. This systematic review examines the effect of risk assessment strategies on predicting suicide and self-harm outcomes among adult healthcare service users. Method Electronic and gray literature databases were searched for prospective research. Studies were screened and selected by independent reviewers. Quality and level of evidence assessments were conducted. Due to study heterogeneity, we present a narrative synthesis under three categories: (1) suicide- and self-harm-related outcomes; (2) clinician assessment of suicide and self-harm risk; and (3) healthcare utilization due to self-harm or suicide. Results Twenty-one studies were included in this review. The SAD PERSONS Scale was the most used tool. It outperformed the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation in predicting hospital admissions and stay following suicide and self-harm, yet it failed to predict repeat suicide and self-harm and was not recommended for routine use. There were mixed findings relating to clinician risk assessment, with some studies recommending clinician assessment over structured tools, whilst others found that clinician assessment failed to predict future attempts and deaths. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any one tool, inclusive of clinician assessment of risk, for self-harm and suicidality. The discourse around risk assessment needs to move toward a broader discussion on the safety of patients who are at risk for self-harm and/or suicide.

AB  - The scope of this systematic review was to summarize the existing literature on the effects of heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) on executive functions (EFs) across the lifespan. Specifically, it aimed to investigate the factors that may affect the efficacy of HRV-BF interventions, such as the study population, duration and intensity of the intervention, or the technical equipment. This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies that measured and presented at least one EF were included. We included controlled and uncontrolled trials involving clinical and general populations. From the initial list of 137 papers, 16 final studies were reviewed, with 777 participants. Fifty-six percent of the studies included in this review reported significant positive effects of HRV-BF intervention on at least one EF. Attention was the domain that most often benefited from the intervention. The majority of EF improvements (78%) occurred in studies that addressed patient populations or individuals that may present particular profiles: individuals exposed to stress, professional athletes, war veterans, children and adults with ADHD, and clinical older patients. The remaining studies (22%) that reported significant improvements focused on the general population. Efficacy was neither related to the duration or intensity of the intervention nor related to the technical equipment. Overall, our review shows that HRV-BF may be beneficial (a) to increase attentional skills, inhibition, and working memory and (b) when targeting more vulnerable individuals or individuals with particular profiles. However, further development of standardized, controlled protocols and consistent reporting of effect sizes may contribute to establishing the relevance of HRV-BF biofeedback interventions within the field of cognitive enhancement.

AB  - brain injury (TBI) is a common but heterogeneous injury underpinned by numerous complex and interrelated pathophysiological mechanisms. An essential trace element, iron is abundant within the brain and involved in many fundamental neurobiological processes, including oxygen transportation, oxidative phos-phorylation, myelin production and maintenance, as well as neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. Exces-sive levels of iron are neurotoxic and thus iron homeostasis is tightly regulated in the brain, however, many details about the mechanisms by which this is achieved are yet to be elucidated. A key mediator of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammatory response, iron dysregulation is an important contribu-tor to secondary injury in TBI. Advances in neuroimaging that leverage magnetic susceptibility properties have enabled increasingly comprehensive investigations into the distribution and behaviour of iron in the brain amongst healthy individuals as well as disease states such as TBI. Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is an advanced neuroimaging technique that promises quantitative estimation of local magnetic susceptibility at the voxel level. In this review, we provide an overview of brain iron and its homeostasis, describe recent advances enabling applications of QSM within the context of TBI and summarise the current state of the literature. Although limited, the emergent research suggests that QSM is a promising neuroimaging technique that can be used to investigate a host of pathophysiological changes that are associated with TBI.

AB  - Successive technological improvements have made Raman imaging systems very efficient. Raman imaging applications now cover a wide range of scientific fields, including high-temperature materials corrosion, also known as dry corrosion. The analysis of the phenomena occurring during corrosion requires knowledge in metallurgy, thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, solid-state chemistry, and physics. Part of this information (crystallographic phases, stress state, oxygen transport, etc.) can be obtained, at least qualitatively, from the analysis of Raman images of the oxidation layer. Throughout this paper, we consider as a prototypal example the oxidation of a particular zirconium alloy, Zircaloy-4, used in the nuclear industry as cladding materials in light-water reactors. Through some examples, the aim of the present paper is to describe what kind of information this method can bring, to review its merits and weaknesses. The analysis protocols methods described herein are not exhaustive, but most probably represent a simple way to read and understand the Raman images. These few examples show that rather subtle details that concern phase distribution, strain, and oxygen transport can effectively be captured by this method. Most probably, Raman imaging may be applied to other alloys or systems as well.

AB  - Dimethoate ([O,O-dimethyl S-(N-methylcarbamoylmethyl) phosphorodithioate]) is an organophosphate insecticide and acaricide widely used for agricultural purposes. Genotoxicity refers to the ability of a chemical agent interact directly to DNA or act indirectly leading to DNA damage by affecting spindle apparatus or enzymes involved in DNA replication, thereby causing mutations. Taking into consideration the importance of genotoxicity induced by dimethoate, the purpose of this manuscript was to provide a mini review regarding genotoxicity induced by dimethoate as a result of oxidative stress. The present study was conducted on studies available in MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, and Google scholar for all kind of articles (all publications published until May, 2020) using the following key words: dimethoate, omethoate, DNA damage, genetic damage, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, mutation, and mutagenicity. The results showed that many studies were published in the scientific literature; the approach was clearly demonstrated in multiple tissues and organs, but few papers were designed in humans. In summary, new studies within the field are important for better understanding the pathobiological events of genotoxicity on human cells, particularly to explain what cells and/or tissues are more sensitive to genotoxic insult induced by dimethoate.

AB  - The study aimed to identify whether people diagnosed with depression have endothelial dysfunction, assessed by the technique of flow-mediated dilation (FMD), when compared to controls without depression. In addition, to verify whether people with depressive symptoms have impaired endothelial function when compared to controls without symptoms. Also to explore the potential moderators of the association between depression and endothelial dysfunction. Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science, from inception to April 16, 2021, for studies in people with depression and controls evaluating endothelial function through FMD. The primary outcome was the percentage of change in FMD. Comparative random effects meta-analysis, calculating the mean difference (MD) of the FMD between depressed and controls was performed. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored by meta-regressions and subgroup analyses. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020192070). Nine studies evaluating 1367 participants (379 depressed and 988 controls) (median age = 39.8 years, 44.9% men) were included. People with depression had lower FMD =-1.48% (95%CI =-2.62 to-0.33). High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels moderated the effect (beta =-0.408, 95%CI =-0.776 to-0.040). Differences in FMD were found when assessment was done in the first minute after release of the occlusion, when using occlusion position in distal forearm, and when using occlusion pressure between 250 and 300 mmHg. Those with clinical depression (established by diagnostic instruments) presented the greatest dysfunction. Individuals with depression have a more impaired endothelial dysfunction when compared to controls. HDL cholesterol levels and differences in FMD assessment modalities moderate the difference.

AB  - Cognitive load theory has been a major influence for the field of educational psychology. One of the main guidelines of the theory is that extraneous cognitive load should be reduced to leave sufficient cognitive resources for the actual learning to take place. In recent years, research regarding various design factors, in particular from the field of digital and online learning, have challenged this assumption. Interactive learning media, immersion, disfluency, realism, and redundant elements constitute five major challenges, since these design factors have been shown to induce task-irrelevant cognitive load, i.e., extraneous load, while still promoting motivation and learning. However, currently there is no unified approach to integrate such effects into cognitive load theory. By including aspects of constructive alignment, an approach aimed at fostering deep forms of learning in order to achieve specific learning outcomes, we devise a strategy to balance cognitive load in digital learning. Most importantly, we suggest considering both the positive and negative effects on cognitive load that certain design factors of digital learning can cause. In addition, a number of research results highlight that some types of positive effects of digital learning can only be detected using a suitable assessment method. This strategy of aligning cognitive load with desired learning outcomes will be useful for formulating theory-guided and empirically testable hypotheses, but can be particularly helpful for practitioners to embrace emerging technologies while minimizing potential extraneous drawbacks.

AB  - Background Lithium is a first-line pharmacotherapy for the treatment of bipolar disorder, but long-term use is associated with nephrotoxicity. However, as dialysis effectively eliminates lithium, it remains a pharmacotherapeutic option for patients on dialysis. This systematic review seeks to evaluate the dosing, safety, efficacy, and monitoring of lithium in patients receiving dialysis. Method A PubMed database search performed May 5th, 2020, identified 535 article titles. After exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 15 articles were included in this systematic review. Results In 18 patients receiving dialysis, lithium was primarily used for the treatment of mood disorders. The majority of patients received 300-900 mg lithium carbonate thrice-weekly following dialysis, but several alternative lithium salts and dosing strategies were utilized. The pharmacokinetic properties of lithium in dialysis are not well understood and can be complicated by a serum lithium "rebound effect" following dialysis, due to a two-compartment volume of distribution. Additionally, presence of residual diuresis in some patients may be reason to administer lithium more frequently than thrice-weekly following dialysis. Lithium was shown to be an effective pharmacotherapy in all patients, with many demonstrating rapid improvement after drug initiation. Five patients experienced an adverse event on lithium, but only one patient required lithium discontinuation. Conclusion Lithium may be used in patients on dialysis, with close monitoring of pre-dialysis serum lithium concentrations for at least two weeks after treatment initiation, followed by a lower frequency after stabilization to ensure therapeutic concentrations and reduce toxicity risk.

AB  - Altought compassionate care is an important factor in health care, remains an unmet need in patients. The studies have been carried out in Anglo-Saxon countries with cultural environments and health systems that are very different from Spanish-speaking contexts. The aim of this study to understand the conceptual, evaluation and clinical application nuances of compassion and compassionate care in Spanish-speaking health care settings, through a systematic review. A search of the scientific literature was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines in ProQuest Central, PubMed and Web Of Science, resulting in 295 studies, of which 27 were selected, based on the following inclusion criteria: the article studied or analyzed the construct of compassion in healthcare setting and the participants were Spanish speakers or the authors spoke of the construct in Spanish. Two blinded evaluators performed the study selection process using the Covidence tool. The agreement between evaluators was in all cases satisfactory. Different definitions of the construct have been identified, that they generally share: the recognition of suffering and the attempt to alleviate it. There are few studies that focus solely on the analysis of compassion, since other concepts appear that are associated with it, such as empathy and self-compassion. Further research is needed to obtain a better and greater understanding of compassionate care adapted to the perceptions of patients and health professionals in different socio-cultural contexts. In this way, instruments that measure compassionate care can be better developed and adjusted, and interventions aimed at promoting compassion can be properly assessed.

AB  - The maternal gut microbiome plays a critical role in fetal and early postnatal development, shaping fundamental processes including immune maturation and brain development, among others. Consequently, it also contributes to fetal programming of health and disease. Over the last decade, epidemiological studies and work in preclinical animal models have begun to uncover a link between dysbiosis of the maternal gut microbiome and neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. Neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by both genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions; however, clinical heterogeneity, phenotypic variability, and comorbidities make identification of underlying mechanisms difficult. Among environmental factors, exposure to maternal obesity in utero confers a significant increase in risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Obesogenic diets in humans, non-human primates, and rodents induce functional modifications in maternal gut microbiome composition, which animal studies suggest are causally related to adverse mental health outcomes in offspring. Here, we review evidence linking maternal diet-induced gut dysbiosis to neurodevelopmental disorders and discuss how it could affect pre-and early postnatal brain development. We are hopeful that this burgeoning field of research will revolutionize antenatal care by leading to accessible prophylactic strategies, such as prenatal probiotics, to improve mental health outcomes in children affected by maternal diet-induced obesity.

AB  - Anthropogenic land use change (ALUC) satisfies human needs but also impacts aquatic ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems are intrinsically linked with terrestrial landscapes, an association that is already recognized as a key factor to address future research and effective governance. However, the complexity and range of the impact of ALUC in aquatic ecosystems have been fundamental challenges and have implicitly routed the analysis to particular segments, drivers, management, or effects of the theme. In this study, we present an attempt to frame the subject in a broader context through a topic-based bibliometric analysis. Our aim is to identify possible biases and gaps in the current scientific literature and detect the main topics that have characterized the theme. Our results show an unequal distribution of articles by country when we analyzed the authors' affiliation and also a slight increase in contributions from social and economic disciplines, although they are still underrepresented. Moreover, we distinguish topics whose prevalence seems to change, especially those topics where the use of scenario analysis and multi-stressors are considered. We discuss the main biases and gaps revealed by our results, concluding that future studies on the impact of ALUC on aquatic ecosystems should better integrate social and economic disciplines and expand geographic frontiers.

AB  - Air pollution is regarded as an important risk factor for many diseases that affect a large proportion of the human population. To date, accumulating reports have noted that particulate matter (PM) is closely associated with the course of cardiopulmonary disorders. As the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and autoimmune disorders have risen and as the world's population is aging, there is an increasing interest in environmental health hazards, mainly air pollution, which has been slightly overlooked as one of many plausible detrimental stimuli contributing to neurodegenerative disease onset and progression. Epidemiological studies have indicated a noticeable association between exposure to PM and neurotoxicity, which has been gradually confirmed by in vivo and in vitro studies. After entering the body directly through the olfactory epithelium or indirectly by passing through the respiratory system into the circulatory system, air pollutants are subsequently able to reach the brain. Among the potential mechanisms underlying particle-induced detrimental effects in the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS), increased oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, microglial activation, disturbance of protein homeostasis, and ultimately, neuronal death are often postulated and concomitantly coincide with the main pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative processes. Other complementary mechanisms by which PM could mediate neurotoxicity and contribute to neurodegeneration remain unconfirmed. Furthermore, the question of how strong and proven air pollutants are as substantial adverse factors for neurodegenerative disease etiologies remains unsolved. This review highlights research advances regarding the issue of PM with an emphasis on neurodegeneration markers, symptoms, and mechanisms by which air pollutants could mediate damage in the CNS. Poor air quality and insufficient knowledge regarding its toxicity justify conducting scientific investigations to understand the biological impact of PM in the context of various types of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Purpose Although subjective knowledge about the prognosis of an advanced disease is extremely important for coping and treatment planning, the concept of prognostic awareness (PA) remains inconsistently defined. The aims of the scoping review were to synthesize a definition of PA from the most recent literature, describe preconditions, correlates and consequences, and suggest a conceptual model. Methods By using scoping review methodology, we searched the Web of Science and PubMed databases, and included publications, reviews, meta-analyses or guidelines on all physical diagnoses, as well as publications offering a conceptual or an operational definition of PA. The data were analyzed by means of content analysis techniques. Results Of the 24 included publications, 21 referred exclusively to cancer, one to patients with hip fractures and two to palliative care in general. The deduced definition of PA comprised the following facets: adequate estimation of chances for recovery, knowledge of limited time to live, adequate estimation of life expectancy, knowledge of therapy goals, and knowledge of the course of the disease. Further content analysis results were mapped graphically and in a detailed table. Conclusion There appears to be a lack of theoretical embedding of PA that in turn influences the methods used for empirical investigation. Drawing on a clear conceptual definition, longitudinal or experimental studies would be desirable.

AB  - In the past two decades, a growing number of early childhood interventions that aim to improve school readiness have also targeted children's executive function (EF), building on the theory that promoting EF skills in preschool may play a key role in reducing the substantial gaps in school readiness and later achievement associated with family income. Despite the expansion of school readiness interventions across preschool, research evidence is mixed regarding what works to promote EF development and the impact of these interventions on children's EF skills, and subsequently, their academic and behavioral outcomes. This paper reviews four intervention approaches designed to support school readiness that may also improve children's EF skills by: (a) encouraging adaptive classroom behaviors, (b) improving social-emotional learning, (c) promoting play and direct training of EF skills, and (d) improving cognitive skills related to EF. We describe program effects from rigorous trials testing these approaches, including summarizing the takeaways from four large-scale intervention research studies conducted by the authors, involving over 5,000 children. We conclude by exploring open questions for the field and future directions for research and intervention program development and refinement.

AB  - Introduction: An important approach to improve the therapeutic effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be to early characterize patients who are more likely to respond. Our objective was to explore whether baseline electroencephalography (EEG) settings before the beginning of ECT treatment can predict future clinical response to ECT in patients with depressive disorder. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases to identify studies using EEG in adults with depressive disorder treated by ECT. To investigate the predictive value of baseline EEG on clinical outcomes of ECT, we extracted from the retrieved studies and qualitatively described the association between the baseline EEG markers characteristics and the rates of future responders and/or remitters to ECT. Results: The primary search yielded 2,531 potentially relevant citations, and 12 articles were selected according to inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were prospective studies with small sample size. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients, ECT settings, EEG settings, and outcomes were heterogeneous. Event-related potential (ERP) paradigms were used in three studies, polysomnography was used in three studies, and the six other studies used EEG to measure cerebral connectivity and activity. Conclusions: P300 amplitude, coherence, and connectivity measures were correlated with remission in patients with depression treated by ECT. Sleep EEG recordings seemed not to be correlated with remission after ECT. Further prospective studies with large sample size are needed to determine optimal EEG parameters associated with clinical response to ECT in depressive disorder.

   Recent studies identified specific gut microbial species linked to various human diseases, and gut-brain axis is currently attracting much attention in the field of microbiome science clinically and biologically. Research on multiple sclerosis (MS) and its mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is one of the most active research subjects. Notably, recent achievements established the bidirectional causality between MS and gut microbiome. The reduction of gut microbiome-derived short chain fatty acids and the enrichment of gut-associated oxidative stress appear to be promoting for neurodegenerative processes. Also, researchers are trying to elucidate the mechanisms by which the microbiome regulates the onset and progression of MS. The new findings achieved by the analysis of the causal relationship between MS and the gut microbiome will provide a new therapeutic strategy for MS. These results will contribute to our understanding of the cause, prevention, and treatment of MS, and will lead to a complete cure for this disease in the future. In MS, for which no curative treatment has yet to be established, the unmet needs may be overcome through the analysis of gut microbiome. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB  - In recent years, the application of virtual reality (VR) for therapeutic purposes has escalated dramatically. Favorable properties of VR for engaging patients with autism, in particular, have motivated an enormous body of investigations targeting autism-related disabilities with this technology. This study aims to provide a comprehensive meta-analysis for evaluating the effectiveness of VR on the rehabilitation and training of individuals diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic search of related databases and, after screening for inclusion criteria, reviewed 33 studies for more detailed analysis. Results revealed that individuals undergoing VR training have remarkable improvements with a relatively large effect size with Hedges g of 0.74. Furthermore, the results of the analysis of different skills indicated diverse effectiveness. The strongest effect was observed for daily living skills (g = 1.15). This effect was moderate for other skills: g = 0.45 for cognitive skills, g = 0.46 for emotion regulation and recognition skills, and g = 0.69 for social and communication skills. Moreover, five studies that had used augmented reality also showed promising efficacy (g = 0.92) that calls for more research on this tool. In conclusion, the application of VR-based settings in clinical practice is highly encouraged, although their standardization and customization need more research.

AB  - According to the WHO, major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and it is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. The pathophysiology of this common and chronic disease is still not completely understood. The gut microbiome is an increasingly recognized environmental factor that can have a role in depression, acting through the gut-microbiota-brain axis. The available treatment for depression is still insufficient since 30% of patients are treatment-resistant. There is an unquestionable need for novel strategies. Ketamine is an effective antidepressant in treatment-resistant patients. It is suggested that the antidepressant effect of ketamine may be partially mediated by the modification of gut microbiota. In this study, we presented a review of data on gut microbiota in depression with special attention to the effect of ketamine on the microbiome in animal models of depression. Earlier reports are preliminary and are still insufficient to draw firm conclusion, but further studies in this field might help to understand the role of the gut-brain axis in the treatment of depression and might be the ground for developing new effective treatment strategies.

AB  - While there has been a slew of review studies on suicide measurement tools until now, there were not any reviews focusing on suicide assessment tools available in Korea. This review aimed to examine the psychometric properties of tools developed in Korea or the translated versions from the original tools in their foreign language and to identify potential improvements and supplements for these tools. A literature search was done using the Korean academic information search service, Research Information Service System, to identify the suicide measures to be included in this review. Abstracts were screened to identify which measures were used to assess suicide-related factors. Based on the established inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 tools remained and we assessed their psychometric properties. The current review indicated several major findings. First, many of the tools did not report predictive validity and even those with predictive validity were based on past suicide attempts. Second, some of the tools overlooked the interactive component for the cause of suicide. In addition, information to supplement the self-reported and clinician-administered reports by collecting reports from the subjects' families and acquaintances is needed. It is also important to develop a screening tool that examines other aspects of an individual's personal life, including unemployment, bereavement, divorce, and childhood trauma. Moreover, tools that have been studied in more diverse groups of the population are needed to increase external validity. Finally, the linguistic translation of the tools into Korean needs to consider other cultural, social, and psychological factors of the sample of interest.

AB  - The efficacy and safety of adjunctive nonconvulsive electrotherapy (NET) for patients with depression are undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of adjunctive NET for patients with depression. Chinese (WanFang and Chinese Journal Net) and English (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library) databases were systematically searched from their inception until Jan 27, 2021 by three independent investigators. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 3 treatment arms (n = 108) and two observational studies (single-group, before-after design, n = 31) were included. In the RCT, the antidepressant efficacy of NET on depression was similar to that of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (P > 0.05) but with significantly fewer neurocognitive impairments as measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) (P < 0.05). In two observational studies, the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) scores decreased significantly from baseline to post-NET (all Ps < 0.05), without adverse neurocognitive effects. In the RCT, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were not separately reported among the 3 treatment arms but a similar rate of discontinuation was reported. The currently available limited evidence from 3 studies suggests that NET as an adjunctive treatment may be a safe, well-tolerated, effective therapy for depression without serious neurocognitive impairments.

AB  - Whether and to what degree information can be processed non-consciously has been a matter of debate since the emergence of psychology as a science. Emotional information, in particular, has often been assumed to have a privileged status because of its relevance for well-being and survival (e.g., to detect a threat). Indeed, many studies have explored non-conscious processing of evaluative (i.e., "emotional" in a broad sense) or emotional (e.g., facial expressions) features using the "silver bullet" of non-consciousness research - the masked sequential priming paradigm. In its prototypical form, this paradigm involves the categorization of target stimuli according to valence (e.g., is the target positive or negative?). Each target is preceded by a briefly presented prime that is followed by a mask to constrain awareness. Non-conscious processing is inferred from subtle influences of the prime on target processing, that is, whether responses are faster if prime and target are valence-congruent or not. We will review this research with a focus on three questions: first, which methods are used in this area to establish non-conscious processing? Second, is there evidence for non-conscious extraction of evaluative information? Third, is there evidence for non-conscious processing beyond a simple valence (positive/negative) discrimination, for example, processing of emotion-specific information? We will highlight important current debates and potential directions in which the field will move in the future.

AB  - The effectiveness of policymakers' decision-making in times of crisis depends largely on their ability to integrate and make sense of information. The COVID-19 crisis confronts governments with the difficult task of making decisions in the interest of public health and safety. Essentially, policymakers have to react to a threat, of which the extent is unknown, and they are making decisions under time constraints in the midst of immense uncertainty. The stakes are high, the issues involved are complex and require the careful balancing of several interests, including (mental) health, the economy, and human rights. These circumstances render policymakers' decision-making processes vulnerable to errors and biases in the processing of information, thereby increasing the chances of faulty decision-making processes with poor outcomes. Prior research has identified three main information-processing failures that can distort group decision-making processes and can lead to negative outcomes: (1) failure to search for and share information, (2) failure to elaborate on and analyze information that is not in line with earlier information and (3) failure to revise and update conclusions and policies in the light of new information. To date, it has not yet been explored how errors and biases underlying these information-processing failures impact decision-making processes in times of crisis. In this narrative review, we outline how groupthink, a narrow focus on the problem of containing the virus, and escalation of commitment may pose real risks to decision-making processes in handling the COVID-19 crisis and may result in widespread societal damages. Hence, it is vital that policymakers take steps to maximize the quality of the decision-making process and increase the chances of positive outcomes as the crisis goes forward. We propose group reflexivity-a deliberate process of discussing team goals, processes, or outcomes-as an antidote to these biases and errors in decision-making. Specifically, we recommend several evidence-based reflexivity tools that could easily be implemented to counter these information-processing errors and improve decision-making processes in uncertain times.

AB  - The continuous improvement of living standards is related to higher requirements for the freshness and taste of food. For example, synthetic phenolic antioxidants (SPAs) are added to fats and fried foods as food additives to minimize the oxidative rancidity of oils and fats. Hence, the global use of SPAs is increasing year by year. Dibutyl hydroxytoluene is one of the widely used SPAs, often in combination with butyl hydroxyanisole or gallate SPAs. The extensive use of these compounds makes them and their transformation products to be widespread in various environmental matrices, including indoor dust, wastewater, river water, sewage sludge, and sediment, as well as human samples, such as nails and urine, at concentrations varying from nanogram per gram (ng/g) to microgram per gram (mu g/g). Animal experiments have shown that high-dose SPA exposure is toxic, which may lead to DNA damage and mismatches and the development of cancerous tumors. Since the biosphere shares the same set of genetic codes, humans and animals have many identical or similar feedback mechanisms and information pathways. Therefore, the damage of SPAs to animals may also threaten human health. This review discusses the properties, occurrence, analysis, and environmental health risks of typical SPAs, including butyl hydroxyanisole, dibutyl hydroxytoluene, tert-butylhydroquinone, propyl gallate, octyl gallate, and lauryl gallate, used as food additives. In addition, AO2246, which is used in food packaging bags, is also considered. Future research directions on SPAs and their transformation products (TPs) are identified and discussed.

AB  - Soil is a living heterogeneous body mass consists of solid, water, gases, organic, inorganic matters and organisms and acts upon as a source and sink of any contaminant. Nanotechnology is a diversified, dynamic and transformative technology, which stimulates the scientific innovation for the betterment of different sectors of the society which produces large number of nanocontaminants. Nanocontaminants in the soil are a major concern because of their toxicities with subsequent threat to soil, environment and human community. These contaminants may badly influence soil ecology, crop production, or product quality, ground water purity and human health. Moreover, the safety protocol for the specific nanocontaminants is yet to be developed to protect our environment and ecology. Of late many research experiments were conducted to investigate and comprehend the outcome, lethal dose and behaviour of nanocontaminants and consequently to extend this knowledge for development of bio-safety protocol to handle the nanocontaminants in the coming decade. Research initiatives are focused on to understand the impacts of manufactured nanoparticles on human being, soil and formulate combat mechanisms to mitigate the adverse consequences of nanocontaminants on human health and soil quality. While this attempt signifies an exclusive chance for soil scientists to investigate these highly potential technologies, it also emphasizes on foremost challenges to a field of research that has great scope to predict the consequences of nanocontaminants on the soil ecology and animal health. Currently nanocontaminants draw the major world research attention and need more endeavours to entirely assess their impacts. This review documented an outline of impacts of nanocontaminants in soil, which highlights the understanding of major interactive effects of nanocontaminants on soil organisms, plants, and human. This article also provides highlights of the challenges that soil researchers and policy makers face when developing risk assessment tool for nanocontaminants in soil and subsequently for human being.

AB  - This review aimed to synthesize qualitative evidence of views and experiences of partners and other family members who provided breastfeeding support for a relative. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence was followed. Seven databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Maternal and Infant Care, and Web of Science were searched. Partners and other family members (e.g. grandmothers, siblings) of women in any countries were included. Included papers were critically appraised. The JBI meta-aggregative approach was used to analyze data and form synthesized findings. Seventy-six papers from 74 studies were included. Five synthesized findings were: (i) spectrum of family members' breastfeeding knowledge, experiences and roles; (ii) the complexity of infant feeding decision making; (iii) the controversy of breastfeeding in front of others; (iv) impact of breastfeeding on family; and (v) it takes more than just family members: support for family members. Partners' and family members' views and experiences of breastfeeding support reflected multi-faceted personal, social, financial, cultural, religious, emotional, psychological, and societal factors of the support they provided (or not). Healthcare professionals should engage them in breastfeeding discussions with the woman, and offer tailored and practical guidance relevant to help them to appropriately support the woman.

AB  - Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is associated with neuroinflammation by triggering the systemic inflammatory responses. Related studies have demonstrated that ulinastatin, which is a urinary trypsin inhibitor, inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators and improved postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing major surgery. However, there are controversial results put forwarded by some studies. This systemic review aimed to evaluate the effect of ulinastatin on POCD in elderly patients undergoing surgery. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Ovid to find relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ulinastatin on POCD in elderly patients undergoing surgery. The primary outcomes included the incidence of POCD and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. The secondary outcome was the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, S100 beta, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10. RevMan 5.3 was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Results: Ten RCTs were included finally. Compared with controls, ulinastatin significantly reduced the incidence of POCD [risk ratio (RR) = 0.29, 95% CI 0.21-0.41, test of RR = 1: Z = 7.05, p < 0.00001]. In addition, patients in the ulinastatin group have lower levels of TNF-alpha, S100 beta, CRP, and IL-6 and higher level of IL-10 in serum following surgery. Conclusion: These findings suggested that ulinastatin can be used as an anti-inflammatory drug for POCD prevention in elderly patients undergoing surgery.

AB  - Directionally opposite to placebo effects are the nocebo effects that negatively impact people's thoughts, feelings, and actions. An important but scarcely studied aspect of everyday functioning is motor performance, in which nocebo effects might impair athletic skills and the much-needed purposeful daily movements and motor actions. The aim of this literature review is to unveil the nocebo effects on motor performance.
   Searched databases were PubMed, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus. Twenty-one articles, reporting 23 studies, met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the current review. All reports exhibited "some" risk of bias. Of the 23 studies, 14 found a nocebo effect on motor performance, equivocal results emerged from two studies, and negative findings were reported in seven studies. Most (10/12) studies using a between-subjects design have reported a nocebo effect. The mean effect size was 0.60, suggesting a medium-to-large effect of nocebo intervention on motor performance. Based on this review, we conclude that nocebo effects do influence motor performance and can be evoked with negative verbal information. This effect may be more robust than the placebo effect but also depends on the type of motor performance, on the examined sample, and on the nocebo agent. Hence, nocebo effects should be recognized and controlled in empirical research on motor performance, and they should be prevented or extinguished in practical and therapeutic settings. More extensive examination of the nocebo effect on motor performance is warranted, especially using between-subjects research design and a "no agent" control condition.

AB  - Modern wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effectively remove microplastics (MPs) from wastewater and unsurprisingly concentrate them in sludge. Hence through its beneficial use and disposal, sludge causes secondary release pathways of an estimated average amount of 106 to 1014 wastewater-based MPs to various environmental compartments yearly. Despite these numbers, studies investigating sludge are scarce. Currently, majority of the studies in the field focus on identifying the magnitude of the problem, whereas research investigating the fate and effects of MPs during sludge treatment are very rare. This review aims to bring together and critically evaluate the limited studies conducted about MPs in the sludge treatment line and bring out the key gaps and research needs in the area. Studies conducted so far indicate that depending on the type, size, and amount of MPs, their effects during anaerobic digestion differ, with some studies demonstrating serious negative impact on biogas production. Possible effect mechanisms are also suggested such as formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leaching of toxic chemicals. Moreover, a potential for sludge treatment processes (thickening, dewatering, drying, stabilization, etc.) to change the characteristics and the number of MPs, which may increase surface area available for adsorption and desorption of pollutants, was observed. Review uncovers that, in the broad universe of MPs, some highly abundant ones in sludge such as polypropylene, polyurethane, polycarbonate, and acrylic are not yet investigated in sludge treatment. Future research should focus not only to investigate the fate/effects but to fully understand the mechanisms behind these, which is missing in many studies reviewed. Besides, new studies show that effect of MPs start from the floc formation stage during biological treatment, which in fact determine the final sludge behavior in thickening and dewatering. Therefore, holistic approaches starting from wastewater till sludge exits WWTP seem necessary. Substantiating from polymer chemistry and response of plastics to stress conditions, review suggests possibilities of deterioration during sludge treatment processes. It becomes evident that some totally uninvestigated aspects such as disintegration conducted before stabilization, can change the fate of MPs during sludge treatment and may bring new perspectives to the solution of the problem.

AB  - Macrophytes have often been considered as a prospective tool for the elimination of cyanobacterial bloom, be-cause they may produce chemical compounds that outcompete bloom-forming cyanobacteria. However, a com-prehensive, unbiased overview of evidence to support this is missing. Moreover, studies into the effects of individual macrophyte species have often used different methodologies and, thus, cannot be compared. Herein, we firstly carried out a systematic review of studies into the effects of macrophytes on the growth of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Secondly, we carried out an experiment into the effects of aqueous and ethanol extracts from 19 macrophyte species on the growth of two of the most common cyanobacteria, Aphanizomenon gracile and Microcystis aeruginosa, using a uniform methodological approach. The systematic review revealed that most of the 69 macrophyte species previously studied have shown a combination of inhibitory, stimulatory, and neutral effects. In our own experiment, an inhibitory effect was exhibited only 15 times out of 532 experi-mental variants, specifically by Chara globularis, Ceratophyllum submersum, Elodea nuttallii, Hydrilla verticillata, Myriophyllum heterophyllum, M. spicatum, and Vallisneria americana. Put together, these results indicate that the practical application of chemical compounds produced by macrophytes to eliminate cyanobacterial bloom may have lower prospects than previously anticipated.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) stigma is one barrier to TB testing, treatment uptake, and treatment completion. Therefore, stigma measurement must be approached through rigorous scientific methodology in order to accurately and reliably estimate the impact of TB stigma on treatment outcomes. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the methods and instruments used to measure TB stigma and interrogate strategies used to culturally validate measures of TB stigma in global research. Two reviewers used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method to extract and analyze the existing body of literature on TB stigma in Sub-Saharan Africa. A thorough search was performed using three databases generating 2,302 independent studies. After the systematic screening, this review includes 28 studies. Of those studies, 13 used a psychometrically validated instrument while 15 used informal questionnaires or proxy variables to measure stigma. The psychometric appraisal was limited due to the number of studies that measured stigma using unvalidated questionnaires or proxy variables. The Patient and Community Perceptions of TB scales validated by Van Rie et al. were the most commonly used instruments to measure TB stigma; additionally, many instruments were not culturally or linguistically validated in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our appraisal emphasizes the need for reliable and valid instruments to measure TB stigma in low- and middle-income countries most affected by TB.

AB  - Background Suicide is one of the leading mental health crises and takes one life every 40 seconds. Four out of every five suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries. Despite religion being a protective factor against suicide, the estimated number of suicides is rapidly increasing in Pakistan. Aims Our review focuses on the trends of suicide and means of self-poisoning in the past three decades, and the management of commonly used poisons. Method We searched two electronic databases (PubMed and PakMediNet) for published English-language studies describing agents used for suicide in different regions of Pakistan. A total of 46 out of 85 papers (N = 54 747 cases) met our inclusion criteria. Results Suicidal behaviour was more common among individuals younger than 30 years. Females comprised 60% of those who attempted suicide in our study sample, although the ratio of completed suicides favoured males. There were regional trends in the choice of agent for overdose. Organophosphate poisoning was reported across the nation, with a predominance of cases from the agricultural belt of South Punjab and interior Sindh. Aluminium phosphide ('wheat pills') was a preferred agent in North Punjab, whereas paraphenylenediamine ('kala pathar') was implicated in deaths by suicide from South Punjab. Urban areas had other means for suicide, including household chemicals, benzodiazepines, kerosene oil and rat poison. Conclusions Urgent steps are needed, including psychoeducational campaigns on mental health and suicide, staff training, medical resources for prompt treatment of self-poisoning and updated governmental policy to regulate pesticide sales.

AB  - Purpose To summarize and describe the available knowledge on dermatological manifestation of eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified, diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV-TR and 5th edition. Methods We searched in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases from January 1, 1980 through May 1, 2020 for papers in English language on the skin manifestation of eating disorders. Results were screened using the PRISMA tool. Results The study yielded 207 results. According with PRISMA guidelines, 26 papers were included in the review. More than 73% of screened papers (19/26) were case reports. Cross-sectional studies represented the 19.2% of screened papers (5/26). Each eligible study has been screened and analyzed. Conclusion Huge heterogeneity of skin signs of eating disorders were identified. The number of controlled studies available is very limited, and most papers of interest are case reports or narrative review articles. Larger, more methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate the presence of dermatological issue in eating disorder patients are needed.

AB  - Introduction: Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) use is a global concern due to increased usage and the harm to physical, mental, and social well-being. The objective of this overview of systematic reviews is to summarise trial results of psychosocial interventions and describe their efficacy and safety. Methods: We searched seven bibliographic databases to November 2020 for systematic reviews examining ATS misuse treatment by psychosocial interventions. Given the apparent incompleteness of the included reviews, we undertook a supplemental meta-analysis of all eligible primary studies. Results: We included 11 systematic reviews of moderate to high quality and 39 primary studies which assessed the outcomes of psychosocial interventions on people who use ATS. The key findings include: (1) There were conflicting results about the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions among reviews, which may confuse decision-makers in selecting treatment. (2) In the supplemental meta-analysis, relative to usual care (only counselling or self-help materials), membership of a psychological intervention group was associated with an important reduction in drug usage [risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.85]. Patients in psychological interventions used injectables substantially less [odds ratio (OR) 0.35, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.49]. The risk of unsafe sex in the psychosocial intervention group was lower than in the control group (RR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.71). The combination of therapies reduced 1.51 day using drugs in the preceding 30 days (95% CI: -2.36 to -0.67) compared to cognitive behavioural therapy intervention alone. (3) Compared to usual care, cognitive behavioural therapy was less likely to be retained at follow-up (RR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.97; high-quality evidence). However, the additional of contingency management strategy can make an important improvement upon retention (RR 1.42, 95%CI: 1.25 to 1.62). Authors' Conclusions: Integrated models are more effective than a single-treatment strategy. Comprehensive and sustained psychosocial interventions can help to reduce use of ATS and other drugs, risk behaviours and mental disorders, and significantly improve treatment adherence.

AB  - Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases are characterized by selective degeneration of specific brain areas. Although increasing number of studies report alteration of the extracellular matrix on these diseases, an exhaustive characterization at the brain's matrix level might contribute to the development of more efficient cell restoration therapies. In that regard, proteomics-based studies are a powerful approach to uncover matrix changes. However, to date, the majority of proteomics studies report no or only a few brain matrix proteins with altered expression. This study aims to reveal the changes in the brain extracellular matrix by integrating several proteomics-based studies performed with postmortem tissue. In total, 67 matrix proteins with altered expression were collected. By applying a bioinformatic approach, we were able to reveal the dysregulated biological processes. Among them are processes related to the organization of the extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans' metabolism, blood coagulation, and response to injury and oxidative stress. In addition, a protein was found altered in all three diseases-collagen type I alpha 2-and its binding partners further identified. A ClueGO network was created, depicting the GO groups associated with these binding partners, uncovering the processes that may consequently be affected. These include cellular adhesion, cell signaling through membrane receptors, inflammatory processes, and apoptotic cell death in response to oxidative stress. Overall, we were able to associate the contribution of the modification of extracellular matrix components to essential biological processes, highlighting the investment needed on proteomics studies with specific focus on the extracellular matrix in neurodegeneration.

AB  - It is widely projected that under future climate scenarios the economic importance of Arctic Ocean fish stocks will increase. The Arctic Ocean is especially vulnerable to ocean acidification and already experiences low pH levels not projected to occur on a global scale until 2100. This paper outlines how ocean acidification must be considered with other potential stressors to accurately predict movement of fish stocks toward, and within, the Arctic and to inform future fish stock management strategies. First, we review the literature on ocean acidification impacts on fish, next we identify the main obstacles that currently preclude ocean acidification from Arctic fish stock projections. Finally, we provide a roadmap to describe how satellite observations can be used to address these gaps: improve knowledge, inform experimental studies, provide regional assessments of vulnerabilities, and implement appropriate management strategies. This roadmap sets out three inter-linked research priorities: (1) Establish organisms and ecosystem physiochemical baselines by increasing the coverage of Arctic physicochemical observations in both space and time; (2) Understand the variability of all stressors in space and time; (3) Map life histories and fish stocks against satellite-derived observations of stressors.

AB  - The present work contains a personal perspective on what sport and exercise psychology (SEP) is today. It is a global synthesis of research about psychological aspects related to the context and practice of sport and exercise. The intended impact was to positively influence teaching SEP to students, to promote interdisciplinary research and practice, and to assist the development of SEP as an applied science by helping experts develop a more holistic view of the field. Over 650 theoretical and review articles about psychological concepts in connection to sport and exercise were read in the process of creating a conceptual model that reflects the essence of SEP and leads to a conceptualization of SEP based on research topics. The result was a knowledge map of SEP made up of four main research clusters: biopsychological descriptors, external variables, psychological skills, and applied SEP practice. In terms of interdisciplinarity, the present perspective on SEP suggests that sport and exercise can be used as a research paradigm or natural laboratory to study psychological aspects relevant to various scientific fields, and that sport and exercise can be used as a therapeutic framework in response to challenges that researchers and practitioners in these fields are typically addressing.

AB  - Background This meta-analysis aimed to investigate serum and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in comparison to healthy controls. Methods Following the PRISMA protocol, we searched for the relevant studies through the databases of Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and web of science until September 2019 with no time restriction. Overall, nine studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Data were pooled using a random-effects model; in addition, standard mean difference (SMD) and/or weight mean difference (WMD) was calculated. Cochran's Q test and I-square (I-2) statistics were used to evaluate between-study heterogeneity. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Statistical analyses were done using the STATA version 14. Results Our systematic review included nine case-control studies (including 367 cases and 337 controls). Pooling findings from these studies showed a significantly higher MDA level in OCD patient compared to control groups (SMD = 1.62; 95% CI [0.53, 2.72]; I-2 = 96.9%; Pheterogeneity (Ph) < 0.001). This finding remained unchanged among studies which reported MDA in the same unit (WMD = 1.93; 95% CI [0.27, 3.59]; I-2 = 99.2%; Ph < 0.001). Subgroup analysis by the study location and sample size revealed findings that were also significant. Conclusion We found that MDA levels are higher in OCD patients than healthy controls. This finding highlights the importance of inflammatory responses in OCD patients that should be considered for future investigations. Further studies are recommended to expand current knowledge on this issue.

AB  - Accessible neuroimaging tools that can identify specific frontal lobe dysfunction associated with psychiatric disorders could be useful for improving disease diagnosis and prognosis and treatment development. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), in conjunction with the verbal fluency test (VFT), has emerged as an inexpensive and convenient method for understanding psychiatric disorders. However, questions remain regarding the specificity and uniqueness of fNIRS measurements for different disorders and the soundness of the methods applied previously. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of fNIRS studies using the VFT to probe psychiatric disorders. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and PsycINFO on October 27, 2020. Overall, 82% and 49% of the 121 included studies reported significantly reduced changes in oxyhemoglobin concentrations (HbO) and significantly fewer produced words during the VFT in psychiatric patients compared with healthy controls, respectively. For most psychiatric disorders, changes in HbO are more sensitive than changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentrations and VFT performance to detect psychopathologies. In addition, meta-analyses based on the proportion of channels that exhibited significant differences in HbO changes between patients and controls and on the effect sizes of group differences consistently showed that for major depression and schizophrenia, hypoactivation could be found across the frontotemporal regions, but its topographical distribution is disorder-specific. Thus, the fNIRS-VFT paradigm holds promise for understanding, detecting, and differentiating psychiatric disorders, and has the potential for developing accessible neuroimaging biomarkers for different psychiatric disorders. The findings are discussed with regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the applied methods, following by recommendations.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Existing pharmaceutical treatments offer alleviation of symptoms but cannot delay disease progression and are often associated with significant side effects. Clinical studies have demonstrated that acupuncture may be beneficial for PD treatment, particularly in terms of ameliorating PD symptoms when combined with anti-PD medication, reducing the required dose of medication and associated side effects. During early stages of PD, acupuncture may even be used to replace medication. It has also been found that acupuncture can protect dopaminergic neurons from degeneration via antioxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic pathways as well as modulating the neurotransmitter balance in the basal ganglia circuit. Here, we review current studies and reflect on the potential of acupuncture as a novel and effective treatment strategy for PD. We found that particularly during the early stages, acupuncture may reduce neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons and regulate the balance of the dopaminergic circuit, thus delaying the progression of the disease. The benefits of acupuncture will need to be further verified through basic and clinical studies.

AB  - Experimental psychologists often neglect the poor psychometric properties of the dependent measures collected in their studies. In particular, a low reliability of measures can have dramatic consequences for the interpretation of key findings in some of the most popular experimental paradigms, especially when strong inferences are drawn from the absence of statistically significant correlations. In research on unconscious cognition, for instance, it is commonly argued that the lack of a correlation between task performance and measures of awareness or explicit recollection of the target stimuli provides strong support for the conclusion that the cognitive processes underlying performance must be unconscious. Using contextual cuing of visual search as a case study, we show that given the low reliability of the dependent measures collected in these studies, it is usually impossible to draw any firm conclusion about the unconscious character of this effect from correlational analyses. Furthermore, both a psychometric meta-analysis of the available evidence and a cognitive-modeling approach suggest that, in fact, we should expect to see very low correlations between performance and awareness at the empirical level, even if both constructs are perfectly related at the latent level. Convincing evidence for the unconscious character of contextual cuing and other effects will most likely demand richer and larger data sets, coupled with more powerful analytic approaches.

AB  - While transnational social ties and exchanges are a core concern within migration studies, health researchers have often overlooked their importance. Continuous and circular exchanges of information within transnational networks, also defined as social remittances, facilitate the diffusion of innovations, potentially driving contemporary social and cultural change. Influences on health, wellbeing, and care-seeking are important, but under-researched, dimensions for consideration. We undertook a systematic narrative evidence synthesis to describe the current state of knowledge in this area and to identify gaps and future directions for health researchers to take. Between April 2017 and May 2019, an iterative series of searches in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and PubMed, plus backward and forward citation searches identified 1173 potential papers. Screening resulted in 36 included papers, eighteen focused on migrant populations and eighteen on those who remain behind. The top three health topics were health-seeking strategies, sexual and reproductive health issues, and healthcare support. And, while not always explicitly identified, mental health and wellbeing was a further prominent, cross-cutting theme. Articles on migrant populations were all conducted in the global North and 13 out of 18 used qualitative methods. Five main themes were identified: therapeutic effect of the continuing social relationships, disrupted social relationships, hybridisation of healthcare, facilitation of connections to healthcare providers, and factors encouraging or undermining transnational social exchanges. Papers concerned with those who remain behind were mainly focused on the global South and used a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Four main themes were identified: transnational transfer of health-related advice, norms, and support; associations between migrant linkages and health behaviours/outcomes; transnational collective transfer of health knowledge; and power and resistance in exchanges. Findings suggest that transnational social exchanges can both support and undermine the health of migrants and those who remain behind. This review confirms that the volume and quality of research in this area must be increased so that health policy and practice can be informed by a better understanding of these important influences on the health of both migrants and those who remain behind.

AB  - The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. There is still no available disease-modifying strategy against PD, whose management is mainly symptomatic. A growing amount of preclinical evidence shows that a complex interplay between autophagy dysregulation, mitochondrial impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and excessive neuroinflammation underlies PD pathogenesis. Identifying key molecules linking these pathological cellular processes may substantially aid in our deeper understanding of PD pathophysiology and the development of novel effective therapeutic approaches. Emerging preclinical evidence indicates that apelin, an endogenous neuropeptide acting as a ligand of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor APJ, may play a key neuroprotective role in PD pathogenesis, via inhibition of apoptosis and dopaminergic neuronal loss, autophagy enhancement, antioxidant effects, endoplasmic reticulum stress suppression, as well as prevention of synaptic dysregulation in the striatum, excessive neuroinflammation, and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Underlying signaling pathways involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and inositol requiring kinase 1 alpha/XBP1/C/EBP homologous protein. Herein, we discuss the role of apelin/APJ axis and associated molecular mechanisms on the pathogenesis of PD in vitro and in vivo and provide evidence for its challenging therapeutic potential.

AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to review international literature systematically to estimate the prevalence of homelessness among incarcerated persons at the time of imprisonment and the time of discharge.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A systematic review methodology was used to identify quantitative observational studies that looked at the prevalence of homelessness at the time of imprisonment, or up to 30 days prior to that point (initial homelessness), and at the time of discharge from prisons. Studies reported in English from inception to 11 September 2019 were searched for using eight databases (PsycInfo, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycArticles, Scopus, Web of Science and the Campbell Collaboration), in addition to grey literature. Studies were screened independently by three researchers. Results of studies meeting inclusion criteria were meta-analysed using a random effects model to generate pooled prevalence data.
   Findings
   A total of 18 out of 2,131 studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies originated from the USA, Canada, UK, Ireland or Australia. The estimated prevalence of initial homelessness was 23.41% and at time of discharge was 29.94%. Substantial heterogeneity was observed among studies.
   Originality/value
   People in prisons are over twenty times more likely to be homeless than those in the general population. This is likely attributable to a range of health and social factors. Studies in this analysis suggest higher rates of homelessness in minority populations and among those with mental illnesses and neurodevelopmental disorders. While there was significant heterogeneity among studies, the results highlight the global burden of this issue and a clear necessity for targeted interventions to address homelessness in this population.

AB  - A recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that positive affective variables (PAVs) partially mediate physical activity (PA) interventions. However, the effectiveness of each intervention technique on PAVs and PA is still unknown. Thus, this meta-analytic review included two primary objectives: (1) to summarize intervention effects on PA and PAVs; (2) to examine each behavior change technique's effectiveness in modifying PAVs and PA. Following PRISMA protocols, we had searched five electronic databases by April 1, 2020. The random-effect model in the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3 was adopted to perform these meta-analytic analyses. The search identified 1,742 articles, and 37 studies (49 datasets) met our inclusion criteria. Finally, inferential statistics yielded that: the utilization of "teach to use prompts/cues," "facilitate social comparison," and "provide information on consequences of behavior in general" had positive effects on PA or PAVs outcomes; the utilization of "barrier identification/problem solving" and "plan social support/social change" negatively affected on PA or PAVs outcomes. However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the findings. Nonetheless, this paper has considerable implications for guiding future comparative intervention studies to achieve more reliable outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: Music therapy is increasingly being used to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals. However, publications on the global trends of music therapy using bibliometric analysis are rare. The study aimed to use the CiteSpace software to provide global scientific research about music therapy from 2000 to 2019. Methods: Publications between 2000 and 2019 related to music therapy were searched from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The CiteSpace V software was used to perform co-citation analysis about authors, and visualize the collaborations between countries or regions into a network map. Linear regression was applied to analyze the overall publication trend. Results: In this study, a total of 1,004 studies met the inclusion criteria. These works were written by 2,531 authors from 1,219 institutions. The results revealed that music therapy publications had significant growth over time because the linear regression results revealed that the percentages had a notable increase from 2000 to 2019 (t = 14.621, P < 0.001). The United States had the largest number of published studies (362 publications), along with the following outputs: citations on WoS (5,752), citations per study (15.89), and a high H-index value (37). The three keywords "efficacy," "health," and "older adults," emphasized the research trends in terms of the strongest citation bursts. Conclusions: The overall trend in music therapy is positive. The findings provide useful information for music therapy researchers to identify new directions related to collaborators, popular issues, and research frontiers. The development prospects of music therapy could be expected, and future scholars could pay attention to the clinical significance of music therapy to improve the quality of life of people.

AB  - Prenatal insult exposure effects on the offspring, have and are still considered the main interest of most teratological studies, while paternal and maternal preconception effects have received relatively little interest. Once thought to be a myth, paternal exposure to insults leading to numerous detrimental effects in the offspring, has been confirmed on several occasions and is gaining increased attention. These effects could be demonstrated molecularly, biochemically and/or behaviorally. Different epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed for these effects to occur, including DNA methylation, histone modification and sperm RNA transmission. Paternal insult exposure has been shown to cause several neurobehavioral and developmental defects in the offspring. Findings on parental insult exposure effects on the progeny will be discussed in this review, with the main focus being on neurobehavioral effects after parental preconceptional exposure. The exposure to the insults induced longlasting, mostly marked, defects. A few pioneering, prevention and reversal studies were published. Interestingly, most studies were conducted on paternal exposure and, at the present state of this field, on animal models. Clinical translation remains the subsequent challenge.

AB  - The effect of environmental pollution on epigenetic changes and their heredity in affected organisms is of major concern as such changes can play a significant role in adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Changes of epigenetic marks including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA's can induce changes in gene transcription leading to physiological long-term changes or even transgenerational inheritance. Such mechanisms have until recently been scarcely studied in invertebrate organisms, mainly focusing on model species including Caenorhabditis elegans and Daphnia magna. However, more data are becoming available, particularly focused on DNA methylation changes caused by anthropogenic pollutants in a wide range of invertebrates. This review examines the literature from field and laboratory studies utilising invertebrate species exposed to environmental pollutants and their effect on DNA methylation. Possible mechanisms of epigenetic modifications and their role on physiology and adaptation as well as the incidence of intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance are discussed. Furthermore, critical research challenges are defined and the way forward is proposed. Future studies should focus on the use of next generation sequencing tools to define invertebrate methylomes under environmental stress in higher resolution, those data should further be linked to gene expression patterns and phenotypes and detailed studies focusing on transgenerational effects are encouraged. Moreover, studies of other epigenetic mechanisms in various invertebrate species, apart from DNA methylation would provide better understanding of interconnected cross-talk between epigenetic marks. Taken together incorporating epigenetic studies in ecotoxicology context presents a promising tool for development of sensitive biomarkers for environmental stress assessment.

AB  - Study Objectives: We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effects of different regular exercise (lasting at least 2 months on a regular basis) on self-reported and physiological sleep quality in adults. Varied exercise interventions contained traditional physical exercise (e.g., walking, cycling) and mind-body exercise characterized by gentle exercise with coordination of the body (e.g., yoga).
   Methods: Procedures followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Systematical searches were conducted in three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) for relevant research that involved adult participants without pathological diseases receiving exercise intervention. The search strategy was based on the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome study design (PICOS) framework. The self-reported outcomes included varied rating scales of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Subgroup meta-analyses of PSQI scores were conducted based on type of exercise, duration of intervention, and participants' age and gender. The physiological outcomes were measured by Actigraph. All meta-analyses were performed in a fixed or random statistic model using Revman software.
   Results: Twenty-two randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. The overall analysis on subjective outcomes suggests that exercise interventions significantly improved sleep quality in adults compared with control interventions with lower PSQI (MD -2.19; 95% CI -2.96 to -1.41), ISI (MD -1.52; 95% CI -2.63 to -0.41), and ESS (MD -2.55; 95% CI -3.32 to -1.78) scores. Subgroup analyses of PSQI scores showed both physical and mind-body exercise interventions resulted in improvements of subjective sleep to the same extent. Interestingly, short-term interventions (<= 3 months) had a significantly greater reduction in sleep disturbance vs. long-term interventions (>3 months). Regarding physiological sleep, few significant effects were found in various sleep parameters except the increased sleep efficiency in the exercise group vs. control group.
   Conclusions: Results of this systematic review suggest that regular physical as well as mind-body exercise primarily improved subjective sleep quality rather than physiological sleep quality in adults. Specifically, self-reported sleep quality, insomnia severity, and daytime sleepiness could be improved or ameliorated with treatment of exercise, respectively, evaluated by PSQI, ISI, and ESS sleep rating scales.

AB  - This study analyzes the performance of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to screen for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. We divided adults into three groups such as communityindwelling adults, patients with chronic diseases, and psychiatric patients. Electronic searches were performed on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO database using the following keywords: depression, depressive disorder, major, and CES-D scale. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 was applied to assess the risk of bias in diagnostic studies. We reviewed 33 studies, including 18,271 adults that met the selection criteria. In meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity was 0.86 on community-indwelling adults, 0.85 on patients with chronic diseases and 0.85 on psychiatric patients. The pooled specificity was 0.74, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively, and the summary receiver-operating characteristic curves were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.93, respectively. The RE correlation was a negative value (-0.394) only in patients with chronic diseases, showing no heterogeneity between studies. The CES-D, which has shown high diagnostic accuracy in adults, can be recommended for use as a first-stage screener for MDD. As a result, the early application of the CES-D can lead to disease prevention in adults at risk for depression.

AB  - Initiatives to optimise preconception health are emerging following growing recognition that this may improve the health and well-being of women and men of reproductive age and optimise health in their children. To inform and evaluate such initiatives, guidance is required on indicators that describe and monitor population-level preconception health. We searched relevant databases and websites (March 2021) to identify national and international preconception guidelines, recommendations and policy reports. These were reviewed to identify preconception indicators. Indicators were aligned with a measure describing the prevalence of the indicator as recorded in national population-based data sources in England. From 22 documents reviewed, we identified 66 indicators across 12 domains. Domains included wider (social/economic) determinants of health; health care; reproductive health and family planning; health behaviours; environmental exposures; cervical screening; immunisation and infections; mental health, physical health; medication and genetic risk. Sixty-five of the 66 indicators were reported in at least one national routine health data set, survey or cohort study. A measure of preconception health assessment and care was not identified in any current national data source. Perspectives from three (healthcare) professionals described how indicator assessment and monitoring may influence patient care and inform awareness campaign development. This review forms the foundation for developing a national surveillance system for preconception health in England. The identified indicators can be assessed using national data sources to determine the population's preconception needs, improve patient care, inform and evaluate new campaigns and interventions and enhance accountability from responsible agencies to improve preconception health.

AB  - Physically based distributed hydrological models that coupled surface and groundwater processes are the key tools for groundwater resources management. WASH123D is one of the models that integrate multimedia multi-processes to simulate flow in different components of the watershed system at various spatio-temporal scale for watershed planning, management and support decision-making activities. This review study on WASH123D discussed its applications, numerical challenges, issues and future needs. Total 68 research articles were acknowledged since 1998; approximately half of these studies were conducted in south Florida for rehabilitation and management of Floridian aquifer system while others were conducted in river basins of Taiwan for flood forecasting and inundation during typhoons. Most of the WASH123D calibration and validation results for river stage and groundwater level were under satisfactory to very good level based on statistical performance indicators. However, coupled 1D river/2D overland/3D groundwater simulations need high-performance computing resources. Moreover, the integration of WASH123D with other numerical models is the most practical approach for stable and reliable real-time inundation forecasting. Besides the model calibration, WASH123D application was also tested as a case study in sub-regional area of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. The groundwater modeling with multiple pumping scenarios examined the changes in hydraulic drawdown with respect to pumping rate. The long-term pumping slowly increases the drawdown, but it stabilized at a certain level depending on pumping rate. Numerical groundwater modeling is an alternative tool that can best describe aquifer response to external stresses without the need for costly aquifer pumping tests.

AB  - Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are small secreted proteins that support the development, maturation and survival of neurons. NTFs injected into the brain rescue and regenerate certain neuronal populations lost in neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating the potential of NTFs to cure the diseases rather than simply alleviating the symptoms. NTFs (as the vast majority of molecules) do not pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and therefore, are delivered directly into the brain of patients using costly and risky intracranial surgery. The delivery efficacy and poor diffusion of some NTFs inside the brain are considered the major problems behind their modest effects in clinical trials. Thus, there is a great need for NTFs to be delivered systemically thereby avoiding intracranial surgery. Nanoparticles (NPs), particles with the size dimensions of 1-100 nm, can be used to stabilize NTFs and facilitate their transport through the BBB. Several studies have shown that NTFs can be loaded into or attached onto NPs, administered systemically and transported to the brain. To improve the NP-mediated NTF delivery through the BBB, the surface of NPs can be functionalized with specific ligands such as transferrin, insulin, lactoferrin, apolipoproteins, antibodies or short peptides that will be recognized and internalized by the respective receptors on brain endothelial cells. In this review, we elaborate on the most suitable NTF delivery methods and envision "ideal" NTF for Parkinson's disease (PD) and clinical trial thereof. We shortly summarize clinical trials of four NTFs, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), that were tested in PD patients, focusing mainly on GDNF and CDNF. We summarize current possibilities of NP-mediated delivery of NTFs to the brain and discuss whether NPs have impact in improving the properties of NTFs and delivery across the BBB. Emerging delivery approaches and future directions of NTF-based nanomedicine are also discussed.

AB  - Oxidative stress and alpha-synuclein aggregation both drive neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, and the protein kinase c-Abl provides a potential amplifying link between these pathogenic factors. Suppressing interactions between these factors may thus be a viable therapeutic approach for this disorder. To evaluate this possibility, pre-formed alpha-synuclein fibrils (PFFs) were used to induce alpha-synuclein aggregation in neuronal cultures. Exposure to PFFs induced oxidative stress and c-Abl activation in wild-type neurons. By contrast, alpha-synuclein - deficient neurons, which cannot form alpha-synuclein aggregates, failed to exhibit either oxidative stress or cAbl activation. N-acetyl cysteine, a thiol repletion agent that supports neuronal glutathione metabolism, suppressed the PFF - induced redox stress and c-Abl activation in the wild-type neurons, and likewise suppressed alpha-synuclein aggregation. Parallel findings were observed in mouse brain: PFF-induced alpha-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra was associated with redox stress, c-Abl activation, and dopaminergic neuronal loss, along with microglial activation and motor impairment, all of which were attenuated with oral N-acetyl cysteine. Similar results were obtained using AAV-mediated alpha-synuclein overexpression as an alternative means of driving alpha-synuclein aggregation in vivo. These findings show that alpha-synuclein aggregates induce c-Abl activation by a redox stress mechanism. c-Abl activation in turn promotes alpha-synuclein aggregation, in a feed-forward interaction. The capacity of N-acetyl cysteine to interrupt this interaction adds mechanistic support its consideration as a therapeutic in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Initially, COVID-19 is a disease that attacks the respiratory tract, but now the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are various, including acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Emergency surgeries such as mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for AIS must be performed without any delay even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce morbidity and mortality. Besides the focus on patient's health, the safety of healthcare workers must also be considered. The aim of the study was to evaluate and summarize the scientific literature systematically to explore MT for AIS in the COVID-19 pandemic.Data synthesisThe independent reviewers searched the literature through 12 electronic databases, searching for articles fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data from all included studies were presented in a summary table featuring key points of each study. The authors independently assessed the risk of bias of 15 included articles.ConclusionAlthough MT procedure has been prolonged during the pandemic, clinical outcomes and procedure-related serious adverse events have remained unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The screening process and the implementation of the PCS algorithm must be performed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection without threatening patient safety and clinical outcomes. The standard precaution of infection and the health assurance of healthcare workers and their families (including mental health) are also important factors that must be given special attention and consideration in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Besides, it is intended to provide recommendation based on the literature and results of studies from Saudi Arabia for exercise in pregnancy to improve the general health of women in Saudi Arabia. Prenatal physical exercise enhances physical and mental health of pregnant women. It can also reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy-related complications such as; lower back pain, fluid retention and risk of gestational diabetes. All these factors can affect fetal development and life later. Multiple studies showed that prenatal exercise could reduce the risk of fetal macrosomia with no effect on other perinatal or postnatal complications. The study followed the systematic literature review approach where it included multiple medical search Databases using PICOS eligibility criteria up to January 2019. The review was based on the following keywords: pregnancy, gestational, or prenatal) and (physical exercise, exercise, or physical activity. There are only two studies that dealt with physical exercises among Saudi women. The results indicated a relation between prenatal physical exercise on improving or decreasing risks on the mother and child during pregnancy.

AB  - Background
   There is growing interest in glutamatergic agents as a treatment for depression, especially intranasal ketamine, which has become a hot topic in recent years. We aim to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), especially treatment-resistant depression (TRD).
   Methods
   We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library until April 1, 2020 to identify double-blind, randomized controlled trials with allocation concealment evaluating intranasal ketamine in major depressive episodes. Clinical remission, response, and depressive symptoms were extracted by two independent raters. The outcome measures were Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score improved from baseline, clinical response and remission, dissociative symptoms, and common adverse events. The analyses employed a random-effects model.
   Results
   Data were synthesized from five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) employing an intranasal esketamine and one RCT employing intranasal ketamine, representing 840 subjects in parallel arms, and 18 subjects in cross-over designs (n = 858 with MDD, n = 792 with TRD). The weighted mean difference of MADRS score was observed to decrease by 6.16 (95% CI 4.44-7.88) in 2-4 h, 9.96 (95% CI 8.97-10.95) in 24 h, and 4.09 (95% CI 2.18-6.00) in 28 day. The pooled relative risk (RR) was 3.55 (95% CI 1.5-8.38, z = 2.89, and p < 0.001) for clinical remission and 3.22 (95% CI 1.85-5.61, z = 4.14, and p < 0.001) for clinical response at 24 h, while the pooled RR was 1.7 (95% CI 1.28-2.24, z = 3.72, and p < 0.001) for clinical remission and 1.48 (95% CI 1.17-1.86, z = 3.28, and p < 0.001) for clinical response at 28 day. Intranasal ketamine was associated with the occurrence of transient dissociative symptoms and common adverse events, but no persistent psychoses or affective switches.
   Conclusion
   Our meta-analysis suggests that repeated intranasal ketamine conducted a fast-onset antidepression effect in unipolar depression, while the mild and transient adverse effects were acceptable.

We performed meta-analyses and meta-regression of the studies comparing lipid, LRP, and PUFA levels between MDD patients and healthy individuals by searching Embase, Ovid Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Cochrane databases. Search was performed in these databases up to September 2019 and 29 studies were included. Levels of lipid parameter triglyceride (TG) (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.30-0.80, p < 0.0001) were higher while total cholesterol (TC) (SMD = -0.46, 95%CI -0.93 to -0.001, p = 0.04) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) (SMD = -0.46, 95%CI -0.71 to -0.20, p = 0.02) were lower in MDD patients than controls. Subgroup analysis for age showed that the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were lower in >= 40-year age group (SMD = -0.38, 95%CI -0.70 to -0.06, p = 0.01) and levels of TC was lower in MDD patients in studies from Asian countries (SMD = -0.74, 95%CI -1.37 to -0.10, p = 0.02). TG levels were found to be high all subgroups in MDD patients than controls. A negative association between TC levels and use of lipid lowering medications and a positive association between smoking and LDL levels was found using metaregression analysis. This study will be useful for physicians when considering the assessment of lipidand LRP profiles in MDD patients to reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Besides our current health concerns due to COVID-19, cancer is a longer-lasting and even more dramatic pandemic that affects almost a third of the human population worldwide. Most of the emphasis on its causes has been posed on genetic predisposition, chance, and wrong lifestyles (mainly, obesity and smoking). Moreover, our medical weapons against cancers have not improved too much during the last century, although research is in progress. Once diagnosed with a malignant tumour, we still rely on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The main problem is that we have focused on fighting a difficult battle instead of preventing it by controlling its triggers. Quite the opposite, our knowledge of the links between environmental pollution and cancer has surged from the 1980s. Carcinogens in water, air, and soil have continued to accumulate disproportionally and grow in number and dose, bringing us to today's carnage. Here, a synthesis and critical review of the state of the knowledge of the links between cancer and environmental pollution in the three environmental compartments is provided, research gaps are briefly discussed, and some future directions are indicated. New evidence suggests that it is relevant to take into account not only the dose but also the time when we are exposed to carcinogens. The review ends by stressing that more dedication should be put into studying the environmental causes of cancers to prevent and avoid curing them, that the precautionary approach towards environmental pollutants must be much more reactionary, and that there is an urgent need to leave behind the outdated petrochemical-based industry and goods production.

AB  - Seventy percent of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia do not respond to clozapine. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can potentially offer significant benefit in clozapine-resistant patients. However, cognitive side effects can occur with ECT and are a function of stimulus parameters and electrode placements. Thus, the objective of this article is to systematically review published clinical trials related to the effect of ECT stimulus parameters and electrode placements on cognitive side effects. We performed a systematic review of the literature up to July of 2020 for clinical studies published in English or German examining the effect of ECT stimulus parameters and/or electrode placement on cognitive side effects in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The literature search generated 3 randomized, double-blind, clinical trials, 1 randomized, nonblinded trial, and 1 retrospective study. There are mixed findings regarding whether pulse width and stimulus dose impact on cognitive side effects. One study showed less cognitive side effect for right unilateral (RUL) than bitemporal (BT) electrode placement, and 2 studies showed a cognitive advantage for bifrontal (BF) compared with BT ECT. Only 1 retrospective study measured global cognition and showed post-ECT cognitive improvement with all treatment modalities using Montreal Cognitive Assessment in comparison to pre-ECT Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores. Current data are limited, but evolving. The evidence suggests that RUL or BF ECT have more favorable cognitive outcomes than BT ECT. Definitive larger clinical trials are needed to optimize parameter and electrode placement selection to minimize adverse cognitive effects.

AB  - Oil sands development in the lower Athabasca River watershed has raised considerable public and scientific concerns regarding perceived effects on environmental health. To address this issue for tributaries and the mainstem of the Athabasca River in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, the Water Component of the Joint Oil Sands Monitoring (JOSM) plan produced monitoring assessments for seven integrated themes: atmospheric deposition, tributary water quality, river mainstem water quality, groundwater quality and quantity, water quality and quantity modelling, benthic invertebrate condition, and fish health. Our review integrates and synthesizes the large and diverse datasets assembled in the seven JOSM theme assessments to (i) evaluate possible environmental effects based on known sources and candidate proximal causes and (ii) determine the importance of cause-and-effect pathways related to contaminant, sediment, and nutrient inputs. Although JOSM research identified ecological effects that appear to be associated with contaminant exposure, the source of this exposure is confounded by co-location of, and inability to differentiate between, oil sands operations (principally released by atmospheric emission) and inputs from the natural bitumen outcrops (e.g., erosional material transported by surface and groundwater flows). Nutrient enrichment from treated municipal sewage effluent was the dominant ecological effect observed for the mainstem Athabasca River, associated with increased fish size and changes in invertebrate assemblages, likely because this pollution source is discharged directly into the river. If the direct release of treated oil sands process water occurs in the future, then the potential ecological impact of these direct industry releases will need to be evaluated carefully. The ecological causal assessment method proved to be a useful tool for better understanding how stressor sources relate to ecological effects through candidate proximate causes. Factors that confound our ability to assess the ecological effects of oil sands development focus on our inability to adequately differentiate between contaminants supplied from natural and anthropogenic contaminant sources. Our causal synthesis identifies options for changes in future monitoring to better anticipate and detect degradation in the ecosystem health of the lower Athabasca River and its tributaries.

AB  - Non-motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD), including neuropsychiatric or dysautonomic complaints, fatigue, or pain, are frequent and have a high impact on the patient's quality of life. They are often poorly recognized and inadequately treated. In the recent years, the growing awareness of NMS has favored the development of techniques that complement the clinician's diagnosis. This review provides an overview of the most important ultrasonographic findings related to the presence of various NMS. Literature research was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception until January 2021, retrieving 23 prospective observational studies evaluating transcranial and cervical ultrasound in depression, dementia, dysautonomic symptoms, psychosis, and restless leg syndrome. Overall, the eligible articles showed good or fair quality according to the QUADAS-2 assessment. Brainstem raphe hypoechogenicity was related to the presence of depression in PD and also in depressed patients without PD, as well as to overactive bladder. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity was frequent in patients with visual hallucinations, and larger intracranial ventricles correlated with dementia. Evaluation of the vagus nerve showed contradictory findings. The results of this systematic review demonstrated that transcranial ultrasound can be a useful complementary tool in the evaluation of NMS in PD.

AB  - Objective Depression is common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and is associated with poor outcomes. Although different treatments are available, it is unclear which are best or most acceptable to patients, so we conducted a network meta-analysis of evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of different depression treatments to ascertain relative efficacy. Methods We searched for systematic reviews of RCTs of depression treatments in CAD and updated these with a comprehensive search for recent individual RCTs. RCTs comparing depression treatments (pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, combined pharmacological/psychotherapeutic, exercise, collaborative care) were included. Primary outcomes were acceptability (dropout rate) and change in depressive symptoms 8 week after treatment commencement. Change in 26-week depression and mortality were secondary outcomes. Frequentist, random-effects network meta-analysis was used to synthesize the evidence, and evidence quality was evaluated following Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations recommendations. Results Thirty-three RCTs (7240 participants) provided analyzable data. All treatments were equally acceptable. At 8 weeks, combination therapy (1 study), exercise (1 study), and antidepressants (10 studies) yielded the strongest effects versus comparators. At 26 weeks, antidepressants were consistently effective, but psychotherapy was only effective versus usual care. There were no differences in treatment groups for mortality. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations ratings ranged from very low to low. Conclusions Overall, the evidence was limited and biased. Although all treatments for post-CAD depression were equally acceptable, antidepressants have the most robust evidence base and should be the first-line treatment. Combinations of antidepressants and psychotherapy, along with exercise, could be more effective than antidepressants alone but require further rigorous, multiarm intervention trials.

AB  - Simple Summary Several fungal species are well suited to control arthropods, being able to cause epizootic infection among them and most of them infect their host by direct penetration through the arthropod's tegument. Most of organisms are related to the biological control of crop pests, but, more recently, have been applied to combat some livestock ectoparasites. Among the entomopathogenic bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis, innocuous for humans, animals, and plants and isolated from different environments, showed the most relevant activity against arthropods. Its entomopathogenic property is related to the production of highly biodegradable proteins. Entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria are usually employed against agricultural pests, and some studies have focused on their use to control animal arthropods. However, risks of infections in animals and humans are possible; thus, further studies about their activity are necessary. The present study aimed to review the papers dealing with the biological activity of fungi and bacteria against some mites and ticks of veterinary interest. In particular, the attention was turned to the research regarding acarid species, Dermanyssus gallinae and Psoroptes sp., which are the cause of severe threat in farm animals and, regarding ticks, also pets. Their impact on animal and human health has been stressed, examining the weaknesses and strengths of conventional treatments. Bacillus thuringiensis, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae are the most widely employed agents. Their activities have been reviewed, considering the feasibility of an in-field application and the effectiveness of the administration alone or combined with conventional and alternative drugs is reported.

AB  - Growth of the information economy and globalization of labor markets will be marked by exponential growth in emerging technologies that will cause considerable disruption of the social and economic sectors that drive the global job market. These disruptions will alter the way we work, where we work, and will be further affected by the changing demographic characteristics and level of training of the available workforce. These changes will likely result in scenarios where existing workplace hazards are exacerbated and new hazards with unknown health effects are created. The pace of these changes heralds an urgent need for a proactive approach to understand the potential effects new and emerging workplace hazards will have on worker health, safety, and well-being. As employers increasingly rely on non-standard work arrangements, research is needed to better understand the work organization and employment models that best support decent work and improved worker health, safety, and well-being. This need has been made more acute by the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic that has resulted in dramatic changes in employment patterns, millions of lost jobs, an erosion of many economic sectors, and widespread disparities which further challenge occupational safety and health (OSH) systems to ensure a healthy and productive workplace. To help identify new research approaches to address OSH challenges in the future, a virtual workshop was organized in June 2020 with leading experts in the fields of OSH, well-being, research methods, mental health, economics, and life-course analysis. A paradigm shift will be needed for OSH research in the future of work that embraces key stakeholders and thinks differently about research that will improve lives of workers and enhance enterprise success. A more transdisciplinary approach to research will be needed that integrates the skills of traditional and non-traditional OSH research disciplines, as well as broader research methods that support the transdisciplinary character of an expanded OSH paradigm. This article provides a summary of the presentations, discussion, and recommendations that will inform the agenda of the Expanded Focus for Occupational Safety and Health (Ex4OSH) International Conference, planned for December 2021.

AB  - Despite the health improvements afforded to non-Indigenous peoples in Canada, Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the United States, the Indigenous peoples in these countries continue to endure disproportionately high rates of mortality and morbidity. Indigenous peoples' concepts and understanding of health and wellbeing are holistic; however, due to their diverse social, political, cultural, environmental and economic contexts within and across countries, wellbeing is not experienced uniformly across all Indigenous populations. We aim to identify aspects of wellbeing important to the Indigenous people in Canada, Aotearoa and the United States. We searched CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO and PubMed databases for papers that included key Indigenous and wellbeing search terms from database inception to April 2020. Papers that included a focus on Indigenous adults residing in Canada, Aotearoa and the United States, and that included empirical qualitative data that described at least one aspect of wellbeing were eligible. Data were analysed using the stages of thematic development recommended by Thomas and Harden for thematic synthesis of qualitative research. Our search resulted in 2669 papers being screened for eligibility. Following full-text screening, 100 papers were deemed eligible for inclusion (Aotearoa (New Zealand) n = 16, Canada n = 43, United States n = 41). Themes varied across countries; however, identity, connection, balance and self-determination were common aspects of wellbeing. Having this broader understanding of wellbeing across these cultures can inform decisions made about public health actions and resources.

AB  - Background: Patients with non-communicable diseases are vulnerable to disasters. This is a systematic review describing the impact of disasters on non-communicable diseases.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA standards. Relevant articles published from 1997 to 2019 collected by searching the Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, databases. We specifically examined reports describing NCDs and including the key words "non-communicable disease and Disasters". NCDs included cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes, cancer and mental health diseases.
   Results: Of the 663 studies identified, only 48 articles met all the eligibility criteria. Most studies have shown the impact of all natural disasters on non-communicable diseases (39.8% n=19). The largest study was the effect of earthquakes on non-communicable diseases (29.2% n=14). For the NCDs targeted by this research, most of the included studies were a combination of four diseases: cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and cancer (44% n=21). Followed by cardiovascular disease (14.6% n=7), chronic respiratory disease (12.5% n=6), diabetes and cancer (6.2% n=3) and mental health (12.5% n=6).
   Conclusion: The incidence of disasters affects the management of treatment and care for patients with NCDs. Specific measures include a multi part approach to ensuring that patients with non-communicable diseases have access to life-saving services during and after disasters. The approach of the health system should be expanded from traditional approaches to disasters and requires comprehensive planning of health care by policy makers and health professionals to develop effective strategies to enable patients to access medical, therapeutic and diagnostic services in natural disasters.

AB  - Despite the steady increase in female participation in sport over the last two decades, comprehensive research on interventions attenuating the influence of female menstrual physiology on performance remains scarce. Studies involving eumenorrheic women often only test in one menstrual phase to limit sex hormone variance, which may restrict the application of these findings to the rest of the menstrual cycle. The impacts of nutrition-based interventions on athletic performance throughout the menstrual cycle have not been fully elucidated. We addressed this gap by conducting a focused critical review of clinical studies that reported athletic outcomes as well as menstrual status for healthy eumenorrheic female participants. In total, 1443 articles were identified, and 23 articles were included. These articles were published between 2011 and 2021, and were retrieved from Google Scholar, Medline, and PubMed. Our literature search revealed that hydration-, micronutrient-, and phytochemical-based interventions can improve athletic performance (measured by aerobic capacity, anaerobic power, and strength performance) or attenuate exercise-induced damage (measured by dehydration biomarkers, muscle soreness, and bone resorption biomarkers). Most performance trials, however, only assessed these interventions in one menstrual phase, limiting the application throughout the entire menstrual cycle. Improvements in athletic performance through nutrition-based interventions may be contingent upon female sex hormone variation in eumenorrheic women.

AB  - Background There is ongoing controversy whether antidepressant use alters suicide risk in adults with depression and other treatment indications.
   Methods Systematic review of observational studies, searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PsycARTICLES and SCOPUS for case-control and cohort studies. We included studies on depression and various indications unspecified (including off-label use) reporting risk of suicide and/or suicide attempt for adult patients using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other new-generation antidepressants relative to non-users. Effects were meta-analytically aggregated with random-effects models, reporting relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% CIs. Publication bias was assessed via funnel-plot asymmetry and trim-and-fill method. Financial conflict of interest (fCOI) was defined present when lead authors' professorship was industry-sponsored, they received industry-payments, or when the study was industry-sponsored.
   Results We included 27 studies, 19 on depression and 8 on various indications unspecified (n=1.45 million subjects). SSRI were not definitely related to suicide risk (suicide and suicide attempt combined) in depression (RR=1.03, 0.70-1.51) and all indications (RR=1.19, 0.88-1.60). Any new-generation antidepressant was associated with higher suicide risk in depression (RR=1.29, 1.06-1.57) and all indications (RR=1.45, 1.23-1.70). Studies with fCOI reported significantly lower risk estimates than studies without fCOI. Funnel-plots were asymmetrical and imputation of missing studies with trim-and-fill method produced considerably higher risk estimates.
   Conclusions Exposure to new-generation antidepressants is associated with higher suicide risk in adult routine-care patients with depression and other treatment indications. Publication bias and fCOI likely contribute to systematic underestimation of risk in the published literature.

AB  - Cognitive impairment occurs across several neuropsychiatric diseases and impede everyday functioning and quality of life. Fully immersive Virtual Reality (VR) aid motivation and engagement and therefore has a potential to help overcome the obstacles in the field of cognitive rehabilitation. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate whether VR can be a useful intervention in cognitive rehabilitation transdiagnostically. We identified nine studies with randomized controlled trials following the PRISMA guidelines in databases Pubmed, Embase and PsychInfo. The trials were all evaluated through Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias. The studies were conducted in patients with mild cognitive impairment (k=4), schizophrenia (k=3), ADHD (k=1), or stroke (k=1) and involved 6-12 weeks of training. Overall, results showed improvement in some domains of cognition, primarily executive function and attention. The studies were pilot studies with 6-34 participants per treatment group. Risk of bias was either high (k=3) or moderate (some concerns) (k=6). Key reasons were suboptimal statistical analyses and lack of clarification on randomization and blinding of participants and assessors. In conclusion, this review found promising evidence for VR cognitive rehabilitation for neuropsychiatric illnesses. However, larger and methodologically stronger studies are warranted to establish the full potential of VR.

AB  - Decompression illness (DCI) is well known in compressed-air diving but has been considered anecdotal in breath-hold divers. Nonetheless, reported cases and field studies of the Japanese Ama, commercial or professional breath-hold divers, support DCI as a clinical entity. Clinical characteristics of DCI in Ama divers mainly suggest neurological involvement, especially stroke-like cerebral events with sparing of the spinal cord. Female Ama divers achieving deep depths have rarely experienced a panic-like neurosis from anxiety disorders. Neuroradiological studies of Ama divers have shown symptomatic and/or asymptomatic ischaemic lesions situated in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and deep and superficial cerebral white matter, suggesting arterial insufficiency. The underlying mechanism(s) of brain damage in breath-hold diving remain to be elucidated; one of the plausible mechanisms is arterialization of venous nitrogen bubbles passing through right to left shunts in the heart or lungs. Although the treatment for DCI in Ama divers has not been specifically established, oxygen breathing should be given as soon as possible for injured divers. The strategy for prevention of diving-related disorders includes reducing extreme diving schedules, prolonging surface intervals and avoiding long periods of repetitive diving. This review discusses the clinical manifestations of diving-related disorders in Ama divers and the controversial mechanisms.

AB  - Research on the concept of food addiction (FA) has steadily grown and, based on a widely used self-report, FA is estimated to affect between 16-20% of the adult population. However, there are few interventions available for people with self-reported FA, and their efficacy is unclear. The primary aim of the review was to examine the efficacy of different interventions, including behavioural/lifestyle, medication and surgical approaches, for reducing symptoms and/or changing diagnosis of FA among adolescents and adults. A secondary aim was to examine the influence of sex as a moderator of intervention effects. A systematic search was performed from 2008-2020 to identify studies that used the YFAS to assess the effectiveness of interventions on FA. Nine studies were identified (n = 7 adults, n = 2 adolescents) including a total of 812 participants (range 22-256) with an average of 69% females per study. The types of interventions included medications (n = 3), lifestyle modification (n = 3), surgical (n = 2) and behavioural (n = 1), with FA being assessed as a secondary outcome in all studies. Five studies in adults reported a significant reduction in FA symptoms or diagnosis from pre to post-intervention, two when compared to a control group and three in the intervention group only. Efficacious interventions included: medication (combination of naltrexone and bupropion, as well as pexacerfont), bariatric surgery and lifestyle modification. No significant changes in FA were reported in adolescent studies. Given few studies were identified by the review, there is insufficient evidence to provide clear recommendations for practice; however, some interventions show potential for reducing self-reported FA outcomes in adults. Future research should explore the longer-term efficacy of interventions and the effectiveness of treatments with sufficient sample sizes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to systematically review health promotion interventions in the fire services. Four databases were searched for articles reporting on health promotion interventions for firefighters evaluated in randomised controlled trials (RCT) and measuring efficacy on health or lifestyle behaviour outcomes. Data were extracted to create a narrative synthesis regarding study design, intervention characteristics and impact on outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using a 13-item tool. Of 448 papers identified, after removal of duplicates, 209 were excluded based on title/abstract screening. A further 60 papers were excluded, mostly due to studies not being RCTs, not including a lifestyle behaviour intervention, or not focusing on health or lifestyle behaviour outcomes. Ten studies (reported in 11 papers) were eligible for inclusion. Six studies compared an intervention to usual practice, one compared a full intervention to a minimal intervention, one compared two exercise programmes and two compared two interventions to usual practice. Four studies evaluated structured physical activity interventions. Five studies evaluated physical activity and diet-focused behaviour change programmes, and one study included a mindfulness programme. When assessing risk of bias, three studies had low risk ratings for >8/13 items, leaving seven studies with high-risk ratings for >= 5/13 items. Eight of the 10 studies reported improvements in at least 1 outcome from baseline to final follow-up in the intervention group over a comparison group. The majority of lifestyle behaviour interventions targeted physical activity and/or diet. Findings from included studies suggest that programmes for firefighters initiated in the workplace can improve some health outcomes.

AB  - Landscapes in Canada are undergoing change due to resource and land use stressors and climate stressors. Understanding the cumulative effects of these stressors is challenging because of the complexity of ecosystems, the variability of stressors, and species response to individual or multiple stressors. A key challenge within the field of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is guidance that describes and evaluates analytical methods. In this review we discuss four broad categories of methods with current or potential use for project-based and effects-based CEA for species in terrestrial systems: (i) qualitative review, (ii) habitat supply models, (iii) empirical species-stressor models, and (iv) decision support models. We describe each method and provide examples, highlight advantages and limitations, identify how methods address key science-based CEA questions, and provide direction on when and why to use specific CEA methods. Empirical species-stressor models and decision support models are the only analytical approaches that provide answers to many science-based CEA questions including how multiple stressors combine to affect an individual species and the certainty of multiple stressor effects. We provide recommendations for using one or more methods as complementary building blocks to fill data gaps, improve understanding and communication, engage diverse partner groups, and increase the quality and credibility of the CEA. Our review supports a move toward regional scale, effects-based CEA where partner collaboration to design, implement, and analyze comprehensive assessments of multiple stressors will (i) expand our knowledge of terrestrial species response to stressors and (ii) inform best management practices for resource industries and conservation and management actions for land managers.

AB  - Nanotechnology has opened up a plethora of opportunities and has acquired extreme importance in a myriad of fields to produce enhanced materials. Their special properties make them sustainable for industrial purposes. One of the most crucial processes in the petroleum and geothermal industries is cementing. Various classes of Portland cement are used according to API classifications. The conventional Portland cement fails to perform its function at high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) conditions. Hence, various admixtures are used to improve its properties. HPHT conditions not only have a bad impact on Portland cement by affecting its rheological properties but also reduce its strength, porosity, and permeability. So, additives like nano silica are used to improve its properties. Better compressive strength, low porosity and permeability, higher yield stress, and reduced setting time are some of the major properties that improve by the use of nano silica. This paper discusses in detail the different types of cement, cementing processes, failure of Portland cement, and effect of nano silica as an admixture on the compressive strength, rheology, porosity, and permeability of the cement. Furthermore, the upcoming challenges in cementing are discussed along with future potential in this field.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Neurofeedback training has been suggested as a potential additional treatment option for MDD patients not reaching remission from standard care (i.e., psychopharmacology and psychotherapy). Here we systematically reviewed neurofeedback studies employing electroencephalography, or functional magnetic resonance-based protocols in depressive patients. Of 585 initially screened studies, 24 were included in our final sample (N = 480 patients in experimental and N = 194 in the control groups completing the primary endpoint). We evaluated the clinical efficacy across studies and attempted to group studies according to the control condition categories currently used in the field that affect clinical outcomes in group comparisons. In most studies, MDD patients showed symptom improvement superior to the control group(s). However, most articles did not comply with the most stringent study quality and reporting practices. We conclude with recommendations on best practices for experimental designs and reporting standards for neurofeedback training.

AB  - Internet addiction (IA) may constitute a widespread and serious mental problem. Previous reviews have not fully considered potential factors that may contribute to therapeutic outcomes or predict behavioral changes. Such information is relevant to understand the active ingredients of interventions and to develop more efficacious treatments that target features of IA. This systematic review was designed to relate theories of IA to treatments, describe studies of psychotherapies for IA, and propose a model of addiction and interventions based on extant studies. A computer database search of PubMed, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Google Scholar was conducted to identify all available research evidence on psychological treatments for IA (N = 31 studies). Among these psychological interventions, the targeted reduction of addictionrelated impulsivity and craving, improvement of cognitive maladjustment, and alleviation of family problems have been investigated in IA interventions. The targeted domains and intervention methods are not mutually exclusive, and further research is needed to demonstrate the effective components and mechanisms of action for treatments of IA. Such research will help generate more efficacious evidence-based interventions.

AB  - Simple Summary Generally, plants undergo a series of oxidative damage and even die after being stressed by cadmium (Cd). Recently, numerous studies about hyperaccumulators that can tolerate and enrich cadmium in the environment have been reported, revealing its potential in restoration of heavy metal pollution. However, there is a lack of systemic understanding of the mechanisms of Cd accumulation and detoxification by hyperaccumulators. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to investigate how these plants absorb, transport, and distribute Cd. The role of plant roots, compartmentalization, chelation, antioxidants, stress, and osmotic adjustment in bioaccumulation of Cd are comprehensively discussed. This review contributes to further understanding the mechanisms of plant enrichment and detoxification of heavy metals. The heavy metal cadmium (Cd), as one of the major environmentally toxic pollutants, has serious impacts on the growth, development, and physiological functions of plants and animals, leading to deterioration of environmental quality and threats to human health. Research on how plants absorb and transport Cd, as well as its enrichment and detoxification mechanisms, is of great significance to the development of phytoremediation technologies for ecological and environmental management. This article summarises the research progress on the enrichment of heavy metal cadmium in plants in recent years, including the uptake, transport, and accumulation of Cd in plants. The role of plant roots, compartmentalisation, chelation, antioxidation, stress, and osmotic adjustment in the process of plant Cd enrichment are discussed. Finally, problems are proposed to provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for the further application of phytoremediation technology in the field of heavy metal pollution.

AB  - Heated tobacco products (HTP) are a form of nicotine delivery intended to be an alternative to traditional cigarettes. HTP tobacco products are sold to consumers as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes, both for users and bystanders. The actual impact of HTP on the health of users and its overall impact on public health is still not fully known. A systematic search of the literature was carried out to identify relevant studies published in English from 2015 to February 2021. The following databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier and ClinicalKey. 25 studies (independent and sponsored by the tobacco industry) were considered. The analysis of exposure biomarkers and cardiovascular and respiratory biomarkers showed differences between smokers and people using heated tobacco products. Improvements in clinically relevant risk markers, especially cholesterol, sICAM-1, 8-epi-PGF2 alpha, 11-DTX-B2, HDL and FEV1, were observed compared to persistent cigarette smokers. On the other hand, exposure to IQOS has been reported to alter mitochondrial function, which may further exaggerate airway inflammation, airway remodeling and lung cancer. These products have the potential to increase oxidative stress and increase respiratory tract infections by increasing microbial adherence to the respiratory tract. Our review suggests that HTP products may be products with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and cancer compared to traditional smoking, although in the case of non-smokers so far, they may pose a risk of their occurrence. Research seems to be necessary to assess the frequency of HTP use and its potential negative health effects.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the paper is to critically review the current state of the literature on the association between discrimination and allostatic load (AL) in adults and determine whether this association differs by sociodemographic characteristics.
   Methods: An extensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase to identify studies that investigated the association between discrimination and AL. The search was limited to the English language, articles that were peer-reviewed and articles that were published within the last 10 years.
   Results: A total of 11 studies met the eligibility criteria for this review, 8 of which were cross-sectional and 3 of which were longitudinal. There was heterogeneity in the type of discrimination measured, the composition of AL summary score, and the analytic approach utilized to examine the relationship of interest. Nine studies found a significant, positive association between discrimination and AL. The types of discrimination found to be positively associated with AL included lifetime discrimination, childhood racial discrimination, everyday discrimination, and everyday weight discrimination. One study found that this association differed by educational attainment. Conclusion: There is evidence that discrimination is associated with AL. Longitudinal studies with diverse samples are needed to further explore this association and how it differs based on sociodemographic characteristics.

AB  - Increasing resource demand, predicted fossil resources shortage in the near future, and environmental concerns due to the production of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide have motivated the search for alternative 'circular' pathways. Among many options, microalgae have been recently 'revised' as one of the most promising due to their high growth rate (with low land use and without competing with food crops), high tolerance to nutrients and salts stresses and their variability in biochemical composition, in so allowing the supply of a plethora of possible bio-based products such as animal feeds, chemicals and biofuels. The recent raising popularity of Circular Bio-Economy (CBE) further prompted investment in microalgae, especially in combination with wastewater treatment, under the twofold aim of allowing the production of a wide range of bio-based products while bioremediating wastewater. With the aim of discussing the potential bio-products that may be gained from microalgae grown on urban wastewater, this paper presents an overview on microalgae production with particular emphasis on the main microalgae species suitable for growth on wastewater and the obtainable biobased products from them. By selecting and reviewing 76 articles published in Scopus between 1992 and 2020, a number of interesting aspects, including the selection of algal species suitable for growing on urban wastewater, wastewater pretreatment and algal-bacterial cooperation, were carefully reviewed and discussed in this work. In this review, particular emphasis is placed on understanding of the main mechanisms driving formation of microalgal products (such as biofuels, biogas, etc.) and how they are affected by different environmental factors in selected species. Lastly, the quantitative information gathered from the articles were used to estimate the potential benefits gained from microalgae grown on urban wastewater in Campania Region, a region sometimes criticized for poor wastewater management.

AB  - Objective The etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) is multi-factorial and has been associated with a perturbed gut microbiota. Thus, it is therefore of great importance to determine any variations in gut microbiota in patients with MDD.
   Methods A systematic literature search was conducted including original research articles based on gut microbiota studies performed in patients with MDD. Demographic and clinical characteristics, applied methodology and observed gut microbiota composition were compared between included studies.
   Results Seventeen studies were included with a total of 738 patients with MDD and 782 healthy controls using different DNA purification methods, sequencing platforms and data analysis models. Four studies found a reduced alpha-diversity in patients with MDD, while gut microbiota compositions clustered separately according to beta-diversity between patients and controls in twelve studies. Additionally, there was an increase in relative abundance of Eggerthella, Atopobium, and Bifidobacterium and a decreased relative abundance of Faecalibacterium in patients with MDD compared with healthy controls.
   Conclusion Gut microbiota differs significantly when comparing patients with MDD and healthy controls, though inconsistently across studies. The heterogeneity in gut microbiota compositions between the studies may be explained by variations in study design.

AB  - Meta-analyses of cross-sectional studies suggest that patients with psychosis have higher circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) compared with healthy controls; however, cause and effect is unclear. We examined the prospective association between CRP levels and subsequent risk of developing a psychotic disorder by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based cohort studies. Databases were searched for prospective studies of CRP and psychosis. We obtained unpublished results, including adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, and socioeconomic status and suspected infection (CRP > 10 mg/L). Based on random effect meta-analysis of 89,792 participants (494 incident cases of psychosis at follow-up), the pooled odds ratio (OR) for psychosis for participants with high (>3 mg/L), as compared to low (<= 3 mg/L) CRP levels at baseline was 1.50 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.07). Evidence for this association remained after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03-1.66). After excluding participants with suspected infection, the OR for psychosis was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.06-1.74), but the association attenuated after controlling for confounders (aOR = 1.23; 95% CI, 0.95-1.60). Using CRP as a continuous variable, the pooled OR for psychosis per standard deviation increase in log(CRP) was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.93-1.34), and this association further attenuated after controlling for confounders (aOR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.90-1.27) and excluding participants with suspected infection (aOR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92-1.24). There was no association using CRP as a categorical variable (low, medium or high). While we provide some evidence of a longitudinal association between high CRP (>3 mg/L) and psychosis, larger studies are required to enable definitive conclusions.

AB  - Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is an effective treatment during the acute phase of a major depressive episode (MDE), although the evidence for its follow-up efficacy is mixed. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus (EMBASE), Web of Science, Cochrane Library and additional sources were searched from inception to April 29, 2021. Studies that followed up adults treated with tDCS during an MDE - using (interventional) and/or not using (observational) tDCS in the follow-up period were included. The primary outcome was the Hedges' g for the follow-up depression scores. Small study effects and sources of heterogeneity were explored. 427 studies were retrieved and 11 trials (13 datasets, n = 311) were included, most presenting moderate bias. Results showed a follow-up depression improvement (k = 13, g = -0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.28; -0.34, I-2 = 84.0%), which was probably driven by the interventional studies (k = 7, g = -1.12, 95% CI: -1.84; -0.40, I-2 = 87.1%). No predictor of response was associated with the outcome. No risk of publication bias was found. Significant between-study heterogeneity may have influenced the overall results. Our findings suggest that tDCS produces effects beyond the intervention period during MDEs. Maintenance sessions are advised in future research.

AB  - Background: Research has indicated that interactive, computerized case simulations using immersive virtual reality (VR) technology may be beneficial in the augmentation of conventional methods of assessment and treatment in forensic psychiatry, primarily through providing an engaging and safe environment in which the user can practice and learn skills and behaviors. However, there does not appear to be an overview of current developments available in the field, which may be an obstacle to clinicians considering the use of VR in their clinical practice.
   Objectives: Current, clinically relevant assessment and treatment methods applying immersive VR in forensic or adjacent clinical settings, were analyzed.
   Methods: This review surveyed the practical use of immersive VR in forensic psychiatry and relevant adjacent psychiatric and forensic fields from 2016 to 2020 and was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
   Results: Out of the 1,105 journal articles screened, 14 met criteria for inclusion. Four articles described VR interventions directly addressing forensic psychiatric settings (treatment of general aggression and assessment of sexual offenders against children). The majority of the remaining articles were in the clinical domain of psychosis treatment. Several interventions were designed as part of comprehensive treatment programs, and others were intended as one-off assessments or paired with pre-existing psychological treatment. The degree to which the VR simulations were individualized to the user appeared to be largely dependent upon the extent of provider input. A variety of research methodologies were used in the included articles and the majority had limitations common to small-scale, non-randomized studies. None of the studies reported serious adverse effects.
   Discussion: There is a lack of large randomized controlled trials of current assessments or treatments using VR simulation in forensic psychiatry, let alone those with long-term follow-up, showing clear advantages of VR over standard practice. The evidence thus far is insufficient to recommend immediate and large-scale implementation of any one VR intervention, however, several have been shown to be feasible and acceptable to the participants and to provide insights and inspiration for future research and development.

AB  - Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) may be refractory to or have contraindications that preclude treatment with antidepressant pharmacotherapies. Alternative therapies such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) continue to evolve, and include theta burst stimulation (TBS), which has advantages over conventional rTMS. The aim of this study was to identify and meta-analyze efficacy data from all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating TBS as a treatment for MDD. Published reports of RCTs (January 1, 2010 to October 23, 2020) were identified via systematic searches in computerized databases, followed by review of individual reports for inclusion. Inclusion criteria included primary diagnosis of MDD >= 1 week duration of therapy with >= 10 sessions, and treatment with any form of TBS. The Cochrane GRADE methodology and PRISMA criteria were used for evaluation of individual trials. Data from ten RCTs were included, representing 667 patients. Of these, 8 RCTs compared TBS to sham treatment and one compared TBS to standard rTMS (i.e., high frequency stimulation over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [HFL]). Quality of evidence assessment yielded high confidence in the finding of TBS being superior to sham on response measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD) (RR=2.4; 95% CI: 1.27 to 4.55; P=0.007; I-2=40%). Comparison of HRSD response rates for TBS versus rTMS produced no statistically significant difference (RR=1.02; 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.23; P=0.80; I-2=0%). The incidence of adverse events between TBS and rTMS was not statistically different. The findings of a positive effect of TBS vs. sham, and noninferiority of TBS vs. standard HFL rTMS support the continued development of TBS to treat depression.

AB  - The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) 20 years ago has advocated a new era of "small molecular genetics." About 2000 miRNAs are present that regulate one third of the genome. MiRNA dysregulated expression arising as a response to our environment insult or stress or changes may contribute to several diseases, namely non-communicable diseases, including tumor growth. Their presence in body fluids, reflecting level alteration in various cancers, merit circulating miRNAs as the "next-generation biomarkers" for early-stage tumor diagnosis and/or prognosis. Herein, we performed a comprehensive literature search focusing on the origin, biosynthesis, and role of miRNAs and summarized the foremost studies centering on miR value as non-invasive biomarkers in different environment-related non-communicable diseases, including various cancer types. Moreover, during chemotherapy, many miRNAs were linked to multidrug resistance, via modulating numerous, environment triggered or not, biological processes and/or pathways that will be highlighted as well.

AB  - Background: Among adolescents, cannabis use is a health concern due to associations with drug addiction and mental health disorders across the life course. It has been shown that childhood maltreatment is associated with drug addiction in adulthood. However, a better understanding of the relationship between maltreatment and drug use may improve targeted prevention and interventions. The aim of this systematic review is to describe the association between exposure to childhood maltreatment, specifically physical and sexual abuse, with adolescent cannabis use.
   Methods: A systematic search strategy was applied to Embase, PsycINFO, and Ovid MEDLINE(R) databases. Methods followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Abstract and title screening was performed to identify papers which reported an estimate of the association between childhood physical or sexual abuse and adolescent cannabis use. Full text screening of each paper was performed, and data were extracted and study quality assessed. Weighted means meta-analysis was performed on studies reporting odds ratios as effect estimates.
   Results: Of 8,780 screened articles, 13 were identified for inclusion. Eight papers received a quality rating score indicating lower risk of bias. Eleven papers reported the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and adolescent cannabis use; effect estimates ranged from AOR 0.53-AOR 2.18 (weighted mean OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.49). The relationship between childhood physical abuse and adolescent cannabis use was reported in 7 papers; effect estimates ranged from AOR 1.25-AOR 1.87 (weighted mean OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.12-1.66). Differences in the strength of the evidence were observed by the method of exposure ascertainment, and there was some evidence of differences in association by gender, age of cannabis initiation, and the severity of the abuse.
   Conclusions: This systematic review indicates childhood physical or sexual abuse may increase risk of adolescent-onset cannabis use. Few studies considered variation in timing of onset, or by gender. Adolescent cannabis use precedes is strongly associated with increased risk of negative mental health outcomes; further exploration of adolescent cannabis use's place on the causal pathway between childhood abuse and adult mental health problems is warranted to improve intervention.

AB  - The number of individuals affected by psychostimulant use disorder (PSUD) has increased rapidly over the last few decades resulting in economic, emotional, and physical burdens on our society. Further compounding this issue is the current lack of clinically approved medications to treat this disorder. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a common target of psychostimulant actions related to their use and dependence, and the recent availability of atypical DAT inhibitors as a potential therapeutic option has garnered popularity in this research field. Modafinil (MOD), which is approved for clinical use for the treatment of narcolepsy and sleep disorders, blocks DAT just like commonly abused psychostimulants. However, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that it lacks the addictive properties (in both behavioral and neurochemical studies) associated with other abused DAT inhibitors. Clinical availability of MOD has facilitated its off-label use for several psychiatric disorders related to alteration of brain dopamine (DA) systems, including PSUD. In this review, we highlight clinical and preclinical research on MOD and its R-enantiomer, R-MOD, as potential medications for PSUD. Given the complexity of PSUD, we have also reported the effects of MOD on psychostimulant-induced appearance of several symptoms that could intensify the severity of the disease (i.e., sleep disorders and impairment of cognitive functions), besides the potential therapeutic effects of MOD on PSUD.

AB  - Objective A systematic review of literature was conducted to determine the association between serum lipids and suicidality in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
   Methods We undertook a systematic search of multiple databases for studies that ascertained an association between serum lipids and suicidality in adult patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (18-65 years) from database inception to 2 September 2020. Qualitative analysis was done using National Institute of Health (NIH) scales. The standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each study and standardized relative to the study. Adjusted p-value, Z-test, and heterogeneity were calculated, as well as testing for publication bias.
   Results Of 1262 records identified, 17 studies (n = 3113) were included in our systematic review, while 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The majority of studies (11) rated fair on qualitative analysis. Data from seven studies (n = 1597) revealed a medium effect size for an association between low total cholesterol and suicide attempts (SMD -0.560; 95% CI: 0.949-0.170; p = 0.005). People with history of suicide attempt had a mean cholesterol value 0.56 SD lower than the mean in those without suicide attempts. There were differences in how a suicide attempt was defined and there was high heterogeneity (I-2 = 83.3%). No significant association was found between any of the serum lipid parameters and suicide ideation. Funnel-plot analysis suggested small study effects with publication bias.
   Conclusions Suicide attempts in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are associated with low mean total cholesterol levels.

AB  - Introduction Total adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are gaining prominence as a risk factor for preterm birth (PTB). The emerging literature examining this relationship reports inconsistent findings. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the available evidence exploring whether total ACEs predict PTB. Methods A total of 386 studies were returned from searches on PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Nine studies were selected for final analysis and synthesis based on reporting of total ACEs and preterm birth gestational weeks or standard definition of birth before 37 weeks' gestational age. A systematic review rather than meta-analysis was selected to present the findings given the clinical and methodological (e.g., sample studied, measurement tools) heterogeneity of the retrieved studies and pregnancy outcomes measured. Results The nine studies report on birth outcomes for 6,087 women from a range of sociodemographic and ethnic backgrounds. Despite a wide range of study designs, measurement tools, and timings of ACEs exposure across studies, seven of the nine included studies showed significant relationships between ACEs and PTB. Conclusion Systematic review of the literature suggests that total ACEs are associated with PTB and provides an overview on the known associations. However, to date only nine studies have assessed this link, and more studies are needed, to explore the associations between ACEs and PTB using appropriate and valid instruments and doing so among more diverse populations. Future research should also explore possible biological mechanisms (allostatic load), and moderating and mediating variables.

In the last ten years, many different models (such as the Hourglass of Emotions and Sentic Patterns), resources (such as AffectiveSpace and SenticNet), algorithms (such as Sentic LDA and Sentic LSTM), and applications (such as Sentic PROMs and Sentic Album) have been developed under the umbrella of sentic computing. In this paper, we review all such models, resources, algorithms, and applications together with the key shifts and tasks introduced by sentic computing in the context of affective computing and sentiment analysis. We also discuss future directions in these fields.

AB  - Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a global issue, with 200 million women and girls thought to be affected. FGM is defined as removal of female external genitalia, either partial or total, for non-medical purposes. FGM is embedded in tradition, including cultural beliefs about sexual behaviour. Associated risks include haemorrhage, infection, death, dyspareunia, childbirth complications and psychological issues. Although FGM negatively impacts on women's psychological wellbeing, little is known about the impact on pregnancy experiences. Psychological consequences of FGM are likely to be intensified during pregnancy when women have concerns about their own and their baby's wellbeing. This mixed-method systematic review aimed to provide insight into the psychological impact of FGM on women who subsequently become pregnant. Nine electronic databases were searched, using a search strategy to identify relevant studies. Studies were considered for inclusion if they were primary studies (qualitative, quantitative or mixed-method) involving pregnant women of any age who have previously undergone FGM. Relevant studies were evaluated using the MMAT appraisal tool. Analysis was guided by the review questions and the evidence identified. One quantitative and 9 qualitative papers were included. Qualitative data were analysed using meta-ethnography. Narrative analysis of the quantitative study was conducted. Findings relate to power of choice linked to reinfibulation, deinfibulation, birth procedures and pain management; importance of knowledgeable and sensitive health care professionals; and relived trauma experienced during childbirth. These findings could inform the development of supportive interventions for women with FGM within maternity services.

AB  - Background; The goal of this review is 1) to summarize the studies assessing PFP by casual observers, patients themselves and the cosmetic appreciation of the PFP and 2) to summarize the studies assessing whether there is a difference in emotional recognition/processing of facial emotions and/or cognitive tasks in patients with a PFP. Materials and Methods; A multi-database systematic literature search was performed using the following databases: Pubmed, Embase, Medline, and The Cochrane Library from the earliest date of each database up to December 2019. Population of interest consisted of patients with a PFP and studies that investigated cosmetic appreciation and/or emotional recognition and/or emotional processing in these patients. Two authors rated the methodological quality of the included studies independently using the 'Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale' for nonrandomised studies' (NOS). Two authors extracted the outcome data regarding cosmetic appreciation and/or emotional recognition/processing from the included studies. Results; Twelve hundred and thirtytwo studies were found of which eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were assessed to be of 'fair' to 'good' methodological quality. The Cohen's kappa (between author RL and SP) was 0.68. Two studies investigated emotional processing and/or emotional recognition. Nine studies investigated cosmetic appreciation in both patients and casual observers. Important findings of this systematic review are that there is a correlation between the perceived severity of the PFP of the patients and the ratings by casual observers. Secondly there seems to be a laterality difference in cosmetic appreciation and thirdly there might to be a decreased emotional recognition and processing in patients with a PFP. Conclusion; Emotional recognition and cosmetic appreciation in patients with a PFP is an under investigated area, in which further studies are needed to substantiate the findings in current literature.

AB  - Objective: Fatigue is highly prevalent, debilitating and associated with poor mental health in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, little is known about the efficacy of psychological interventions to manage IBD fatigue. This systematic review aimed to establish the efficacy of psychological interventions to manage IBD fatigue. Methods: Studies were identified by systematically searching MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Google Scholar and Open Grey. Included studies needed to employ a randomised control trial (RCT) design with a psychological intervention targeted at reducing fatigue in patients with IBD and include a measure of fatigue. All screening, as well as data extraction and quality appraisals, were conducted by two researchers independently. Results: Four RCTs were included in this systematic review. Psychological interventions including psychoeducation, cognitive behaviour therapy and solution-based approach showed preliminary efficacy for fatigue, however the studies were small and largely underpowered. CBT was the most efficacious psychotherapy trialled, with a greater reduction in fatigue severity (g = 0.91, CI 95% [- 0.30, 2.11]) and impact (g = 0.87, CI 95% [0.22, 2.07]) seen in the intervention group between baseline and 12-months follow-up when compared to the control group using the IBD-F scale. However, while these effect sizes are strong, they were non-significant due to being underpowered. Conclusion: While the evidence is scant and low quality, psychological interventions show promise in improving IBD fatigue. Future studies should examine larger samples and employ longer follow-up to better determine efficacy of psychological interventions for fatigue in people with IBD.

AB  - Background: The effects of polyphenols on cognitive functions have been extensively studied. Due to the large heterogeneity in the study designs, however, it is often difficult to interpret their efficacy. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to examine whether acute polyphenol intake may have a beneficial effect on cognition and specifically on the accuracy and speed of attention.
   Methods: PubMed and Scopus databases were systematically searched for studies published up to end of August 2020 following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021232109). Only placebo-controlled human intervention trials that assessed acute effects of polyphenols on accuracy and speed of attention were included in the meta-analyses. When cognitive tasks were repeated over time, pooled means and standard deviations for intervention and placebo over repetitions separately for each task for both speed and accuracy were calculated. We also conducted separate analyses focusing only on the last repetition. Furthermore, confounding effects of age and source of polyphenols were also considered.
   Results: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis of last task repetitions showed that the acute consumption of polyphenols improved rapid visual information processing speed in young participants (SMD = 0.26; 95%CI = [0.03-0.50]; I-2= 0%; p = 0.02; k = 5). All other analyses did not reach significance.
   Conclusion: The results of the current study indicate that acute polyphenol consumption might improve speed in rapid visual information processing task, a higher order task with elements of vigilance, working memory, and executive function, in young participants; however, as the current literature is inconsistent and limited, further acute intervention studies are warranted to achieve more conclusive results.

AB  - Although individual toxicity of microplastics (MPs) to organism has been widely studied, limited knowledge is available on the interactions between heavy metals and MPs, as well as potential biological impacts from their combinations. The interaction between MPs and heavy metals may alter their environmental behaviors, bioavail-ability and potential toxicity, leading to ecological risks. In this paper, an overview of different sources of heavy metals on MPs is provided. Then the recent achievements in adsorption isotherms, adsorption kinetics and inter-action mechanism between MPs and heavy metals are discussed. Besides, the factors that influence the adsorp-tion of heavy metals on MPs such as polymer properties, chemical properties of heavy metals, and other environmental factors are also considered. Furthermore, potential combined toxic effects from MPs and heavy metals on organisms and human health are further summarized.

AB  - Aim Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with numerous adverse mental and physical health outcomes. While interest in routine screening for ACEs is growing, there is still significant opposition to universal screening. This review explores the feasibility of implementing routine screening for ACEs in primary care settings. Subject and methods We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, reference-mined relevant reviews, and consulted with key experts (June 2020). Studies from 1970 to date evaluating screening for childhood trauma, adversity, and ACEs in a routine healthcare setting, reporting quantitative or qualitative data were eligible. The project is registered in Open Science Framework (osf.io/5wef8) and reporting follows PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Results Searches retrieved 1402 citations. Of 246 publications screened as full text, 43 studies met inclusion criteria. Studies evaluated provider burden, familiarity with ACEs, practice characteristics, barriers to screening, frequency of ACE inquiry, reported or desired training, patient comfort, and referrals to support services. Conclusions This review found that the following factors increase the likelihood that ACE screenings can be successfully integrated into healthcare settings: staff trainings that increase provider confidence and competence in administering screenings, accessible and robust mental health resources, and organizational support. Further research should examine the scalability and sustainability of universal screening.

AB  - Background Meditation is defined as a mind and body practice focused on interactions between the brain, mind, body, and behaviour, containing four key elements: a quiet location with little distractions, a comfortable posture, a focus of attention, and an open attitude. We sought to review the benefits of meditation on the alleviation of loneliness. Methods A scoping review was conducted based on Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework. Eligibility criteria included primary studies of any type that investigated the effects of meditation on loneliness. Search strategies were developed and conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, and CINAHL. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, and American Psychological Association websites were also searched. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were critically reviewed using a descriptive-analytical narrative method. Results Thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria and were published between 2012 and 2020 across 10 countries. Eleven studies reported improvements in relation to loneliness. Of the remaining two studies (15%), one mentioned the alleviation of loneliness, but only looked primarily at social closeness in lonely individuals. The other study found a correlation between loneliness and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B levels, which was the measured outcome; however, the direct effects of meditation on loneliness were unclear. Three main themes emerged from our analysis, as follows: 1) positive results across all studies, 2) relatively small randomized control trials conducted over the last decade, and 3) lack of diverse demographic information. Conclusions While a small number of studies exist at this intersection, given all included studies indicated positive findings, the effects of meditation in alleviating loneliness are promising. Future research should be directed at understanding how meditation mitigates loneliness and how this intervention can impact practice for healthcare professionals.

AB  - Background: Maternal wildfire exposure (e.g., smoke, stress) has been associated with poor birth outcomes with effects potentially mediated through air pollution and psychosocial stress. Despite the recent hike in the intensity and frequency of wildfires in some regions of the world, a critical appraisal of the evidence on the association between maternal wildfire exposure and adverse birth outcomes has not yet been undertaken. We conducted a systematic review that evaluated the scientific evidence on the association between wildfire exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Comprehensive searches in nine bibliographic databases were conducted from database inception up to June 2020. Observational epidemiological studies that evaluated associations between exposure to wildfire during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias tool and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Screening of retrieved articles, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Study results were synthesized descriptively. Results: Eight epidemiological studies conducted in four countries and involving 1,702,252 births were included in the review. The exposure to wildfire during pregnancy was assessed in individual studies by measurement of PM2.5 (n = 2), PM10 (n = 1), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol index (n = 1), heat spots (n = 1), and by proximity of maternal residence to wildfire-affected areas (n = 3). There is some evidence indicating that maternal wildfire exposure associates with birth weight reduction (n = 7) and preterm birth (n = 4), particularly when exposure to wildfire smoke occurred in late pregnancy. The association between wildfire exposure and small for gestational age (n = 2) and infant mortality (n = 1) was inconclusive. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that maternal exposure to wildfire during late pregnancy is linked to reduced birth weight and preterm birth. Well-designed comprehensive studies are needed to better understand the perinatal effects of wildfires.

AB  - The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in promoting resilience among physicians. Previous reviews concerning resilience did not assess effectiveness in a systematic way using meta-analytic methods. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to January 31, 2020. Randomized clinical trials, non-randomized clinical trials, and repeated-measures studies of intervention designs targeting at resilience in physicians were included. Eleven studies were included in the review (n = 580 physicians). Research findings suggest that interventions for resilience in physicians were associated with small but significant benefits. Subgroup analyses suggested small but significantly improved effects for emotional-supportive-coping interventions (Hedges's g = 0.242; 95% CI, 0.082-0.402, p = .003) compared with mindfulness-meditation-relaxation interventions (Hedges's g = 0.208; 95% CI, 0.131-0.285, p = .000). Interventions that were delivered for more than a week indicated higher effect (Hedges's g = 0.262; 95% CI, 0.169-0.355, p = .000) compared with interventions delivered for up to a week (Hedges's g = 0.172; 95% CI, -0.010 to 0.355, p = .064). Results were not influenced by the risk of bias ratings. Findings suggest that physicians can benefit in their personal levels of resilience from attending an intervention specifically designed for that reason for more than a week. Moreover, policy-makers should view current results as a significant source of redesigning healthcare systems and promoting attendance of resilience interventions by physicians. Future research should address the need for more higher-quality studies and improved study designs.

AB  - Interpersonal difficulties are often implicated in the onset of depressive disorders, and typically exacerbate depressive symptoms. This is particularly true for young people, given rapid changes in, and the increased importance of, their social relationships. The purpose of this narrative review was to identify empirically supported interventions that aim to prevent or treat depression in young people by facilitating improvements in their social environment. We conducted a search of controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of such interventions, published between 1980 and June 2020. Our literature search and interpretation of results was informed by consultations with clinical experts and youth consumers and advocates. A number of promising approaches were identified with respect to prevention and treatment. Preliminary evidence was identified suggesting that school- and Internet-based approaches present a viable means to prevent the worsening of depressive symptoms in young people. Notably, delivering interpersonal psychotherapy-adolescent skills training (IPT-AST) in schools appears to be a promising early intervention strategy for young people at risk of full-threshold depressive disorder. In terms of treating depressive disorders in young people, there is strong evidence for the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A), and preliminary evidence in favour of attachment-based family therapy (ABFT). Results are discussed with respect to recommendations for future research and practice.

AB  - Migrant children's well-being has emerged into the spotlight of academic literature and policy-makers in recent times. This systematic review is aimed at analysing the publication trends on the topic and at synthesising the available evidence on the antecedents of well-being of first-generation international migrant children. Systematic searches of primary studies were conducted in 18 databases using search terms related to migration, childhood and well-being. Three rounds of screening and data extraction, researchers' full agreement and the inclusion criteria produced 39 eligible studies. Critical appraisal of results revealed a fragmentation in the literature, the evidence available being mostly descriptive and focused on involuntary migrants settled in Western countries. A bias across publications overlooking younger migrant children was unveiled. The compartmentalisation of the evidence hindered an understanding of the magnitude of the different effects of migration on well-being. Antecedents of well-being have been documented as factors fostering and hindering well-being. Important gaps in literature and key antecedents of well-being have been uncovered for voluntary and involuntary migrant children. These findings show limitations in the available evidence pointing to specific suggestions for future research that should help improve interventions at the social and individual levels.

AB  - Early psychosocial rehabilitation of young people presenting mental disorders is a major challenge. In France, the therapeutic residential care called "soins-etudes," combining care and educational provision, in the Fondation Sante des Etudiants de France (FSEF) can have a role in this rehabilitation. After recalling the history and the concept underpinning soins-etudes in psychiatry, we performed a systematic review of the literature based on the PRISMA statement via a search for quantitative studies on soins-etudes facilities. Eleven quantitative studies on 10 different samples of young people hospitalised in psychiatry in FSEF were identified between the opening of the first unit in 1956 and 2016. The young people involved were mostly aged 16-20 years, which reflects the curricula covered in the FSEF establishments. These young people generally presented severe chronic psychiatric disorders. Their previous care trajectory had lasted for more than 3 years and 24-55% of them had attempted suicide at least once. Their stays lasted more than 6 months. Depending on the severity of the disorders, 44-63% of the young people were considered to have improved at discharge. The contribution of soins-etudes appears valuable for these young people, since there was a clinical improvement for 54-74% of them 1-15 years after their hospitalisation, with resumption of schooling, professional training or entry into employment in 60-75% of the cases. These results are compared with data in the international literature concerning therapeutic residential care, and lines for future research are identified.

AB  - Seagrasses are valuable sources of food and habitat for marine life and are one of Earth's most efficient carbon sinks. However, they are facing a global decline due to ocean warming and eutrophication. In the last decade, with the advent of new technology and molecular advances, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of studies focusing on the effects of ocean warming on seagrasses. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the future of seagrasses in an era of ocean warming. We have gathered information from published studies to identify potential commonalities in the effects of warming and the responses of seagrasses across four distinct levels: molecular, biochemical/physiological, morphological/population, and ecosystem/planetary. To date, we know that although warming strongly affects seagrasses at all four levels, seagrass responses diverge amongst species, populations, and over depths. Furthermore, warming alters seagrass distribution causing massive die-offs in some seagrass populations, whilst also causing tropicalization and migration of temperate species. In this review, we evaluate the combined effects of ocean warming with other environmental stressors and emphasize the need for multiple-stressor studies to provide a deeper understanding of seagrass resilience. We conclude by discussing the most significant knowledge gaps and future directions for seagrass research.

AB  - This review study was conducted to describe how temperament is related to school readiness. The basic research question was whether there is any relationship between later school success and temperament in children and, if so, what characterizes it. A systematic search of databases and journals identified 27 papers that met the two criteria: temperament and school readiness. The analytical strategy followed the PRISMA method. The research confirmed the direct relationship between temperament and school readiness. There is a statistically significant relationship between temperament and school readiness. Both positive and negative emotionality influence behavior (especially concentration), which is reflected in the approach to learning and school success.

AB  - In recent medical research, tremendous progress has been made in the application of deep learning (DL) techniques. This article systematically reviews how DL techniques have been applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) data for diagnostic and predictive purposes in conducting research on mental disorders. EEG-studies on psychiatric diseases based on the ICD-10 or DSM-V classification that used either convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or long-short-term-memory (LSTMs) networks for classification were searched and examined for the quality of the information they contained in three domains: clinical, EEG-data processing, and deep learning. Although we found that the description of EEG acquisition and pre-processing was sufficient in most of the studies, we found, that many of them lacked a systematic characterization of clinical features. Furthermore, many studies used misguided model selection procedures or flawed testing. It is recommended that the study of psychiatric disorders using DL in the future must improve the quality of clinical data and follow state of the art model selection and testing procedures so as to achieve a higher research standard and head toward a clinical significance.

AB  - This review outlines the advances achieved in monitoring natural and anthropogenic plant stressors by hyperspectral remote sensing over the last 50 years. A broad diversity of methods based on field and imaging spectroscopy were developed in that field for precision farming and environmental monitoring purposes. From the 466 articles reviewed, we identified the main factors to consider to achieve accurate monitoring of plant stress, namely: The plant species and the stressor to monitor, the goal (detection or quantification), and scale (field or broad-scale) of monitoring, and the need for controlled experiments. Based on these factors, we then provide recommendations and guidelines for the development of reliable methods to monitor 11 major biotic and abiotic plant stressors. For each stressor, the effects on plant health and reflectance are described and the most suited spectral regions, scale, spatial resolution, and processing approaches to achieve accurate monitoring are presented. As a perspective, we discuss two major components that should be implemented in future methods to improve stress monitoring: The discrimination of plant stressors with similar effects on plants and the transferability of the methods across scales.

AB  - Background Effective measurement of Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment (GEWE) is challenging in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and even more so in humanitarian settings. Conflict, natural disasters, and epidemics may increase gender inequities, but also present an opportunity to address them. This scoping review describes and identifies gaps in the measurement tools, methods, and indicators used to measure GEWE in humanitarian settings, and presents a dashboard that can be used by researchers, organizations and governments to identify GEWE measurement tools. Methods Scientific articles published between January 2004 and November 2019 were identified using Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and PAIS index. Relevant non peer-reviewed literature was downloaded from the websites of humanitarian organizations. Publications on women and/or girls impacted by a humanitarian crisis in a LMIC, within 5 years of data collection, were included. Publications were double-screened in the title/abstract and full-text stages. We used a machine learning software during the title/abstract screening to increase the efficiency of the process. Measurement tools, sampling and data collection methods, gap areas (geographical, topical and contextual), and indicators were catalogued for easy access in an interactive Tableau dashboard. Results Our search yielded 27,197 publications and 2396 non peer-reviewed literature reports. One hundred and seventy publications were included in the final review. Extracted indicators were categorized into seven domains: economic, health, human development, leadership, psychological, security and justice, and sociocultural. The vast majority of studies were observational, and over 70% utilized a cross-sectional study design. Thirty-eight toolkits and questionnaires were identified in this review, of which 19 (50%) were designed specifically for humanitarian settings. Sociocultural was the largest domain in number of studies and indicators in this review, with gender-based violence indicators reported in 66% of studies. Indicators of economic, human development and leadership were uncommon in the peer-reviewed literature. Discussion While there has been some effort to measure GEWE in conflict-affected and other humanitarian settings, measurement has largely focused on violence and security issues. A more comprehensive framework for measuring GEWE in these settings is needed; objective measurement of women's empowerment and gender equality should be prioritized by organizations providing humanitarian aid.

AB  - DNA methylation plays a key role in neural cell fate and provides a molecular link between early life stress and later-life behavioral phenotypes. Here, studies that combine neuroimaging methods and DNA methylation analysis in pediatric population with a history of adverse experiences were systematically reviewed focusing on: targeted genes and neural correlates; statistical models used to examine the link between DNA methylation and neuroimaging data also considering early life stress and behavioral outcomes. We identified 8 studies that report associations between DNA methylation and brain structure/functions in infants, school age children and adolescents faced with early life stress condition (e.g., preterm birth, childhood maltreatment, low socioeconomic status, and less-than optimal caregiving). Results showed that several genes were investigated (e.g., OXTR, SLC6A4, FKBP5, and BDNF) and different neuroimaging techniques were performed (MRI and f-NIRS). Statistical model used ranged from correlational to more complex moderated mediation models. Most of the studies (n = 5) considered DNA methylation and neural correlates as mediators in the relationship between early life stress and behavioral phenotypes. Understanding what role DNA methylation and neural correlates play in interaction with early life stress and behavioral outcomes is crucial to promote theory-driven studies as the future direction of this research fields.

TI  - Understanding the psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19: a meta-analysis of studies assessing psychiatric symptoms in Chinese patients with and survivors of COVID-19 and SARS by using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised
KW  - PREVALENCE
KW  - ASSOCIATION
KW  - NEEDS
AB  - Understanding the psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 could facilitate the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. However, the profile of psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 patients has been understudied. We performed a meta-analysis of studies assessing psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS patients and survivors by using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), an instrument covering a wide spectrum of psychiatric symptoms. Studies reporting SCL-90-R subscale scores among patients with and survivors of COVID-19 and SARS were retrieved from major English and Chinese literature databases. Patients' pooled SCL-90-R subscale scores were compared to the Chinese normative SCL-90-R data, and Cohen's d values were calculated to indicate the severity of psychiatric symptoms. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The search yielded 25 Chinese studies with 1675 acute COVID-19 and 964 acute SARS patients, 30 COVID-19 and 552 SARS survivors during very early recovery (up to 1 month since discharge), 291 SARS survivors during early recovery (1-6 months after discharge), and 48 SARS survivors during late recovery (12 months after discharge). None of the included studies were rated as good quality. The ten SCL-90-R-defined psychiatric symptoms, which were of medium-to-severe severity (d=0.68-3.01), were all exhibited in acute COVID-19 patients, and the severity of these symptoms decreased to mild-to-medium during very early recovery (d=0.17-0.73). SARS patients presented eight psychiatric symptoms with mild-to-severe severity during the acute stage (d=0.43-1.88), and thereafter, the severity of symptoms decreased over the follow-up period. However, somatization (d=0.30) and anxiety (d=0.28) remained at mild levels during late recovery. A wide variety of severe psychiatric symptoms have been reported by acute COVID-19 patients, and these symptoms, despite decreasing in severity, persist in very early recovery. The changing trajectory observed with SARS suggests that psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 may persist for a long time after discharge, and therefore, periodic monitoring of psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial support, and psychiatric treatment (when necessary) may be necessary for COVID-19 patients from the acute to convalescent stages.

AB  - Evidence suggests a link between recovery-oriented practise and service user outcomes in supported accommodation settings. Current clinical guidelines recommend recovery training for supported accommodation staff, however evidence relating to the effectiveness of this type of training is unclear. This review aimed to describe and compare the characteristics and efficacy of existing recovery training packages for mental health staff. The appropriateness and applicability of the interventions was considered in relation to UK supported accommodation services. Initial search processes returned 830 papers. After duplicate removal, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to 489 papers, leaving a final sample of seven papers. Data were reviewed using a narrative synthesis approach. The reviewed papers showed variation in the aims, frequency, and duration of the training interventions, although all included content consistent with the five-domains of the CHIME model. All interventions used direct, in-person teaching, and prioritised interactive, experiential learning, however a number were limited by the absence of feedback, the use of one-off, rather than repeated/follow-up sessions, and a reliance on classroom-based, rather than in-vivo, training. There was limited evidence to suggest a consistent effect of training on staff or service user outcomes, and there was no clear association between the delivery and design characteristics of the interventions and reported outcomes. In considering the development of recovery training for supported accommodation staff, little guidance can be taken from the reviewed literature. Any training package must be developed with consideration of the unique contextual and organisational characteristics of these services. The authors recommend viewing training as one component of a broader goal of service transformation.

AB  - Background: Psychotic episodes have been associated with damage to both grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM). Although a recent meta-analysis suggest that in long term treatment, first generation antipsychotics (FGA) are associated with progressive reduction in GM, second generation antipsychotics (SGA) seem to have benefits to WM microstructure.
   Methods: A search was conducted to identify controlled trials published from January 2000 to January 2021, which assessed WM integrity as measured by DTI in drug-naive patients with FEP before and after antipsychotic administration.
   Results: 3 studies met the criteria for inclusion. All studies demonstrated lower FA in psychotic patients vs HC. A 6-week study reported that antipsychotic medication results in a further decrease in FA within the bilateral ACG and right ACR, regions important in emotional processing. An 8-week study found that antipsychotic treatment increase FA in the SLF, resulting in improved symptoms and increased processing speed. A 3rd study found an increase in FA in several regions along with a negative correlation between FA and PANSS at remission.
   Conclusions: Drug-naive FEP patients have WM dysfunction at baseline and antipsychotic medications appear to alter or improve WM especially at remission. More controlled trials are warranted to validate these conclusions.

AB  - Objective To investigate the risk factors for musculoskeletal injuries in military personnel. Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in August 2019 and updated in July 2020 without language or time filters. The inclusion criteria were prospective studies that investigated the risk factors for injuries in military personnel. Only risk factors analyzed by at least ten studies were selected for the meta-analysis. For data analysis, the RevMan5.3 program was used to compare the number of participants with injuries between high- or low-risk groups. The measurement of dichotomous variables was one of the selected parameters for the analysis, as well as the Mantel-Haenszel statistical method, random-effects model, and analysis with a relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval for the included studies. Results A total of 2,629 studies were identified through databases. Thirty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The groups considered at risk were the oldest [RR = 1.22; (95% CI 1.06-1.41)], with overweight or obesity [RR = 1.27; (95% CI 1.08-1, 48)], with previous injuries [RR = 1.15; (95% CI 1.01-1.30)], and with the worst performance in running tests of 1,600-3,200 m [RR = 1.87; (95% CI 1.28-2.71)]. Gender, ethnicity, and smoking were not associated with injuries. However, a subgroup analysis showed that among studies with a follow-up of fewer than 12 months, women presented RR = 2.44 (95% CI 1.65-3.60) more likely to develop injuries. Conclusion Age, overweight or obesity, previous injuries, and performance in the 1600-3200 m run are associated with an increased risk of injury in the military.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder, comprises several pathophysiologic mechanisms including misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregation, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic loss. Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappa B), as a key regulator of a myriad of cellular reactions, is shown to be involved in such mechanisms associated with PD, and the changes in NF-kappa B expression is implicated in PD. Alpha-synuclein accumulation, the characteristic feature of PD pathology, is known to trigger NF-kappa B activation in neurons, thereby propagating apoptosis through several mechanisms. Furthermore, misfolded alpha-synuclein released from degenerated neurons, activates several signaling pathways in glial cells which culminate in activation of NF-kappa B and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby aggravating neurodegenerative processes. On the other hand, NF-kappa B activation, acting as a double-edged sword, can be necessary for survival of neurons. For instance, NF-kappa B activation is necessary for competent mitochondrial function and deficiency in c-Rel, one of the NF-kappa B proteins, is known to propagate DA neuron loss via several mechanisms. Despite the dual role of NF-kappa B in PD, several agents by selectively modifying the mechanisms and pathways associated with NF-kappa B, can be effective in attenuating DA neuron loss and PD, as reviewed in this paper.

AB  - Natural extracts and compounds from marine resources have gained intensive scientific and industry attention for radioprotective activities in the past ten years. However, the marine-derived radioprotectants have been studied against UV-rays, gamma (gamma)-rays and X-rays for more than 30 years. This review aims to identify key marine-derived extracts/compounds and their modes of action studied for radioprotective activities from 1986 to 2019. A comprehensive survey was conducted to establish the trend in terms of the publications each year and the countries of origin. A total of 40 extracts and 34 natural compounds showing radioprotective activities against UV-rays, gamma (gamma)-rays and X-rays were identified from a range of marine plants and animals. These extracts and compounds are broadly categorized into polysaccharides, phlorotannins, carotenoids and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). Macroalgae and microalgae were found to be the dominant sources of polysaccharides, phlorotannins and carotenoids. MAAs were mainly identified in algae, sponges, sea cucumber and corals that showed significant UV-absorbing activities. A number of radioprotective mechanisms were shown by these compounds, predominantly free radicals scavenging, inhibition of apoptosis, UV-ray absorption and DNA damage-repair signaling pathways. While these bio-discoveries warrant further investigation and development of radioprotective therapeutics, however, the lack of clinical studies is a major obstacle to be tackled in the future.

AB  - Many psychiatric and neurological illnesses can be conceptualized as oscillopathies defined as pathological changes in brain network oscillations. We previously proposed the application of rational design for the development of non-invasive brain stimulation for the modulation and restoration of cortical oscillations as a network therapeutic. Here, we show how transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which applies a weak sine-wave electric current to the scalp, may serve as a therapeutic platform for the treatment of CNS illnesses. Recently, an initial series of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of tACS have been published. Here, we first map out the conceptual underpinnings of such trials with focus on target identification, engagement, and validation. Then, we discuss practical aspects that need to be considered for successful trial execution, with particular regards to ensuring successful study blind. Finally, we briefly review the few published double-blind tACS trials and conclude with a proposed roadmap to move the field forward with the goal of moving from pilot trials to convincing efficacy studies of tACS.

AB  - Purpose of Review Disasters are becoming more common and challenge national and global resiliency and response efforts. As a result, government agencies have increased interest in disaster research to understand their environmental impact and healthrelated consequences. With the research field greatly expanding, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are being asked to review research protocols aimed at assessing health risks, exposures, and outcomes from disaster survivors. Few IRBs have experience reviewing disaster research protocols. This article describes approaches for IRB preparedness in reviewing disaster research.
   Recent Findings From a human research protections perspective, primary attention has focused on vulnerability of individuals and/or populations affected by a disaster who may serve as research participants [3, 4]. From our review of the current literature, there is a lack of best practices and/or guidance for IRBs in the review of disaster research protocols.
   Summary The growth of the disaster research field has brought more attention to potential ethical concerns of disaster research studies. Disaster survivors, responders, and those that assist in cleanup and remedial efforts may be left with significant unmet needs and long-term physical and emotional challenges as a result of their experiences. It is important for IRBs and investigators to collaboratively address how best to protect the welfare of individuals and communities affected by a disaster. A new approach is needed to systematically consider the various factors relevant to an assessment of human research protection issues following disasters.

KW  - FOCUSED ULTRASOUND
AB  - This paper aims to review the current state of brain-to-brain interface (B2BI) technology and its potential. B2BIs function via a brain-computer interface (BCI) to read a sender's brain activity and a computer-brain interface (CBI) to write a pattern to a receiving brain, transmitting information. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to systematically review current literature related to B2BI, resulting in 15 relevant publications. Experimental papers primarily used transcranial magnetic stimulation (tMS) for the CBI portion of their B2BI. Most targeted the visual cortex to produce phosphenes. In terms of study design, 73.3% (11) are unidirectional and 86.7% (13) use only a 1:1 collaboration model (subject to subject). Limitations are apparent, as the CBI method varied greatly between studies indicating no agreed upon neurostimulatory method for transmitting information. Furthermore, only 12.4% (2) studies are more complicated than a 1:1 model and few researchers studied direct bidirectional B2BI. These studies show B2BI can offer advances in human communication and collaboration, but more design and experiments are needed to prove potential. B2BIs may allow rehabilitation therapists to pass information mentally, activating a patient's brain to aid in stroke recovery and adding more complex bidirectionality may allow for increased behavioral synchronization between users. The field is very young, but applications of B2BI technology to neuroergonomics and human factors engineering clearly warrant more research.

AB  - Stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability globally that has multiple risk factors. A risk factor that has recently gained more attention is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Literature searches were carried out for updated PTSD information and for the relationship between PTSD and stroke. The review was divided into two sections, one exploring PTSD as an independent risk factor for stroke, with a second concentrating on PTSD's influence on stroke risk factors.
   The study presents accumulating evidence that shows traumatic stress predicts stroke and is also linked to many major stroke risk factors.
   The review contributes knowledge to stroke aetiology and acts as a reference for understanding the relationship between PTSD and stroke.
   The information presented indicates that screening and identification of traumatic experience would be beneficial for directing stroke patients to appropriate psychological and lifestyle interventions. In doing so, the burden of stroke may be reduced worldwide.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the efficacy and acceptability of the different types of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for the treatment of panic disorder (PD) in adult patients.
   Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1995 and 2020 on the use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for the treatment of PD. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were performed.
   Results: 42 RCTs were included in the network meta-analysis, with a comparison of 11 interventions.Escitalopram (odds ratios OR 1.52, 95 % credible interval CI 1.09-2.10), venlafaxine (OR 1.33, 95 % CI 1.16-1.51) and benzodiazepines (OR 1.50, 95 % CI 1.29-1.75) had greater efficacy and acceptability than the placebo. Imipramine(OR 1.43, 95 % CI 1.15-1.79) was also demonstrated to be efficacious and tolerated but the results were restricted to small sample size. Moreover, paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram and clomipramine (OR 1.37, 1.36, 1.45, 1.33 and 1.36, respectively) were more efficacious, although the acceptability of paroxetine and sertraline were significantly less tolerated than benzodiazepines. Notably, the efficacy of reboxetine and fluvoxamine were merely as equal as that of the placebo.
   Outcomes: This is the first systematic review of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for the treatment of PD to use a network analysis. Escitalopram and venlafaxine as well as benzodiazepines may be effective choices as treatments for PD with relatively good acceptability, which still needs to be confirmed byhigh-quality RCTs.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in which activated immune cells attack the CNS and cause inflammation and demyelination. While the etiology of MS is still largely unknown, the interaction between hormones and the immune system plays a role in disease progression, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are incompletely understood. Several in vitro and in vivo experimental, but also clinical studies, have addressed the possible role of the endocrine system in susceptibility and severity of autoimmune diseases. Although there are several demyelinating models, experi-mental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the oldest and most commonly used model for MS in laboratory ani-mals which enables researchers to translate their findings from EAE into human. Evidences imply that there is great heterogeneity in the susceptibility to the induction, the method of induction, and the response to various immuno-logical or pharmacological interventions, which led to conflicting results on the role of specific hormones in the EAE model. In this review, we address the role of endocrine system in EAE model to provide a comprehen-sive view and a better understanding of the interactions between the endocrine and the immune systems in various models of EAE, to open up a ground for further detailed studies in this field by considering and comparing the results and models used in previous studies.

AB  - Objectives: Prescribing antipsychotic medications to children and adolescents with severe mental and developmental disorders is common; however, there is a lack of consensus on appropriate metabolic monitoring for this population. This review systematically evaluates studies examining metabolic monitoring of children and adolescents prescribed antipsychotic medication to understand the clinical practice of metabolic monitoring and identify opportunities to improve the safety of antipsychotic prescribing in this population.
   Methods: A systematic search for original research on metabolic monitoring in children and adolescents prescribed antipsychotics was conducted in six databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library [Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL], Cochrane Methodology Register and Web of Science [Science and Social Science Citation Index]) from inception to February 2020 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were assessed for quality and findings summarised using narrative synthesis.
   Results: Fifteen papers were identified. Studies agreed on the need for metabolic monitoring; however, there was a gap between guideline-recommended practice and clinical practice. Variable rates of baseline and subsequent monitoring were reported for both physical and biochemical parameters, with particularly low rates for monitoring requiring venesection. Younger age was also associated with lower monitoring rates. Implementation of quality improvement activities (new guidelines, staff education and checklists) improved monitoring rates although the measurement of biochemical parameters still occurred in only a minority of children.
   Conclusion: Despite widespread awareness and concern regarding metabolic side-effects, monitoring occurred inconsistently and infrequently, particularly for biochemical parameters requiring venesection. Monitoring of anthropometric measures (weight, body mass index and waist circumference) with escalation to more laboratory testing where metabolic concerns are identified may improve monitoring. Minimising iatrogenic harm, through reduced antipsychotic prescription where possible, is a clinical priority in this population.

AB  - Air pollution is a major public health threat. The present study is the first systematic review (SR) to determine the association of exposure to air pollution and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Progression. A Literature search was carried out using relevant keywords within several international databases. A comprehensive literature search was carried out systematically and yielded 24 eligible studies concerning the relationship of exposure to air pollution including criteria air pollutants such as particulate matter, NOx and SOx, CO2, traffic noise, etc. and MS disease. The results of the included studies reveal that there was a significant relationship between exposure to air pollution and MS development and progression. Although the effect of air pollution in the pathogenesis of MS is notfully known, according to the results of the included studies exposure to polluted air can stimulate several mechanisms that act as risk factors for developing MS and for having disease relapses or neurological disability. The major potential mechanism is Dysimmune inflammatory responses subsequent oxidative stress (OS), which leads to neuroinflammation and breakdown of the normal balance between immunity and self-tolerance. Air pollutants induce and sustain chemical reactions that produce reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and nitrogen reactive species (RNSs) which can initiate inflammatory cascades via the redox-sensitive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-?B that recruit and activate neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells that stimulate the adaptive immune responses such as Th1 and Th17 inflammatory responses. The uncontrolled inflammatory responses following these events cause cell death and the release of self-antigens capable of stimulating the production of auto-aggressive T-cells via enhancing antigen presentation and facilitate entry of these cells to the central nervous system. Thus, oxidative stress is the culprit in the systemic inflammation and immune imbalance development and progression, powerful risk factors in MS.

TI  - Emotional contagion in nonhuman animals: A review
KW  - animal emotional empathy
KW  - comparative psychology
KW  - emotional contagion
AB  - Emotional contagion, the emotional state-matching of an individual with another, seems to be crucial for many social species. In recent years evidence on emotional contagion in different animal species has accumulated. However, despite its adaptative advantages and its presumed simplicity, the study and direct demonstration of this phenomenon present more complexities than previously thought. For these reasons, a review of the literature on emotional contagion in nonhuman species is timely to integrate current findings. In this paper thus, we carry out a comprehensive review of the most relevant studies on emotional contagion in animals and discuss the main problems and challenges of the field. We conclude that more research is needed to broaden our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of emotional contagion and the extent to which this process is present in a wide variety of species. Furthermore, the comparative study of emotional contagion would benefit from the use of systematized paradigms including both behavioral and physiological measures and the simultaneous recording of the responses of the interacting individuals to reliably assess an emotional state-matching between them and reliable controls.

AB  - Mental simulation of future scenarios is hypothesized to affect future behavior, but a large and inconsistent literature means it is unclear whether, and under what conditions, mental simulation can change people's behavior. A meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the effects of mental simulation on behavior and examine under what conditions mental simulation works best. An inclusive systematic database search identified 123 (N = 5,685) effect sizes comparing mental simulation to a control group. After applying a multilevel random effects model, a statistically-reliable positive effect of Hedges' g = 0.49, 95% CI [0.37; 0.62] was found, which was significantly different than zero. Using a taxonomy to identify different subtypes of mental simulation (along two dimensions, class [process, performance, outcome] and purpose [whether an inferior, standard, superior version of that behavior is simulated]), it was found that superior simulations garnered more reliable beneficial effects than inferior simulations. These findings have implications for integrating theories of how mental simulations change behavior, how mental simulations are classified, and may help guide professionals seeking evidence-based and cost-effective methods of changing behavior.

AB  - Introduction: Electrophysiological (EEG) abnormalities in subjects with schizophrenia have been largely reported. In the last decades, research has shifted to the identification of electrophysiological alterations in the prodromal and early phases of the disorder, focusing on the prediction of clinical and functional outcome. The identification of neuronal aberrations in subjects with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) and in those at ultra high-risk (UHR) or clinical high-risk (CHR) to develop a psychosis is crucial to implement adequate interventions, reduce the rate of transition to psychosis, as well as the risk of irreversible functioning impairment. The aim of the review is to provide an up-to-date synthesis of the electrophysiological findings in the at-risk mental state and early stages of schizophrenia.
   Methods: A systematic review of English articles using Pubmed, Scopus, and PsychINFO was undertaken in July 2020. Additional studies were identified by hand-search. Electrophysiological studies that included at least one group of FEP or subjects at risk to develop psychosis, compared to healthy controls (HCs), were considered. The heterogeneity of the studies prevented a quantitative synthesis.
   Results: Out of 319 records screened, 133 studies were included in a final qualitative synthesis. Included studies were mainly carried out using frequency analysis, microstates and event-related potentials. The most common findings included an increase in delta and gamma power, an impairment in sensory gating assessed through P50 and N100 and a reduction of Mismatch Negativity and P300 amplitude in at-risk mental state and early stages of schizophrenia. Progressive changes in some of these electrophysiological measures were associated with transition to psychosis and disease course. Heterogeneous data have been reported for indices evaluating synchrony, connectivity, and evoked-responses in different frequency bands.
   Conclusions: Multiple EEG-indices were altered during at-risk mental state and early stages of schizophrenia, supporting the hypothesis that cerebral network dysfunctions appear already before the onset of the disorder. Some of these alterations demonstrated association with transition to psychosis or poor functional outcome. However, heterogeneity in subjects' inclusion criteria, clinical measures and electrophysiological methods prevents drawing solid conclusions. Large prospective studies are needed to consolidate findings concerning electrophysiological markers of clinical and functional outcome.

AB  - This study aimed to provide insight into the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp) in patients with "clinical high risk of psychosis (CHR-P)". Methods: Major scientific databases were searched up to April 17, 2020. Randomized controlled trials in CHR-P individuals, comparing CBTp with needs-based interventions (NBI, including treatment as usual or nonspecific control treatment) were included, following PRISMA guidelines. The primary outcome (efficacy) was transition to psychosis by 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and over 24 months. Secondary outcomes were change in attenuated psychotic symptoms, depression, distress, improvements in functioning, and quality of life.Results: Ten randomized controlled studies met inclusion criteria. The comparisons included 1128 participants. CBTp was significantly more efficacious in reducing rate of transition to psychosis by 6 months (after post-hoc sensitivity analysis) (relative risk [RR] = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26, 0.73), 12 months (RR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.64), 12 months (RR = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.30, 0.69), and over 24 months (RR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.95) after treatment, compared with those receiving NBI. CBTp was also associated with more reduced attenuated psychotic symptoms by 12 months (SMD = -0.17, 95% CI: -0.33, -0.02) and by 24 months (SMD = -0.24, 95% CI: -0.43, -0.06). No beneficial effects on functioning, depression, quality of life, or distress were observed favoring CBTp.Conclusions: CBTp is effective in reducing both psychosis transition rates and attenuated psychotic symptoms for the prodromal stage of psychosis. It is a promising intervention at the preventative stage.

AB  - While cancer survivors commonly experience fear and anxiety, a substantial minority experience an enduring and debilitating fear that their cancer will return; a condition commonly referred to as fear of cancer recurrence (FCR). Despite recent advances in this area, little is known about FCR among people from Indigenous or other ethnic and racial minority populations. Given the high prevalence and poor outcomes of cancer among people from these populations, a robust understanding of FCR among people from these groups is critical. The current review identified and aggregated existing literature on FCR amongst adult cancer survivors from Indigenous and minority populations. The protocol of this review was registered with PROSPERO in July 2020 (Registration number: CRD42020161655). A systematic search of bibliographic databases was conducted for relevant articles published from 1997 to November 2019. Data from eligible articles were extracted and appraised for quality by two independent reviewers. Nineteen articles from four countries (United States of America, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom) met the inclusion criteria, including 14 quantitative, 4 qualitative and 1 mixed-methods study. Only one article reported on an Indigenous population. Few studies reported on FCR prevalence (n = 3) or severity (n = 9). While the variation in tools used to measure FCR hindered a robust estimate of severity, results suggested some differences in FCR severity between minority and dominant populations, although these may have been due to study metholodological differences. Few factors were reported as being associated with FCR in minorities across multiple studies. The qualitative synthesis found five themes associated with the lived experience of FCR: (i) variations in the lived experience of FCR; (ii) spirituality and worldview impacting on FCR; (iii) the importance of staying positive; (iv) complexities around support; and (v) increasing cancer knowledge. The findings of this review highlight differences in FCR across cultures and contexts, which reinforces the need for culturally-specific approaches to this condition. The dearth of research in this area is of concern given the significant burden of cancer in these populations. A deeper understanding of this condition among Indigenous and minority populations is critical to developing and delivering appropriate and effective psychosocial care for cancer survivors from these groups.

KW  - oral health
KW  - psychotic disorders
AB  - Aim To understand the relationship between serious mental illness and oral health self-care behaviours using meta-analytic methods and a narrative synthesis of available literature.
   Method The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines [PROSPERO reference: CRD42020176779]. Search terms pertaining to serious mental illness and oral health were entered into EMBASE, PsycINFO, Medline and CINAHL. Eligible studies included a sample of people with a serious mental illness and a quantitative measure of an oral health self-care behaviour (eg dental visits, toothbrushing). The Effective Public Health Practice Project tool was utilised to appraise the quality of the literature. Studies in the meta-analysis contained a non-clinical or general population comparator sample.
   Results People with a serious mental illness were significantly less likely to visit the dentist (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32-0.065, p > 0.001) or brush their teeth (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08-0.42, p < 0.001) when compared to non-clinical comparator samples. Few studies explored other oral health self-care behaviours (eg flossing and mouth washing), but uptake was generally low in people with a serious mental illness. The study quality of included studies was variable.
   Conclusions The research showed a reduced uptake of oral health self-care behaviours in people with a serious mental illness. Suboptimal oral health can negatively impact on physical, social and psychological functioning. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for low rates of oral health self-care behaviours in this population.

AB  - The aim of this review was to outline the most relevant benefits of forest bathing for well-being promotion. This study was designed as an umbrella literature review. Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the DOAJ were systematically searched for relevant reviews up to February 2021. After article selection, 16 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. Overall, the best available evidence supports the use of forest bathing as a complementary practice for the promotion of psychophysical well-being, whereas evidence for its use as a therapeutic practice for the improvement of organic diseases needs to grow before clear and specific clinical indications can be formulated. The positive impact of forest bathing on individual quality of life, along with its favorable cost-effectiveness profile, may justify its possible adoption for public health strategies of well-being promotion. Further investigations on the topic are advised.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the labor market and multiple aspects of work and workers' life. The present rapid review analyzes this impact considering the effects that COVID-19 pandemic had on employment and work-related aspects across different age groups. A comprehensive literature search was performed on scientific contributions published between 2019 and March 2021, resulting in 36 papers pertinent to the scope of this review. Findings were grouped according to different topics, all linked to age: occupational risk, implications on the labor market (i.e., job loss and reemployment, job insecurity, turnover intentions and retirement, and healthcare workers' return-to-work phase), remote work, and key individual and organizational resources and strategies. Overall, the review revealed variability across age groups in the impact this pandemic had on employment and several work-related aspects (i.e., occupational risk, remote work). Findings supported an age-differential effect of normative history-graded events such as the current pandemic, highlighting different responses and consequences depending on workers' age.

AB  - Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are disorders frequently seen in Alzheimer's disease. These symptoms contribute to reduction of brain reserve capacity and, in addition, they present unfavorable implications, such as: poor prognosis for the disease, increased functional decline, increased burden on the caregiver and institutionalization. This scenario makes neuropsychiatric symptoms one of the biggest problems in Alzheimer's disease, and gives rise to a need for treatments focused on improving these symptoms. Sow progress in drug trials has led to interest in exploring non-pharmacological measures for improving the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, such as physical exercise. Objective: To ascertain the effect of exercise on the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and its implications. Methods: This was a systematic review of effective longitudinal research, conducted by searching for articles in the PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and Scopus electronic databases, from 2009 to 2019. Studies in which the sample consisted of elderly people aged 65 years old or over with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease were included. Initially 334 articles were identified. After exclusions, 21 articles remained to be read in full. From these, five articles fitted the eligibility criteria, and a further two articles were added through manual searches in the references of the articles found. Results: Out of the seven articles analyzed in this review, five studies revealed that physical exercise had a positive effect on the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: This systematic review indicated that physical exercise is a favorable non-pharmacological means for attenuating the neuropsychiatric symptoms of elderly people with Alzheimer's disease, with special attention to aerobic exercises.

AB  - The actual coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the limit of emergency systems worldwide, leading to the collapse of health systems, police, first responders, as well as other areas. Various ways of dealing with this world crisis have been proposed from many aspects, with fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis being a method that can be applied to a wide range of emergency systems and professional groups, aiming to confront several associated issues and challenges. The purpose of this critical review was to discuss the basic principles, present current applications during the first pandemic wave, and propose future implications of this methodology. For this purpose, both primary sources, such as scientific articles, and secondary ones, such as bibliographic indexes, web pages, and databases, were used. The main search engines were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. The method was a systematic literature review of the available literature regarding the performance of the fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis of emergency systems in the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study highlight the importance of the fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis method as a beneficial tool for healthcare workers and first responders' emergency professionals to face this pandemic as well as to manage the created uncertainty and its related risks.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19) presents a variability of clinical symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory and systemic conditions. In a cohort of patients, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), beyond the classical respiratory manifestations, induces anosmia. Evidence has suggested SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia can be the result of neurodegeneration of the olfactory pathway. Neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 have been reported; however, the precise mechanism and possible long-lasting effects remain poorly investigated. Preclinical models are valuable tools for describing and testing new possible treatments for neurological disorders. In this way, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) organism model represents an attractive tool in the field of neuroscience, showing economic and logistical advantages besides genetic and physiologic similarities with mammalian, including the brain structure and functions. Besides, its external embryonic development, high availability of eggs, and fast development allows easy genetic manipulation and fast replications. In the present review, we suggest that the zebrafish model can be advantageous to investigate the neurological features of COVID-19.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
   The Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized not only by respiratory, but also neurological symptoms that may persevere even longer than the respiratory condition. However, some questions remain unanswered. How does the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enter the brain? Which brain regions are infected? How does the virus affect our behavioral and sensorial responses? Can the brain infection induce alterations that last longer? We propose that the zebrafish is a suitable model to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, especially because of the similarities between the fish' and the human brain. Zebrafish is a cheap animal model and several reproducible and fast animal tests can be used to investigate its behavioral and sensory functions.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Morinda officinalis oligosaccharide (MOO) capsules for depressive disorder.
   Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched for relevant studies from inception to April 19, 2020. Randomized controlled trials comparing MOO capsules with antidepressants were included. Data analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 software. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and the quality of the studies was evaluated by two researchers using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) software.
   Results: Seven studies involving 1,384 participants were included in this study. The effect of MOO capsules for moderate depressive disorder was not different from that of antidepressants (risk ratio [RR] = 0.99, 95%CI 0.92-1.06). Regarding adverse events, no significant difference was found between MOO capsules and antidepressants (RR = 0.84, 95%CI 0.65-1.07). In addition, the quality of evidence related to these adverse events was rated as low.
   Conclusion: This systematic review suggests that the efficacy of MOO capsules in the treatment of mild to moderate depression is not inferior to that of conventional antidepressants, which may provide a new direction for clinical alternative selection of antidepressants. However, more high-quality research and detailed assessments are needed.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and an important source of patient disability and caregiver burden. The timing, profile and rate of cognitive decline varies widely among individuals with PD and can range from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD). Beta-amyloid and tau brain accumulation, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are reported risk factors for cognitive impairment. Traumatic brain injury and pesticide and tobacco exposure have also been described. Genetic risk factors including genes such as COMT, APOE, MAPT and BDNF may also play a role. Less is known about protective factors, although the Mediterranean diet and exercise may fall in this category. Nonetheless, there is conflicting evidence for most of the factors that have been studied. The use of inconsistent criteria and lack of comprehensive assessment in many studies are important methodological issues. Timing of exposure also plays a crucial role, although identification of the correct time window has been historically difficult in PD. Our understanding of the mechanism behind these factors, as well as the interactions between gene and environment as determinants of disease phenotype and the identification of modifiable risk factors will be paramount, as this will allow for potential interventions even in established PD.

AB  - Objective
   Recent evidence has accumulated that the immune system is intimately intertwined with cancer development. Two key characteristics of carcinogens in which the immune system plays a central role are chronic inflammation and immunosuppression. In this systematic review, we investigated the association of chronic inflammatory and immunosuppressive outcomes with benzene, a widely used industrial chemical. Benzene has been confirmed to cause acute myeloid leukaemia and suspected to cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two cancers of the blood-forming system that affect immune cells.
   Methods
   We systematically searched PubMed and Embase for all relevant studies using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and selected key words. The detailed review protocol, including search strategy, was registered with PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews (#CRD42019138611).
   Results
   Based on all human studies selected in the final review, we report new evidence of a benzene-induced immunosuppressive effect on the adaptive immune system and activation of the innate immune system to cause inflammation. In particular, benzene significantly lowers the number of white blood cells, particularly lymphocytes such as CD4(+) T-cells, B-cells and natural killer cells, and increases proinflammatory biomarkers at low levels of exposure.
   Conclusion
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of benzene's immunotoxicity in humans. Based on results obtained from this review, we propose two potential immunotoxic mechanisms of how benzene induces leukaemia/lymphoma: (1) cancer invasion caused by proinflammatory cytokine production, and (2) cancer promotion via impaired immunosurveillance. Further studies will be required to confirm the connection between benzene exposure and its effects on the immune system.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe effects on communities globally, leading to significant restrictions on all aspects of society, including in sports. Several significant decisions were made to postpone or cancel major swimming events by FINA (Federation Internationale de Natation). Swimmers were no longer allowed to continue their usual training in swimming pools and were confined to their homes. These unusual circumstances may represent a good opportunity to strengthen different areas of swimmer preparation and potentially enhance performance when resuming regular aquatic training. We searched major databases for relevant information, and the present article provides practical information on home-based training for swimmers of all ages. The COVID-19 crisis and its consequences on the swimming community have created a myriad of challenges for swimmers around the world, including maintaining their fitness level and preparing to return optimally and safely to pool training and competitions. Unfortunately, the mental consequences that might arise after the pandemic may also have an impact. We strongly recommend encouraging the swimmers to consider quarantine as an opportunity for development in specific areas of preparation and learn how to best cope with this special situation of self-isolation and/or "physical distancing" for their mental health and in case a similar situation is faced again in the future.

AB  - Characteristics of early childhood education and care (ECEC) centers might be relevant for children's health. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the association between meso-level characteristics (MLCs) of ECEC centers with children's health, health behavior, and wellbeing. Five databases were searched for quantitative and qualitative research articles published in English or German since 1 January 2000 on health, health behavior, and wellbeing of children aged 0 to 6 years considering MLCs of ECEC centers. Two authors screened 10,396 potentially eligible manuscripts and identified 117 papers, including 3077 examinations of the association between MLCs and children's health indicators (Kappas > 0.91). Five categories of MLCs were identified: (1) structural characteristics, (2) equipment/furnishings, (3) location, (4) facilities/environment, (5) culture/activities/policies/practices, and 6) staff. Only very few studies found an association of MLCs with body weight/obesity, and general health and wellbeing. Especially physical activity and mental health were related to MLCs. In general, the location (rural vs. urban, neighborhood status) seemed to be a relevant health aspect. MLCs of ECEC centers appeared relevant for child health indicators to different degrees. Future research should focus on these associations, in detail, to identify concrete ECEC indicators that can support health promotion in early childhood.

AB  - Several studies have focused on neonatal maternal separation (MS) to investigate behavioural and neuroendocrine reactions to lack of contact, but only a few have focused on early separation in the first days or weeks after birth. This literature review investigates the vital importance of contact and touch by exploring how skin-to-skin contact (SSC) regulates stress in the mother-infant relationship. Various databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect were searched for literature published between 2015 and 2020. From 1141 articles, 22 were declared eligible. The reviewed articles showed how SSC regulates child stress by biological indicators such as the autonomic nervous system (ANS), heart rate variability (HRV), cortisol, and oxytocin. This research concludes the importance of SSC for stress regulation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. With no research to date indicating a possible risk of neonatal COVID-19 transmission following SSC, SSC should continue to be practiced for all women, as recommended by the WHO.

AB  - Simple Summary
   It is essential for cellular homeostasis that biomolecules, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, function properly. Disturbance of redox homeostasis produces aberrant biomolecules, including oxidized lipids and misfolded proteins, which increase in cells. Aberrant biomolecules are removed by excellent cellular clearance systems. However, when excess aberrant biomolecules remain in the cell, they disrupt organelle and cellular functions, leading to cell death. These aberrant molecules aggregate and cause apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death, leading to various protein aggregation diseases. Thus, we investigated the cell-death cross-linking between lipid peroxidation and protein aggregation.
   Lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes is a complicated cellular event, and it is both the cause and result of various diseases, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis. Lipid peroxidation causes non-apoptotic cell death, which is associated with cell fate determination: survival or cell death. During the radical chain reaction of lipid peroxidation, various oxidized lipid products accumulate in cells, followed by organelle dysfunction and the induction of non-apoptotic cell death. Highly reactive oxidized products from unsaturated fatty acids are detected under pathological conditions. Pathological protein aggregation is the general cause of these diseases. The cellular response to misfolded proteins is well-known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and it is partially concomitant with the response to lipid peroxidation. Moreover, the association between protein aggregation and non-apoptotic cell death by lipid peroxidation is attracting attention. The link between lipid peroxidation and protein aggregation is a matter of concern in biomedical fields. Here, we focus on lethal protein aggregation in non-apoptotic cell death via lipid peroxidation. We reviewed the roles of protein aggregation in the initiation and execution of non-apoptotic cell death. We also considered the relationship between protein aggregation and oxidized lipid production. We provide an overview of non-apoptotic cell death with a focus on lipid peroxidation for therapeutic targeting during protein aggregation diseases.

(2) Methods: Systematic searches were performed on the MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Physiotherapy Evidence Databases for articles published until October 2020, in order to identify randomized controlled trials which analyzed the effectiveness of myofascial therapy as compared to a control group, passive treatment, placebo, or another intervention, and allowed co-interventions on female breast cancer survivors. Two reviewers examined the sources individually, calculated the risk of bias and extracted the data (PROSPERO number CRD42020215823). (3) Results: A total of eight RCTs were included. The results suggested that myofascial therapy does not have a greater statistically significant immediate effect on pain intensity (SMD: -0.15; 95% CI -0.48, 0.19), functionality (SMD: -0.17; 95% CI -0.43, 0.09) and range of motion in flexion (SMD: 0.30; 95% CI -0.13, 0.74) than an inactive, passive treatment or another intervention. However, a statistically significant result was observed for the abduction shoulder in favor of the experimental group (SMD: 0.46; 95% CI 0.05, 0.87; p = 0.03). (4) Conclusion: In general, although we found greater overall effects in support of the intervention with myofascial therapy than other control groups/types of interventions, the subgroup analysis revealed inconsistent results supporting myofascial therapy applied to breast cancer survivors.

AB  - Objective A central adrenergic hyperactivation is described in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with probable variable symptomatic impact. Few studies have evaluated using the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin for such symptoms; however, given the likely pathophysiology involved, this drug may play an important role in the pharmacological approach to PTSD.
   Methods This study assessed articles already published on the use of prazosin through a systematic review along a timeline in view of the symptomatic target of difficult access by standardized treatments. The impact of using this medication for the general symptoms of PTSD is also discussed. Several databases were searched for articles in the literature on the use of prazosin to treat PTSD.
   Results A total of 168 articles were found containing search terms in the title or abstract. Overall, 85 articles met the criteria described, and 48 studies were explored to conduct the present systematic review. Most articles showed some improvement after prazosin administration, especially in relation to sleep symptoms (nightmares and night waking). Only one article demonstrated no improvement after the use of this drug. More randomized studies are needed. Conclusion Several clinical studies demonstrated the relevant role of prazosin for treating PTSD symptoms. Prazosin is an affordable and cost-effective pharmacological option compared to other drugs used to treat PTSD. Psychiatry Investig 2021;18(5):365-372

KW  - WORKERS
AB  - Despite high rates of critical incidents (CIs) in working class occupations, there is a significant gap in our understanding of responses to these events. In this study, we aimed to inform a response training module by synthesising the key elements of pre-, during- and post-incident responses to CIs and suicide in the workplace. A rapid review identified studies on responses to CIs or suicide deaths in the workplace published between January 2015 and June 2020. A systematic search of six databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociology Collection, Academic Search and Business Search Complete) and grey literature was performed. Studies were excluded if the focus was on non-colleagues. Two reviewers independently conducted record screening, a review of the full text and assessed study quality. The existing evidence was synthesised and interventions were categorised using Haddon's Matrix. Five studies were included, reporting on CIs across a range of workplace settings, including railways, factories, police and military, along with external critical response units. Overall, study quality was assessed as being poor. Most of the evidence focused on the pre-incident and post-incident stage. There is little evidence on responses to CIs in the workplace. Evidence-based education and training is necessary to establish organisational responses to assist with supporting workers exposed to workplace CIs.

AB  - In this paper, we try to build on the problems surrounding the management of human resources in health care organizations worldwide. After the analysis of the reviewed literature, we detected that the scientific community considers several recurring themes that need attention: stress, burnout, and turnover intention. Based on this, we developed a model of organizational commitment that aims to achieve performance and health quality, its main result the establishment of the appropriate management policies in order to avoid the abandonment of the organization through the search for commitment and job satisfaction. Amongst our main conclusions, we highlight the need to implement a human resources model for hospital administrators based on the relationships with "patients" not "clients" through the maintenance of a positive and strong atmosphere of staff participation. It is important to develop innovative practices related to clear job design that eliminate reasons for ambiguity and stress in executing the tasks of the healthcare system. Finally, we urge training programs in transformational leadership to promote the well-being and organizational commitment of employees.

AB  - Second-hand smoke is a neglected public health issue. Every year 1.2 million people die due to this exposure. Second-hand smoke is also related to various other diseases like cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, low birth weight, maternal depression, etc. The purpose of this review is to look over various studies and to gain an understanding of existing research about second-hand smoke and its adverse effects. In addition, we tried to identify the barriers behind creating a smoke-free environment at home and successful strategies employed and suggestion given in various studies. A comprehensive search of the recent literature related to Second-hand smoke was undertaken using electronic databases like MEDLINE, PUBMED, Google Scholar, and Research gate. Keyword searches were conducted for publications published since 2004 or later on Second-hand smoke exposure in pregnant women. Prevalence of SHS among pregnant women ranged from 24% 92%. Lack of knowledge, absence of comprehensive smoking ban, low status of women was among the main contributing factors. Community awareness and counseling by primary health-care physician was found to be successful strategies. There are various cultural and social barriers behind a smoke-free home for pregnant women. Interventional approaches like focused counseling by primary care physicians can help to overcome this issue. There is a need for behavioral interventions and community awareness to be done in this aspect.

AB  - Worldwide commitment to disseminate Psychological First Aid (PFA) training to enable frontline workers to support distressed individuals and/or manage their own self-care is increasing, but the evidence base of PFA training is uncertain. Method: a scoping review was undertaken by searching seven databases and hand-searching grey literature to maximise coverage of potential studies. Results: Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Three PFA training models were commonly used in research studies. A broad selection of PFA training outcomes were observed including learning, behavior, satisfaction and practice in crisis mental and behavior health preparedness. Conclusions: Research evidence of reasonable quality demonstrates that PFA training significantly improves knowledge of appropriate psychosocial response and PFA skills in supporting people in acute distress, thereby enhancing self-efficacy and promoting resilience. However, this review highlights inadequate guidance on how PFA training should be applied and adapted, significant shortcomings of reporting PFA training delivery, limited training evaluation and unclear training outcomes. Whilst behavioral, knowledge and system impact of the PFA training are promising, methodologically stronger evaluations which include systematic training adaptation and selection of sensitive outcome measures is needed to strengthen future implementation of PFA training and thereby enhance population preparedness for future emergencies.

AB  - Background: Depression remains an important health problem among older adults and it may be correlated with the deterioration of physical fitness, whose chief indicator is hand grip strength (HGS). The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between depression and HGS among older populations using the available literature. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct databases were searched. The inclusion criteria were as follows: written in English and published after 2009, subject age: >= 60 years, HGS measured using a hand dynamometer, assessment of the depressive symptoms using a validated tool. The following articles were excluded: studies conducted among institutionalized subjects and/or populations with a specific disease. Results: The total combined effect of 33 results presented in 16 studies included in the meta-analysis, converted to the correlation coefficient, was OEr = -0.148 (SE = 0.030, 95%CI: -0.206--0.091), indicating a weak, negative correlation between HGS and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The review of the literature and the meta-analysis demonstrated a relationship between low muscle strength and intensified depressive symptoms in older populations. Bearing in mind that depression is often unrecognized or underdiagnosed among older patients, lowered muscle strength should be an important sign for physicians and an incentive to screen them for depression.

AB  - Binge-purge eating disorders (BP-ED), such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, may share some neurobiological features. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement modality that may aid in research and diagnosis of BP-ED. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on EEG findings in BP-ED, seeking to summarize and analyze the current evidence, as well as identify shortcomings and gaps to inform new perspectives for future studies. Following PRISMA Statement recommendations, the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched using terms related to "electroencephalography" and "binge-purge" eating disorders. Of 555 articles retrieved, 15 met predefined inclusion criteria and were included for full-text analysis. Eleven studies investigated EEG by means of event-related potentials (ERP) in BP-ED individuals: 7 using eating disorder-related stimuli (i.e., food, body image) and 4 using non-eating disorder-related stimuli (i.e., facial expressions or auditory clicks). These studies found significant differences in the N200, P200, P300, and LPP components in BP-ED participants compared to controls, indicating that this population exhibits impairments in selective attention, attentional allocation/processing, and allocation of motivational or emotion-based attention. Five studies investigated EEG using frequency analysis; reporting significant differences in beta activity in fronto-temporal and occipito-temporo-parietal areas in BP-ED individuals compared to controls, revealing a dysfunctional brain network. However, the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of samples, study paradigms, stimulus types, and the lack of an adequate assessment of neuropsychological parameters are some limitations of the current literature. Although some EEG data are promising and consistent with neuroimaging and neuropsychological findings in individuals with BP-ED, future studies need to overcome current methodological shortcomings.

AB  - This article provides an overview of the impacts of climate change stressors (temperature, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and hypoxia) on estuarine and marine biota (algae, crustaceans, molluscs, corals, and fish). It also assessed possible/likely interactive impacts (combined impacts of climate change stressors and pollutants) on pollutants mobilization, pollutants toxicity (effects on growth, reproduction, mortality) and pollutants bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine biota. An increase in temperature and extreme events may enhance the release, degradation, transportation, and mobilization of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pollutants in the estuarine and marine environments. Based on the available pollutants' toxicity trend data and information it reveals that the toxicity of several high-risk pollutants may increase with increasing levels of climate change stressors. It is likely that the interactive effects of climate change and pollutants may enhance the bioaccumulation of pollutants in seafood organisms. There is a paucity of literature relating to realistic interactive effects of climate change and pollutants. Therefore, future research should be directed towards the combined effects of climate change stressors and pollutants on estuarine and marine bota. A sustainable solution for pollution control caused by both greenhouse gas emissions (that cause climate change) and chemical pollutants would be required to safeguard the estuarine and marine biota.

AB  - Objectives/methods The biology underlying sleep is not yet fully elucidated, but it is known to be complex and largely influenced by circadian rhythms. Compelling evidence supports of a link among circadian rhythms, sleep and metabolism, which suggests a role for mitochondria. These organelles play a significant role in energy metabolism via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and several mitochondrial enzymes display circadian oscillations. However, the interplay between mitochondria and sleep is not as well-known. This review summarises human and animal studies that have examined the role of mitochondria in sleep. Literature searches were conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Results Using various models of sleep deprivation, animal studies support the involvement of mitochondria in sleep via differential gene and protein expression patterns, OXPHOS enzyme activity, and morphology changes. Human studies are more limited but also show differences in OXPHOS enzyme activity and protein levels among individuals who have undergone sleep deprivation or suffer from different forms of insomnia. Conclusions Taken altogether, both types of study provide evidence for mitochondria's involvement in the sleep-wake cycle. We briefly discuss the potential clinical implications of these studies.

AB  - Aim First use of opioids often happens in adolescence and an increasing number of opioid overdoses are being reported among youth. The purpose of this narrative review was to present the treatment approaches for youth with high-risk opioid use, determine whether the literature supports the use of opioid agonist treatment among youth and identify evidence for better treatment outcomes in the younger population.
   Methods A search of the literature on PubMed using MeSH terms specific to youth, opioid use and treatment approaches generated 1436 references. Following a screening process, 137 papers were found to be relevant to the treatment of high-risk opioid use among youth. After full-text review, 19 eligible studies were included: four randomized controlled trials, nine observational studies and six reviews.
   Results Research for the different treatment options among youth is limited. The available evidence shows better outcomes in terms of retention in care and cost-effectiveness for opioid agonist treatment than abstinence-based comparisons. Integrating psychosocial interventions into the continuum of care for youth can be an effective way of addressing comorbid psychiatric conditions and emotional drivers of substance use, leading to improved treatment trajectories.
   Conclusions From the limited findings, there is no evidence to deny youth with high-risk opioid use the same treatment options available to adults. A combination of pharmacological and youth-specific psychosocial interventions is required to maximize retention and survival. There is an urgent need for more research to inform clinical strategies toward appropriate treatment goals for such vulnerable individuals.

AB  - The safety planning intervention (SPI) is gaining momentum in suicide prevention practice and research. This systematic review sought to determine the effectiveness of the SPI for adults experiencing suicide-related distress. Systematic searches of international, peer-reviewed literature were conducted in six databases (Cochrane Trials, Embase, Emcare, Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science), including terms for safety planning, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes. A total of 565 results were included for screening. Result screening (title/abstract and full-text), data extraction and critical appraisal were conducted in duplicate. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were primarily quantitative (n = 20), largely with general adult or veteran samples; a small number of studies explored the perspectives of staff and significant others. Half of the studies included the SPI as a standalone intervention, while the other half examined the SPI in combination with other interventions. Most interventions were delivered in-person, with a hard-copy safety plan created, while a smaller number explored internet-based interventions. Primary measures included: suicidality (ideation, behavior, deaths; 10 studies), suicide-related outcomes (depression, hopelessness; 5 studies) and treatment outcomes (hospitalizations, treatment engagement; 7 studies). The evidence supports improvements in each of these domains, with complementary findings from the remaining quantitative and qualitative studies suggesting that the SPI is a feasible and acceptable intervention. While positive, these findings are limited by the heterogeneity of interventions and study designs, making the specific impact of the SPI difficult to both determine and generalize. Conversely, this also points to the flexibility of the SPI.

Topics include how theta rhythms were discovered; how theta rhythms organize brain information processing into temporal series of spatial patterns; how distinct theta rhythms occur within area CA1 of the hippocampus and between the septum and area CA3 of the hippocampus; what functions theta rhythms carry out in different brain regions, notably CA1-supported functions like learning, recognition, and memory that involve visual, cognitive, and emotional processes; how spatial navigation, adaptively timed learning, and category learning interact with hippocampal theta rhythms; how parallel cortical streams through the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) represent the end-points of the What cortical stream for perception and cognition and the Where cortical stream for spatial representation and action; how the neuromodulator acetylcholine interacts with the septo-hippocampal theta rhythm and modulates category learning; what functions are carried out by other brain rhythms, such as gamma and beta oscillations; and how gamma and beta oscillations interact with theta rhythms. Multiple experimental facts about theta rhythms are unified and functionally explained by this theoretical synthesis.

AB  - Introduction: An emerging picture has seen increasing numbers of young people with mental health crisis attend paediatric emergency departments in Ireland. Following paediatric review, many are referred to in-house paediatric liaison psychiatry (PLP) services. This pilot study describes referral patterns and practice over a 1-month period across three Dublin centres. Methods: Case notes of all referrals to PLP were reviewed to extract relevant clinical and administrative data. For those admitted, costs associated with length of stay were estimated. Clinical profile, management and intra-hospital pathway differences were explored. Results: Fifty-nine young people under 16 years presented to one of the three EDs with an acute MH presentation. The sample consisted of 39 females (66%) with a mean age of 13.7 years. The majority (n = 34, 58%) presented out of hours. A substantial portion of youths presenting (n = 37, 63%) were admitted, and had a mean duration of stay of 4.51 days. There were differences between hospitals in terms of frequency of presentation with self-harm, admission rates and length of stay. Discussion: Different PLP service configuration, staffing and funding streams may explain some of the differences observed across centres, although the findings should be interpreted with caution given the limited sample size. Standardisation of service provision and management is needed for PLP services. Additional community CAMHS resourcing is needed to support the development of alternative pathways for youth in need of urgent MH review.

AB  - A number of human biomonitoring (HBM) studies have presented data on exposure to hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI)] and cadmium (Cd), but comparatively few include results on effect biomarkers. The latter are needed to identify associations between exposure and adverse outcomes (AOs) in order to assess public health implications. To support improved derivation of EU regulation and policy making, it is of great importance to identify the most reliable effect biomarkers for these heavy metals that can be used in HBM studies. In the framework of the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative, our study aim was to identify effect biomarkers linking Cr(VI) and Cd exposure to selected AOs including cancer, immunotoxicity, oxidative stress, and omics/epigenetics. A comprehensive PubMed search identified recent HBM studies, in which effect biomarkers were examined. Validity and applicability of the markers in HBM studies are discussed. The most frequently analysed effect biomarkers regarding Cr(VI) exposure and its association with cancer were those indicating oxidative stress (e.g., 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH)) and DNA or chromosomal damage (comet and micronucleus assays). With respect to Cd and to some extent Cr, 0-2-microglobulin (B2-MG) and N-acetyl-0-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) are well-established, sensitive, and the most common effect biomarkers to relate Cd or Cr exposure to renal tubular dysfunction. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 could serve as sensitive biomarkers of acute kidney injury in response to both metals, but need further investigation in HBM studies. Omics-based biomarkers, i.e., changes in the (epi-)genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome associated with Cr and/or Cd exposure, are promising effect biomarkers, but more HBM data are needed to confirm their significance. The combination of established effect markers and omics biomarkers may represent the strongest approach, especially if based on knowledge of mechanistic principles. To this aim, also mechanistic data were collected to provide guidance on the use of more sensitive and specific effect biomarkers. This also led to the identification of knowledge gaps relevant to the direction of future research.

AB  - Aims
   Suicide accounts for 2.2% of all years of life lost worldwide. We aimed to establish whether infectious epidemics are associated with any changes in the incidence of suicide or the period prevalence of self-harm, or thoughts of suicide or self-harm, with a secondary objective of establishing the frequency of these outcomes.
   Methods
   In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and AMED were searched from inception to 9 September 2020. Studies of infectious epidemics reporting outcomes of (a) death by suicide, (b) self-harm or (c) thoughts of suicide or self-harm were identified. A random-effects model meta-analysis for the period prevalence of thoughts of suicide or self-harm was conducted.
   Results
   In total, 1354 studies were screened with 57 meeting eligibility criteria, of which 7 described death by suicide, 9 by self-harm, and 45 thoughts of suicide or self-harm. The observation period ranged from 1910 to 2020 and included epidemics of Spanish Flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, human monkeypox, Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regarding death by suicide, data with a clear longitudinal comparison group were available for only two epidemics: SARS in Hong Kong, finding an increase in suicides among the elderly, and COVID-19 in Japan, finding no change in suicides among children and adolescents. In terms of self-harm, five studies examined emergency department attendances in epidemic and non-epidemic periods, of which four found no difference and one showed a reduction during the epidemic. In studies of thoughts of suicide or self-harm, one large survey showed a substantial increase in period prevalence compared to non-epidemic periods, but smaller studies showed no difference. As a secondary objective, a meta-analysis of thoughts of suicide and self-harm found that the pooled prevalence was 8.0% overall (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2-12.0%; 14 820 of 99 238 cases in 24 studies) over a time period of between seven days and six months. The quality assessment found 42 studies were of high quality, nine of moderate quality and six of high quality.
   Conclusions
   There is little robust evidence on the association of infectious epidemics with suicide, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm. There was an increase in suicides among the elderly in Hong Kong during SARS and no change in suicides among young people in Japan during COVID-19, but it is unclear how far these findings may be generalised. The development of up-to-date self-harm and suicide statistics to monitor the effect of the current pandemic is an urgent priority.

AB  - Performing and listening to music occurs in specific situations, requiring specific media. Empirical research on music listening and appreciation, however, tends to overlook the effects these situations and media may have on the listening experience. This article uses the sociological concept of the frame to develop a theory of an aesthetic experience with music as the result of encountering sound/music in the context of a specific situation. By presenting a transdisciplinary sub-field of empirical (concert) studies, we unfold this theory for one such frame: the classical concert. After sketching out the underlying theoretical framework, a selective literature review is conducted to look for evidence on the general plausibility of the single elements of this emerging theory and to identify desiderata. We refer to common criticisms of the standard classical concert, and how new concert formats try to overcome alleged shortcomings and detrimental effects. Finally, an empirical research program is proposed, in which frames and frame components are experimentally manipulated and compared to establish their respective affordances and effects on the musical experience. Such a research program will provide empirical evidence to tackle a question that is still open to debate, i.e., whether the diversified world of modern-day music listening formats also holds a place for the classical concert - and if so, for what kind of classical concert.

AB  - Background: Health-justice partnerships (HJPs) are collaborations between healthcare and legal services which support patients with social welfare issues such as welfare benefits, debt, housing, education and employment. HJPs exist across the world in a variety of forms and with diverse objectives. This review synthesizes the international evidence on the impacts of HJPs.
   Methods: A systematic scoping review of international literature was undertaken. A wide-ranging search was conducted across academic databases and grey literature sources, covering OECD countries from January 1995 to December 2018. Data from included publications were extracted and research quality was assessed. A narrative synthesis approach was used to analyze and present the results.
   Results: Reported objectives of HJPs related to: prevention of health and legal problems; access to legal assistance; health improvement; resolution of legal problems; improvement of patient care; support for healthcare services; addressing inequalities; and catalyzing systemic change. There is strong evidence that HJPs: improve access to legal assistance for people at risk of social and health disadvantage; positively influence material and social circumstances through resolution of legal problems; and improve mental wellbeing. A wide range of other positive impacts were identified for individuals, services and communities; the strength of evidence for each is summarized and discussed.
   Conclusion: HJPs are effective in tackling social welfare issues that affect the health of disadvantaged groups in society and can therefore form a key part of public health strategies to address inequalities.

AB  - A numerical investigation is conducted to review the entropy study of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) convection nanofluid flow from an inclined surface. In evaluating the thermophoresis and Brownian motion impacts, Buongiorno's model is applied to nanofluid transfer. Using Keller's implicit box technique, the governing partial differential conservation equations and wall and free stream boundary conditions are made into the dimensionless form and solved computationally. For different thermos physical parameter values, the numerical results are discussed both graphically and numerically. Verification of the present code with previous Newtonian responses is also included. To analyze the variability in fluid velocity, temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, entropy, Bejan number, shear stress rate, wall heat, and mass transfer rates, graphical and tabulated results are reported. The study suggests applications in the manufacturing of nanomaterial fabrication, and so on.

AB  - Gender diverse people experience significantly high levels of mental health difficulties, face significant barriers accessing mental healthcare, and often report negative experiences with mental health professionals. At the same time, healthcare professionals describe feeling deskilled when providing care for gender diverse adults. This paper aims to systematically review research into mental health professionals' experiences of providing care for gender diverse individuals, and the kind of research methods employed in these investigations. PubMed, SCOPUS, psycARTICLES, and psychINFO were searched, as well citation and reference lists of relevant articles. From 268 search results, 12 articles were deemed relevant to be included in the review. The studies used quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods approaches. Each article was evaluated against established quality guidelines. All studies were likely to have been affected by social desirability bias, and had limited exploration of participants' contexts, or social discourse. The quality of the articles varied. Clinicians reported having minimal training about gender diversity, and they tended to be less competent working with gender diverse clients compared to LGB clients. Participants described uncertainty working with gender diverse clients, and all the studies identified the need for improved training for mental health professionals working with gender diverse adults.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review randomized trials of the effectiveness of inpatient Consultation-Liaison (C-L) Psychiatry service models in improving patient outcomes, reducing length of hospital stay and decreasing healthcare costs. Method: We searched databases including Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO and EBSCO CINAHL for relevant trials. Two independent reviewers assessed articles and extracted data. The review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019120827. Results: Eight trials were eligible for inclusion. All had methodological limitations and all were published more than ten years ago. None reported clear evidence that the C-L Psychiatry service model evaluated was more effective than usual medical care alone. All the service models tested focused on providing a consultation for patients identified by screening. Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Conclusion: Whilst we found no evidence that any of the inpatient C-L Psychiatry service models evaluated is effective, the sparseness of the literature and its methodological limitations preclude strong conclusions. The trials do, however, suggest that purely consultation-based service models may not be effective. A new generation of robust clinical trials of a wider range of C-L Psychiatry service models is now required to inform future service developments.

AB  - Background: Cognitive behavioral therapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are evidence-based and effective for many. However, the reach and impact of these interventions are limited. Physical interventions hold potential to bridge a gap in the unmet treatment of trauma and stressor-related disorders.
   Method: This systematic review examined 84 studies from four decades of research on physical interventions for trauma and stressor-related disorders to: 1) describe the state of the field and 2) summarize the best available evidence. Reviewed studies were described in terms of measured sample characteristics and assessed outcomes. Treatment effect patterns were analyzed by intervention content and study design.
   Results: The majority of studies (65.9%) reported statistically significant reductions in posttraumatic stress symptoms; 40.9% used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Among RCTs, one performed rigorous, statistically powered analyses in an intention-to-treat sample.
   Limitations: High variability in reporting strategies among reviewed studies precludes analysis of variables such as intervention length, frequency, and dropout.
   Conclusion: Preliminary evidence for the efficacy of physical interventions for trauma and stressor-related disorders is promising. Larger scale RCTs powered and designed to identify mediators and moderators of these interventions are warranted.

AB  - The socio-ecological systems (SESs) framework provides cross-disciplinary insight into complex environmental problems. Numerous studies have applied the SES framework to coastal and marine environments over the last two decades. We review and analyze 98 of those studies to (i) describe how SES concepts were examined and measured, (ii) describe how the studies included feedbacks and thresholds, and (iii) identify and analyze elements unique to coastal and marine SES frameworks. We find that progress has been made in understanding key SES properties in coastal and marine ecosystems, which include resilience, adaptive capacity, vulnerability, and governance. A variety of methods has been developed and applied to analyze these features qualitatively and quantitatively. We also find that recent studies have incorporated land-based stressors in their analyses of coastal issues related to nutrient runoff, bacterial pollution, and management of anadromous species to represent explicit links in land-to-sea continuums. However, the literature has yet to identify methods and data that can be used to provide causal evidence of non-linearities and thresholds within SES. In addition, our findings suggest that greater alignment and consistency are needed in models with regard to metrics and spatial boundaries between ecological and social systems to take full advantage of the SES framework and improve coastal and marine management.

AB  - Brain diseases, including neurodegenerative, cerebrovascular and neuropsychiatric diseases, have posed a deleterious threat to human health and brought a great burden to society and the healthcare system. With the development of medical technology, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an alternative treatment for refractory epilepsy, refractory depression, cluster headaches, and migraines. Furthermore, current evidence showed promising results towards the treatment of more brain diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and stroke. Nonetheless, the biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of VNS in brain diseases remain only partially elucidated. This review aims to delve into the relevant preclinical and clinical studies and update the progress of VNS applications and its potential mechanisms underlying the biological effects in brain diseases.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and DNA methylation in adults from published observational studies. PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases were systematically searched for available studies on the association between air pollution and DNA methylation published up to March 9, 2021. Three DNA methylation approaches were considered: global methylation, candidate-gene, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Meta-analysis was used to summarize the combined estimates for the association between air pollutants and global DNA methylation levels. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q test and quantified with the I2 statistic. In total, 38 articles were included in this study: 16 using global methylation, 18 using candidate genes, and 11 using EWAS, with 7 studies using more than one approach. Meta-analysis revealed an imprecise but inverse association between exposure to PM2.5 and global DNA methylation (for each 10-mu g/m(3) PM2.5, combined estimate: 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.97 - 0.19). The candidate-gene results were consistent for the ERCC3 and SOX2 genes, suggesting hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5 exposure. EWAS identified 201 CpG sites and 148 differentially methylated regions that showed differential methylation associated with air pollution. Among the 307 genes investigated in 11 EWAS, a locus in nucleoredoxin gene was found to be positively associated with PM2.5 in two studies. Current meta-analysis indicates that PM2.5 is imprecisely and inversely associated with DNA methylation. The candidate-gene results consistently suggest hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene exposure and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5 exposure. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) network analyses revealed that these genes were associated with African trypanosomiasis, Malaria, Antifolate resistance, Graft-versus-host disease, and so on. More evidence is needed to clarify the association between air pollution and DNA methylation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose Psychiatric hospitals or mental asylums grew across the world in the colonial era. Despite concerns over quality of care and human rights violations, these hospitals continue to provide the majority of mental health care in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We sought to review the evidence of reform of mental hospitals and associated patient outcomes. Methods We adopted an integrative review methodology by including experimental and non-experimental research. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019130399). A range of databases and systematic hand searches were conducted by two independent reviewers. Research conducted between 1980 and May 2019, that focused on any aspect of reform in mental hospitals for adults (age 18 and upwards) with severe mental illness and published in English, were considered. Results 16 studies were included in the review. 12 studies met inclusion criteria, and four additional reports emerged from the hand search. Studies covered-India, China, South Africa, Grenada, Georgia, Sri Lanka, Argentina and Brazil. Key findings emphasise the role of judicial intervention as a critical trigger of reform. Structural reform composed of optimisation of resources and renovations of colonial structures to cater to diverse patient needs. Process reforms include changes in medical management, admission processes and a move from closed to open wards. Staff engagement and capacity building have also been used as a modality of reform in mental hospital settings. Conclusion There is some documentation of reform in psychiatric hospitals. However, poor methodological quality and variation in approach and outcomes measured, make it challenging to extrapolate specific findings on process or outcomes of reform. Despite being integral service providers, psychiatric hospitals still do not adopt patient centric, recovery-oriented processes. Hence, there is an urgent need to generate robust evidence on psychiatric reform and its effect on patient outcomes.

AB  - Aims To identify and synthesise peer-reviewed, published literature reporting perceived barriers and facilitators associated with cervical cancer screening attendance in EU member states with organised population-based screening programmes. Methods Quantitative and qualitative studies reporting perceived barriers/facilitators to attendance for cervical cancer screening were searched for in databases Embase, HMIC, Medline and PsycInfo. Data were extracted and deductively coded to the Theoretical Domains Framework domains and inductive thematic analysis within domains was employed to identify specific barriers or facilitators to attendance for cervical cancer screening. Results 38 studies were included for data extraction. Five theoretical domains ['Emotion' (89% of the included studies), 'Social influences' (79%), 'Knowledge' (76%), 'Environmental Context and Resources' (74%) and 'Beliefs about Consequences' (68%)] were identified as key domains influencing cervical cancer screening attendance. Conclusion Five theoretical domains were identified as prominent influences on cervical cancer screening attendance in EU member states with organised population-based screening programmes. Further research is needed to identify the relative importance of different influences for different sub-populations and to identify the influences that are most appropriate and feasible to address in future interventions.

AB  - This study aimed to systematically review the relationship of obesity-depression in the female sex. We carried out a systematic search (PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase) to quantify the articles (controlled trials and randomized controlled trials) regarding obesity and depression on a female population or a mixed sample. Successively, we established whether the sex specificities were studied by the authors and if they reported on collecting data regarding factors that may contribute to the evolution of obesity and depression and that could be responsible for the greater susceptibility of females to those conditions. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we found a total of 20 articles with a female sample and 54 articles with a mixed sample. More than half of all articles (51.35%, n = 38) evaluated the relationship between depression and obesity, but only 20 (27.03%) evaluated this relationship among females; still, 80% of those (n = 16) presented supporting results. However, few articles considered confounding factors related to female hormones (12.16%, n = 9) and none of the articles focused on factors responsible for the binomial obesity-depression in the female sex. The resulting articles also supported that depression (and related impairments) influencing obesity (and related impairments) is a two-way road. This systematic review supports the concurrency of obesity-depression in females but also shows how sex specificities are ultimately under-investigated. Female sex specificity is not being actively considered when studying the binomial obesity-depression, even within a female sample. Future studies should focus on trying to understand how the female sex and normal hormonal variations influence these conditions.

AB  - Successful career development requires increased career self-management and contemporary career orientations accordingly stress the importance of being self-directed, values-driven, and flexible. This paper provides an overview of key perspectives on contemporary career orientations in relation to career self-management (CSM), as well as a systematic review of these two streams of literatures. With a focus on highly influential classic and recent papers as well as on all papers published in the Journal of Vocational Behavior on these topics, we aim to integrate the literatures on career orientations and CSM and advance future research. To this purpose, we present an integrative framework of career self-regulation which views CSM as a dynamic process consisting of goal setting and development, information seeking, planning and execution of behaviors, and monitoring and feedback processing. This process is influenced by, and subsequently affects, individual career orientations. We finish the paper by providing several directions for future research in terms of examining more dynamic and self-regulatory processes, unpacking the role of context, integrating the larger proactivity literature, applying a work-nonwork perspective, and developing and testing interventions.

AB  - Exposure to early life stress (ELS) causes abnormal hippocampal development and functional deficits in rodents and humans, but no meta-analysis has been used yet to quantify the effects of different rodent models of ELS on hippocampal-dependent memory. We searched PubMed and Web of Science for publications that assessed the effects of handling, maternal separation (MS), and limited bedding and nesting (LBN) on performance in the Morris water maze (MWM), novel object recognition (NOR), and contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria (n=451-763 rodents per test) and were used to calculate standardized mean differences (Hedge's g) and to assess heterogeneity, publication bias, and the moderating effects of sex and species (rats vs. mice). We found significantly lower heterogeneity in LBN compared to handling and MS with no consistent effects of sex or species across the three paradigms. LBN and MS caused similar cognitive deficits in tasks that rely heavily on the dorsal hippocampus, such as MWM and NOR, and were significantly different compared to the improved performance seen in rodents exposed to handling. In the CFC task, which relies more on the ventral hippocampus, all three paradigms showed reduced freezing with moderate effect sizes that were not statistically different. These findings demonstrate the utility of using meta-analysis to quantify outcomes in a large number of inconsistent preclinical studies and highlight the need to further investigate the possibility that handling causes different alterations in the dorsal hippocampus but similar outcomes in the ventral hippocampus when compared to MS and LBN.

AB  - Background: Currently, more and more subfertility couples are opting for combined acupuncture to improve the success rate of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). However, the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in IVF-ET is still highly controversial.
   Objectives: The purpose of this overview is to summarize evidence of essential outcomes of systematic reviews (SRs) of acupuncture in IVF-ET and evaluate their methodological quality.
   Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search for relevant SRs in eight databases from inception to July 31, 2020, without language restriction. We evaluated the methodological quality of the included SRs by using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), which was the latest available assessment tool. The Risk of Bias in Systematic Review (ROBIS) tool was used to assess the risk of bias in SRs. We assessed the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) score to determine the strength of evidence. We excluded the overlapping randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and performed a re-meta-analysis of the primary RCTs.
   Results: This review included 312 original RCT studies and 65,388 participants. By using AMSTAR-2, we found that the methodological quality of 16 SRs was critically low, because they had more than one critical weakness. Our reviews showed that although the GRADE for quality of evidence profile was suboptimal, acupuncture seemed to be beneficial in increasing the pregnancy rate. Our re-meta-analysis suggested that acupuncture was superior to sham acupuncture in improving the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) of IVF-ET with substantial heterogeneity (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.13-1.52, p = 0.0004, I-2 = 66%). No statistical difference was observed regarding the outcomes of live birth rate (LBR), ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR), biochemical pregnancy rate (BPR), and miscarriage rate (MR) between two groups. When compared with no adjunctive treatment groups, acupuncture improved CPR (RR = 1. 25, 95% CI: 1.11-1.42, p = 0.0003) and OPR (RR = 1. 38, 95% CI: 1.04-1.83, p = 0.03). Acupuncture was more superior than no adjunctive treatment in reducing MR (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.03-1.95, p = 0.03) and BPR (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.37, p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: Although the evidence of acupuncture in IVF-ET is insufficient, acupuncture appears to be beneficial to increase the clinical pregnancy rate in women undergoing IVF-ET. However, there are severe heterogeneity and methodological quality defects, which limit the reliability of results. Further, high-quality primary studies are still needed.

AB  - In the past decade, brain and autonomic nervous system activity measurement received increasing attention in the study of software engineering (SE). This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to survey the existing NeuroSE literature. Based on a rigorous search protocol, we identified 89 papers (hereafter denoted as NeuroSE papers). We analyzed these papers to develop a comprehensive understanding of who had published NeuroSE research and classified the contributions according to their type. The 47 articles presenting completed empirical research were analyzed in detail. The SLR revealed that the number of authors publishing NeuroSE research is still relatively small. The thematic focus so far has been on code comprehension, while code inspection, programming, and bug fixing have been less frequently studied. NeuroSE publications primarily used methods related to brain activity measurement (particularly fMRI and EEG), while methods related to the measurement of autonomic nervous system activity (e.g., pupil dilation, heart rate, skin conductance) received less attention. We also present details of how the empirical research was conducted, including stimuli and independent and dependent variables, and discuss implications for future research. The body of NeuroSE literature is still small. Yet, high quality contributions exist constituting a valuable basis for future studies. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suffer significant distress due to their condition; however, there can be multiple barriers to treatment. Even following OCD-tailored treatment, symptoms often remain. Exercise may be an effective and available approach to managing OCD, and yet, there are no specifically dedicated reviews, limiting integration into clinical practice. This study aimed to provide an overview of the literature on exercise and OCD.
   Method: Four databases, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE, were systematically searched. 1534 records were screened and the reference lists of eligible articles were examined. For this review, 11 extracted studies were narratively explored.
   Results: Two observational and nine interventional studies were included, of which one article focused on youth and ten studies focused on adults. Physical activity likely reduces the risk of metabolic syndrome or general health conditions. Several pre-post studies demonstrated exercise's benefits for OCD symptoms, while the only randomized controlled trial showed negative findings for its efficacy in reducing obsessions and compulsions.
   Conclusions: The evidence for aerobic exercise's long-term benefits for the symptoms of OCD is mixed, but remains promising. Potential mechanisms of exercise's effects and future directions for research are explored.

AB  - Purpose There are significant documented inequalities for the Black community in the UK in relation to mental health care. Research has also indicated that cultural difference exists in pathways into, and engagement with, mental health services. To reduce inequalities and improve engagement with mental health services, it is important that professionals utilise culturally appropriate community networks to increase mental health awareness and reduce stigma. This systematic review considers research in Black faith settings, with two linked aims to review the evidence for the effectiveness of (i) mental health interventions, and (ii) other health stigma interventions as the latter have been implemented in Black faith settings. The review identified 'active ingredients' of interventions for this population that can be applied in future work. The authors seek to draw from the mental health and wider health stigma literature to inform the design of the ON TRAC project, a collaborative partnership between King's College London, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Black faith community groups in Southwark and Lambeth, London, in this currently under-researched area. Methods A systematic search of ten major medical and social sciences databases was conducted in 2019, for studies on mental health or other health stigma interventions in Black faith settings. PRISMA guidelines were followed and search terms and search strategy ensured all possible studies were identified for review. Results The review identified sixteen studies for inclusion. Ten were quantitative studies, four qualitative studies and two systematic reviews. Active ingredients of interventions included utilisation of 'bottom up' development of approaches and mental health champions. Multiple factors were found to influence effective implementation. Co-production and partnership working are key to ensure that an acceptable and accessible intervention is agreed. Conclusion Evidence for the effectiveness of interventions focused on mental health awareness and stigma reduction in the Black faith community is limited due to the low quality of studies. This review sheds light on the lessons learnt and necessary key requirements for interventions that can guide future projects. Study registration: PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018110068

AB  - Background
   Racial/ethnic minorities (REMs) continue to carry the burden of sexual health disparities in the United States, including increased health risks and lower proportions of preventative care. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been useful in developing interventions aimed at reducing these disparities. Specifically, partnership with the target group members has resulted in more culturally relevant intervention strategies.
   Aim
   The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the existing research on sexual health interventions targeting U.S. REMs that were developed using CBPR, to highlight the role target group members played in the development of these interventions, and to explore the benefits and outcomes of these partnerships.
   Method
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided the search of 46 thesauri terms for CBPR, sexual health, and REMs across six databases.
   Results
   The initial search yielded 805 identified studies. After applying limiters, reviewing abstracts, and doing a full-text review, 24 appropriate studies were retained. The key findings indicated significant intervention outcomes such as increased health knowledge, attitude change, and behavioral intention that could reduce sexual risk-taking behaviors. Twelve studies detailed the methods for partnering with target group members to formulate interventions, highlighting the benefits related to recruitment, retention, and cultural relevance.
   Discussion
   CBPR is well-positioned to address sexual health disparities among REMs. While community partnership strategies vary, the findings yield evidence that CBPR addressing sexual health disparities is achievable, can influence the effectiveness of interventions, and should be considered as an orientation in future sexual health research.

AB  - Maternal substance use has often been associated with insecure and disorganized child attachment. We evaluated this association with a meta-analysis of young children and, further, systematically reviewed mediating and moderating factors between maternal substance use and child attachment. We performed a systematic database search of quantitative English language studies on child attachment that included substance-using mothers and their children below 6 years of age. Eleven studies (N = 1,841) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis of attachment security and seven (N = 1,589) studies were included in the meta-analysis of attachment disorganization. We found that maternal substance use was negatively associated with secure attachment in children, but the effect size was small (r = -.10). The association with disorganized attachment was not significant (r = .15). Related to moderating and mediating factors (k = 6), we found evidence on the role of teratogenic and sociological factors on child attachment. Most importantly, the impact of cumulative risks was vital. However, literature was scarce, and studies varied in risk of bias, leaving many unanswered questions on other potential factors underlying the development of attachment in these high-risk children. We discuss the results considering clinical implications and future directions.

AB  - Objectives
   To address the extreme suicide risk period following a suicidal crisis, we aimed to assess the current evidence for specific healthcare system-based interventions on suicide-related outcomes within one-week or one-month in individuals with current suicidal ideation (SI) or a recent suicide attempt (SA).
   Methods
   We performed a database (Medline, Academic Search Complete, PsycARTICLES, the Cochrane library, PubMed) and manual reference search for randomised controlled trials, published between March 2000 and March 2020. Antisuicidal efficacy was defined as SI, SA, or a closely related concept. Quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomised trials.
   Results
   Out of 34 trials, five reported ketamine or esketamine superiority over placebo in reducing SI in depressed subjects within one week, while five studies had negative findings. Single trials reported positive results for one-month antisuicidal efficacy of buprenorphine, paroxetine, a crisis response plan, and assertive case management. Most trials were underpowered and had moderate-to-high risk of bias.
   Conclusions
   Preliminary mixed evidence suggests the possible utility of several pharmacological (ketamine, esketamine paroxetine, and buprenorphine) and non-pharmacological (a crisis response plan, and assertive case management) interventions. Only the immediate efficacy of ketamine was supported by multiple studies, and replication is needed.

AB  - Background
   Incidents of self-harm are common on psychiatric wards. There are a wide variety of therapeutic, social and environmental interventions that have shown some promise in reducing self-harm in in-patient settings, but there is no consensus on the most appropriate means of reducing and managing self-harm during in-patient admissions.
   Aims
   To review interventions used to reduce self-harm and suicide attempts on adolescent and adult psychiatric in-patient wards.
   Method
   A systematic literature search was conducted between 14 March 2019 and 25 January 2021 using PsycINFO and Medline (PROSPERO ID: CRD42019129046). A total of 23 papers were identified for full review.
   Results
   Interventions fell into two categories, therapeutic interventions given to individual patients and organisational interventions aimed at improving patient-staff communication and the overall ward milieu. Dialectical behaviour therapy was the most frequently implemented and effective therapeutic intervention, with seven of eight studies showing some benefit. Three of the six ward-based interventions reduced self-harm. Two studies that used a combined therapeutic and ward-based approach significantly reduced self-harm on the wards. The quality of the studies was highly variable, and some interventions were poorly described. There was no indication of harmful impact of any of the approaches reported in this review.
   Conclusions
   A number of approaches show some promise in reducing self-harm, but the evidence is not strong enough to recommend any particular approach. Current evidence remains weak overall but provides a foundation for a more robust programme of research aimed at providing a more substantial evidence base for this neglected problem on wards.

AB  - Objectives
   After decades of intensive research in the field of biological psychiatry and its partly modest and non-specific results, the self-critical question arises as to whether basic predispositions in epistemology and philosophy of science prevent bigger successes.
   Methods/Results
   Central here are the arguments that the brain is unable to recognise itself completely and that the psychological mental level cannot be connected with the physiological neurobiological level in a causal way.
   Conclusion
   In conclusion, for biological psychiatry it might be well advised to reflect on the research, diagnostics and treatment realistically achievable according to the theoretical framework, so that the impression of valid knowledge progress, although limited, remains motivating for our younger generation.

AB  - Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising nonpharmacological intervention for treating depression. We aimed to provide an updated meta-analysis assessing the anti-depressant efficacy of tDCS.
   Methods: We searched the literature from the first available date to 30 December 2020 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
   Results: 27 RCTs (N = 1204 patients, 653 in active tDCS and 551 in sham tDCS) were included. Active tDCS was superior to sham tDCS (g = 0.46, 95 % CI 0.15-0.76) in modulating depressive symptoms measured by depression rating scales. Active tDCS was also superior to sham tDCS in reducing response and remission rates, but these differences did not reach statistically significant levels (ORresporse = 1.75, 95 % CI 0.85-3.58; ORremission = 1.29, 95 % CI 0.59-2.83). The two groups had comparable dropout rates (OR = 1.28, 95 % CI 0.62-1.64).
   Conclusion: For treatments of depressive episodes, tDCS may be efficacious. Specific tDCS parameters (e.g., a 2-mA stimulation current and 30-min sessions) and clinical characteristics (e.g., antidepressant-free) may augment the treatment efficacy of tDCS.

AB  - Coral reefs are highly endangered ecosystems. The identification and quantification of potential stress factors are essential to protect them. UV filters from sunscreens that are introduced to coral reef areas are considered as one of these stressors and their impact on corals needs to be further investigated. Even though UV filters are functionally similar, their structural features are very diverse. Their impact on limnic organisms have also been shown to be highly variable ranging from no or low to high toxicity. It is therefore to be expected that their effect on corals also differs significantly and that each compound has to be evaluated individually. The demand for conclusive benchmarks and guidelines from policy makers and the public over the past years shows the necessity for an objective literature review on the effects of various UV filters on scleractinian corals. Here, we review the present literature, summarize the data on the different UV filters and discuss the different approaches, advantages and limitations of the studies. However, the methods used in the latter studies vary greatly. They differ in many aspects such as species and life stage used, field and laboratory approaches, with exposure times ranging from hours to weeks. Some studies include analytics and measure the actual test concentration, others only provide nominal concentrations. The lack of standardized methods renders comparisons between studies futile. Additionally, most UV filters have only been investigated in a single or a few studies of different quality. Reliable thresholds are therefore impossible to draw on the basis of currently available studies. Nevertheless, certain UV filters repeatedly showed comparable toxicity in both freshwater and marine species tested. Yet, existing differences in results from coral tests emphasize the need for a standardized testing method comparable to those established for other aquatic organisms in order to allow for a more conclusive assessment. In this review, we describe what a scientifically sound testing proposal should include in order to obtain reliable and reproducible data, which ultimately should result in an internationally organized standardized ring test trial. Such standardized toxicity tests would enable validation of coral toxicity data related to UV filters, but also testing of other types of compounds that are known to be introduced and effect coral reefs, thus helping to identify significant stressors and enabling objective policy decisions.

AB  - Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted extensive attention due to their low density, adjustable structure, functionalization, and good stability. This paper systematically and comprehensively describes to qual-itatively and quantitatively the progress, trends, and hotspots of COFs in the environmental and energy fields from the perspective of bibliometrics. Herein, based on the Web of Science database, a total of 2589 articles from 2005 to October 6, 2020, were collected. Thereafter, co-occurrence, co-citation analysis, and cluster analysis were conducted using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. The results indicated that COFs research shows the characteristics of rapid growth. The active countries were mainly USA, Germany, Japan, China, and India. More than half of the top 20 active institutions were from China. The research hotspots in this field were systematically elaborated, including synthesis, adsorption, catalysis, membrane, sensor, and energy storage. Research has shown that various COFs are reasonably designed, synthesized, and used in different applications. For example, when COFs are used for photocatalysis, groups containing photocatalytic active sites are integrated into COFs to improve photocatalytic activity. Finally, some challenges were proposed, that are beneficial to the rapid and balanced development of the COFs field. For instance, the preparation methods still need to be further improved for mass production and there is an imbalance in environmental applications such as fewer sensor and mem-brane applications. We believe that this study provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the environ-mental and energy applications of COFs for future investigations.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease leading to dementia in the elderly. Increasing evidence indicates that folate plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. To investigate the role of folate deficiency/possible deficiency in the risk of AD and the benefical effect of sufficient folate intake on the prevention of AD, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. The Web of Science, PubMed, CENTRAL, EBSCO, CNKI, CQVIP, and Wanfang databases were searched. The analysis of cross-sectional studies showed that the standardized mean difference (SMD) was -0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.65, -0.55), indicating that plasma/serum folate level is lower in AD patients than that in controls. Moreover, the combined odds ratio (OR) of case-control studies was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99), while the combined ORs were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.26) and 1.94 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.86) in populations with normal levels of folate (>= 13.5 nmol/L) and folate deficiency/possible deficiency (<13.5 nmol/L), respectively. In addition, the risk ratio (RR) of the cohort studies was 1.88 (95% CI: 1.20, 2.57) in populations with folate deficiency/possible deficiency. Furthermore, when the intake of folate was equal to or higher than the recommended daily allowance, the combined RR and hazard ratio (HR) were 0.44 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.71) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.99), respectively. These results indicate that folate deficiency/possible deficiency increases the risk for AD, while sufficient intake of folate is a protective factor against AD.

AB  - Background To systematically review the evidence published in systematic reviews (SR) on the health impact of staying at home, social distancing and lockdown measures. We followed a systematic review approach, in line with PRISMA guidelines.
   Methods In October 2020, we searched the databases Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Web of Science, using a pre-defined search strategy.
   Results The literature search yielded an initial list of 2172 records. After screening of titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening, 51 articles were retained and included in the analysis. All of them referred to the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The direct health impact that was covered in the greatest number (25) of SR related to mental health, followed by 13 SR on healthcare delivery and 12 on infection control. The predominant areas of indirect health impacts covered by the included studies relate to the economic and social impacts. Only three articles mentioned the negative impact on education.
   Conclusions The focus of SR so far has been uneven, with mental health receiving the most attention. The impact of measures to contain the spread of the virus can be direct and indirect, having both intended and unintended consequences.

AB  - Microplastics (<5 mm) have become an environmental hazard to natural ecosystems and humanity due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment, and possess detrimental effects on aquatic organisms. Sampling, extrac-tion, and detection of microplastics from sediments, surface water, and biota are quite complex and challenging. Rigorous research on the abundance and distribution of microplastics in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is pri-marily attributed to instinctive anthropogenic actions like land-based activities. Although, the fate and transport of microplastics in the environment are uncertain. Therefore, this paper reviews current research progress on the occurrence and distribution of microplastic pollution in the riverine ecosystem. Detailed potential sources, sam-pling techniques, and experimental design have been discussed, along with the classification and detection of microplastics in the riverine sediment and surface water. Microplastic ingestion through riverine species is also discussed systematically which emphasizes the extraction of microplastics from different body parts of the organism. Different types of polymeric microplastic have been observed in rivers, for instance, PS, PE, PP, PA, PET, PVC, PDPE, LPDE, nylon, acrylic, etc. using spectroscopy. Fragments, foams, pellets, films, fibers and microbeads are common shapes of microplastic which are abundant in the riverine ecosystem. The ingestion and ecological concern of microplastics, along with adsorption mechanisms of toxic contaminants, such as heavy metals, organic pollutants, nutrients, antibiotics, etc. onto microplastics surface and their exposure to aquatic organisms have also been discussed. Microplastic pollution in riverine ecosystems is under global change stress due to ecotoxicological and geochemical consequences. Further, detailed policies intervention for plastics and microplastics mitigation have been focused which delineate for application of science and policy together with scientific evidence. Lastly, scientific knowledge gaps and future research prospective on microplastic pollution have been given, along with suggestions and policy recommendations.

AB  - While the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of people to stay home and minimize their social contacts, newspaper reports worldwide raised concerns as they reported an increasing rate of intimate partner violence (IPV). One link of the measures enforced to control the pandemic to IPV might be a possible side effect of those measures, namely social and geographical isolation. As there was no scientific data investigating the association of IPV and social and geographical isolation in the context of epidemics or pandemics at the time of conducting this rapid review, we aimed at investigating a broader range of contexts of social as well as geographical isolation and its association with IPV to draw conclusions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (core collection). A research strategy was developed and observational studies were included if they considered men and/or women, estimates of social and geographical isolation, and IPV as a primary outcome. Of the 526 identified studies, 11 were included in this review. The included studies involved 15,695 women and were conducted in the USA, Sweden, Ethiopia, Egypt, Spain, and Turkey. Indicators of social isolation such as lack of social, emotional, or informational support or the frequency and quality of social contacts were narratively assessed. Geographical isolation was primarily assessed by physical distance to the next town or support service. Both social and geographic isolation were found to be associated with an increased risk of IPV. Recommendations made by the individual studies include the following: (a) improving access to social networks outside the victims' own group, (b) improving their economic circumstances, (c) asserting the responsibility for those in contact with the victims, and (d) increasing the focus on access to preventive services and programs need to be taken into account. Therefore, considering the particular infrastructure and legislation of the countries affected by the pandemic, policies need to ensure constant access to shelters and other help services and increase awareness for IPV in the society. In addition, future studies are warranted to assess prevalence rates and risk factors of IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objective: Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR), Health Anxiety (HA), worry, and uncertainty in illness are psychological concerns commonly faced by cancer patients. In survivorship research, these similar, yet different constructs are frequently used interchangeably and multiple instruments are used in to measure them. The lack of clear and consistent conceptualization and measurement can lead to diverse or contradictory interpretations. The purpose of this scoping review was to review, compare, and analyze the current conceptualization and measurements used for FCR, HA, worry, and uncertainty in the breast cancer survivorship literature to improve research and practice.
   Inclusion Criteria: We considered quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies of breast cancer survivors that examined FCR, HA, worry, or uncertainty in illness as a main topic and included a definition or assessment of the constructs.
   Methods and Analysis: The six-staged framework was used to guide the scoping review process. Searches of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were conducted. The principle-based qualitative analysis and simultaneous content analysis procedures were employed to synthesize and map the findings.
   Findings: After duplicate removal, the search revealed 3,299 articles, of which 82 studies met the inclusion criteria. Several critical attributes overlapped the four constructs, for example, all were triggered by internal somatic and external cues. However, several unique attributes were found (e.g., a sense of loss of security in the body is observed only among survivors experiencing FCR). Overall, findings showed that FCR and uncertainty in illness are more likely to be triggered by cancer-specific factors, while worry and HA have more trait-like in terms of characteristics, theoretical features, and correlates. We found that the measures used to assess each construct were on par with their intended constructs. Eighteen approaches were used to measure FCR, 15 for HA, 8 for worry, and 4 for uncertainty.
   Conclusion: While consensus on the conceptualization and measurement of the four constructs has not yet been reached, this scoping review identifies key similarities and differences to aid in their selection and measurement. Considering the observed overlap between the four studied constructs, further research delineating the unique attributes for each construct is warranted.

AB  - PALINKAS, L.A., and P. SUEDFELD. Psychosocial Issues in Isolated and Confined Extreme Environments. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV (1) XXX-XXX, 2020. Psychosocial elements of behavior and performance will significantly impact the outcomes of long duration missions in space, ranging from individual and team decrements to positive benefits associated with successful adaptation. This paper reviews our current understanding of the individual, interpersonal and organizational issues related to living and working in isolated and confined extreme (ICE) environments. Individual issues include changes in emotions and cognitive performance; seasonal syndromes linked to changes in the physical environment; and positive effects of adapting to ICE environments. Interpersonal issues include processes of crew cohesion, tension and conflict; interpersonal relations and social support; the impact of group diversity and leadership styles on small group dynamics; and crew-mission control interactions. Organizational issues include the influence of organizational culture and mission duration on individual and group performance, crew autonomy, and managerial requirements for long duration missions. Improved screening and selection, leadership, coping and interpersonal skills training, and organizational change are key elements to optimizing adjustment to the environment and preventing decrements during and after long duration missions.

AB  - Background: Smoking is a significant risk factor for mortality and morbidity among patients with schizophrenia. Objective: To clarify the effectiveness of multimodal smoking cessation interventions in adult smokers diagnosed with schizophrenia. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Relevant electronic databases were searched for clinical trials that combined pharmacological and non-pharmacological smoking cessation interventions for patients with schizophrenia, published up to October 2020. Primary outcomes were smoking abstinence and smoking reduction. Secondary outcomes consisted in psychiatric symptoms. Results: A final sample of nine articles was obtained from a total of 208 studies. All studies reported higher biochemically validated smoking reduction rates after treatment. However, the majority of the studies reported low smoking abstinence rates, which progressively decreased over time. Multimodal interventions did not worsen psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that multimodal smoking cessation interventions for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia should be recommended by clinicians, as they showed to be effective in reducing smoking without worsening psychiatric symptoms. Further studies are needed to understand how interventions can become more effective in helping patients achieve long-term smoking abstinence. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases such as prion, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases have distinct etiologies and clinical manifestations, but they share common pathological events. These diseases are caused by abnormally folded proteins (pathogenic prions PrPSc in prion diseases, beta-amyloids/A beta and Tau in Alzheimer's disease, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease) that display beta-sheet-enriched structures, propagate and accumulate in the nervous central system, and trigger neuronal death. In prion diseases, PrPSc-induced corruption of the physiological functions exerted by normal cellular prion proteins (PrP(C)) present at the cell surface of neurons is at the root of neuronal death. For a decade, PrP(C) emerges as a common cell surface receptor for other amyloids such as A beta and alpha-synuclein, which relays, at least in part, their toxicity. In lipid-rafts of the plasma membrane, PrP(C) exerts a signaling function and controls a set of effectors involved in neuronal homeostasis, among which are the RhoA-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCKs). Here we review (i) how PrP(C) controls ROCKs, (ii) how PrP(C)-ROCK coupling contributes to neuronal homeostasis, and (iii) how the deregulation of the PrP(C)-ROCK connection in amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases triggers a loss of neuronal polarity, affects neurotransmitter-associated functions, contributes to the endoplasmic reticulum stress cascade, renders diseased neurons highly sensitive to neuroinflammation, and amplifies the production of neurotoxic amyloids.

KW  - Methane
KW  - Microbial diversity
AB  - Microbial activities within oil reservoirs have adversely impacted the world's majority of oil by lowering its quality, thereby increasing its recovery and refining cost. Moreover, conventional method of extraction leaves behind nearly two-thirds of the fossil fuels in the oil fields. This huge potential can be extracted if engineered methanogenic consortium is adapted to convert the hydrocarbons into natural gas. This process involves conversion of crude oil hydrocarbons into methanogenic substrates by syntrophic and fermentative bacteria, which are subsequently utilized by methanogens to produce methane. Microbial diversity of such environments supports the viability of this process. This review illuminates the potentials of abundant microbial groups such as Syntrophaceae, Anaerolineaceae, Clostridiales and Euryarchaeota in petroleum hydrocarbon-related environment, their genetic markers, biochemical process and omics-based bioengineering methods involved in methane generation. Increase in the copy numbers of catabolic genes during methanogenesis highlights the prospect of developing engineered biofuel recovery technology. Several lab-based methanogenic consortia from depleted petroleum reservoirs and microcosm studies so far would not be enough for field application without the advent of multi-omics-based technologies to trawl out the bottleneck parameters of the enhanced fuel recovery process. The adaptability of efficient consortium of versatile hydrocarbonoclastic and methanogenic microorganisms under environmental stress conditions is further needed to be investigated. The improved process might hold the potential of methane extraction from petroleum waste like oil tank and refinery sludge, oil field deposits, etc. What sounds as biodegradation could be a beginning of converting waste into wealth by recovery of stranded energy assets.

AB  - Background Previous studies have shown that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 G > A polymorphism is closely related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk. However, the results were not consistent. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to explore the underlying relationships between BDNF rs6265 G > A polymorphism and PTSD risk.
   Materials and Methods Five online databases were searched, and all related studies were reviewed up to July 1, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to examine the statistical power of each genetic model. In addition, heterogeneity, sensitivity accumulative analysis, and publication bias were examined to check the statistical power.
   Result Overall, 16 publications involving 5,369 subjects were included in this systematic review and 11 case-control studies were analyses in meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated an increasing risk of A allele mutations with PTSD risk. Moreover, the sequential subgroup analysis also demonstrated some similar situations in Asian populations and other groups.
   Conclusion Current meta-analysis suggests that the BDNF rs6265 G > A polymorphism might be involved in PTSD susceptibility.

AB  - The auditory mismatch negativity, a component of the event-related potential elicited by an unexpected stimulus in a sequence of acoustic stimuli, provides an objective measure of the accuracy of the echoic information processing of the human brain in vivo. Auditory mismatch negativity is also a useful probe of cortical glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activity and disturbance. Notably, auditory mismatch negativity is consistently impaired in schizophrenia. Because of the wide spectrum extending from bipolar affective illness and schizoaffective psychosis to typical schizophrenia, we examined the literature on auditory mismatch negativity in bipolar disorder with the aim to find any neurophysiological dysfunction concerning pre-attentive information processing shared by these clinical conditions. This focused review includes 26 original articles published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed in the National Institutes of Health National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search system. Overall, evidence is consistent with the finding that auditory mismatch negativity is impaired in bipolar disorder with psychotic features, even though to a lesser extent than in schizophrenia. It must be acknowledged that, in a few twin and family studies, mismatch negativity abnormalities were not specifically associated with bipolar disorder. In conclusion, auditory mismatch negativity research supports the involvement of the N-methyl-d-aspartate system in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, as previously assessed for schizophrenia, thus creating an intriguing trait d'union between these two mental illnesses and stimulating the development of novel therapeutic agents. With additional replication and validation, auditory mismatch negativity may be further considered as a correlate of a common psychopathology of schizophrenia and bipolar spectrum illnesses.

AB  - The advent of Web 2.0 and its continuous growth has yielded enormous amounts of freely available user-generated information. Within this information, it is easy to find subjective texts, especially on social networks and eCommerce platforms that contain valuable information about users. Consequently, the field of opinion mining has attracted considerable interest over the last decade. Many new research articles are published every day, in which different artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., neural networks, fuzzy logic, clustering algorithms, and evolving computing) are applied to various tasks and applications related to opinion mining.
   Given this context, this survey presents a rigorous review of the different applications of fuzzy logic in opinion mining. The review portrays different uses of fuzzy logic and summarizes over one hundred and twenty articles published in the past decade regarding tasks and applications of opinion mining. This study is organized around three primary tasks, feature processing, review classification and emotions and also pays special attention to sentiment analysis applications whose core technique uses fuzzy logic to achieve the stated goals.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a very well-established and effective treatment for patients with extrapyramidal diseases. Despite its generally favorable clinical efficacy, some undesirable outcomes associated with DBS have been reported. Among such complications are incidences of suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) in patients undergoing this neurosurgical procedure. However, causal associations between DBS and increased suicide risk are not demonstrated and they constitute a debated issue. In light of these observations, the main objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive and unbiased overview of the literature on suicide risk in patients who received subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal part of globus pallidum (GPi) DBS treatment. Additionally, putative mechanisms that might be involved in the development of SI and SB in these patients as well as caveats associated with these hypotheses are introduced. Finally, we briefly propose some clinical implications, including therapeutic strategies addressing these potential disease mechanisms. While a mechanistic connection between DBS and suicidality remains a controversial topic that requires further investigation, it is of critical importance to consider suicide risk as an integral component of candidate selection and post-operative care in DBS.

AB  - For more than 4 decades, the Atoyac River in central Mexico has been subjected to anthropogenic stresses driven by the urban and industrial wastewater discharges, as well as leachates coming from intensive peri-urb an agricultural practices. This review provides an overview of the levels of organic, inorganic and microbiological contaminants found during the past 10 years in waters and bed sediments of the Atoyac system, and the implication of this pollution over the human health. Overall, the Atoyac waters present high loads of nutrients, BOD5, COD, TDS and trace elements (Al, Fe, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cu). The bacteriological pollution is extremely high; with total coliform values of up to 1012 MPN/ 100 mL. Anthropogenic organics such as PAHs, PCBs and organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides have been also found in river waters. Although pharmaceuticals have not been surveyed in a broad range, considerable concentrations of Triclosan, Naproxen and Diclofenac have been detected in river waters. Regarding sediments, anoxic conditions promote the precipitation/enrichment of sulfides and associated trace elements (As, Fe, Mo, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr). Microplastics in sediments included films (25.9%), fragments (22.2%), fibers (14.8% ) and pellets (11.1%). Fibers from the textile industry were found to accumulate in the aquatic biota of the Valsequillo reservoir. Quality indexes demonstrated that waters and sediments in the Puebla City are the most contaminated. The water of this zone reached the classification of strongly contaminated, whereas the sediments showed the most accumulation/enrichment of major and trace elements of the riverine zones. The main pathologies found in humans were gastrointestinal diseases, whereas children living in vulnerable zones showed elevated levels of cancer biomarkers. Studies have indicated a high risk of suffering cancerous diseases in children that consume contaminated groundwater and high risks for developing non-cancerous diseases in adults working with river-irrigated soils and children consuming milk with high content of river-derived Arsenic.

AB  - Over the last few decades, nanotechnology has risen to the forefront of both the research and industrial interest, resulting in the manufacture and utilization of various nanomaterials, as well as in their integration into a wide range of fields. However, the consequent elevated exposure to such materials raises serious concerns regarding their effects on human health and safety. Existing scientific data indicate that the induction of oxidative stress, through the excessive generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), might be the principal mechanism of exerting their toxicity. Meanwhile, a number of nanomaterials exhibit antioxidant properties, either intrinsic or resulting from their functionalization with conventional antioxidants. Considering that their redox properties are implicated in the manifestation of their biological effects, we propose an integrated approach for the assessment of the redox-related activities of nanomaterials at three biological levels (in vitro-cell free systems, cell cultures, in vivo). Towards this direction, a battery of translational biomarkers is recommended, and a series of reliable protocols are presented in detail. The aim of the present approach is to acquire a better understanding with respect to the biological actions of nanomaterials in the interrelated fields of Redox Biology and Toxicology.

TI  - Channelopathies in fragile X syndrome
AB  - Ion channel dysfunctions contribute significantly to fragile X pathophysiology. In this Review, Deng and Klyachko discuss the mechanisms underlying the effects of these channelopathies in fragile X syndrome, and the therapeutic potential of pharmacological interventions that target ion channels.
   Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and the leading monogenic cause of autism. The condition stems from loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which regulates a wide range of ion channels via translational control, protein-protein interactions and second messenger pathways. Rapidly increasing evidence demonstrates that loss of FMRP leads to numerous ion channel dysfunctions (that is, channelopathies), which in turn contribute significantly to FXS pathophysiology. Consistent with this, pharmacological or genetic interventions that target dysregulated ion channels effectively restore neuronal excitability, synaptic function and behavioural phenotypes in FXS animal models. Recent studies further support a role for direct and rapid FMRP-channel interactions in regulating ion channel function. This Review lays out the current state of knowledge in the field regarding channelopathies and the pathogenesis of FXS, including promising therapeutic implications.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a deliberately progressive neurological disorder, arises due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The loss of dopaminergic nerves and dopamine deficiency leads to motor symptoms characterized by rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. Heavy metals and trace elements play various physiological and pathological roles in the nervous system. Excessive exposure to toxic metals like mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), aluminium (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium(cd), and selenium (Se) cross the blood-brain barrier to enter into the brain and leads to dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Excessive concentrations of heavy metals in the brain promote oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the formation of alpha-synuclein leads to dopaminergic neuronal damage. There is increasing evidence that heavy metals normally present in the human body in minute concentration also cause accumulation to initiate the free radical formation and affecting the basal ganglia signaling. In this review, we explored how these metals affect brain physiology and their roles in the accumulation of toxic proteins (alpha-synuclein and Lewy bodies). We have also discussed the metals associated with neurotoxic effects and their prevention as management of PD. Our goal is to increase the awareness of metals as players in the onset and progression of PD.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has become an increasingly viable non-pharmacological adjunct to reduce the use of analgesics in hospitals. Within the context of the ongoing opioid epidemic, VR can serve as an invaluable alternative to traditional pain management techniques. While VR research continues to advance, there is no clear consensus on the terms used to describe critical aspects of VR. This paper presents how immersion, presence, and agency encapsulate the VR experience and investigates the methods by which VR can relieve pain by changing users' cognition and perception of pain. Multiple clinical studies investigating VR efficacy indicate that higher degrees of immersion, presence, and agency are all correlated with greater pain reduction. These studies also demonstrate that VR analgesia is effective for patients with various medical conditions and for those undergoing painful medical procedures. Furthermore, the shared biological mechanisms between pain and anxiety suggest that reducing either through the use of VR will reduce the other. As a nascent field of research, VR analgesia has key obstacles to overcome in order to become a mainstream intervention for pain management in hospital settings.

AB  - Sleep disturbance may be a central, yet underappreciated mechanism by which early adversity has a long-term impact upon mental and physical health. The fundamental regulatory processes shaped by early adversity - neural, neuroendocrine, and immune - are also central to sleep. Sleep problems, in turn, lead to a similar constellation of chronic health problems that have been linked to early adversity. We bring together work from the fields of early adversity and sleep in order to suggest a model by which sleep disturbance plays a critical role in the far-reaching impacts of early adversity on health. Future research should employ more longitudinal designs and pay particular attention to the impact of developmental periods such as adolescence and midlife when maturational and environmental factors conspire to create a unique time of sleep disturbance. We also suggesting that intervening to minimize sleep disturbance may be a promising means by which to test the model, as well as potentially blunt the long-term impact of early adversity on health.

AB  - Introduction In 2016, low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) accounted for 79% of the global suicide deaths. In LMICs, vulnerable groups-women, sexual minorities and refugees, and internally displaced persons (IDPs)-are at high risk of suicidal ideation, attempts and deaths by suicide, but information for designing targeted interventions for them is fragmented and missing, making it difficult to address gaps in the existing system. This review highlights these gaps by mapping: (a) risk factors associated with suicides and suicidal behavior including challenges in implementing targeted programmes for vulnerable groups; and (b) recommendations for effective suicide prevention interventions and strategies in LMICs as documented in the literature.
   Methods A descriptive mapping review of literature was conducted. Three electronic databases-PubMed, Google Scholar, and Refworld-were searched for specific keywords. The researchers mapped and reviewed 34 studies on suicide and suicide prevention across three main vulnerable groups.
   Results This review highlighted the need for gender-specific interventions for women and sexual minorities, addressing gender-based discrimination, access to healthcare, abuse and violence, while for refugees and IDPs, critical concerns are monitoring and understanding suicidal behaviors and to address psychological and emotional responses to resettlement.
   Conclusion In LMICs, specific and unique socio-cultural and environmental factors may increase the risk of vulnerable groups to suicidal behaviors. In order to develop effective and comprehensive suicide prevention strategies, it is crucial to evaluate these differential risk factors and develop culturally appropriate and sensitive interventions and strategies.

AB  - Background Innovations in virtual reality (VR) technologies have improved the adaptability of its use in therapeutic settings, and VR has shown to be a promising treatment for fear of medical procedures, with research increasing in this area in recent years.
   Purpose This review aims to collate evidence for the impact of VR on fear of medical procedures.
   Methods CENTRAL (Cochrane), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO databases were searched up to October 2020. A mix of experimental and case-control studies were included for review, which evaluated the effectiveness of VR for fear, anxiety, and pain of medical procedures for people with needle phobia, dental phobia, claustrophobia of medical scans, and burn wound care anxiety. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed by Cochrane and ROBINS-I tools.
   Results Twenty-eight studies were selected. Some studies included mixed participant groups of young people adults. The interventions varied, with VR used for distraction, hypnosis, or exposure. These were shown to be effective for reducing fear of medical procedures. However, effectiveness for blood-injection-injury phobias and burn wound care patients was unclear.
   Conclusions Evidence on the effectiveness of VR suggests that it does decrease fear of medical procedures in some situations. However, the RoB assessment illustrated a poor quality of studies across those included in this review, limiting the ability to draw firm general conclusions from the study findings. There is a need for further research exploring the use of VR technologies in the management of anxiety in physical health care settings.

AB  - Although issues pertaining to infertility affect both males and females, women often become victims of stigmatization and rejection, making them susceptible to emotional pain and suffering. Due to these psychosocial problems, they require not only biomedical treatment, but also psychological, social, and spiritual support. Unfortunately, many women with infertility are not treated holistically. The aim of this review was to retrieve existing evidence of holistic healthcare interventions for women with infertility. Global databases were searched for articles published anywhere in the world between 2010 to 2018 that explored holistic healthcare interventions for women diagnosed with infertility. A total of 18 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed, and data extraction was performed. Findings revealed that interventions adopted in managing infertile women alongside the bio-medical management included: counseling; cognitive behavioral therapy; acceptance and commitment therapy; educational interventions; spiritual interventions; emotionally focused therapy/intervention and integrative body-mind-spirit interventions. The results of this review have implications for healthcare professionals to ensure holistic care of women diagnosed with infertility in Ghana and Africa at large.

AB  - Health beliefs, and especially illness representations, have been widely used to understand clinical outcomes and psychosocial adjustment in people with physical diseases. However, this area of research hasbeen under-explored in the field of mental health, and the few studies that have been conducted haveused very different methods. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify the tools and methods thathave been used to evaluate illness representations in psychiatry. To this end, a mini review has beenconducted and 58 articles were retained. This mini review highlights that the quantitative method is themost used, and that the scales mobilised are often adapted for the study, but not validated. Indeed, multiple modifications and adaptations have been made by the authors (e.g. deletion of subscales, additionof items), which lead to questions about the reliability of what is measured. In the future, it is essentialto have a validated generic tool for mental disorders, which could be based on the Illness perceptionsquestionnaire for schizophrenia. (C) 2021 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB  - Background
   Coercive treatment comprises a broad range of practices, ranging from implicit or explicit pressure to accept certain treatment to the use of forced practices such as involuntary admission, seclusion and restraint. Coercion is common in mental health services.
   Aims
   To evaluate the strength and credibility of evidence on the efficacy of interventions to reduce coercive treatment in mental health services. Protocol registration: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/S76T3.
   Method
   Systematic literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Campbell Collaboration, and Epistemonikos from January 2010 to January 2020 for meta-analyses of randomised studies. Summary effects were recalculated using a common metric and random-effects models. We assessed between-study heterogeneity, predictive intervals, publication bias, small-study effects and whether the results of the observed positive studies were more than expected by chance. On the basis of these calculations, strength of associations was classified using quantitative umbrella review criteria, and credibility of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.
   Results
   A total of 23 primary studies (19 conducted in European countries and 4 in the USA) enrolling 8554 participants were included. The evidence on the efficacy of staff training to reduce use of restraint was supported by the most robust evidence (relative risk RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.87; suggestive association, GRADE: moderate), followed by evidence on the efficacy of shared decision-making interventions to reduce involuntary admissions of adults with severe mental illness (RR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.92; weak association, GRADE: moderate) and by the evidence on integrated care interventions (RR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.95; weak association, GRADE: low). By contrast, community treatment orders and adherence therapy had no effect on involuntary admission rates.
   Conclusions
   Different levels of evidence indicate the benefit of staff training, shared decision-making interventions and integrated care interventions to reduce coercive treatment in mental health services. These different levels of evidence should be considered in the development of policy, clinical and implementation initiatives to reduce coercive practices in mental healthcare, and should lead to further studies in both high- and low-income countries to improve the strength and credibility of the evidence base.

AB  - Maternal nutrition is an environmental determinant for offspring growth and development, especially in critical periods. Nutritional imbalances during these phases can promote dysregulations in food intake and feeding preference in offspring, affecting body composition. The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the effects of maternal high-fat diet (HFD) on offspring feeding behavior and body composition. A search was performed in the PUBMED, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and LILACS databases. Inclusion criteria were studies in rodents whose mothers were submitted to HFD that assessed outcomes of food or caloric intake on offspring and food preference associated or not with body weight or body composition analysis. At the end of the search, 17 articles with the proposed characteristics were included. In these studies, 15 articles manipulated diet during pregnancy and lactation, 1 during pregnancy only, and 1 during lactation only. Maternal exposure to a HFD leads to increased food intake, increased preference for HFDs, and earlier food independence in offspring. The offspring from HFD mothers present low birthweight but become heavier into adulthood. In addition, these animals also exhibited greater fat deposition on white adipose tissue pads. In conclusion, maternal exposure to HFD may compromise parameters in feeding behavior and body composition of offspring, impairing the health from conception until adulthood.

AB  - Technological advancement is constantly evolving, and it is also developing in the mental health field. Various applications, often based on virtual reality, have been implemented to carry out psychological assessments and interventions, using innovative human-machine interaction systems. In this context, the LEAP Motion sensing technology has raised interest, since it allows for more natural interactions with digital contents, via an optical tracking of hand and finger movements. Recent research has considered LEAP Motion features in virtual-reality-based systems, to meet specific needs of different clinical populations, varying in age and type of disorder. The present paper carried out a systematic mini-review of the available literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The inclusion criteria were (i) publication date between 2013 and 2020, (ii) being an empirical study or project report, (iii) written in English or Italian languages, (iv) published in a scholarly peer-reviewed journal and/or conference proceedings, and (v) assessing LEAP Motion intervention for four specific psychological domains (i.e., autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment), objectively. Nineteen eligible empirical studies were included. Overall, results show that protocols for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder can promote psychomotor and psychosocial rehabilitation in contexts that stimulate learning. Moreover, virtual reality and LEAP Motion seem promising for the assessment and screening of functional abilities in dementia and mild cognitive impairment. As evidence is, however, still limited, deeper investigations are needed to assess the full potential of the LEAP Motion technology, possibly extending its applications. This is relevant, considering the role that virtual reality could have in overcoming barriers to access assessment, therapies, and smart monitoring.

AB  - The rise of electronic waste (e-waste) generation around the globe has become a major concern in recent times and its recycling is mostly focused on the recovery of valuable metals, such as gold, silver, and copper, etc. However, e-waste consists of a significant weight fraction of plastics (25-30%) which are either discarded or incinerated. There is a growing need for recycling of these e-waste plastics. The majority of them are made from high-quality polymers (composites), such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact polystyrene (HIPS), polycarbonate (PC), polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP) and epoxies. These plastics are often contaminated with hazardous materials, such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and heavy metals (such as Pb and Hg). Under any thermal stress (thermal degradation), the Br present in the e-waste plastics produces environmentally hazardous pollutants, such as hydrogen bromide or polybrominated diphenyl ethers/furans (PBDE/Fs). The discarded plastics can lead to the leaching of toxins into the environment. It is important to remove the toxins from the e-waste plastics before recycling. This review article gives a detailed account of e-waste plastics recycling and recovery using thermochemical processes, such as extraction (at elevated temperature), incineration (combustion), hydrolysis, and pyrolysis (catalytic/non catalytic). A basic framework of the existing processes has been established by reviewing the most interesting findings in recent times and the prospects that they open in the field recycling of e-waste plastics.

KW  - lymphatic vasculature
AB  - Simple Summary
   The lymphatic system is involved in tissue homeostasis, immune processes as well as transport of lipids, proteins and pathogens. Aging affects all physiological systems. However, it is not well studied how aging affects the lymphatic vasculature. Therefore, this review aims at investigating how senescence could lead to changes in the structure and function of the lymphatic vessels. We report that lymphatic senescence is associated with alterations in lymphatic muscles and nerve fibers, lymphatic endothelial cells membrane dysfunction, as well as changes in lymphatic pump, acute inflammation responses and immune function.
   Lymphatic flow is necessary for maintenance of vital physiological functions in humans and animals. To carry out optimal lymphatic flow, adequate contractile activity of the lymphatic collectors is necessary. Like in all body systems, aging has also an effect on the lymphatic system. However, limited knowledge is available on how aging directly affects the lymphatic system anatomy, physiology and function. We investigated how senescence leads to alterations in morphology and function of the lymphatic vessels. We used the strategy of a review to summarize the scientific literature of studies that have been published in the area of lymphatic senescence. Searches were carried out on PubMed and Web of Science using predefined search queries. We obtained an initial set of 1060 publications. They were filtered to 114 publications based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, the most appropriate 57 studies that specifically addressed lymphatic senescence have been selected for the preparation of this review. Analysis of the literature showed that lymphatic senescence is associated with alterations in lymphatic muscles and nerve fibers, lymphatic glycocalyx function of lymphatic endothelial cells, effects of chronic ultraviolet light exposure and oxidative stress as well as changes in lymphatic pump, acute inflammation responses and immune function. The current review underscores the relevance of the understudied area of lymphatic senescence. Continued research on the impact of aging on the structure and function of the lymphatic vasculature is needed to provide further insights to develop innovative clinical diagnostic-and treatment-modalities as well as to reduce the morbidity associated with diseases related to the lymphatic system.

AB  - Introduction
   To examine the effectiveness of universal suicide prevention interventions on reducing suicide mortality in high-income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries.
   Methods
   We implemented a comprehensive search strategy across three electronic databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid). All studies using time-series, retrospective, prospective, pre-post or cross-sectional study designs were included. Studies were required to examine suicide mortality as the outcome of interest. To help organise the results, studies were grouped into six broad categories of universal interventions consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan. A narrative synthesis of results was used to describe the findings.
   Results
   Of the 15 641 studies identified through the search strategy, 100 studies were eligible in the following categories: law and regulation reforms (n=66), physical barriers (n=13), community-based interventions (n=9), communication strategies (n=4), mental health policies and strategies (n=7), and access to healthcare (n=1). Overall, 100% (13/13) of the included physical barrier interventions resulted in a significant reduction in suicide mortality. Although only 70% (46/66) of the law and regulation reform interventions had a significant impact on reducing suicide, they hold promise due to their extended reach. Universal suicide prevention interventions seem to be more effective at reducing suicide among males than females, identifying a need to stratify results by sex in future studies.
   Conclusions
   These findings suggest that universal suicide prevention interventions hold promise in effectively reducing suicide mortality in high-income OECD countries.

AB  - Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a highly transmissible and contagious disease in small wild and domesticated ruminants, particularly goats and sheep. Commonly called 'Goat Plague'; it's caused by Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus (PPRV). The aim of this review is to draw the attention by updating the available literature on PPRV, and stresses upon its eradication from Pakistan. Mixing of herds, movement of animals across borders, confining animals during rainy and winter seasons are risk factors for transmission of PPR. Wild small ruminants play a major role in the epidemiology of PPR. This review found out that wild animals are not responsible in the spread of PPR; there is a scope of this disease in wild ungulates. Pathological lesions and clinical signs of PPR are similar to Rinder Pest disease. Diagnosis of PPRV is possible clinical samples by several molecular and serological techniques; laboratory confirmation; post-mortem lesions; epidemiology; distinctive symptoms and general clinical observations. In Pakistan, vaccines contain Nig 75/1 strain which is being used for immunization against all PPR viruses. Current review has concluded that PPR is a significant disease of goats, sheep and small wild ruminants. However, there is a dire need of investigations to explore the role of wildlife in PPR transmission. Finally, comprehensive national programs for controlling PPR are strongly suggested.

AB  - Although research on men's stress expression, coping strategies, and attitudes toward support has been accumulated, there is a lack of evaluation of men's stress expression and perception of their partners' supportiveness within the context of romantic relationships. This review summarizes findings related to factors that influence men's expression of stress and the ways in which they perceive the support provided by their romantic partners, as well as the resulting effects on men's well-being and that of the relationship itself. We searched four electronic databases using terms related to stress expression and perceived supportiveness in couples. Findings meeting inclusion criteria were classified in two conceptual categories: (a) Men's stress expression to their partner and (b) men's perception of their partner's support. Forty-four articles met inclusion criteria. Data were collected on 4,520 men from clinical/ subclinical and healthy populations. Findings suggest that (a) men's stress expression and perceived supportiveness from their partner are linked to positive effects for men's well-being and that of the relationship; (b) stress and adherence to masculine norms negatively affect men's expression of stress to their romantic partner; and (c) men's perception of their romantic partner's support is negatively affected by stress and positively linked to men's stress expression. These results suggest that for men, stress expression and perceived supportiveness within the context of the romantic relationship parallel their general attitudes regarding self-disclosure and social support. The prescriptive role of masculine norms is highlighted as an important determinant of men's behavior toward their romantic partner.

TI  - Wall Shear Stress Topological Skeleton Analysis in Cardiovascular Flows: Methods and Applications
KW  - fixed points
KW  - manifolds
KW  - divergence
KW  - hemodynamics
KW  - computational fluid dynamics
AB  - A marked interest has recently emerged regarding the analysis of the wall shear stress (WSS) vector field topological skeleton in cardiovascular flows. Based on dynamical system theory, the WSS topological skeleton is composed of fixed points, i.e., focal points where WSS locally vanishes, and unstable/stable manifolds, consisting of contraction/expansion regions linking fixed points. Such an interest arises from its ability to reflect the presence of near-wall hemodynamic features associated with the onset and progression of vascular diseases. Over the years, Lagrangian-based and Eulerian-based post-processing techniques have been proposed aiming at identifying the topological skeleton features of the WSS. Here, the theoretical and methodological bases supporting the Lagrangian- and Eulerian-based methods currently used in the literature are reported and discussed, highlighting their application to cardiovascular flows. The final aim is to promote the use of WSS topological skeleton analysis in hemodynamic applications and to encourage its application in future mechanobiology studies in order to increase the chance of elucidating the mechanistic links between blood flow disturbances, vascular disease, and clinical observations.

AB  - People who identify as trans and gender non-binary experience many challenges in their lives and more interest is being paid to their overall health and wellbeing. However, little is known about their experiences and perceptions regarding their distinct psychosocial needs. The aim of this systematic review is to critically evaluate and synthesize the existing research evidence relating to the unique psychological and social experiences of trans people and identify aspects that may help or hinder access to appropriate psychosocial interventions and supports. The PRISMA procedure was utilized. A search of relevant databases from January 2010 to January 2021 was undertaken. Studies were identified that involved trans people, and addressed issues related to their psychosocial needs. The search yielded 954 papers in total. Following the application of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria a total of 18 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Quality was assessed using the MMAT instrument. Following analysis, four themes were identified: (i) stigma, discrimination and marginalization (ii) trans affirmative experiences (iii) formal and informal supports, and (iv) healthcare access. The policy, education and practice development implications are highlighted and discussed. Future research opportunities have been identified that will add significantly to the body of evidence that may further the development of appropriate health interventions and supports to this population.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to report, through a systematic review of the literature, the baseline and final reference values obtained by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2) during resistance training in healthy adults. Methods: Original research studies were searched from four databases (Scopus, PubMed, WOS, and SportDiscus). Subsequently, three independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts, followed by full-text reviews to assess the studies' eligibility. Results: Four studies met the inclusion criteria, data were extracted and methodological quality was assessed using the Downs and Black scale. Muscle oxygen saturation (% SmO2) during reported muscle strength exercises showed a decreasing trend after a muscle strength protocol; that is, before the protocol (range = 68.07-77.9%) and after (range = 9.50-46.09%). Conclusions: The trend of the SmO2 variables is to decrease after a muscle strength protocol. Studies are lacking that allow expanding the use of these devices during this type of training.

AB  - The present review aims to address child abuse, a phenomenon to which society has become more aware and directed more efforts, and the role that health and education professionals can play in its prevention and intervention. Based on the premise that professionals with a primary role of working with children, who may have the first contact with them after a situation of abuse, are mostly in the fields of health and education, it is important to reflect on their practices in these cases, which have particular relevance in order to avoid potential situations of secondary victimization, contamination of speech, or even withdrawal of revelation. This review examines the preparation of these professionals to address the allegedly abused child and to report abuse if they feel fit to take appropriate action, focuses mainly on the context of Portugal. What the literature shows is that there are still difficulties in making decisions and taking action in situations where abuse is suspected, based on physical or behavioral evidence from the child, or before his/her disclosure. Further studies are needed on the knowledge of the actions to be taken, and on the actions taken before there is a referral to the competent entities by these professionals. Moreover, there is a discussion on the need to develop training as well as brief and structured protocols for action, in this first line of intervention, when facing potential situations of child abuse.

AB  - Office workers are at high risk for many chronic diseases, lowering their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the effects of physical exercise on HRQOL in office workers with and without health problems using data obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental, and observational studies. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and several grey literature databases, and identified 26 relevant studies for the synthesis. Overall, physical exercise significantly improved general (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66 to 1.44) and mental (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.66) HRQOL in office workers. Compared with healthy office workers, unhealthy office workers experienced greater improvements in general (unhealthy, SMD = 2.76; 95% CI: 1.63 to 3.89; healthy, SMD = 0.23; 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.56) and physical (unhealthy, SMD = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.58; healthy, SMD = -0.20; 95% CI: -0.51 to 0.11) HRQOL. Unsupervised physical exercise significantly improved general and mental HRQOL, while directly supervised physical exercise significantly improved only general HRQOL. Although physical exercise, especially unsupervised physical exercise, should be encouraged to improve HRQOL in office workers, detailed recommendations could not be made because of the diverse exercise types with different intensities. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the optimal exercise for office workers with different health conditions.

AB  - Migration is a growing phenomenon around the world, including within the African continent. Many migrants, especially African children, face challenges related to health and social inclusion and can face increased health risks. A systematic scoping review of available literature on the health of African migrant children across the globe was conducted to offer insight into these health risks. The review was conducted over a 15-month period from January 2019 to April 2020, yielding 6602 articles once duplicates were removed. This search included electronic databases, reference lists of articles reviewed, and searches of libraries of relevant organisations. A total of 187 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 159 were quantitative, 22 were qualitative, and 6 used mixed methods. The findings reveal decreased health in this population in areas of nutrition, infectious diseases, mental health, birth outcomes, sexual and reproductive health, physical and developmental health, parasitic infections, oral health, respiratory health, preventative health, endocrine disorders, health care services, and haematological conditions. The findings offer insights into factors influencing the health of African immigrant and refugee children. Further studies, especially qualitative studies, are needed to determine barriers to service access after migration and to investigate other underexplored and overlooked health concerns of African migrant children, including pneumonia and child maltreatment.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this systematic review is to analyze the relevant research on religious organizations' participation in disasters risk management and to understand the ways in which these organizations impact on disaster management. Today, community-based disaster risk management is emphasized as a very effective approach. Religious organizations are one of the most important components of community. They have access to resources that can be critical to help government agencies to manage disasters successfully. Methods: This systematic review was conducted since August 2018 to investigate the role of religious institutions in disasters management and was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, Proquest, Embase, and Google scholar were the primary databases used for search of literature. Keywords used in this review were "religious institution," "disaster management," and their equivalents were obtained from Mesh, Emtree, or extracted from related articles. The papers from a broad range of disciplines related to keywords were included, and those articles that focus on response to disaster based on religious beliefs' and religion rather than participation of religious institutions in disaster risk management were excluded. From the 18,071 records identified through database searching in the early stage, 22 articles were selected for this review followed by analysis of the characteristics and content analysis of the included studies to answer the study questions. Results: The findings of this systematic review that emerged from content analysis are summarized in 11 themes: religious institutions' potential for disaster management, preparedness of religious institutions for disasters, response, recovery, the social capital, partnership with all stakeholders, collaboration and communication between mental health professionals and faith-based organization leaders, unity of information and message, religious institution shelters, dealing with disaster in old and new approaches, and barriers and challenges. Conclusions: Religious institutions have a vital role and great potential in disasters management. They often contribute in response and recovery phases of disasters, although these services are valuable but the great potential of these groups should also be recruited to participate in preparedness and mitigation efforts as part of disasters cycle. Coordination and collaboration of all stakeholders is essential in this way.

AB  - Several meta-analyses of observational studies have addressed the association between risk and protective factors and cannabis/cocaine/opioid use disorders, but results are conflicting. No umbrella review has ever graded the credibility of this evidence (not significant/weak/suggestive/highly suggestive/convincing). We searched Pubmed-MEDLINE/PsycInfo, last search September 21, 2020. We assessed the quality of meta-analyses with the AMSTAR-2 tool. Out of 3,072 initial references, five were included, providing 19 associations between 12 putative risk/protective factors and cannabis/cocaine/opioid use disorders (cases: 4539; N = 1,118,872,721). While 84 % of the associations were statistically significant, none was convincing. One risk factor (smoking) had highly suggestive evidence for association with nonmedical use of prescription opioid medicines (OR = 3.07, 95 %CI:2.27 to 4.14). Convincing evidence emerged in sensitivity analyses on antisocial behavior and cannabis use disoder (OR 3.34, 95 %CI 2.53-4.41). Remaining associations had weak evidence. The quality of meta-analyses was rated as moderate in two (40 %), low in one (20 %), and critically low in two (40 %). Future research is needed to better profile risk/protective factors for cannabis/cocaine/opioid use disorders disorders informing preventive approaches.

AB  - Cognitive impairment risk in Parkinson's disease increases with disease progression and poses a significant burden to the patients, their families and society. There are no disease-modifying therapies or preventative measures for Parkinson's disease mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). This article reviews current and previously investigated treatments and those under investigation, including pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic and surgical procedures. There are currently no effective pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic treatments for PD-MCI. The only recommended treatment for PDD currently is rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor. Donepezil and galantamine-other cholinesterase inhibitors-are possibly useful. Memantine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is considered investigational in PDD. Drug repurposing (atomoxetine, levodopa, insulin, atomoxetine for PD-MCI; ambroxol and ceftriaxone for PDD) and novel medications (SYN120, GRF6021, NYX-458 for PD-MCI; ANAVEX2-73, LY3154207, ENT-01, DAAOI-P for PDD) currently have insufficient evidence. There is growing research supporting exercise in the treatment of PD-MCI, but most non-pharmacological approaches have insufficient evidence for use in PD-MCI (cognitive rehabilitation, deep brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial ultrasound, vestibular nerve stimulation) and PDD (cognitive intervention, deep brain stimulation, transcranial alternating current stimulation, transcranial ultrasound, temporal blood brain barrier disruption). Research is needed for both disease-modifying and symptomatic treatments in PD cognitive impairment.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) can pose a threat to public health if it is not safely managed. Despite prior research, uncertainties remain and refurbished evidence is needed along with new approaches. We conducted a systematic review of recently published literature to update and expand the epidemiological evidence on the association between MSW management practices and resident populations' health risks. Studies published from January 2005 to January 2020 were searched and reviewed following PRISMA guidelines. Eligible MSW treatment or disposal sites were defined as landfills, dumpsites, incinerators, waste open burning, transfer stations, recycling sites, composting plants, and anaerobic digesters. Occupational risks were not assessed. Health effects investigated included mortality, adverse birth and neonatal outcomes, cancer, respiratory conditions, gastroenteritis, vector-borne diseases, mental health conditions, and cardiovascular diseases. Studies reporting on human biomonitoring for exposure were eligible as well. Twenty-nine studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria of our protocol, assessing health effects only associated with proximity to landfills, incinerators, and dumpsites/open burning sites. There was some evidence of an increased risk of adverse birth and neonatal outcomes for residents near each type of MSW site. There was also some evidence of an increased risk of mortality, respiratory diseases, and negative mental health effects associated with residing near landfills. Additionally, there was some evidence of increased risk of mortality associated with residing near incinerators. However, in many cases, the evidence was inadequate to establish a strong relationship between a specific exposure and outcomes, and the studies rarely assessed new generation technologies. Evidence gaps remain, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Background: Radiotherapy, as a method of treatment of cervical and uterine cancers, may induce severe late-onset vaginal side effects. Unfortunately, little evidence on the management of adverse effects has been presented. This study aimed to evaluate the available interventions which reduce symptoms of vaginitis and vaginal atrophy by improving dyspareunia, mucosal inflammation, vaginal pH and vaginal dryness in women who have undergone brachytherapy or radiotherapy due to uterine or cervical malignancies. Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed following PRISMA guidelines. The systematic search was conducted using electronic databases, namely Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed, between October and November 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) and, prospective randomized studies (PRS). Results: The analyzed population consists of 376 patients with uterine or cervical cancer, treated with hyaluronic acid, vitamin A, vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol acetate and dienestrol. Intervention with HA along with vitamin A and vitamin E revealed advantage in endpoints such as reduced dyspareunia, vaginal mucosal inflammation, vaginal dryness, bleeding, fibrosis and cellular atypia. Administration of alpha-tocopherol acetate reduced vaginal mucosal inflammation and improved vaginal acanthosis, whereas dienestrol resulted in reduced dyspareunia, vaginal caliber and bleeding. Conclusions: Vaginal suppositories were found to be clinically effective at the management of late-onset vulvovaginal side effects after radiotherapy.

AB  - (1) Background: Medial sigmoid depression (MSD) of the mandibular ramus is an anatomical variation that resembles non-odontogenic cystic lesion. (2) Aim: The aim of this systematic review was to survey the literature to identify the relevant journal publications, reveal their scientific impact in terms of citations and compare the reported prevalence of MSD. (3) Materials and methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science were queried to identify relevant publications. The search string was: "medial depression of mandibular ramus" OR "medial depression of the mandibular ramus" OR "medial depression of the mandibular rami" OR "medial depression of mandibular rami" OR "medial sigmoid depression". (4) Results: Eight studies were identified. Dry mandibles and patient dental panoramic radiographs were evaluated in four and seven of the eight studies, respectively. The prevalence of MSD varied from 20.2% to 82.0%. In male and female patients, the prevalence was 18.3-76.0% and 22.0-64.0%, respectively. MSD tended to occur bilaterally and most prevalent in patients with Angle's Class II occlusion. The semilunar and triangular shapes were more common than teardrop and circular shapes. The most cited study had 12 citations. (5) Conclusions: MSD was a seldom investigated and cited anatomical variation that was not uncommon. Its recognition should be further promoted.

AB  - This paper examines the existing literature on the relationship between religion and populism, and is intended as a starting point for further examination of the relationships between populism, religion, and emotions. This paper systematically reviews the various aspects of the populist phenomenon. After a discussion on different definitions of populism, this paper looks at how the literature discusses the causes of populism, mainly socio-economic factors and emotive factors. Then it discusses how religion and populism interact and can be divided in two broad categories of religious populism and identitarian populism. While, on the surface, the two share similarities, this paper reviews populist manifestations across the world to draw the distinct features between the two forms. Lastly, while pointing out the salient features of religious populism and identitarian populism, this study points out gaps in the research on the relationship between religious populism and other phenomena such as transnational populism, the psychology of populism, the role of emotions in creating support for populism, and populism in Western and non-Western contexts for future areas of research in the field.

AB  - Objective
   Patients with diabetes mellitus with comorbid depression are at an increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Studies have suggested a positive association between depression and diabetic retinopathy (DR), but the evidence has not been systematically summarized. Therefore, the aim of the study was to perform a meta-analysis to investigate the correlation of depression with DR in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods
   PubMed and EMBASE were searched for relevant studies through January 7, 2017. Fixed-effects and random-effects models were used to calculate overall odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine whether the association was affected by adjustment for confounders or by age of study population. Results
   A total of 11 cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies were included in the analyses, with 34,185 individuals involved. Overall, patients with depression were at a significantly elevated risk of development of DR (fixed-effects OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.39-1.63; random-effects OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.35-1.84). The association did not vary by adjustment for confounders. However, a slightly larger pooled estimate was observed among studies with a mean age of <60 years (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.46-2.07) than those with a mean age of >= 60 years (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.16-1.75). Conclusions
   Depression was significantly associated with an increased incidence of DR in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the existing literature does not yet definitely document that whether depression contributes directly or indirectly to incident DR. Further prospective investigations identifying high-risk subgroups are warranted.

This review aims to better understand the current literature describing the connection between heat stress and kidney function in farmworkers in the United States. Utilizing a scoping review methodology, we searched CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to better understand the current state of the heat stress and kidney function research in farmworkers within the United States. In this review, 229 pieces of literature were screened. Ultimately, 4 articles were chosen to be included in the scoping review. Common themes within the articles were variations in study protocol lengths and type of heat stress measurement. Additionally, the majority of the work completed was quantitative to date, with only one study providing a critical social lens for analysis of CKDu in the United States. We found evidence that more work is needed within the US to understand the relationship between working in the heat and kidney function in agricultural and other workers who experience high heat conditions at work and are susceptible to the deleterious effects of working in said conditions.

AB  - Despite accumulating evidence suggesting the effectiveness of Attention Bias Modification (ABM) in adults, little is known about its efficacy in children and adolescents. As anxiety has been the chief target in most studies and research in this area has grown rapidly in recent years, we conducted the first meta-analysis to establish the effects of ABM alone for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Studies were identified through a systematic search in three main databases: PubMed, EMBASE and PsycInfo, resulting in 17 randomized studies. The quality of these studies, possible publication bias and moderators were then examined. ABM had small but significant effects on clinician-rated anxiety symptoms and attention bias towards threat, while the effect on self or parent-reported anxiety measures was non-significant. Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low. ABM was more effective when conducted as a stand-alone treatment than as an adjunct to other treatments. In addition, younger age and larger number of training sessions were associated with a greater reduction in clinician-rated anxiety symptoms. Results indicate that ABM may have significant effects on anxiety and attention bias in children and adolescents. Overall, the effects of ABM are mainly evident when clinical outcome is assessed by a clinician.

AB  - Social anxiety is common in psychosis and associated with impaired functioning, poorer quality of life, and higher symptom severity. This study systematically reviewed factors maintaining social anxiety in people with attenuated, transient, or persistent psychotic experiences. Other correlates of social anxiety were also examined. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and PsycENFO were searched for relevant literature up to October 19, 2020. Forty-eight articles were eligible for narrative synthesis: 38 cross-sectional studies, 8 prospective studies, 1 uncontrolled trial, and 1 qualitative study. From 12060 participants, the majority was general population (n = 8771), followed by psychosis samples (n = 2532) and those at high risk of psychosis (n=757). The methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Ninety percent of studies were rated as high to very-high quality. Poorer quality studies typically failed to adequately control for confounds and provided insufficient information on the measurement validity and reliability. Prominent psychological factors maintaining social anxiety included self-perceptions of stigma and shame. Common correlates of social anxiety included poorer functioning and lower quality of life. In conclusion, stigma and shame could be targeted as a causal mechanism in future interventional studies. The integration of findings from this review lead us to propose a new theoretical model to guide future intervention research.

TI  - Molecular Factors Mediating Neural Cell Plasticity Changes in Dementia Brain Diseases
AB  - Neural plasticity-the ability to alter a neuronal response to environmental stimuli-is an important factor in learning and memory. Short-term synaptic plasticity and long-term synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation and long-term depression, are the most-characterized models of learning and memory at the molecular and cellular level. These processes are often disrupted by neurodegeneration-induced dementias. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 50% of cases of dementia. Vascular dementia (VaD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) constitute much of the remaining cases. While vascular lesions are the principal cause of VaD, neurodegenerative processes have been established as etiological agents of many dementia diseases. Chief among such processes is the deposition of pathological protein aggregates in vivo including beta-amyloid deposition in AD, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in AD and FTD, and the accumulation of Lewy bodies composed of alpha-synuclein aggregates in DLB and PDD. The main symptoms of dementia are cognitive decline and memory and learning impairment. Nonetheless, accurate diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases can be difficult due to overlapping clinical symptoms and the diverse locations of cortical lesions. Still, new neuroimaging and molecular biomarkers have improved clinicians' diagnostic capabilities in the context of dementia and may lead to the development of more effective treatments. Both genetic and environmental factors may lead to the aggregation of pathological proteins and altered levels of cytokines, such that can trigger the formation of proinflammatory immunological phenotypes. This cascade of pathological changes provides fertile ground for the development of neural plasticity disorders and dementias. Available pharmacotherapy and disease-modifying therapies currently in clinical trials may modulate synaptic plasticity to mitigate the effects neuropathological changes have on cognitive function, memory, and learning. In this article, we review the neural plasticity changes seen in common neurodegenerative diseases from pathophysiological and clinical points of view and highlight potential molecular targets of disease-modifying therapies.

AB  - Background Despite availability of effective treatments, migrants in high-income countries seek care for conditions associated with stigma to a lower extent than the rest of the population. We conducted a scoping review to map the literature on interventions to increase migrants' care-seeking behaviour in high-income countries for stigmatised conditions. Main body of the abstract: We searched 15 electronic databases and journals, hand-searched references and citations, to identify studies on interventions to increase migrants' care-seeking in high-income countries for stigmatised conditions. We applied language restrictions for English and Swedish, and searched the full time period up to 5 July 2019. Our primary outcome of interest was care utilisation. Results 5447 records were identified in the literature searches. We identified 16 eligible studies, all from North America, that reported interventions to increase migrants' care-seeking behaviour for hepatitis B (n = 1) and mental health (n = 15). Three approaches were identified: health communication (n = 10), support groups (n = 2), and primary care-based approaches (n = 4). There was a general trend towards community-based interventions tailored to individual migrant groups. Significant gaps were identified in the literature, including studies conducted in Europe and studies including men or children. Furthermore, the choice of study designs introduced significant bias that prevented accurate conclusions on intervention effectiveness. Conclusion The available evidence on interventions to increase migrants' in high-income countries care-seeking behaviour for stigmatised conditions is limited in scope and quality. Future research, using reliable study designs, is needed to fill the remaining gaps and to boost the scope and reliability of the evidence.

AB  - Purpose:
   The purpose of this work was to review scientific publications related to the use of visual arts in pediatric hospitals.
   Background:
   Visual arts, particularly painting, have historically played an important role in the design and atmosphere of healthcare spaces, especially hospitals.
   Methods:
   From 2000 to 2019, 79 publications located in relevant databases and manual searches were identified and analyzed.
   Results:
   Sixty of these publications include empirical studies and 19 theoretical models, comments, or reflections on the use of art in children's hospitals. Their analysis allows us to differentiate four groups of works: (a) "environmental" includes works whose purpose is to know how visual artistic interventions in the hospital can affect the people who see them, mainly pediatric patients, families, and health workers; (b) "participatory" includes studies aimed at knowing the effect of developing visual arts activities in the hospital; (c) "exploratory" includes works whose purpose was to know more about the children's perspective using their artistic expressions; and (d) "diagnostic" includes those that use children's drawings as a tool to diagnose diverse processes related to the pediatric patients' experience.
   Conclusions:
   Taken together, the works we analyzed in our study support the use of visual arts in hospitals as a resource to enhance the well-being of children and families and their experience in the hospital. We indicate two particularly relevant aspects in this sense: the importance of the visual arts in improving the symbolic quality of hospitalization settings and the communication processes that occur in these environments.

AB  - Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a type of brominated flame retardant widely detected in the environment and organisms. IL has been reported to cause cylotoxid ty and disrupt endocrine system of animals. However, the effect of TBBPA on the reproductive system of male rodents is still controversial. Hence, this meta-analysis aims to determine whether TBBPA exposure damage to the reproductive system of male rodents. In this study, a thorough search of literatures was undertaken to select papers published before December 1st, 2020. The standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by random model. The results showed a statistically significant association between TBBPA exposure and the reproductive system health of male rodents (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.19). The SMD for the reproductive system index organ weight, sperm quality, hormone levels, and gene expression were 0.03 (95% CI -0.18 to 023), -0.47 (95% CI -0.78 to -0.16), -0.51 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.27), and -0.98 (95% CI -1.36 to -0.60), respectively. There was a significant dose-effect relationship between TBBPA exposure and the reproductive health of male rodents, with the SMD values of low, medium, and high doses -020 (95% CI -0.34 to -0.05), -024 (95% CI -0.56 to 0.07), and -0.48 (95% CI -0.83 to -0.13), respectively. For exposure duration of TBBPA, an exposure time of >10 weeks (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.12) showed more significant effect than an exposure time of <= 10 weeks (SMD = -0.22. 95% CI -0.43 to -0.02). Moreover, TBBPA exposure exhibited significant negative effects on sperm count (SMD = -0.49, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.17) while also reduced the content of triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) hormones. To summarize, our meta-analysis indicated that TBBPA had a toxicity effect to the reproductive system of male rodents. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The cardinal pathophysiological finding of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra, which is responsible for the motor and some of the non-motor symptomatology. While the primary causes of nigrostriatal degeneration are hotly debated, considerable evidence supports a central role for impaired mitochondrial function. Postmortem analysis of PD patients reveals impaired respiratory chains and increased mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), in addition to increased markers of oxidative stress indicative of mitochondrial impairment. Most animal models of PD, both genetic and toxin-based, target some component of mitochondrial function to reproduce aspects of the human disease. One model that continues to gain attention is the MitoPark mouse, created through a cell type-specific knockout of mitochondrial transcription factor A specifically in midbrain DA neurons. This model effectively recapitulates the slowly developing, adult onset motor decline seen in PD due to mass loss of DA neurons. MitoPark mice therefore represent an effective tool for studying the sequence of events that occurs in the early stages of DA neuron degeneration following mitochondrial impairment, as well as for testing the efficacy of potential diseasemodifying therapies in a progressive model of neurodegeneration. A targeted review of key findings from MitoPark mice has not been published since the early years following the initial report of the model in 2007. The current review synthesizes findings from several groups that are exploring MitoPark mice and discusses implications for the future identification of disease-modifying treatments for PD.

AB  - Previous research highlighted that prejudice is already formed in early childhood, reaches a peak in middle childhood, and slightly decreases in late childhood, whereas the development of prejudice in adolescence was mostly unknown. This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively summarize and integrate prior longitudinal research on adolescents' prejudice to address two main research questions: (a) how does prejudice develop in adolescence? (b) which factors are related to holding prejudicial attitudes in adolescence? Using multiple search strategies and applying a two-step selection process, a final set of 26 journal articles including a total of 30 samples (N = 23,513 participants) was found to match eligibility criteria and, thus, was included in the review. The meta-analytic findings highlighted that (a) prejudice does not change in adolescence; (b) interindividual differences in prejudice are well-established, they become increasingly strong with age, and they are inversely related to the time-lag between assessments; and (c) several individual, identity, and contextual factors are related to prejudice in different ways. More specifically, social dominance orientation, intergroup anxiety, identification with the national ingroup, and parental prejudice contributed to increasing later levels of adolescents' prejudice, whereas intergroup friendship contributed to lessening it. Importantly, prejudice had comparable reverse effects on these factors, pointing to consistent bidirectional associations. These main findings are discussed considering their implications for future research and practice.

AB  - Parental support is of paramount importance in the promotion of positive parenting, strengthening parenthood and protecting children from disadvantages due to immigration experiences. The aim was to describe what is known about parent support programmes targeted to families who are immigrants. Electronic databases and the grey literature were systematically and comprehensively searched with no time/language restrictions. JBI approach and PRISMA-ScR were used to guide the review. N = 88 articles were sourced. Interventions were targeted to improve parental practices, skills and family wellbeing, usually through group-based methods. Most interventions included components of positive parenting and family communication. Identifying the needs of the target group and cultural tailoring were reported to be highly important in gaining acceptability, promoting engagement and producing benefits. Parent support programmes for families who are immigrants potentially improve positive parental practices and families' wellbeing. There are many applicable and effective interventions to be exploited.

AB  - Suicide accounts for approximately 800,000 deaths per year globally. Previous research has shown that intranasal esketamine and intravenous ketamine can rapidly decrease the severity of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. However, the majority of clinical trials excluded individuals with moderate to high baseline suicidality scores (e.g., suicidal ideation with plan/intent at the time of recruitment). The current review aims to evaluate the effect of esketamine and ketamine in patients with suicidal ideation at baseline. A systematic search was conducted on EMBASE, PsychInfo and PubMed from inception to July 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. 15 studies met inclusion criteria. Results from esketamine trials did not demonstrate antisuicidal effects, as between-group differences were not found. Intravenous ketamine appeared to rapidly decrease the severity of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in individuals with baseline suicidal ideation, though retrospective studies suggest that these effects may be short-lasting. During the double-blind treatment phases, 2.4% of patients from the treatment groups and 1.5% of patients from control groups attempted suicide, with zero deaths by suicide in both the treatment and control groups during this phase. Based on the overall pooled samples, studies were assessed to be relatively safe, and the continual inclusion of this study population in future clinical trials is encouraged. Future research should aim to assess the longitudinal efficacy of ketamine in patients with baseline suicidality.

   Methods: RCTs of pro-, pre-, synbiotics for the treatment of pre-diabetes population will be summarized. We searched for EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov) from inception to February 2021.
   Results: The gut microbiota influences host metabolic disorders via the modulation of metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS), bile acids (BA) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), as well as mediating the interaction between the gastrointestinal system and other organs. Due to the limited sources of studies, inconsistent outcomes between included studies. Probiotics can decrease glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and have the potential to improve post-load glucose levels. The supplementation of probiotics can suppress the rise of blood cholesterol, but the improvement cannot be verified. Pre-biotics are failed to show an evident improvement in glycemic control, but their use caused the changes in the composition of gut microbiota. A combination of probiotics and pre-biotics in the synbiotics supplementation is more effective than probiotics alone in glycemic control.
   Conclusion: In the current studies using probiotics, pre-biotics or synbiotics for the treatment of pre-diabetes, the benefits of modulating the abundance of gut microbiota were partially demonstrated. However, there is insufficient evidence to show significant benefits on glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism and body composition.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered to be the most effective acute treatment for otherwise treatment resistant major depressive episodes, and has been used for over 80 years. Still, the underlying mechanism of action is largely unknow. Several studies suggest that ECT affects the cerebral neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows investigators to study neurotransmitters in vivo, and has been used to study neurochemical changes in the brain of patients treated with ECT. Several investigations have been performed on ECT-patients; however, no systematic review has yet summarized these findings. A systematic literature search based on the Prisma guidelines was performed. PubMed (Medline) was used in order to find investigations studying patients that had been treated with ECT and had undergone an MRS examination. A search in the databases Embase, PsycInfo, and Web of Science was also performed, leading to no additional records. A total of 30 records were identified and screened which resulted in 16 original investigations for review. The total number of patients that was included in these studies, ignoring potential overlap of samples in some investigations, was 325. The metabolites reported were N-acetyl aspartate, Choline, Myoinositol, Glutamate and Glutamine, GABA and Creatine. The strongest evidence for neurochemical change related to ECT, was found for N-acetyl aspartate (reduction), which is a marker of neuronal integrity. Increased choline and glutamate following treatment was also commonly reported.

KW  - Meta-Review
AB  - Inpatient psychiatric hospitals have remained a standard aspect of mental health treatment for many centuries. While numerous treatments have been empirically validated to assist inpatients, less is known about how inpatients perceive psychiatric hospitals. A meta-review, which is a systematic review of systematic reviews, was conducted to examine the factors reported by inpatients which affect their perception of psychiatric hospitals. MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE were systematically searched. Reviews that considered the perception of adults with mental illness admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital were eligible for inclusion. The AMSTAR2 was used to assess for methodological quality and bias of eligible reviews, with reviews judged to have critical issues excluded. Thematic synthesis was used to detect key overarching factors that generalised across multiple reviews. Twelve systematic reviews were included of which seven key factors were extracted. These were; relationships on the ward, the ward environment, coercive measures, legal status, autonomy, feeling deserving of care, and expectations of care at admission and discharge. Inpatients report several factors that need to be considered when creating a therapeutic environment in a psychiatric hospital. While the importance of therapeutic rapport was the most consistently referenced factor in the included reviews, all factors are likely interwoven and modifiable. Limitations of this meta-review and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Mental healthcare and wellness are a global concern and have increasingly become an essential service and priority from a human rights perspective. However, negative attitudes towards mental health, such as stigmatisation and discrimination from communities and family members, continue to pose challenges for deinstitutionalisation and home care of mentally ill persons. This study aimed to review the literature on the content and implementation methods of stigma reduction interventions for family/community caregivers of patients with mental illness to inform the development of an anti-stigma intervention for such caregivers in low- and middle-income countries like South Africa. A scoping literature review was conducted of English language studies published from 2008 to 2019 in peer-reviewed journals, using established guidelines for the study objectives. Primary interventions targeting caregivers of mental health patients were searched from PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, CINAHL, and Medline. In total, nine full-text articles were extracted for inclusion in the review, indicating a scarcity of literature on anti-stigma interventions aimed at primary caregivers of mental health patients. Interventions varied in terms of educational content, duration, delivery methods, and sample sizes. Intervention delivery was primarily through face-to-face, telephone, and online methods. Anti-stigma interventions for caregivers of patients with mental illness are varied and show positive short-term impacts on mental health stigma reduction among family caregivers. The evolution of health systems is a feasible approach towards integrating learning and trials that are needed to assess long-term impacts.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is acknowledged to have multiple detrimental effects on human health. In this review, we report literature results on the possible link between outdoor PM and health outcomes with a focus on pulmonary infections and the mechanisms responsible for observed negative effects. PM physical and chemical properties, such as size and chemical composition, as well as major emission sources are described for a more comprehensive view about the role played by atmospheric PM in the observed adverse health effects; to this aim, major processes leading to the deposition of PM in the respiratory tract and how this can pave the way to the onset of pathologies are also presented. From the literature works here reviewed, two ways in which PM can threaten human health promoting respiratory infectious diseases are mostly taken into account. The first pathway is related to an enhanced susceptibility and here we will also report on molecular mechanisms in the lung immune system responsible for the augmented susceptibility to pathogens, such as the damage of mechan-ical defensive barriers, the alteration of the innate immune response, and the generation of oxidative stress. The second one deals with the relationship between infectious agents and PM; here we recall that viruses and bacte-ria (BioPM) are themselves part of atmospheric PM and are collected during sampling together with particles of different origin; so, data should be analysed with caution in order to avoid any false cause-effect relation. To face these issues a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory as also evident from the ongoing research about the mechanisms hypothesized for the SARS-CoV-2 airborne spreading, which is still controversial and claims for fur-ther investigation. Therefore, we preferred not to include papers dealing with SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to obtain updated evidence regarding the short-term effect of ozone on respiratory mortality in China. We systematically searched the Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet, and Wanfang databases for relevant studies. After screening based on the inclusion criteria, 12 studies with 19 estimates were selected for further meta-analysis. The results revealed that respiratory mortality significantly increased by 0.55% (95% confidence interval: 0.24%e0.85%; Q = 39.47, I2 = 54.4%, P = 0.002, tau2 < 10-5) for every 10-mg/m3 increase in the maximum 8-h average concentration of ozone. Furthermore, differences in combined estimates were observed between various regions and lag structures. The combined effect of single-day lags was generally larger than that of multiday lags; the estimate of mortality for the population in the north was larger than that for the population in the south. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the main findings were stable; funnel plots with Egger's and Begg's tests indicated no significant publication bias in our analysis.

AB  - Objective: Serious mental illness is associated with physical health comorbidities, however most research has focused on adults. We aimed to synthesise existing literature on clinical and behavioral cardiometabolic risk factors of young people on mental health inpatient units.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, using electronic searches of PsycINFO, EMBASE, AMED, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ovid MEDLINE. Eligible studies included child/adolescent mental health inpatient units for <25 years, reporting clinical/behavioral cardiometabolic risk factors. Studies containing adult samples, case-studies, or eating disorder populations were excluded. The main clinical outcome was weight, and main behavioral outcome was tobacco use.
   Results: Thirty-nine studies were identified (n = 809,185). Pooled prevalence rates of young people who were overweight (BMI > 25) was 32.4% (95% CI 26.1%-39.5%; n = 2789), and who were obese (BMI > 30) was 15.5% (95% CI 4.5%-41.6%; n = 2612). Pooled prevalence rates for tobacco use was 51.5% (95% CI 32.2-70.2; N = 804,018). Early signs of metabolic risk were observed; elevated blood cholesterol, presence of physical health conditions, and behavioral risk factors (e.g. physical inactivity).
   Conclusions: This review highlights the vulnerability of young people admitted to inpatient units and emphasises the opportunity to efficiently monitor, treat and intervene to target physical and mental health.

AB  - Objectives: Increasing numbers of youth experience mental illness, and also require and benefit from specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Worldwide, such services are underfunded and under-resourced, and services in Ireland are no different. It is vital that existing services are regularly reviewed for both efficacy and acceptability. Our objective was to review published studies evaluating service user satisfaction with CAMHS in Ireland and CAMHS therapeutic efficacy. Methods: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were systematically searched. Studies were included if they reported on service user satisfaction or an evaluation of CAMHS in Ireland. Results: From an initial 125 articles identified, 15 studies meet the inclusion criteria: four reporting on overall CAMHS satisfaction, three on satisfaction where a specific diagnosis was present, while eight evaluated various interventions offered. Whilst most service users perceived services to be satisfactory, important issues relating to accessibility were present. Evidence of efficacy was present for a small number of interventions, but studies were limited by methodological issues. Conclusions: There is a dearth of studies evaluating CAMHS in Ireland. The extant literature suggests a positive experience once accessed, but long waiting times and poor collaboration are seen to limit services users' experience. More robust methodologically sound studies are urgently required. Given the expected increased demand linked to the current COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the resultant compromised financial position, it is essential that scant resources are appropriately directed.

AB  - Objectives: Technology can assist and support both people with dementia (PWD) and caregivers. Recently, technology has begun to embed remote components. Timely with respect to the pandemic, the present work reviews the most recent literature on technology in dementia contexts together with the newest studies about technological support published until October 2020. The final aim is to provide a synthesis of the timeliest evidence upon which clinical and non-clinical decision-makers can rely to make choices about technology in the case of further pandemic waves.
   Methods: A review of reviews was performed alongside a review of the studies run during the first pandemic wave. PsycInfo, CINAHL, and PubMed-online were the databases inspected for relevant papers published from January 2010.
   Results: The search identified 420 articles, 30 of which were reviews and nine of which were new studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies were first sorted according to the target population, then summarized thematically in a narrative synthesis. The studies targeting technologies for PWD were categorized as follows: monitoring and security purposes, sustaining daily life, and therapeutic interventions. Each category showed potential benefits. Differently, the interventions for caregivers were classified as informative, psycho-education programs, psychosocial-supportive, therapeutic, and cognitive/physical training. Benefits to mental health, skills learning, and social aspects emerged.
   Conclusions: The evidence shows that technology is well-accepted and can support PWD and caregivers to bypass physical and environmental problems both during regular times and during future pandemic waves. Nevertheless, the lack of a common methodological background is revealed by this analysis. Further and more standardized research is necessary to improve the implementation of technologies in everyday life while respecting the necessary personalization.

AB  - Purpose Early detection of eating disorders (EDs) could improve their prognosis, decrease morbidity and mortality, and prevent the risk of evolution towards a chronic form and somatic, psychiatric and psychosocial complications. The objective of this review was to examine the current scientific data concerning the early detection of EDs, which is one of the facets of secondary prevention. Method A scoping literature review was carried out following the PRISMA-ScR criteria, including all articles on ED detection published up to 2021 on PUBMED and PSYCINFO. Results 43 articles were included. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were the most widely studied disorders. The articles focused on professionals from the medical field (GPs, psychiatrists, gynaecologists, gastroenterologists and residents), from the paramedical field, from education and sport, and from the general population. The assessments conducted with the professionals receiving interventions aiming to improve detection demonstrated their efficacy. Interventions for ED detection in the general population and at school seemed less efficacious. Conclusion The results highlighted some lines of action to be implemented. They pointed towards improving initial and continuing education for professional carers; e-learning could be an interesting solution for continuing education. Improving training with specific instructors, school personnel and sports professionals is also one of the solutions for a better detection of EDs. Specific recommendations could be published for fitness centre professionals to help them to deal with clients suspected of having an ED. Among secondary school students and in the general population, a better dissemination of mental health literacy and the development of mental health first aid programs could help improve early detection.

AB  - Biosensors enable observation and understanding of latent physiological occurrences otherwise unknown or invasively detected. Wearable biosensors monitoring physiological constructs across a wide variety of mental and physical health conditions have become an important trend in innovative research methodologies. Within substance use research, explorations of biosensor technology commonly focus on identifying physiological indicators of intoxication to increase understanding of addiction etiology and to inform treatment recommendations. In this review, we examine the state of research in this area as it pertains to treatment of alcohol use disorders specifically highlighting the gaps in our current knowledge with recommendations for future research. Annually, alcohol use disorders affect approximately 15 million individuals. A primary focus of existing wearable technology-based research among people with alcohol use disorders is identifying alcohol intoxication. A large benefit of wearable biosensors for this purpose is they provide continuous readings in a passive manner compared with the gold standard measure of blood alcohol content (BAC) traditionally measured intermittently by breathalyzer or blood draw. There are two primary means of measuring intoxication with biosensors: gait and sweat. Gait changes have been measured via smart sensors placed on the wrist, in the shoe, and mobile device sensors in smart phones. Sweat measured by transdermal biosensors detects the presence of alcohol in the blood stream correlating to BAC. Transdermal biosensors have been designed in tattoos/skin patches, shirts, and most commonly, devices worn on the ankle or wrist. Transdermal devices were initially developed to help monitor court-ordered sobriety among offenders with alcohol use disorder. These devices now prove most useful in continuously tracking consumption throughout clinical trials for behavioral treatment modalities. More recent research has started exploring the uses for physical activity trackers and physiological arousal sensors to guide behavioral interventions for relapse prevention. While research has begun to demonstrate wearable devices' utility in reducing alcohol consumption among individuals aiming to cutdown on their drinking, monitoring sustained abstinence in studies exploring contingency management for alcohol use disorders, and facilitating engagement in activity-based treatment interventions, their full potential to further aid in understanding of, and treatment for, alcohol use disorders has yet to be explored.

AB  - Radiation can be lethal at high doses, whereas controlled doses are useful in medical applications. Other applications include power generation, agriculture sterilization, nuclear weapons, and archeology. Radiation damages genetic material, which is reflected in genotoxicity and can cause hereditary damage. In the medical field, it is essential to avoid the harmful effects of radiation. Radiation countermeasures and the need for radioprotective agents have been explored in recent years. Considering plants that evolve in radiative conditions, their ability to protect organisms against radiation has been studied and demonstrated. Crude extracts, fractioned extracts, isolated phytocompounds, and plant polysaccharides from various plants have been used in radioprotection studies, and their efficiency has been proven in various in vitro and in vivo experimental models. It is important to identify the mechanism of action to develop a potent plant-based radioprotective agent. To identify this protective mechanism, it is necessary to understand the damage caused by radiation in biological systems. This review intends to discuss the effects of ionizing radiation on biological systems and evaluate plant-based radioprotectants that have tested thus far as well as their mechanism of action in protecting against the toxic effects of radiation. From the review, the mechanism of radioprotection exhibited by the plant-based products could be understood. Meanwhile, we strongly suggest that the potential products identified so far should undergo clinical trials for critically evaluating their effects and for developing an ideal and compatible radioprotectant with no side-effects.

AB  - Water quality plays a central role in the well-being of all the living organisms on planet Earth. The everincreasing human population and consequently increasing industrialization, urbanization, and chemically boosted cultivation are rapidly contaminating already stressed water resources. The availability of clean drinking water has become scarce for masses across the globe, and this situation is becoming alarming in developing countries. Therefore, the immediate need for cost-effective, easily accessible, eco-friendly, portable, thermally efficient, and chemically stable technologies and materials is desperately felt to meet the high global demand for clean water. To search for effective materials for wastewater treatment, the hyper-cross-linked porous polymers (HCPs) have emerged as an excellent class of porous materials for wastewater treatment due to their unique features of high surface area, tunability, biodegradability, and chemical versatility. This review describes the advances in fabrication strategies and the efficient utilization of hyper-cross-linked porous polymers for wastewater treatment. Moreover, this review specifically discusses the hyper-cross-linked porous polymers effectiveness for the separation of the dyes, nutrients, inorganic ions, organic contaminants, and toxic metals ions. Finally, the review provides insight into the challenges and prospects in the area of hyper-cross-linked porous polymers. Overall, the hyper-cross-linked porous polymers with empowering proper functionalization can provide an opportunity for the wastewater treatment not only to remove toxic contaminants but also to make contaminated water useful for various applications.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review assessed whether physician-patient language concordance, compared with discordance, is associated with better health outcomes.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted, without language restrictions, using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO, from inception to July 2020. We included studies that evaluated the effects of physician-patient language concordance on health outcomes. Articles were screened, selected, and data-extracted in duplicate. Review protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO, CRD42020157229).
   Results: There were 541 citations identified through databases and eight citations through reverse search and Google Scholar. A total of 15 articles (84,750 participants) were included reporting outcomes within five domains: diabetes care (four studies), inpatient care (five studies), cancer screening (three studies), healthcare counseling (two studies), and mental health care (one study). Ten studies were of good quality, four were fair, and one was poor, according to the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Eight studies (53%) showed a significant negative association between language discordance and at least one clinical outcome. Five studies (33%) found no association.
   Conclusion: Over half the evidence collated showed that physician-patient language concordance was associated with better health clinical outcomes.

KW  - Mental health
AB  - Public stigma and self-stigma impact negatively on the lives of people with mental health issues. Many people in society stereotype and discriminate against people with mental ill-health, and often this negative process of marginalisation is internalised by people with lived experiences. Thus, this negative internalisation leads to the development of self-stigma. In this article, I reflect on my own experiences of shame and self-stigma as a person with mental ill-health socially bullied by peers from my community and social groups. I present a personal narrative of both public and self-stigmatisation which I hope will enable me to exorcise memories of internalised stigma, which are encountered as my demons of lived experience. Using reflexivity, a process used widely in health and social care fields, I consider how social bullying shattered my fragile confidence, self-esteem, and self-efficacy in the early days of my recovery; the impact of associative stigma on family members is also explored. Following this, the potential to empower people who experience shame and stigma is explored alongside effective anti-stigma processes which challenge discrimination. I connect the concept of recovery with the notion of empowerment, both of which emphasise the importance of agency and self-efficacy for people with mental ill-health. Finally, I consider how the concepts of empowerment and recovery can challenge both the public stigma held by peers in the community and the self-stigma of those with lived experiences.

AB  - BackgroundOccupational stress is a global health problem which affects employed personals especially health professionals. The burden of stress is not limited at individual level, but also affects the organizations productivity, the quality of care and country in large. In Ethiopia, little concern is given to this problem and individual studies conducted among health care professionals also showed inconsistent result. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the pooled prevalence of occupational stress and its associated factors among health care professionals in Ethiopia.MethodsArticles were searched from PubMed, Hinari, PsychInfo, Science direct databases, Google and Google scholar. A total of 10 studies were included in this review and meta-analysis. We used a standardized format for data extraction and STATA software version 13 for analysis. A random effect meta-analysis model was used to determine the pooled prevalence of occupational stress and I-2 was used to check heterogeneity. Begg's and Egger's tests were conducted to detect publication bias. Furthermore, sensitivity and subgroup analysis was also conducted. Association was expressed by pooled odd ratio with corresponding 95% CI.ResultsThe pooled prevalence of occupational stress was 52.5 [95% CI: (47.03, 57.96)]. The heterogeneity test was I-2=89.1% & P<0.001. The result of the publication bias detection (Begg's and Egger's) tests were p =0.283 and p =0.369 respectively. Female sex was identified as a significant predictor for occupational stress with a pooled effect of 3.75 [95% CI: (2.58, 5.45)].ConclusionsAbove half of health care professionals had occupational stress. Being female was significantly associated factor in this review and meta-analysis. Therefore, introduction of policies supporting health care professionals well-being at work in Ethiopia are advisable.

KW  - Suicide
KW  - Self-harm
KW  - Peripartum mental health
AB  - The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize research that uses linked data to examine peripartum suicidal behaviours and critically appraise studies to identify evidence gaps and future research priorities. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and grey literature was undertaken to identify data linkage studies that examined suicidal behaviours among women in the peripartum period. All articles available through PubMed and Scopus up until the search date of 26 September 2019 were deemed eligible for inclusion. A grey literature search was also undertaken, through the Google search engine, on 11 November 2019. Studies were analysed descriptively and synthesized qualitatively. Eighteen studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. All studies examined the incidence of suicidal behaviours. Twelve studies examined sociodemographic correlates, associations, or risk factors, and nine studies examined mental health. There was a high degree of variability regarding how both peripartum status and suicidal behaviours were defined. Few studies used data linkage to examine suicidal behaviours from a health services or social services perspective. The evidence base could benefit from conceptual clarity and standardization of constructs regarding suicidal behaviours in the peripartum period, to enable meaningful synthesis of results across studies. Data linkage can be used to improve understandings of risk factors and pathways. It can also be harnessed to examine both health and social services utilization, to inform coordinated multi-sectoral interventions and care pathways for women and their children.

Since initial planning in 2010, it has rapidly grown - giving rise to seven completed, and 15 ongoing, clinical trials of 16 agents each aimed at delivering disease modification in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this review, we will provide an overview of the history, structure, process, and progress of the program. We will also present some examples of agents that have been selected and prioritized by the program and subsequently evaluated in clinical trials. Our goal with this review is to provide a template that can be considered across other therapeutic areas.

AB  - Purpose We aimed to map evidence on the development of mental health care in Central Asia after 1991. Method We conducted a scoping review complemented by an expert review. We searched five databases for peer-reviewed journal articles and conducted grey literature searching. The reference lists of included articles were screened for additional relevant publications. Results We included 53 articles (Kazakhstan: 13, Kyrgyzstan: 14, Tajikistan: 10, Uzbekistan: 9, Turkmenistan: 2, Multinational: 5). Only 9 were published in internationally recognised journals. In the 1990's mental health services collapsed following a sharp decline in funding, and historically popular folk services re-emerged as an alternative. Currently, modernised mental health policies exist but remain largely unimplemented due to lack of investment and low prioritisation by governments. Psychiatric treatment is still concentrated in hospitals, and community-based and psycho-social services are almost entirely unavailable. Stigma is reportedly high throughout the region, psychiatric myths are widespread, and societal awareness of human rights is low. With the exception of Kyrgyzstan, user involvement is virtually absent. After many years of stagnation, however, political interest in mental health is beginning to show, along with some promising service developments. Conclusions There is a substantial knowledge gap in the region. Informed decision-making and collaboration with stakeholders is necessary to facilitate future reform implementation.

AB  - Many people with intellectual disability experience digital inequality due to a lack of Internet access; this is known as the digital divide. Digital inequality is also apparent when people with intellectual disability have Internet access, but only use it for a small number of applications (e.g., watching videos and playing games). Recently, it has been suggested that digital inequality also occurs in situations where some Internet users are less likely than others to translate their online activities to offline resources, including educational outcomes and social capital. The extent to which people with intellectual disability are translating their online activities to offline resources has not been examined. We conducted a systematic and critical review using PRISMA guidelines. The search strategy terms "intellectual disability" and "Internet use" were used to search the databases: Scopus; Wiley Online Library; Psychiatry Online; Web of Science; CINAHL; and PubMed. Twenty-four studies were found, which described 53 types of Internet use, 48 risks of Internet use, and 28 benefits of Internet use. The data were identified thematically and categorized to facilitate comparisons. The most frequently reported types of Internet use were in the category of social media/social networking (23%), the most common Internet risks were in the category of emotional distress (24%), and the most often reported benefits were in the category of friendships and social connection (33%). The findings indicate that the benefits of Internet use for people with intellectual disability have received much less attention than the risks.

AB  - Background: When infertility is diagnosed, physicians have the difficult task to break bad news. Their communication skills play a central role in improving patients' coping abilities and adherence to infertility treatments. However, specific guidelines and training courses on this topic are still lacking. The aim of the present study is to provide some practical advice for improving breaking bad news in infertility diagnosis through a systematic literature review of qualitative and quantitative studies.
   Methods: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection databases. All articles focusing on the communication of the diagnosis of infertility were included. The main findings of each included article were then summarized.
   Results: Literature search identified 11,838 references that were screened for eligibility. Full texts of 81 articles were retrieved, and their analysis led to the inclusion of 4 articles, which treated the theme of communication of infertility only partially. The main addressed aspects concerning the communication of the infertility diagnosis were the following: (i) the value that patients give to healthcare professionals' communication skills; (ii) the importance of giving clear information on diagnostic procedures and treatments in order to decrease patients' anxiety; and (iii) the importance of involving both partners.
   Conclusions: This review pointed out that the communication of the infertility diagnosis is still underinvestigated. Specific guidelines are currently not available, but other protocols could be used. Taking into account the principal aspects of communication highlighted with this review, in this study, we suggested an adaptation of the original SPIKES protocol that could be used by healthcare professionals for the communication of the infertility status.

AB  - Introduction: Screen-based and mobile technology has grown at an unprecedented rate. However, little is understood about whether increased screen-use affects executive functioning (EF), the range of mental processes that aid goal attainment and facilitate the selection of appropriate behaviors. To examine this, a systematic review was conducted.
   Method: This systematic review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus databases to identify articles published between 2007 and March 2020, examining the use of mobile technologies on aspects of EF in healthy adults aged 18-35 years. In total 6079 articles were screened by title, and 39 screened by full text. Eight eligible papers were identified for inclusion. Our methods were pre-registered on the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews.
   Results: A total of 438 participants were included across the eight studies. Five of the eight studies examined more than one EF. Five studies measured inhibition, and four studies measured decision-making. Smartphone use was negatively associated with inhibition and decision-making. Working memory performance was found to be improved by increased time engaging in video games and by refraining from smartphone use prior to bedtime. Quality assessments indicated high risk of methodological biases across the studies and a low quality of evidence for determining the relationship between technology use and executive functioning.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the scarcity of the literature in this area. It presents a call for rigorous and objective research to further our understanding of the impact of mobile technology on different aspects of executive function.

AB  - Background: Mental fatigue can impact physical demands and tactical behavior in sport-related contexts. Small-sided games (SSGs) are often used to develop a specific sport-related context. However, the effects of mental fatigue on physical demands and tactical behaviors during soccer SSGs have not been aggregated for systematical assessment.
   Objective: This systematic review (with a meta-analysis) was conducted to compare the effects of mental fatigue vs. control conditions in terms of the total running distance and tactical behavior of soccer players during SSGs.
   Methods: The data sources utilized were PubMed, PsycINFO, Scielo, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The study eligibility criteria were established based on PICOS: (i) Population: healthy youth and young adult men soccer players with regular training practice and belonging to teams with regular competitions; (ii) Intervention: exposed to mental fatigue-induced protocols only before SSGs; (iii) Comparator: control conditions (passive or active not promoting mental fatigue) before SSGs; (iv) Outcomes: physical demands (total running distance) and tactical behavior (attacking behavior accuracy, pass decision-making accuracy, and space exploration index); (v) Study design: counterbalanced cross-over design; and (vi) only full-text and original articles written in English.
   Results: The database search initially identified 111 titles. From those, six articles were eligible for the systematic review and meta-analysis. Results showed no significant effect of fatigue on total running distance (ES = 0.13; p = 0.307) and tactical behavior (ES = 0.56; p = 0.079).
   Conclusions: A non-significant effect of mental fatigue on total running distance and tactical behaviors performed by soccer players during SSGs was found in this systematic review.

AB  - Background There is a growing body of evidence on racial and ethnic disparities within traumatic brain injury (TBI) care. The aim of this paper was to conduct a narrative review of the literature, demonstrating how racial and ethnic disparities manifest across the full spectrum of the TBI experience in civilian populations: injury, acute care and diagnosis, post-TBI recovery and adjustment, and long-term outcomes. Methods We searched five electronic databases (Scopus, APA PsychNet, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar) using the search terms traumatic brain injury, head trauma, concussion, health disparities, ethnic minority, racial minority, race ethnicity, racial ethnic, prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, rehabilitation, recovery, and outcomes. Boolean search modifiers AND, NOT, and OR were used to produce relevant results. Additional resources were included by the authors, as deemed relevant to the investigation. Results Our narrative review of 39 articles elucidated numerous ways in which racial and ethnic disparities span the TBI continuum of care, including acute care and diagnosis, post-TBI recovery and adjustment, and long-term outcomes. Conclusions Understanding racial and ethnic disparities is a first step in ensuring equitable care for all individuals with TBI, including raising awareness among clinicians and guiding the development of tailored interventions for racial and ethnic minority populations.

KW  - review
KW  - Iraq
AB  - Background:
   Generations of women living in Iraq endured three major regional wars and internal conflicts, which weakened their psychological vulnerability and social role by poverty, displacements, and loss of their beloved ones. The available literature about women's mental health is scarce and does not signify the gender inequality and gender disparity of mental disorders.
   Method:
   During 1st August to October 2020, we explored the search engines: Google Scholar, Pub-Med, Medline, and Clarivate using keywords of Iraq, gender inequality, women's mental health, violence, and conflict, mental disorders, gender-based violence, etc. From 1792 research items, 64 articles were scrutinized for this study. We selected the most relevant studies with some available documents excluding data bout Immigrant women outside Iraq and reports from foreign military sources.
   Finding:
   Women living in Iraq have struggled for equality and empowerment since the 20th century. For the last four decades, successive wars, economic sanction, gender-based violence, and internal conflicts have affected their development endeavors. The 2003 US-led invasion caused a loss of lives, destruction of infrastructure, and forced displacement for tens of thousands of civilians, including women and children. These atrocities increased women's vulnerability to develop or worsen the existing mental disorders. This review tries to attract world attention to women's situations in Iraq.

AB  - Objective:
   Suicide in Canadian men is high and rising. Research consistently indicates increased suicide risk in male subgroups including sexual minority, Indigenous, middle-aged, and military men. The current scoping review addresses the research question: Among male subgroups featured in Canadian suicide research, what are the key findings to inform suicide prevention efforts?.
   Method:
   A scoping review was undertaken in accord with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Structured searches were conducted in CIHAHL, Medline, PsychInfo, and Web of Science to identify studies reporting suicidality (suicidal ideation, plans and/or attempts) and suicide among men in Canada. Inclusion criteria comprised primary empirical studies featuring Canadian male subgroups published in English from 2009 to 2020 inclusive.
   Results:
   Sixty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria, highlighting significant rates of male suicidality and/or suicide in 3 categories: (1) health inequities (n = 29); (2) age-specific (n = 30); and (3) occupation (n = 9). The health inequities category included sexual minority men, Indigenous, and other marginalized males (i.e., homeless, immigrant men, and men who use opiates). Age-specific men focused on adolescents and youth, and middle-aged and older males. Active military, veterans, and first responders featured in the occupation category. Studies compared at risk male subgroups to females, general male populations, and/or other marginalized groups in emphasizing mental health disparities and increased suicide risk. Some men's suboptimal connections to existing mental health care services were also highlighted.
   Conclusion:
   While male subgroups who are vulnerable to suicidality and suicide were consistently described, these insights have not translated to tailored upstream suicide prevention services for Canadian boys and men. There may be some important gains through integrating social and mental health care services for marginalized men, implementing school-based masculinity programs for adolescent males, orientating clinicians to the potential for men's mid-life suicide risks (i.e., separation, bereavement, retirement) and lobbying employers to norm help-seeking among activate military, veterans, and first responder males.

AB  - Affective prosody recognition is an important area of research in autism spectrum conditions where difficulties in social cognition have been frequently observed. To probe into the mixed results reported in the literature, we conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis and examined potential factors that could explain the inconsistent results. Our literature search included six electronic databases for studies that compared the affective prosody recognition performance in individuals with autism spectrum condition with typically developing participants, which yielded 23 papers eligible for quantitative synthesis. Using a random-effects model, we obtained a moderate-to-large pooled effect (Hedges' g = -0.63) for the overall affective prosody recognition performance of autism spectrum condition participants, which, however, reduced substantially (to -0.26) and became non-significant after the correction for publication bias. The number of answer codes was found to be a significant moderator for the effect estimate, whereas the number of speakers was not. Moreover, the magnitude of the pooled effect estimate varied across emotions. The findings suggested moderate differences in affective prosody recognition ability between autism spectrum condition and typically developing individuals, which reduced to marginal difficulties for autism spectrum condition when the impact of publication bias was taken into account. Diversity in the number of answer codes could have differential effects on affective prosody recognition performance in autism spectrum condition, which varied across emotions. The present review and meta-analysis demonstrated the insufficiency of research on affective prosody recognition in autism spectrum condition, highlighting a need for further exploration of the contributors and underlying mechanisms for specific affective prosody recognition difficulties.
   Lay abstract
   Differences in understanding others' emotions and attitudes through features in speech (e.g. intonation) have been observed in individuals with autism spectrum conditions, which contribute greatly to their social communication challenges. However, some studies reported that individuals with autism spectrum condition performed comparably to typically developing individuals on affective prosody recognition. Here, we provide a comprehensive review with statistical analysis of 23 existing studies on this topic to examine potential factors that could explain the discrepancies. Compared with typically developing individuals, autism spectrum condition participants generally appeared to encounter more difficulties in affective prosody recognition. But this finding was likely due to the tendency of the existing research to overly focus on deficits in autism. The affective prosody recognition performance in individuals with autism spectrum condition was closely related to the number of answer options offered to them. Moreover, the degree of difficulty in affective prosody recognition encountered by individuals with autism spectrum condition varied across emotions. The findings of this systematic review highlighted the need for further research on affective prosody recognition in autism (e.g. studies that include tonal language speakers and autism spectrum condition individuals with lower cognitive or verbal abilities).

AB  - Increasing crop productivity to feed a growing population, while conserving the natural resources, is one of the humanity's major challenges that needs to be overcome. To achieve these goals while decreasing and/or rational-izing the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, scientists are nowadays more interested in plant-and microbial-based solutions to develop a new up-coming green revolution being much defined by cost-effective and eco-friendly approaches to sustain the agricultural sector. Biostimulants and bioprotectants are natural prep-arations, that have gained a big interest in the last years because of their role in improving plant growth and yields and reducing the impact of abiotic and biotic stresses. Seaweed extracts, humic substances, protein hydro-lysates, amino acids, plant extracts, and beneficial microorganisms have gained importance as biostimulants and bioprotectants because of their valuable effect on plant growth and their ability to alleviate the detrimental ef-fects of different abiotic and biotic stresses. Likewise, microbial-based biostimulants and bioprotectants are shown to impact positively cropping systems through different mechanisms (e.g., increase nutrients uptake and use efficiencies, boost root system development, suppress phytopathogens infection, and alleviate heavy metals (HMs) toxicity among many others), eventually leading to better crop growth and yields. Among the dif-ferent classes of molecules extracted from plants, seaweeds and microorganisms, secondary metabolites, repre-sent a major group of bioactive compounds that could be responsible for the biostimulant effect. In addition to their effect as biostimulants, these molecules, are endowed with a wide range of bioprotectant activities and could, therefore, play an important role as protectors for plants against multiple attacks from insects and phyto-pathogens. Given all this knowledge, the exploitation of these bio-based and cost-effective compounds is worth further investigations to develop propitious approaches that should sustain agricultural productivity in an envi-ronmentally friendly manner.

AB  - Background: Cyberbullying is well-recognized as a severe public health issue which affects both adolescents and children. Most extant studies have focused on national and regional effects of cyberbullying, with few examining the global perspective of cyberbullying. This systematic review comprehensively examines the global situation, risk factors, and preventive measures taken worldwide to fight cyberbullying among adolescents and children.
   Methods: A systematic review of available literature was completed following PRISMA guidelines using the search themes "cyberbullying" and "adolescent or children"; the time frame was from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2019. Eight academic databases pertaining to public health, and communication and psychology were consulted, namely: Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, ProQuest, Communication & Mass Media Complete, CINAHL, and PsycArticles. Additional records identified through other sources included the references of reviews and two websites, Cyberbullying Research Center and United Nations Children's Fund. A total of 63 studies out of 2070 were included in our final review focusing on cyberbullying prevalence and risk factors.
   Results: The prevalence rates of cyberbullying preparation ranged from 6.0 to 46.3%, while the rates of cyberbullying victimization ranged from 13.99 to 57.5%, based on 63 references. Verbal violence was the most common type of cyberbullying. Fourteen risk factors and three protective factors were revealed in this study. At the personal level, variables associated with cyberbullying including age, gender, online behavior, race, health condition, past experience of victimization, and impulsiveness were reviewed as risk factors. Likewise, at the situational level, parent-child relationship, interpersonal relationships, and geographical location were also reviewed in relation to cyberbullying. As for protective factors, empathy and emotional intelligence, parent-child relationship, and school climate were frequently mentioned.
   Conclusion: The prevalence rate of cyberbullying has increased significantly in the observed 5-year period, and it is imperative that researchers from low and middle income countries focus sufficient attention on cyberbullying of children and adolescents. Despite a lack of scientific intervention research on cyberbullying, the review also identified several promising strategies for its prevention from the perspectives of youths, parents and schools. More research on cyberbullying is needed, especially on the issue of cross-national cyberbullying. International cooperation, multi-pronged and systematic approaches are highly encouraged to deal with cyberbullying.

AB  - Research suggests that optimism and pessimism should be studied as two distinct constructs rather than as unidimensional, at opposing ends of a continuum. Optimism and pessimism have different associations with health-related behaviours, coping style, and a number of health outcomes. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence on the association of optimism and pessimism and all-cause mortality. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. From 6837 retrospective/prospective cohort studies identified, 25 were included, with a total of 217,256 participants. Eleven of the 18 studies assessing optimism reported that optimism was associated with lower risk of mortality, while seven of eight studies measuring pessimism and the two assessing unrealistic optimism reported that higher pessimism/unrealistic optimism was associated with an increased mortality risk. Results of a meta-analysis indicated that optimism measured categorically was associated with lower risk of mortality (pooled RR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79?0.91). We suggest optimism and pessimism be measured as separate constructs, as both of these have distinct effects on mortality risk. Future research is required to investigate whether psychological interventions to increase optimism or decrease pessimism can reduce risk of all-cause mortality.

AB  - Disasters have many deleterious effects and are becoming more frequent. From a health-care perspective, disasters may cause periods of stress for hospitals and health-care systems. Telemedicine is a rapidly growing technology that has been used to improve access to health-care during disasters. Telemedicine applied in disasters is referred to as disaster telemedicine. Our objective was to conduct a scoping literature review on current use of disaster telemedicine to develop recommendations addressing the most common barriers to implementation of a telemedicine system for regional disaster health response in the United States. Publications on telemedicine in disasters were collected from online databases. This included both publications in English and those translated into English. Predesigned inclusion/exclusion criteria and a PRISMA flow diagram were applied. The PRISMA flow diagram was used on the basis that it would help streamline the available literature. Literature that met the criteria was scored by 2 reviewers who rated relevance to commonly identified disaster telemedicine implementation barriers, as well as how disaster telemedicine systems were implemented. We also identified other frequently mentioned themes and briefly summarized recommendations for those topics. Literature scoring resulted in the following topics: telemedicine usage (42 publications), system design and operating models (43 publications), as well as difficulties with credentialing (5 publications), licensure (6 publications), liability (4 publications), reimbursement (5 publications), and technology (24 publications). Recommendations from each category were qualitatively summarized.

AB  - The majority of antidepressant medication trials have focused on adult populations (ages 18?65), with much less research in older and younger populations. Moreover, key differences in the efficacy and safety of antidepressants have been identified between these age groups. Ketamine has emerged as a promising new treatment for treatment resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this review is to summarize and synthesize the extant literature on the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of ketamine for depression in special age populations (age 18 and 60). Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was performed, searching EMBASE, PsycInfo, and PubMed from inception through July 2020. Studies reporting the use of any ketamine formulation with variable routes of administration to treat clinically diagnosed depression in adolescents or older adults were included. Thirteen studies were included in the analysis and ten observed rapid (<2 week latency) antidepressant effects following ketamine treatments, with better outcomes following larger, repeated doses, and in open-label rather than blinded settings. Two case reports in adolescents assessed measures of suicidal ideation and both found ketamine to effectuate rapid anti-suicidal effects. Ketamine appears to be safe and well-tolerated in adolescents and older adults. The small quantity, high heterogeneity, and generally low quality of available studies precludes statistical syntheses and significantly limits the strength of our conclusions. Preliminary proof-ofconcept studies are promising, however, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are still required to ascertain effectiveness, safety and tolerability in these groups.

AB  - The lack of physical exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic-related quarantine measures is challenging, especially for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Without regular exercise not only patients, but also nursing staff and physicians soon noticed a deterioration of motor and non-motor symptoms. Reduced functional mobility, increased falls, increased frailty, and decreased quality of life were identified as consequences of increased sedentary behavior. This work overviews the current literature on problems of supplying conventional physiotherapy and the potential of telerehabilitation, allied health services, and patient-initiated exercise for PD patients during the COVID-19 period. We discuss recent studies on approaches that can improve remote provision of exercise to patients, including telerehabilitation, motivational tools, apps, exergaming, and virtual reality (VR) exercise. Additionally, we provide a case report about a 69-year-old PD patient who took part in a 12-week guided climbing course for PD patients prior to the pandemic and found a solution to continue her climbing training independently with an outdoor rope ladder. This case can serve as a best practice example for non-instructed, creative, and patient-initiated exercise in the domestic environment in difficult times, as are the current. Overall, many recent studies on telemedicine, telerehabilitation, and patient-initiated exercises have been published, giving rise to optimism that facilitating remote exercise can help PD patients maintain physical mobility and emotional well-being, even in phases such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic itself may even boost the need to establish comprehensive and easy-to-do telerehabilitation programs.

AB  - Introduction: Mental disorders represent serious public health concerns in the U.S. Compared with Whites, racial/ethnic minority adolescents are more likely to be affected by mental disorders but less likely to use mental health services. This systematic review aimed to summarize factors related to mental health service use among minority adolescents in the U.S. as identified in previous research.
   Methodology: Following the PRISMA guideline, we systematically searched seven databases for peer reviewed articles related to barriers and facilitators of mental health service use among racial/ethnic minority adolescents.
   Results: Thirty-two quantitative studies met our inclusion criteria, among which 12 studies (37.5%) sampled mostly Blacks or African Americans, 6 studies (18.7%) focused primarily on Hispanics or Latin/a/x, including Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans, and 4 studies (12.5%) were mostly Asian Americans (e.g., Chinese, Vietnamese). Based on the socio-ecological framework, 21 studies (65.6%) identified adolescent-related barriers and facilitators of mental health service use, including biological (e.g., age, gender), clinical (e.g., symptom severity), behavioral (e.g., drug/alcohol use), and psychological characteristics (e.g., internal asset) of minority youth. Ten studies (31.3%) identified parents-related factors that influenced minority adolescent mental health service use, including parental perceptions and beliefs, family and parenting issues, and demographic characteristics. Primary factors at the therapist level included ethnic match between patient and practitioner, relationship with healthcare practitioners, and patient-therapist co-endorsement of etiological beliefs. Fifteen studies (46.9%) identified factors influencing minority adolescent mental health service use at the contextual/structural level, including household income, insurance status, and family structure. Lastly, acculturation and school experiences were major factors at the social/cultural level that influence minority adolescent service use.
   Conclusion: More empirical studies are needed to understand the mechanism underlying minority adolescents' unmet mental health service needs. Culturally competent interventions are warranted to engage minority adolescents with mental disorders into treatment.

AB  - Poland, being a post-Communist European country with a tradition of Marxists religious studies in operation till 1989, developed during the Communist Era an original way of connecting psychology of religion with the value-neutral study of religion. It is also a Catholic a country, in which psychology of religion was practiced in a bipolar milieu: religion as a "sensitive" topic was approached from either Marxist-atheist or Catholic religious perspective. Such dualistic divisions should end with the breaking of the Iron Curtain, and opening to the West, but was it so in this country of contrasts? The article forms a bird's eye look on the last three decades of the Polish psychology of religion (1989-2020), concentrating on the "concrete products of scientific inquiry" therefore main works of scholars in the field are presented, discussed and context-wise interpreted in order to provide some answers for that query.

AB  - Introduction The rate of diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is on the rise. Families of individuals with ASD usually face challenges in raising their children. The coping strategies that allow for caregivers to prevail and be resilient in this situation need to be better understood. Thus, this review aimed to compile evidences related to resiliency and coping strategies among families of individuals with ASD. Methods We searched several online databases including CINAHL, EBSCO, Embase, and Medline, which yielded 1613 articles. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 25 studies remained for review. Results We found that caregivers use different coping strategies and report different stressors that are influenced by their partners support and resiliency. Positive cognitions can mediate the effects of raising a child with ASD, and the severity of the child's symptoms is one of the greatest influences on maternal well-being. Conclusion The majority of previous studies are cross sectional or descriptive. It is crucial that empirical, longitudinal research establish a cogent picture of parental resiliency. A clearer picture of resiliency will help outline the ways in which parents can increase their well-being and quality of life, and this will support advancing the child resiliency and interventions that might be adopted.

AB  - Feeding difficulties related to selective intake, or eating a limited variety of foods, are very common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and CINAHL identified 29 studies that evaluated eight correlates: age, ASD symptoms and severity, cognitive and adaptive skills, sensory processing and perception, challenging behavior, weight status, gastrointestinal symptoms, and parenting stress. Feeding difficulties related to selective intake are consistently correlated with impaired sensory processing and perception and tend to be positively associated with rigidity and challenging behavior. These feeding difficulties tend to persist with advancing age. Other correlates demonstrated inconsistent findings. A significant limitation of research reviewed is variability in terminology, definitions, and measurement of feeding difficulties.

KW  - Discrimination
KW  - Rehabilitation
AB  - Purpose
   Mental illness is associated with high unemployment rates, limited working opportunities, work-related discrimination, stigma and prejudices. For people with severe mental illness, the work reality is even more burdensome. This paper aims to explore in-depth and presents research results in the past decade on the meaning of work for people with severe mental illness.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors conducted a systematic literature search in Medline, Science Direct, PsycINFO databases between 2000 and 2019. The review concluded in 13 studies.
   Findings
   This research showed actual results regarding the meaning of work for individuals with severe mental illness from a medical, social, psychological and financial perspective. Work is of great importance for people with severe mental illness, influencing their lives on many levels.
   Practical implications
   The present research results can contribute to the information and further awareness of experts in mental health and vocational rehabilitation services. This review lightens the meaning of work and challenges the state's priorities in creating active and not marginalised citizens.
   Originality/value
   This review is original and adds to the existing knowledge that employment may benefit people with severe mental illness, especially the youngest adults, despite their labor market obstacles. It is for communities' benefit, employers, but mostly for people with severe mental illness themselves, to work.

AB  - Chlorophyll a fluorescence is increasingly being used as a rapid, non-invasive, sensitive and convenient indicator of photosynthetic performance in marine autotrophs. This review presents the methodology, applications and limitations of chlorophyll fluorescence in marine studies. The various chlorophyll fluorescence tools such as Pulse-Amplitude-Modulated (PAM) and Fast Repetition Rate (FRR) fluorometry used in marine scientific studies are discussed. Various commonly employed chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are elaborated. The application of chlorophyll fluorescence in measuring natural variations, stress, stress tolerance and acclimation/adaptation to changing environment in primary producers such as microalgae, macroalgae, seagrasses and mangroves, and marine symbiotic invertebrates, namely symbiotic sponges, hard corals and sea anemones, kleptoplastic sea slugs and giant clams is critically assessed. Stressors include environmental, biological, physical and chemical ones. The strengths, limitations and future perspectives of the use of chlorophyll fluorescence technique as an assessment tool in symbiotic marine organisms and seaplants are discussed.

It also reviews the available screening tools and different treatment modalities.Recent FindingsIn PD, longitudinal predictors of anxiety are mostly non-motor non-dopaminergic symptoms. The longitudinal course of anxiety is mainly a stable one. The Parkinson Anxiety Scale and the Geriatric Anxiety Scale are the 2 recommended screening tools.SummaryA third of PD patients suffer from an anxiety disorder at any time point. It can precede or follow PD motor symptoms. Anxiety is associated with demographic, disease-related motor and non-motor features. There is a lack of studies evaluating psychotropic treatment of anxiety in PD. Adjustment of dopaminergic treatment is indicated when anxiety is associated with motor fluctuations. DBS can be useful as well as CBT and body-mind interventions.

AB  - Background: Research on rehabilitation for falls after stroke is warranted. However, published evidence on fall interventions with stroke survivors is limited and these are mainly international studies that may be less relevant for Southeast Asia.
   Objective: This review aims to systematically identify literature related to stroke rehabilitation for falls and risk of falls in Southeast Asia.
   Methods: A scoping review with stakeholders' consultation was implemented. An electronic search was conducted up to December 2020 on 4 databases (Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, ASEAN Citation Index). Only original studies conducted in Southeast Asia were selected.
   Results: The initial search yielded 3,112 articles, however, only 26 were selected in the final analysis. Most of the articles focused on physical rehabilitation and implemented conventional therapies. While the literature may reflect practice in Southeast Asia, stakeholders perceived that the literature was inadequate to show true practice, was not informative and missed several aspects such as functional, cognitive, and psychological interventions in managing falls. Individual-centric interventions dominated the review while community-based and environmental-focused studies were limited. Majority of the articles were written by physiotherapists while others were from physicians, occupational therapists, and an engineer but few from other healthcare practitioners (i.e., speech therapists, psychologists) or disciplines interested in falls.
   Conclusions: Falls prevention among stroke survivors has received a lack of attention and is perceived as an indirect goal in stroke rehabilitation in Southeast Asia. More innovative research adopted from falls research with older people is needed to advance falls prevention and intervention practice with stroke survivors.

AB  - Heat stress has been defined as the rise of temperature for a period of time higher than a threshold level, thereby permanently affecting the plant growth and development. Day or night temperature is considered as the major limiting factor for plant growth. Earlier studies reported that night temperature is an important factor in the heat reaction of the plants. Tomato cultivars capable of setting viable fruits under night temperatures above 21 degrees C are considered as heat-tolerant cultivars. The development of breeding objectives is generally summarized in four points: (a) cultivars with higher yield, (b) disease resistant varieties in the 1970s, (c) long shelf-life in 1980s, and (d) nutritive and taste quality during 1990s. Some unique varieties like the dwarf "Micro-Tom", and the first transgenic tomato (FlavrSavr) were developed through breeding; they were distributed late in the 1980s.
   High temperature significantly affects seed, pollen viability and root expansion. Researchers have employed different parameters to evaluate the tolerance to heat stress, including membrane thermo stability, floral characteristics (Stigma exertion and antheridia cone splitting), flower number, and fruit yield per plant. Reports on pollen viability and fruit set/plant under heat stress by comparing the pollen growth and tube development in heat-treated and non-heat-stressed conditions are available in literature. The electrical conductivity (EC) have been used to evaluate the tolerance of some tomato cultivars in vitro under heat stress conditions as an indication of cell damage due to electrolyte leakage; they classified the cultivars into three groups: (a) heat tolerant, (b) moderately heat tolerant, and (c) heat sensitive.
   It is important to determine the range in genetic diversity for heat tolerance in tomatoes. Heat stress experiments under field conditions offer breeders information to identify the potentially heat tolerant germplasm.

AB  - Determination of antioxidant/capacity in the dietary, food, drugs, and biological samples is an interesting approach for testing the safety of these compounds and for drug development. Investigating the google searching engines for the words (measurement + antioxidant + capacity) yielded more than 20 million results, which makes it very difficult to follow. Therefore, collecting the common methods to measure the antioxidant activity/capacity in the food products and biological samples will reduce the burden for both the students and researchers. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that a plant-based diet with a high intake of dietary sources such as vegetables, fruits, and other nutrient-rich plant foods may decrease the effect of oxidative stress-related diseases. In this review article, we have provided the most recent advances in the most common in vitro methods used for evaluating the antioxidant potential of numerous food products, plant extracts, and biological fluids. We have also provided detailed procedures on how to perform them and analyze the results. This review article shall be a comprehensive reference for all tech-niques used in this area.

TI  - Human moral decision-making through the lens of Parkinson's disease
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia (BG) and thalamocortical circuitry. While defective motor control has long been considered the defining symptom of PD, mounting evidence indicates that the BG are fundamentally important for a multitude of cognitive, emotional, and motivational processes in addition to motor function. Here, we review alterations in moral decision-making in people with PD, specifically in the context of deceptive behavior. We report that PD patients exhibit two opposite behavioral patterns: hyper- and hypo-honesty. The hyper-honest subgroup engages in deception less often than matched controls, even when lying is associated with a monetary payoff. This behavioral pattern seems to be linked to dopaminergic hypo-activity, implying enhanced harm avoidance, risk aversion, non-impulsivity, and reduced reward sensitivity. On the contrary, the hypo-honest subgroup-often characterized by the additional diagnosis of impulse control disorders (ICDs) and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS)-deceives more often than both PD patients without ICDs/DDS and controls. This behavioral pattern appears to be associated with dopaminergic hyperactivity, which underpins enhanced novelty-seeking, risk-proneness, impulsivity, and reward sensitivity. We posit that these two complementary behavioral patterns might be related to dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system, leading to reduced or enhanced motivation to deceive. Only a few studies have directly investigated moral decision-making in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders affecting the BG, and further research on the causal role of subcortical structures in shaping moral behavior is needed.

AB  - North Africa coastline extends on 8955 km from Mauritania to Egypt. These areas continue to experience population and economic growth. North Africa coastal aquifers were exposed to an increase in groundwater salinity and seawater intrusion, which may contribute to economic crisis as a result of freshwater resources crisis. This work aims to explore the status and a holistic comprehending review of saltwater intrusion extent in the region and future challenges. Results on seawater intrusion in North Africa, from published papers and grey literature, show a several efforts have been made in understanding this phenomenon and developing management strategies in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania. The most method used is geochemical data and statistical analysis. Some studies linked geochemical data with geophysical techniques, geographical information system (GIS), and GALDIT index. Seawater intrusion varies from one country to another according to the aquifer hydrogeological settings, abstraction rates and aquifer morphology, climate change, urban expansion, and economic development. North Africa countries, such as Libya and Mauritania, need, for instance, more expertise and experience on the part of local researchers. The challenge of inadequate data and a need for a more robust data inventory was stressed. This paper recommends developing and building scientific capabilities in regional and international partnerships, and adopting rational water governance for sustainable development.

KW  - Turkey
AB  - Objective: Designated Acts for issues related to mental health are in force in many countries throughout the world. A mental health act is also expected to be approved in Turkey soon. Under the leadership of the Psychiatric Association of Turkey, non-governmental organizations operating in the field of mental health has contributed to the emergence of a comprehensive draft. The current draft, after extensive discussion and reiterations for almost a decade, was brought to a state close to its final form and accepted as a draft bill, ready to be legislated in the Turkish Grand National Assembly. This review will discuss the potential impact of the law in matters involving Forensic Psychiatry, and present our recommendations.
   Method: Current draft, which has not yet been finalized, was compared to similar statutes in Massachusetts, USA, and potential benefits and pitfalls were discussed in light of experience with these laws in this jurisdiction.
   Results: The draft introduces several new concepts and practices which have never existed in Turkey before. It also attempts to organize some of the existing de facto clinical practices in a uniform manner. As a whole, it appears to be in compliance with human rights and related international treaties. However, it is likely that some of the sections might have compliance issues in daily practice.
   Conclusion: In this review, we aimed to draw attention to a number of issues, based on our experience in Massachusetts, USA, where similar laws have been in force for a very long time. Rather than literally comparing the statutes in both jurisdictions, we attempted to emphasize positive aspects as well as likely problems that we might encounter should Turkish draft be legislated in the present form.

KW  - human pathology
AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, among which are bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor as well as mental symptoms such as dementia. The underlying cause of Parkinson disease is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. It has been challenging to develop an efficient animal model to accurately represent the complex phenotypes found with PD. However, it has become possible to recapitulate the myriad of phenotypes underlying the PD pathology by using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. Patient-specific iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons are available and present an opportunity to study many aspects of the PD phenotypes in a dish. In this review, we report the available data on iPSC-derived neurons derived from PD patients with identified gene mutations. Specifically, we will report on the key phenotypes of the generated iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients with different genetic background. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship these cellular phenotypes have to PD pathology and future challenges and prospects for iPSC modelling and understanding of the pathogenesis of PD.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Defective insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is key for the development of type 2 diabetes but the precise mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Metallothioneins are metal binding proteins whose precise biological roles have not been fully characterized. Available evidence indicated that Metallothioneins are protective cellular effectors involved in heavy metal detoxification, metal ion homeostasis and antioxidant defense. This concept has however been challenged by emerging evidence in different medical research fields revealing novel negative roles of Metallothioneins, including in the context of diabetes. In this review, we gather and analyze the available knowledge regarding the complex roles of Metallothioneins in pancreatic beta cell biology and insulin secretion. We comprehensively analyze the evidence showing positive effects of Metallothioneins on beta cell function and survival as well as the emerging evidence revealing negative effects and discuss the possible underlying mechanisms. We expose in parallel findings from other medical research fields and underscore unsettled questions. Then, we propose some future research directions to improve knowledge in the field.
   Metallothioneins (MTs) are low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins whose precise biological roles have not been fully characterized. Existing evidence implicated MTs in heavy metal detoxification, metal ion homeostasis and antioxidant defense. MTs were thus categorized as protective effectors that contribute to cellular homeostasis and survival. This view has, however, been challenged by emerging evidence in different medical fields revealing novel pathophysiological roles of MTs, including inflammatory bowel disease, neurodegenerative disorders, carcinogenesis and diabetes. In the present focused review, we discuss the evidence for the role of MTs in pancreatic beta-cell biology and insulin secretion. We highlight the pattern of specific isoforms of MT gene expression in rodents and human beta-cells. We then discuss the mechanisms involved in the regulation of MTs in islets under physiological and pathological conditions, particularly type 2 diabetes, and analyze the evidence revealing adaptive and negative roles of MTs in beta-cells and the potential mechanisms involved. Finally, we underscore the unsettled questions in the field and propose some future research directions.

AB  - Chronically disabling health impairments affect an increasing number of people worldwide. In close relationships, disability is an interpersonal experience. Psychological distress is thus common in patients as well as their spouses. Dyadic coping can alleviate stress and promote adjustment in couples who face disabling health impairments. Much research has focused on dyadic coping with cancer. However, other health problems such as physical and sensory impairments are also common and may strongly impact couple relationships. In order to promote couples' optimal adjustment to impaired health, the identification of disability-related relationship challenges is required. Furthermore, ways in which dyadic coping with these challenges may benefit couples could inform researchers and practitioners how to support couples in coping with health impairments. Accordingly, the aims of this study were to systematically review dyadic challenges and dyadic coping when one partner has a chronically disabling physical or sensory impairment. Out of 873 articles identified through database searches, 36 studies met inclusion criteria. The disability-related dyadic challenges identified in the review were changed roles and responsibilities within the couple, altered communication, compromised sexual intimacy, and reduced social participation. These challenges were reported to burden both partners and the couple relationship. Dyadic adjustment benefitted from a we-perspective, i.e., when couples viewed the disability as a shared challenge and engaged in conjoint dyadic coping. The results suggest that patient/care recipient and partner/caregiver roles should be de-emphasized and that disability should be recognized as an interpersonal experience.

AB  - Background: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common form of primary headache.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to document and summarize the advances in the understanding of TTH in terms of pathogenesis and management.
   Material and Methods: We reviewed the available literature on the pathogenesis and management of TTH by searches of PubMed between 1969 and October 2020, and references from relevant articles. The search terms "tension-type headache", "episodic tension-type headache", chronic tension-type headache, "pathophysiology", and "treatment" were used.
   Results: TTH occurs in two forms: episodic TTH (ETTH) and chronic TTH (CTTH). Unlike chronic migraine, CTTH has been less thoroughly studied and is a more difficult headache to treat. Frequent ETTH and CTTH are associated with significant disability. The pathogenesis of TTH is multifactorial and varies between the subtypes. Peripheral mechanism (myofascial nociception) and environmental factors are possibly more important in ETTH, whereas genetic and central factors (sensitization and inadequate endogenous pain control) may play a significant role in the chronic variety. The treatment of TTH consists of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches. Simple analgesics like NSAIDs are the mainstays for acute management of ETTH. CTTH requires a multimodal approach. Preventive drugs like amitriptyline or mirtazapine and non-pharmacologic measures like relaxation and stress management techniques and physical therapies are often combined. Despite these measures, the outcome remains unsatisfactory in many patients.
   Conclusion: There is clearly an urgent need to understand the pathophysiology and improve the management of TTH patients, especially the chronic form.

AB  - Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a perception that is not objectively measured in screening tests. Although many tools are available for evaluating SCD, no single gold standard is available for classifying individuals as presenting SCD, in the Portuguese-speaking population. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature for tools used to evaluate SCD in the Portuguese-speaking population. Methods: Four databases (Web of Science, SciELO, LILACS and MEDLINE) were primarily utilized in this study (Phase 1). Subsequently, we conducted a manual search of the literature (Phase 2). We then retrieved tools for critical evaluation (Phase 3). Studies that matched the inclusion criteria were analyzed. We summarized the features of each tool in terms of the number of questions, scoring system, benefits and deficiencies, translation and validity. Results: A total of 30 studies utilizing four questionnaires and seven different single questions were found. The tools retrieved were the Memory Assessment Questionnaire (MAC-Q; 12/30 studies), single-question methods (7/30 studies), Subjective Memory Complaint Scale (SMC scale; 5/30 studies), Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ; 3/30 studies) and Memory Complaint Scale (MCS; 3/30 studies). Only two were formally translated and validated for the Portuguese speaking population (PRMQ and MCS). Conclusions: In summary, SCD is still underinvestigated in Portuguese-speaking countries. The MAC-Q was the most commonly used tool in Portuguese, despite its lack of formal translation and validation for the Portuguese-speaking population. Further studies are required in order to develop and validate a screening tool that includes questions for detecting SCD-plus features and affective symptoms, so as to improve its predictive value.

This study sought to investigate the factors associated with the following adolescent risk behaviors: i) aggressiveness and violence, ii) tobacco, alcohol, and illicit substance use, iii) depressive behavior and self-harm (including suicidal ideation and attempts), iv) sexual risk behavior, and v) multiple risk behavior.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify longitudinal studies that examined factors associated with adolescent risk behaviors. The PubMed, PsycINFO, and LILACS databases were searched.
   Results: Of the 249 included studies, 23% reported distal risk factors, while the remaining reported proximal risk factors. Risk factors were related to sociodemographic characteristics (neighborhood, school, and peers), family patterns, and the presence of other adolescent risk behaviors.
   Conclusion: Distal and proximal factors in adolescent risk behavior that are not exclusively socioeconomic, familial, environmental, or social should be explored more thoroughly.

AB  - Background and Objective: Experiencing psychosis can be associated with changes in how people see themselves as individuals and in relation to others (ie, changes in their identity). However, identity changes receive little attention in treatment, possibly due to a lack of clarity or consensus around what identity change means in people with psychosis. We aimed to create a conceptual framework synthesizing how identity changes are understood in the psychosis literature. Methods: Electronic databases were searched up to April 2020. Studies about identity changes among people with psychotic disorders were analyzed using narrative synthesis by a collaborative review team, including researchers from different disciplines, clinicians, and people who have experienced psychosis. Results: Of 10 389 studies screened, 59 were eligible. Identity changes are understood in 5 ways as (1) characteristics of psychosis, (2) consequences of altered cognitive functioning, (3) consequences of internalized stigma, (4) consequences of lost roles and relationships, and (5) reflections of personal growth. These 5 understandings are not mutually exclusive. Across a heterogeneous literature, identity changes were mostly framed in terms of loss. Conclusions: Our conceptual framework, comprising 5 understandings, highlights the complexity of studying identity changes and suggests important implications for practice and research. For clinicians, this framework can inform new therapeutic approaches where the experience and impact of identity changes are acknowledged and addressed as part of treatment. For researchers, the conceptual framework offers a way of locating their understandings of identity changes when undertaking research in this area.

TI  - Organisational Commitment in Healthcare Systems: A Bibliometric Analysis
KW  - organisational commitment

KW  - SciMAT
AB  - Business organisations are subject to high pressure to ensure their sustainability and competitiveness. In the case of healthcare institutions, moreover, there are unique characteristics where human resource management is of vital importance. The workforce in these institutions is at a critical moment where the shortages of qualified staff, burnout, or job dissatisfaction represent some of the detrimental aspects for the performance of the organisation, and more importantly, they diminish the quality of patient care. The promotion of organisational commitment is positioned as one of the tools that organisations have to face this problem. This paper aims to increase knowledge about research trends that analyse organisational commitment in healthcare institutions. To this end, using bibliometric techniques, a sample of 448 publications on this subject from journals indexed in Web of Science between 1992 and 2020 is analysed. The results obtained suggest a growing interest in this subject and a visible concern for the management of human resources in these institutions. Research has focussed mainly on organisational factors related to nursing staff. The most analysed topics have been job satisfaction, the implications of stress and high turnover, burnout syndrome, and the possibility of leaving the job. On the other hand, issues emerged such as empowerment in the workplace and others related to organisational management such as quality of service or performance. Finally, there is a lack of research that deals more deeply with other groups working in health centres, such as doctors or administrative staff. There is also a need for further development in the analysis of the implications of the ideological psychological contract in relation to normative organisational commitment in the field of healthcare organisations. The contribution of this work focusses on expanding knowledge about commitment in healthcare organisations and creating points of support for future research as well as helping healthcare managers make decisions in HR management.

AB  - Background: Different scales have attempted to assess various aspects of family dynamics and structures. Good family function seems to allow for better prognoses for basic diseases and appears to be a predictor of depression. The aim of this study was to determine the association between family functionality and depression.
   Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis including cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies using validated instruments such as the Family APGAR (Adaptability, Partnership, Growth, Affection, and Resolve) and Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale III. A search strategy was designed for the MEDLINE, Embase, Central, and LILACS databases along with data saturation through a search of unpublished literature from the onset of the databases to the present. The categorical variables are expressed in terms of odds ratios (OR), and the statistical analysis was carried out using Review Manager ver. 5.31 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) using forest plots with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed-effect model was used according to the expected heterogeneity, expressed in terms of I-2. The risk of bias was evaluated using the MINORS (methodological index for non-randomized studies) tool.
   Results: A total of 1,519 studies were found, of which 10 were selected for the qualitative synthesis and four were chosen for the meta-analysis. The result for the association between family dysfunction and depression yielded an OR (95% CI) of 3.72 (2.70 to 5.12) and I-2 of 24%.
   Conclusion: Family dysfunction and depression are strongly associated.

AB  - Background To investigate and address the evidence gap on the effectiveness of co-creation/production in international health research.
   Methods An initial systematic search of previous reviews published by 22 July 2017 in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. We extracted reported aims, elements and outcomes of co-creation/production from 50 reviews; however, reviews rarely tested effectiveness against intended outcomes. We therefore checked the reference lists in 13 included systematic reviews that cited quantitative studies involving the public/patients in the design and/or implementation of research projects to conduct meta-analyses on their effectiveness using standardized mean difference (SMD).
   Results Twenty-six primary studies were included, showing moderate positive effects for community functions (SMD = 0.56, 95%CI = 0.29-0.84, n = 11) and small positive effects for physical health (SMD = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.07-0.42, n = 9), health-promoting behaviour (SMD = 0.14, 95%CI = 0.03-0.26, n = 11), self-efficacy (SMD = 0.34, 95%CI = 0.01-0.67, n = 3) and health service access/receipt (SMD = 0.36, 95%CI = 0.21-0.52, n = 12). Non-academic stakeholders that co-created more than one research stage showed significantly favourable mental health outcomes. However, co-creation was rarely extended to later stages (evaluation/dissemination), with few studies specifically with ethnic minority groups.
   Conclusions The co-creation of research may improve several health-related outcomes and public health more broadly, but research is lacking on its longer term effects.

AB  - Climate change can have detrimental effects on child health and wellbeing. Despite the imperative for a fuller understanding of how climate change affects child health and wellbeing, a systematic approach and focus solely on children (aged <18 years) has been lacking. In this Scoping Review, we did a literature search on the impacts of climate change on child health from January, 2000, to June, 2019. The included studies explicitly linked an alteration of an exposure to a risk factor for child health to climate change or climate variability. In total, 2970 original articles, reviews, and other documents were identified, of which 371 were analysed. Employing an expanded framework, our analysis showed that the effects of climate change on child health act through direct and indirect pathways, with implications for determinants of child health as well as morbidity and mortality from a range of diseases. This understanding can be further enhanced by using a broader range of research methods, studying overlooked populations and geographical regions, investigating the costs and benefits of mitigation and adaptation for child health, and considering the position of climate change and child health within the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Present and future generations of children bear and will continue to bear an unacceptably high disease burden from climate change.

AB  - Poor management of hazardous waste can lead to environmental pollution, injuries, and adverse health risks. Children's exposure to hazardous waste may cause serious acute and chronic health problems due to their higher vulnerability to the toxic effects of chemicals. This study examines an incident of illegal chemical dumping in Pasir Gudang, Malaysia and its potential health impacts on children. The study introduced a risk assessment of possible health-related effects due to chemical contamination based on a real case scenario where quantification of the contamination was not feasible. A literature review and spatial analysis were used as research methods. On 6th March 2019, tons of hazardous waste were illegally disposed into Kim Kim River, Pasir Gudang, Malaysia. They were identified as benzene, acrolein, acrylonitrile, hydrogen chloride, methane, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, and d-limonene. As a result, 975 students in the vicinity developed signs and symptoms of respiratory disease due to the chemical poisoning. The findings of this study indicate that more effective policies and preventive actions are urgently needed to protect human health, especially children from improper hazardous waste management.

AB  - Adolescence, a period of physical, social, cognitive and emotional development, represents a target population for sexual health promotion and education when it comes to achieving the 2030 Agenda goals for sustainable and equitable societies. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of what is known about the dissemination and effectiveness of sex education programs and thereby to inform better public policy making in this area. Methodology: We carried out a systematic review based on international scientific literature, in which only peer-reviewed papers were included. To identify reviews, we carried out an electronic search of the Cochrane Database Reviews, ERIC, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, Scopus and PsycINFO. This paper provides a narrative review of reviews of the literature from 2015 to 2020. Results: 20 reviews met the inclusion criteria (10 in school settings, 9 using digital platforms and 1 blended learning program): they focused mainly on reducing risk behaviors (e.g., VIH/STIs and unwanted pregnancies), whilst obviating themes such as desire and pleasure, which were not included in outcome evaluations. The reviews with the lowest risk of bias are those carried out in school settings and are the ones that most question the effectiveness of sex education programs. Whilst the reviews of digital platforms and blended learning show greater effectiveness in terms of promoting sexual and reproductive health in adolescents (ASRH), they nevertheless also include greater risks of bias. Conclusion: A more rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of sexual education programs is necessary, especially regarding the opportunities offered by new technologies, which may lead to more cost-effective interventions than with in-person programs. Moreover, blended learning programs offer a promising way forward, as they combine the best of face-to-face and digital interventions, and may provide an excellent tool in the new context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Chronic pain is experienced by the vast majority of patients living with Parkinson's disease. The degeneration of dopaminergic neuron acts as the essential mechanism of Parkinson's disease in the midbrain dopaminergic pathway. The impairment of dopaminergic neurons leads to dysfunctions of the nociceptive system. Key cortical areas, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insular cortex (IC) that receive the dopaminergic projections are involved in pain transmission. Dopamine changes synaptic transmission via several pathway, for example the D2-adenly cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and D1-G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2)-fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) pathway. The management of Parkinson's disease-related pain implicates maintenance of stable level of dopaminergic drugs and analgesics, however a more selective drug targeting at key molecules in Parkinson's disease-related pain remains to be investigated.

KW  - Trauma- and stress-related disorders
AB  - Background: The diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) was proposed several decades ago by scientist-practitioners, almost parallel to the first description of the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the previous International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10) issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), this symptom constellation was termed 'enduring personality change after catastrophic experience'. This diagnosis has not been clinically influential, nor has it been subjected to much research. Thus, in a multi-stage process of ICD-11 development, the diagnosis of CPTSD was developed.
   Methods: This paper provides a review of the historical lines of development that led to the CPTSD diagnosis, as well as the results since the ICD-11 publication in 2018.
   Results: The CPTSD diagnosis comprises the core symptoms of the - newly, narrowly defined - PTSD diagnosis, the three symptom groups of affective, relationship, and self-concept changes. The diagnosis is clinically easy to use in accordance with the WHO development goals for the ICD-11 and has shown good psychodiagnostic properties in various studies, including good discrimination from personality disorder with borderline pattern.
   Conclusion: The scholarly use of the new diagnosis has resulted in an increasing number of published studies on this topic in the diagnostic and therapeutic fields.

AB  - Purpose of review Over 70 million people worldwide, including those with neurodegenerative disease (NDD), have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to date. We review outcomes in patients with NDD and COVID-19 and discuss the hypothesis that due to putative commonalities of neuropathogenesis, COVID-19 may unmask or trigger NDD in vulnerable individuals. Recent findings Based on a systematic review of published literature, patients with NDD, including dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) make up a significant portion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Such patients are likely to present with altered mental status or worsening of their preexisting neurological symptoms. Patients with NDD and poor outcomes often have high-risk comorbid conditions, including advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart/lung disease. Patients with dementia including Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death, whereas those with preexisting Parkinson's disease are not. MS patients have good outcomes and disease modifying therapies do not increase the risk for severe disease. Viral infections and attendant neuroinflammation have been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and MS, suggesting that COVID-19 may have the potential to incite or accelerate neurodegeneration. Since patients with Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death in the setting of COVID-19, additional precautions and protective measures should be put in place to prevent infections and optimize management of comorbidities in this vulnerable population. Further studies are needed to determine whether COVID-19 may lead to an increased risk of developing NDD in susceptible individuals.

Recent Findings Following its identification and characterization, CHR services have successfully been developed in North America, Europe, Australia and elsewhere. As reflected in guidelines, these services and their orientation largely emerged as an outgrowth of the framework pioneered by early intervention services for first-episode psychosis. We critically discuss what is known so far about the subjective experience of the CHR syndrome, the meaning of this "unofficial" diagnosis as well as what is known and unknown about the service-related needs. While a range of outstanding questions remain in the field, there is a particular need for patient-oriented work and to investigate the service-related needs of young people at CHR.

AB  - Childhood overweight and obesity is a worldwide public health issue. Our objective was to describe planned, ongoing and completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed for the prevention of obesity in early childhood. Two databases (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched to identify RCTs with the primary aim of preventing childhood obesity and at least one outcome related to child weight. Interventions needed to start in the first two years of childhood or earlier, continue for at least 6 months postnatally, include a component related to lifestyle or behaviours, and have a follow up time of at least 2 years. We identified 29 unique RCTs, implemented since 2008, with most being undertaken in high income countries. Interventions ranged from advice on diet, activity, sleep, emotion regulation, and parenting education through to individual home visits, clinic-based consultations, or group education sessions. Eleven trials published data on child weight-related outcomes to date, though most were not sufficiently powered to detect significant effects. Many trials detected improvements in practices such as breastfeeding, screen time, and physical activity in the intervention groups compared to the control groups. Further follow-up of ongoing trials is needed to assess longer-term effects.

KW  - occupational health

KW  - informal economy

KW  - occupational injuries
KW  - depression
AB  - Background: There are approximately two billion workers in the informal economy globally. Compared to workers in the formal economy, these workers are often marginalised with minimal or no benefits from occupational health and safety regulations, labour laws, social protection and/or health care. Thus, informal economy workers may have higher occupational health risks compared to their formal counterparts. Our objective was to systematically review and meta-analyse evidence on relative differences (or inequalities) in health services use and health outcomes among informal economy workers, compared with formal economy workers. Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE in March 2020 for studies published in 1999-2020. The eligible population was informal economy workers. The comparator was formal economy workers. The eligible outcomes were general and occupational health services use, fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, HIV, tuberculosis, musculoskeletal disorders, depression, noise-induced hearing loss and respiratory infections. Two authors independently screened records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias with RoB-SPEO, and assessed quality of evidence with GRADE. Inverse variance meta-analyses were conducted with random effects. Results: Twelve studies with 1,637,297 participants from seven countries in four WHO regions (Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific) were included. Compared with formal economy workers, informal economy workers were found to be less likely to use any health services (odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.85-0.94, four studies, 195,667 participants, I-2 89%, low quality of evidence) and more likely to have depression (odds ratio 5.02, 95% confidence interval 2.72-9.27, three studies, 26,260 participants, I-2 87%, low quality of evidence). We are very uncertain about the other outcomes (very-low quality of evidence). Conclusion: Informal economy workers may be less likely than formal economy workers to use any health services and more likely to have depression. The evidence is uncertain for relative differences in the other eligible outcomes. Further research is warranted to strengthen the current body of evidence and needed to improve population health and reduce health inequalities among workers.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the normal course of life, with measures to reduce the virus spread impacting motherhood expectations and, in particular, breastfeeding practices. This study aimed to review evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding plans and how these relate to women's psychological outcomes. Searches were conducted on PubMed and Web of Science for studies in English, Spanish, and Portuguese between January 2020 and January 2021. All study designs and pre-prints were considered. Twelve studies were included. Reports suggest that COVID-19 impacts differently on breastfeeding plans, which in turn leads to distinctive mental health outcomes. Positive breastfeeding experiences have been observed when mothers perceive that they have more time for motherhood, which may be associated with better mental health outcomes. Negative breastfeeding experiences have been observed when mothers are separated from their newborns, when mothers struggle with breastfeeding, or when mothers perceive decreased family and professional support, which seems to be associated with worse mental health outcomes. These preliminary results highlight the need for further research into the association between COVID-19, breastfeeding expectations, and maternal mental health. Filling this gap will foster the development of guidelines and interventions to better support mothers experiencing the obstacles of COVID-19 pandemic.

   The current literature discloses discrepant findings regarding the rates of co-occurring obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In addition, it is not clear which characteristics are related specifically to OCD with co-occurring OCPD. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the studies of the prevalence of OCPD in patients with OCD. We also investigated potential moderators of the prevalence, including OCD severity, age of onset of OCD, sex, current age, methodological quality, and publication date of the studies. Electronic databases and gray literature were searched by two independent reviewers. A PRISMA systematic review with a random-effect meta-analysis was conducted. Thirty-four studies were included. A significant mean effect size of 0.25 without publication bias indicated that OCPD was present in 25% of patients with OCD, suggesting that the two conditions are distinct clinical entities. This prevalence was higher than the rates found in the literature for any other personality disorders among OCD patients. OCPD that occurs in the context of OCD was more likely to be present in males and to be characterized by a later age of onset of OCD, older age at assessment, and less severe OCD symptoms. Clinicians should consider these findings when assessing and planning treatment of OCD with co-occurring OCPD.

AB  - Health care workers are exposed to numerous workplace hazards. The implementation of safety measures in high-income countries has largely mitigated these risks. However, in many low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), resources to institute safety measures are lacking, increasing the risk of occupational exposures to these hazards. The aim of this scoping review is to map and synthesize the available research on occupational hazards among health care workers in LMICs, identify research gaps and inform policy. Searches for relevant articles were conducted in five electronic databases using a broad range of search terms. The inclusion criteria were: quantitative observational or experimental studies which examined exposure to one or more occupational hazards among health care workers in a LMCI; and the article was published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. A total of 99 studies met the inclusion criteria, and data were extracted from these studies. Large proportions of health care workers in LMICs were exposed to biological hazards (bloodborne pathogens, tuberculosis), psychosocial hazards (workplace violence, burnout, job dissatisfaction), ergonomic hazards (musculoskeletal complaints), and chemical hazards (exposure to latex and antineoplastic drugs). The implementation of risk reduction strategies was suboptimal. The majority of the literature was on biological hazards (48%), and research on other hazards was limited in comparison. Occupational safety needs to become a priority public health issue to protect health care workers in LMICs. More research is needed to understand the magnitude of the problem in these countries.

AB  - Purpose: Refugees and asylum seekers have unique and complex needs related to their experiences of forced displacement and resettlement. Cultural competence is widely recognized as important for the provision of effective and equitable services for refugee populations. However, the delivery of culturally appropriate services-including health care and social services-is often complicated by unclear definitions and operationalization of cultural competence. Further, the unique needs and priorities of people from refugee backgrounds are under-addressed in the cultural competence literature. This scoping review seeks to synthesize the peer-reviewed literature examining cultural competence in refugee service settings.
   Methods: A systematic search of four databases (EBSCO, Proquest, Scopus and Google Scholar) identified 26 relevant peer-reviewed studies for analysis.
   Results: A range of approaches to cultural competence were identified at the level of individual providers and organizations.
   Conclusion: We identified a need for greater refugee participation and perspectives in the practice of cultural competence, increased conceptual clarity and greater recognition of structural barriers. We call for further rigorous research that critically examines the concept of cultural competence and its meaning and relevance to refugee populations.

AB  - Kazakhstan owns one of the largest global oil reserves (approximately 3%). This paper aims at investigating the challenges and potentials for production from weakly consolidated and unconsolidated oil sandstone reserves in Kazakhstan.
   We used the published information in the literature, especially those including comparative studies between Kazakhstan and North America. Weakly consolidated and unconsolidated oil reserves in Kazakhstan were studied in terms of the depth, pay-zone thickness, viscosity, particle-size distribution (PSD), clay content, porosity, permeability, gas cap, bottomwater, mineralogy, solution gas, oil saturation, and homogeneity of the pay zone. The previous and current experiences in developing these reserves were outlined. The stress condition was also discussed. Furthermore, the geological condition, including the existing structures, layers, and formations, were addressed for different reserves.
   Weakly consolidated heavy-oil reserves in shallow depths (less than 500-m true vertical depth) with oil viscosity of approximately 500 cp and thin pay zones (less than 10 m) have been successfully produced using cold methods; however, thicker zones could be produced using thermal options. Sand management is the main challenge in cold operations, while sand control is the main challenge in thermal operations. Tectonic history is more critical compared with the similar cases in North America. The complicated tectonic history necessitates geomechanical models to strategize the sand control, especially in cased and perforated completions. These models are usually avoided in North America because of the less-problematic conditions. Further investigation has shown that inflow-control devices (ICDs) could be used to limit the water breakthrough, because water coning is a common problem that begins and intensifies the sanding.
   This paper provides a review on challenges and potentials for sand control and sand management in heavy-oil reserves of Kazakhstan, which could be used as a guideline for service companies and operators. This paper could be also used as an initial step for further investigations regarding the sand control and sand management in Kazakhstan.

AB  - Testing for time to reorientation (TRO) after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been one of the most predictive measures for cognitive adverse effects of ECT. However, measuring TRO varies between clinical trials, and there is no standardized approach on its measurement between studies. The objective of this report is to systematically review the literature on the different ways of measuring TRO. This would be a first step to establish a consensus on a standard method for TRO. We performed a systematic literature review from 1968 to October 2019 for clinical trials with a sample size of more than 50 and published in English that describe measures of TRO. We searched both PubMed and Web of Science databases. The literature search generated 12 clinical trials, which met the inclusion criteria. Studies measured TRO using 3-, 5-, or 10-item questionnaires. Most studies measured full orientation as answering 4/5 questions. Other studies smaller than 50 required 14/14 items to be answered correctly. There was wide variation between studies on how often and when orientation questions were initiated. These factors have obvious implications to the results and interpretation of the ECT literature.There was no clear consensus on measuring TRO in a uniform fashion. Research and clinical care would benefit from a standardized approach to measuring TRO. Measuring TRO using a 4/5 method seems the most common and quickest way, whereas using a 14/14 method seems to be the most rigorous and sensitive to change in trials.

AB  - The approval of intranasal esketamine for treatment-resistant depression marks the next step in our understanding of and ability to treat treatment-resistant depression. The origin of ketamine is rooted in the search for a phencyclidine analog that could be used as a pre-surgical anesthetic with less emergence delirium. Following its inception, ketamine has been used in a variety of contexts. However, it was the seminal Berman et al., 2000 study, which published positive findings from the first human trial using subanesthetic intravenous ketamine for depression. Since then, a large body of research has investigated ketamine?s various proposed antidepressant mechanisms of action, and the role its pharmacokinetic properties and route of administration play in producing its antidepressant effects. The results of this research were the eventual approval of intranasal esketamine for treatment-resistant depression by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2019. By identifying and utilizing predictors of response, we can continue to refine our approach to treating treatment-resistant depression and optimize patient response to intranasal esketamine. In this article, we look at the history, pharmacology, landmark studies, and future implications of intranasal esketamine for treatment-resistant depression.

AB  - The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the oldest hormone systems in vertebrate phylogeny. RAS was initially related to regulation of blood pressure and sodium and water homeostasis. However, local or paracrine RAS were later identified in many tissues, including brain, and play a major role in their physiology and pathophysiology. In addition, a major component, ACE2, is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Overactivation of tissue RAS leads several oxidative stress and inflammatory processes involved in aging-related degenerative changes. In addition, a third level of RAS, the intracellular or intracrine RAS (iRAS), with still unclear functions, has been observed. The possible interaction between the intracellular and extracellular RAS, and particularly the possible deleterious or beneficial effects of the iRAS activation are controversial. The dopaminergic system is particularly interesting to investigate the RAS as important functional interactions between dopamine and RAS have been observed in the brain and several peripheral tissues. Our recent observations in mitochondria and nucleus of dopaminergic neurons may clarify the role of the iRAS. This may be important for the developing of new therapeutic strategies, since the effects on both extracellular and intracellular RAS must be taken into account, and perhaps better understanding of COVID-19 cell mechanisms.

AB  - The loss of dopamine (DA)-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) underlies the core motor symptoms of the progressive movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no treatment to prevent or slow SN DA neurodegeneration exists; thus, the identification of the underlying factors contributing to the high vulnerability of these neurons represents the basis for the development of novel therapies. Disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction seem to be key players in the pathophysiology of PD. The autonomous pacemaker activity of SN DA neurons, in combination with low cytosolic Ca2+ buffering, leads to large somatodendritic fluctuations of intracellular Ca2+ levels that are linked to elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress. L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) contribute to these Ca2+ oscillations in dendrites, and LTCC inhibition was beneficial in cellular and in vivo animal models of PD. However, in a recently completed phase 3 clinical trial, the dihydropyridine (DHP) LTCC inhibitor isradipine failed to slow disease progression in early PD patients, questioning the feasibility of DHPs for PD therapy. Novel evidence also suggests that R- and T-type Ca2+ channels (RTCCs and TTCCs, respectively) represent potential PD drug targets. This short review aims to (re)evaluate the therapeutic potential of LTCC, RTCC, and TTCC inhibition in light of novel preclinical and clinical data and the feasibility of available Ca2+ channel blockers to modify PD disease progression. I also summarize their cell-specific roles for SN DA neuron function and describe how their gating properties allow activity (and thus their contribution to stressful Ca2+ oscillations) during pacemaking.

AB  - Background
   During the global COVID-19 pandemic, there has been guidance concerning adaptations that physical healthcare services can implement to aid containment, but there is relatively little guidance for how mental healthcare services should adapt service provision to better support staff and patients, and minimise contagion spread.
   Aims
   This systematic review explores service adaptations in mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic and other contagions.
   Method
   The Allied and Complementary Medicine database (AMED), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science were systematically searched for published studies from database inception to April 2020. Data were extracted focusing on changes to mental health services during contagion outbreaks. Data were analysed with thematic analysis.
   Results
   Nineteen papers were included: six correspondence/point-of-view papers, five research papers, five reflection papers, two healthcare guideline documents and one government document. Analysis highlighted four main areas for mental health services to consider during contagion outbreaks: infection control measures to minimise contagion spread, including procedural and practical solutions across different mental health settings; service delivery, including service changes, operational planning and continuity of care; staff well-being (psychological and practical support); and information and communication.
   Conclusions
   Mental health services need to consider infection control measures and implement service changes to support continuity of care, and patient and staff well-being. Services also need to ensure they are communicating important information in a clear and accessible manner with their staff and patients, regarding service delivery, contagion symptoms, government guidelines and well-being.

AB  - Recent findings and emerging trends concerning the role of affect and emotion in climate change perceptions and judgments as well as their potential as drivers of sustainable action are reviewed. The affective responses people experience toward climate change are consistently found to be among the strongest predictors of risk perceptions, mitigation behavior, adaptation behavior, policy support, and technology acceptance. As correlational results do not imply that inducing affective states will necessarily lead to the corresponding changes in a target population, research efforts now should focus on establishing the causal pathways from affect and emotion towards climate action. Communication and intervention studies show that inducing both positive and negative emotions may under certain conditions promote sustainable behavior, but the field would benefit from a stronger integration of concepts and findings from affective psychology. Explicitly considering the mechanisms by which emotions influence decisions and actions may help design more efficient affective interventions.

AB  - Health literacy is a key determinant of health in refugee and migrant populations living in in high-income countries (HICs). We conducted a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to characterize the scope, methodology, and outcomes of research on interventions aimed at improving health literacy among these vulnerable populations. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases to identify RCTs of health literacy intervenions in our target population published between 1997 and 2018. The search yielded 23 RCTs (n = 5625 participants). Study demographics, health literacy topics, interventions, and outcome measures were heterogeneous but demonstrated overall positive results. Only two studies used a common health literacy measure. Few RCTs have been conducted to investigate interventions for improving the health literacy of refugees and migrants in HICs. The heterogeniety of health literacy outcome measures used impeded a robust comparison of intervention efficacy.

AB  - Background: Maths anxiety is defined as a feeling of tension and apprehension that interferes with maths performance ability, the manipulation of numbers and the solving of mathematical problems in a wide variety of ordinary life and academic situations. Our aim was to identify the facilitators and barriers of maths anxiety in university students.
   Method: A scoping review methodology was used in this study. A search of databases including: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Scopus, PsycInfo, Medline, Education Resources Information Centre, Google Scholar and grey literature. Articles were included if they addressed the maths anxiety concept, identified barriers and facilitators of maths anxiety, had a study population comprised of university students and were in Arabic or English languages.
   Results and discussion: After duplicate removal and applying the inclusion criteria, 10 articles were included in this study. Maths anxiety is an issue that effects many disciplines across multiple countries and sectors. The following themes emerged from the included papers: gender, self-awareness, numerical ability, and learning difficulty. The pattern in which gender impacts maths anxiety differs across countries and disciplines. There was a significant positive relationship between students' maths self-efficacy and maths performance and between maths self-efficacy, drug calculation self-efficacy and drug calculation performance.
   Conclusion: Maths anxiety is an issue that effects many disciplines across multiple countries and sectors. Developing anxiety toward maths might be affected by gender; females are more prone to maths anxiety than males. Maths confidence, maths values and self-efficacy are related to self-awareness. Improving these concepts could end up with overcoming maths anxiety and improving performance.

AB  - Chemistry practitioners, particularly in educational settings, often associate building strong safety cultures with compliance or regulatory requirements around laboratory glassware, equipment, flammable and incompatible materials, signage, container labels, and safety data sheets. Other fields of science also emphasize biohazardous materials, animal handling, human subject, and ergonomics. However, little attention in the literature has gone toward describing the interpersonal interactions and behaviors affecting the physical and emotional safety and wellbeing of laboratory trainees and personnel from marginalized backgrounds. This work unifies known approaches of building strong safety cultures and principles for preventing identity cues that threaten safety within a laboratory environment. Specifically, this work uses the four principles of chemical safety RAMP model as a conceptual framework for integrating identity safety within the laboratory safety culture.

AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) has been proposed to alleviate loneliness and improve social connectedness. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MBI. This study aimed to critically evaluate and determine the effectiveness and safety of MBI in alleviating the feeling of loneliness.
   Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane CENTRAL, and AMED for publications from inception to May 2020. We included RCTs with human subjects who were enrolled in MBI with loneliness as an outcome. The quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias (ROB) tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis.
   Results: Out of 92 articles identified, eight studies involving 815 participants were included in this study. Most (7/8) trials conducted a minimum of 8 weeks of MBI. Most of the trials (5/8) used UCLA-Loneliness Scale. A pooled analysis combining three trials and compared with wait-list showed significant improvement in loneliness score reduction using the UCLA-R scale with MD of -6.33 [95% confidence interval (CI): -9.39, -3.26]. Subgroup analysis with only two Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) trials also showed similar MD of -6.05 (95% CI: -9.53, 2.58). The overall quality of evidence (GRADE) was low.
   Conclusions: Mindfulness intervention with an average length of 8-week duration significantly improved the population's loneliness level with no mental health issue. However, this evidence had a low GRADE level.

AB  - Microplastics are an emerging global environmental contaminant that are affecting multiple spheres. Despite their ubiquity in all spheres of life and ecology, little is known about the health effects of microplastics exposure to humans. This scoping review explores the existing evidence on the potential human health effects of microplastics and subsequent knowledge gaps. An electronic search of published articles in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane databases, and Google Scholar was conducted using a combination of subject headings and keywords relating to microplastics and human health effects. The initial search resulted in 17,043 published articles and grey literature documents. After a full review of published articles and their references, 129 publications were identified for further detailed review. These articles indicate that human exposure to microplastics can occur through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact due to their presence in food, water, air, and consumer products. Microplastics exposure can cause toxicity through oxidative stress, inflammatory lesions, and increased uptake or translocation. Several studies have demonstrated the potentiality of metabolic disturbances, neurotoxicity, and increased cancer risk in humans. Moreover, microplastics have been found to release their constituent compounds as well as those that are adsorbed onto their surface. Further research is needed to quantify the effects of microplastics on human health and their pathogenesis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Rates of suicide among people in prison are elevated compared with people of similar age and sex who are living in the community. Improving assessments and interventions to reduce suicide risk requires updated evidence on risk factors. We aimed to examine risk factors associated with suicide in prisoners.
   Methods We did an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for suicide among people in prison. We searched five biblographic databases for articles published between Jan 1, 2006, and Aug 13, 2020, and one database for articles published between Jan 1, 1973, and Aug 13, 2020. Eligible studies reported risk factors in individuals who died by suicide while in prison and in controls from the general prison population. Two reviewers independently extracted data for each study using a standardised form. We calculated random-effects pooled odds ratios (ORs) for the association of suicide with demographical, clinical, criminological, and institutional risk factors, and investigated heterogeneity using subgroup and meta-regression analyses. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020137979.
   Findings We identified 8041 records through our searches, and used 77 eligible studies from 27 countries, including 35 351 suicides, in the main analysis. The strongest clinical factors associated with suicide were suicidal ideation during the current period in prison (OR 15.2, 95% CI 8.5-27.0), a history of attempted suicide (OR 8.2, 4.4-15.3), and current psychiatric diagnosis (OR 6.4, 3.6-11.1). Institutional factors associated with suicide included occupation of a single cell (OR 6.8, 2.3-19.8) and having no social visits (OR 1.9, 1.5-2.4). Criminological factors included remand status (OR 3.6, 3.1-4.1), serving a life sentence (OR 2.4, 1.3-4.6), and being convicted of a violent offence, in particular homicide (OR 3.1, 2.2-4.2).
   Interpretation Several modifiable risk factors, such as psychiatric diagnosis, suicidal ideation during the current period in prison, and single-cell occupancy, are associated with suicide among people in prison. Preventive interventions should target these risk factors and include improved access to evidence-based mental health care. Understanding other factors associated with suicide might improve risk stratification and resource allocation in prison services. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The environment, directly and indirectly, affects many mosquito traits in both the larval and adult stages. The availability of food resources is one of the key factors influencing these traits, although its role in mosquito fitness and pathogen transmission remains unclear. Larvae nutritional status determines their survivorship and growth, having also an impact on adult characteristics like longevity, body size, flight capacity or vector competence. During the adult stage, mosquito diet affects their survival rate, fecundity and host-seeking behaviour. It also affects mosquito susceptibility to infection, which may determine the vectorial capacity of mosquito populations. The aim of this review is to critically revise the current knowledge on the effects that both larval and adult quantity and quality of the diet have on mosquito life history traits, identifying the critical knowledge gaps and proposing future research lines. The quantity and quality of food available through their lifetime greatly determine adult body size, longevity or biting frequency, therefore affecting their competence for pathogen transmission. In addition, natural sugar sources for adult mosquitoes, i.e., specific plants providing high metabolic energy, might affect their host-seeking and vertebrate biting behaviour. However, most of the studies are carried out under laboratory conditions, highlighting the need for studies of feeding behaviour of mosquitoes under field conditions. This kind of studies will increase our knowledge of the impact of diets on pathogen transmission, helping to develop successful control plans for vector-borne diseases.

AB  - Neurons are particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction due to high energy demand and an inability to proliferate. Therefore, dysfunctional mitochondria cause various neuropathologies. Mitochondrial damage induces maintenance pathways to repair or eliminate damaged organelles. This mitochondrial quality control (MQC) system maintains appropriate morphology, localization, and removal/replacement of mitochondria to sustain brain homeostasis and counter progression of neurological disorders. Glucocorticoid release is an essential response to stressors for adaptation; however, it often culminates in maladaptation if neurons are exposed to chronic and severe stress. Long-term exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids induces mitochondrial dysfunction via genomic and nongenomic mechanisms. Glucocorticoids induce abnormal mitochondrial morphology and dysregulate fusion and fission. Moreover, mitochondrial trafficking is arrested by glucocorticoids and dysfunctional mitochondria are subsequently accumulated around the soma. These alterations lead to energy deficiency, particularly for synaptic transmission that requires large amounts of energy. Glucocorticoids also impair mitochondrial clearance by preventing mitophagy of damaged organelle and suppress mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting in the reduced number of healthy mitochondria. Failure to maintain MQC degrades brain function and contributes to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer?s disease, Parkinson?s disease, and Huntington?s disease. However, mechanisms of glucocorticoid action on the regulation of MQC during chronic stress conditions are not well understood. The present review discusses pathways involved in the impairment of MQC and the clinical significance of high glucocorticoid blood levels for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background: A prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to trigger a global mental health crisis increasing demand for mental health emergency services. We undertook a rapid review of the impact of pandemics and epidemics on emergency department utilization for mental health (MH) and substance use (SU).
   Objective: To rapidly synthesize available data on emergency department utilization for psychiatric concerns during COVID-19.
   Methods: An information specialist searched Medline, Embase, Psycinfo, CINAHL, and Scopus on June 16, 2020 and updated the search on July 24, 2020. Our search identified 803 abstracts, 7 of which were included in the review. Six articles reported on the COVID-19 pandemic and one on the SARS epidemic.
   Results: All studies reported a decrease in overall and MH related ED utilization during the early pandemic/epidemic. Two studies found an increase in SU related visits during the same period. No data were available for mid and late stage pandemics and the definitions for MH and SU related visits were inconsistent across studies.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that COVID-19 has resulted in an initial decrease in ED visits for MH and an increase in visits for SU. Given the relative paucity of data on the subject and inconsistent analytic methods used in existing studies, there is an urgent need for investigation of pandemic-related changes in ED case-mix to inform system-level change as the pandemic continues.

TI  - COVID-19 related mental health issues: a narrative review of psychometric properties of scales and methodological concerns in scale development
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - mental health
KW  - tools
KW  - instruments
KW  - assessment
AB  - Objectives:
   The global crisis of COVID-19 and its consequential strict public health measures placed around the world have impacted mental health. New scales and tools have been developed to measure these mental health effects. This narrative review assesses the psychometric properties of these scales and tools and methodological aspects of their development.
   Methods:
   PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar were searched for articles published from 15 May 2020 to 15 August 2020. This search used three groups of terms ("tool" OR "scale" AND "mental" OR "psychological"; AND "COVID-19" OR "coronavirus"). The identified scales were further evaluated for their psychometric properties and methodological aspects of their development.
   Results:
   Though the studies developing these scales (n = 12) have demonstrated their robust psychometric properties, some methodological concerns are noteworthy. Most of the scales were validated using internet-based surveys, and detailed descriptions of the mode of administration, sampling process, response rates, and augmentation strategies were missing.
   Conclusions:
   The heterogeneous and inadequate reporting of methods adopted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the identified scales can limit their utility in clinical and research settings. We suggest developing guidelines and checklists to improve the design and testing, and result in reporting of online-administered scales to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Adult Attachment and Personal, Social, and Symptomatic Recovery From Psychosis: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
KW  - attachment
KW  - personal recovery
KW  - social recovery
KW  - symptomatic recovery
KW  - first episode of psychosis
KW  - schizophrenia
AB  - Despite growing evidence for the role of attachment in psychosis, no quantitative review has yet been published on the relationship in this population between insecure attachment and recovery in a broad sense. We therefore used meta-analytic techniques to systematically appraise studies on the relationship between attachment and symptomatic, social and personal recovery in clients with a psychotic disorder. Using the keywords attachment, psychosis, recovery and related terms, we searched six databases: Embase, Medline Epub (OVID), Psycinfo (OVID), Cochrane Central (trials), Web of Science, and Google Scholar. This yielded 28 studies assessing the associations between adult attachment and recovery outcome in populations with a psychotic disorder. The findings indicated that insecure anxious and avoidant attachment are both associated with less symptomatic recovery (positive and general symptoms), and worse social and personal recovery outcomes in individuals diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. The associations were stronger for social and personal recovery than for symptomatic recovery. Attachment style is a clinically relevant construct in relation to the development and course of psychosis and recovery from it. Greater attention to the relationship between attachment and the broad scope of recovery (symptomatic, social, and personal) will improve our understanding of the illness and efficacy of treatment for this population.

AB  - Background: Personal recovery (PR) is a subjective, multidimensional concept, and quantitative research using PR as an outcome is rapidly increasing. This systematic review is intended to support the design of interventions that contribute to PR in psychotic disorders, by providing an overview of associated factors and their weighted importance to PR: clinical factors, social factors, and socio-demographic characteristics are included, and factors related to the concept of PR (organized into CHIME dimensions).
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted from inception to March 2020. Quantitative studies that had used a validated questionnaire assessing the concept of PR were included. Mean effect sizes for the relationship between PR-scale total scores and related factors were calculated using meta-analyses. Sources of heterogeneity were examined using meta-regression tests.
   Results: Forty-six studies, that used (a total of) eight PR measures, showed that in clinical factors, affective symptoms had a medium negative association with PR-scale total scores (r = -0.44, 95%CI -0.50 to -0.37), while positive, negative and general symptoms had small negative correlations. No association was found with neuro-cognition. Social factors (support, work and housing, and functioning) showed small positive correlations. Gender and age differences had barely been researched. Large associations were found for PR-scale total scores with the CHIME dimensions hope (r = 0.56, 95%CI 0.48-0.63), meaning in life (r = 0.48, 95%CI 0.38-0.58) and empowerment (r = 0.53, 95%CI 0.42-0.63); while medium associations were found with connectedness (r = 0.34, 95%CI 0.43-0.65) and identity (r = 0.43, 95%CI 0.35-0.50). Levels of heterogeneity were high, sources included: the variety of PR measures, variations in sample characteristics, publication bias, variations in outcome measures, and cultural differences.
   Discussion: Most interventions in mental healthcare aim to reduce symptoms and improve functioning. With regard to stimulating PR, these interventions may benefit from also focusing on enhancing hope, empowerment, and meaning in life. The strength of these findings is limited by the challenges of comparing separate CHIME dimensions with questionnaires assessing the concept of PR, and by the high levels of heterogeneity observed. Future research should focus on the interaction between elements of PR and clinical and social factors over time.

AB  - Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid of potential interest for the treatment of substance use disorders. Our aim was to review the outcome measures, surrogate endpoints, and biomarkers in published and ongoing randomized clinical trials.
   Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed, Web of Science, PMC, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CENTRAL Cochrane Library, "," "clinicaltrialsregister.eu," and "anzctr.org.au" for published and ongoing studies. Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the use of CBD alone or in association with other cannabinoids, in all substance use disorders. The included studies were analyzed in detail and their qualities assessed by a standardized tool (CONSORT 2010). A short description of excluded studies, consisting in controlled short-term or single administration in non-treatment-seeking drug users, is provided.
   Findings: The screening retrieved 207 published studies, including only 3 RCTs in cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, 12 excluded studies in cannabis, tobacco, and opioid use disorders are described.
   Interpretation: Primary outcomes were validated withdrawal symptoms scales and drug use reduction in the three RCTs. In the short-term or crossover studies, the outcome measures were visual analog scales for subjective states; self-rated scales for withdrawal, craving, anxiety, or psychotomimetic symptoms; and laboratory tasks of drug-induced craving, effort expenditure, attentional bias for substance, impulsivity, or anxiety to serve as surrogate endpoints for treatment efficacy. Of note, ongoing studies are now adding peripheral biomarkers of the endocannabinoid system status to predict treatment response.
   Conclusion: The outcome measures and biomarkers assessed in the ongoing CBD trials for substance use disorders are improving.

AB  - Due to its excellent physical and chemical properties and low price, plastic has replaced part of the use of stone, wood and metal. The inability to degrade and improper handling have caused plastic pollution to become one of the most serious environmental problems in the world today. Plastic fragments undergo ultraviolet radiation, natural weathering, and biodegradation to form microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs)1. The current re-search on MPs mainly focuses on transportation, bioaccumulation and toxicity. However, existing reviews treat NPs and MPs as a whole to discuss toxic damage, and ignore their differences in toxicity. In this review, we pro-vided the latest research information on the differences in toxicity between MPs and NPs in the digestive system, reproductive system and nervous system, and explored the possible reasons for differences in toxicity for the first time. Finally, it is recommended to consider the influence of microplastics components on the differences in tox-icity, as most of the researches now focuses on a few types of microplastics. And it is necessary to study the unique toxicity mechanism of MPs/NPs in bioaccumulation and pathway activation from the differences in phys-ical properties. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background
   Antidepressant medication and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are both recommended interventions in depression treatment guidelines based on literature reviews and meta-analyses. However, 'conventional' meta-analyses comparing their efficacy are limited by their reliance on reported study-level information and a narrow focus on depression outcome measures assessed at treatment completion. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis, considered the gold standard in evidence synthesis, can improve the quality of the analyses when compared with conventional meta-analysis.
   Aims
   We describe the protocol for a systematic review and IPD meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of antidepressants and IPT for adult acute-phase depression across a range of outcome measures, including depressive symptom severity as well as functioning and well-being, at both post-treatment and follow-up (PROSPERO: CRD42020219891).
   Method
   We will conduct a systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and the Cochrane Library to identify randomised clinical trials comparing antidepressants and IPT in the acute-phase treatment of adults with depression. We will invite the authors of these studies to share the participant-level data of their trials. One-stage IPD meta-analyses will be conducted using mixed-effects models to assess treatment effects at post-treatment and follow-up for all outcome measures that are assessed in at least two studies.
   Conclusions
   This will be the first IPD meta-analysis examining antidepressants versus IPT efficacy. This study has the potential to enhance our knowledge of depression treatment by comparing the short- and long-term effects of two widely used interventions across a range of outcome measures using state-of-the-art statistical techniques.

AB  - Purpose: Descriptive psychopathology (DP, sometimes called psychopathology or phenomenology) is the language of psychiatry and is dedicated to the description of mental symptoms. Due to its importance, there is an ongoing case to put it back at the heart of psychiatry and its training. This study seeks to examine the literature on how to train psychiatry residents in DP, including reported educational interventions and educational methods. Method: The authors conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA and BEME guidelines to identify literature on how to train psychiatry residents in DP. In May 2019, they searched in Embase, ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science; of 7,199 initial results, 26 sources were finally included for analysis. The assessment tools were the CRAAP test, Kirkpatrick's 4 levels, and (when applicable) the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). Results: The mean CRAAP score was 38.885 of a possible 50 (SD 0.983; range: 36.859-40.910). Fourteen sources (53.8%) had some kind of training evaluation: Kirkpatrick's level 1 was present in nearly all (13) and was the highest in half of them (7). Regarding the educational interventions, the mean MERSQI score was 10.592 of a possible 18 (SD 2.371; range 9.085-12.098). Lectures were the most widely reported educational method (5); among those in clinical settings, the live supervised interview with feedback was the most usual (4). Conclusions: Despite its core importance as the language of psychiatry, the literature about training psychiatry residents in DP is scarce and heterogeneous. General lack of training evaluation and ongoing overemphasis on Kirkpatrick's levels 1-2 at the expense of levels 3-4 are causes for concern. During the review process, the authors identified a selection of educational interventions that could serve as the basis for the design of new training efforts in both clinical and nonclinical settings. Topics for future research are also suggested, such as the role of DP in competency-based training frameworks now in vogue and a series of neglected contents. Finally, the combined use of the CRAAP test and the MERSQI may be useful for future systematic reviews in medical education.

AB  - BackgroundThe main focus of the non-pharmacological treatment of Gambling Disorder (GD) is the behaviour, cognition and motivation of the patient, addressing the psychological determinants of gambling. Although there is not a gold standard non-pharmacological treatment yet, many studies already had promising results, and the outcomes were even better when pharmacotherapies were combined with psychotherapies. This review intended to synthesise the efficacy of various available non-pharmacological therapies for GD evaluated in randomized controlled trials.MethodsA systematic search was conducted in PubMed and in Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials. Studies were included if participants had GD as their primary diagnosis and excluded if patients had other comorbidities.ResultsFrom 320 records identified, 22 studies were included in the critical appraisal. They included a total of 1694 patients, with a mean age of 42.94years, and a 62.31% of males. Seven trials revealed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy in improving significantly the outcomes. Three studies assessing cognitive therapy showed significant improvements in gambling symptoms, while one study showed improvements in gambling behaviour using exposure therapy. Combined or separate motivational interviewing and imaginal desensitization had significant results in 4 trials. Four other studies also showed efficacy for: couples therapy, node-link mapping therapy, 12-step facilitated and personalized feedback intervention. Physical exercise had promising results but did not reach significance.ConclusionThe literature included in this review showed the heterogeneity of available psychotherapies. The majority of studies supported the efficacy of the tested therapies, while some of them, due to limitations such as small sample sizes or inadequate control groups, failed to reach significance.

AB  - This paper reviews recent advances in the circulation dynamics of the Kuroshio and its interaction with shelf currents in the East China Sea (ECS). The annually averaged Kuroshio volume transport varies between 19 and 24 Sv, based on different observations, but there is no consensus on which season its volume transport peaks. The Kuroshio is intensified over the central slope of the ECS from that off the northeast of Taiwan. The total Kuroshio intrusion into the ECS shelf is estimated to be 1.3-1.4 Sv, deduced from the observed volume transport of exchange flow in the Taiwan and Tsushima Straits, based on the assumption of volume conversation over the shelf. However, the uncertainty regarding this estimation remains due to the absence of sufficient observations and understanding of the Kuroshio dynamics. The Kuroshio intrusions over the shelf off the northeast of Taiwan and southwest of Kyushu are stimulated by planetary or topographic beta-effect associated with the alongshore variations in the ECS slope topography and altered by variations in the Kuroshio intensity, shear stress, and baroclinicity. Multilayered exchanges between the Kuroshio and shelf currents were found between 100 and 200-m isobaths along the central ECS slope. The spatial variations in these exchanges are governed by cross-isobath transport by geostrophy, whereas bottom Ekman transport may play a predominant role in altering the integrated exchange flow along the slope. Although the intrusion is greatly modulated along the path of the Kuroshio in the ECS by variable slope topography, there are few observations on the spatial variations of these exchange flows. The characteristics and variations in the circulation and hydrographic properties of waters between 100 and 200-m isobaths significantly determine the general ECS circulation, about which consensus has still not been attained.

A systematic search was conducted for the period January 1994-February 2020. One hundred and twenty-two articles underwent data extraction. The majority of studies took place in Europe and North America in high-income countries. Over half of the studies used qualitative methodology. Four key components of the diagnostic experience were identified: journey to assessment, assessment process, delivery of the diagnosis and feedback session, and provision of information, resources, and support. Themes of parental emotions and parental satisfaction with the diagnostic process were also found.

AB  - Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants in the marine environment and a health concern. They are generated directly for commercial purposes or indirectly from the breakdown of larger plastics. Examining a toxicological profile for microplastics is a challenge due to their large variety of physico-chemical properties and toxicological behavior. In addition to their concentration, other parameters such as polymer type, size, shape and color are important to consider in their potential toxicity. Microplastics can adsorb pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or metals on their surface and are likely to contain plastic additives that add to their toxicity. The observations of microplastics in seafood increased concern for potential human exposure. Since literature considering microplastics in humans is scarce, using a One Environmental Health approach can help better inform about potential human exposures. Marine mammals and sea turtles are long-lived sentinel species regularly used for biomonitoring the health status of the ocean and share trophic chain and habitat with humans. This review considers the available research regarding microplastic and plastic fiber exposures in humans, marine mammals and turtles. Overall, across the literature, the concentration of microplastics, size, color, shape and polymer types found in GI tract and feces from sea turtles, marine mammals and humans are similar, showing that they might be exposed to the same microplastics profile. Additionally, even if ingestion is a major route of exposure due to contaminated food and water, dermal and inhalation studies in humans have provided data showing that these exposures are also health concerns and more effort on these routes of exposures is needed. In vitro studies looked at a variety of endpoints showing that microplastics can induce immune response, oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, alter membrane integrity and cause differential expression of genes. However, these studies only considered three polymer types and short-term exposures, whereas, due to physiological relevance, prolonged exposures might be more informative.

AB  - Dysregulated eating among children and adolescents is associated with a wide range of negative mental and physical health outcomes, including obesity. However, less is known regarding underlying neural mechanisms underlying such behaviors. Therefore, the present manuscript systematically reviewed neuroimaging research examining dysregulated eating behavior linked to excess weight in children and adolescents. A systematic literature search identified 23 eligible studies, the majority of which were cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies and excluded participants with psychiatric disorders. Dysregulated eating was captured by measures of eating styles and eating self-regulation, eating disorder behaviors, food addiction, objective measures of non-homeostatic eating and caloric restriction. While preliminary, findings suggested eating dysregulation was related to aberrant functioning within the frontostriatal and frontoparietal regions involved in self-regulatory processes, as well as regions involved in satiety signaling and interoception. This heterogeneous body of research is continually growing and may have potential to inform future prevention and intervention approaches. Results also identified several important limitations to consider and highlight key areas for future research.

AB  - In recent decades, the potential toxicological and environmental effects of organic ultraviolet filters (OUVF) have received growing attention. The number of studies in this area has increased; however, presently there is no scientometric perspective addressing this topic. The purpose of this study is to identify the intellectual base and research front using the visualization and analysis software, CiteSpace. We retrieved 453 articles, published in print or online as an early-access article between 2002 and 2020, from the Web of Science with a topic search related to OUVFs, environment, and toxicology. We then analysed synthesized networks of co-authorship (author, institution, country), co-citation (author, document, journal) and co-occurring keywords. The annual publication output has trended upwards since 2002. Authors based in China accounted for 29.4% of the total publications, followed by USA (17.4%); but overall publications from Switzerland and Spain were more influential. Major research themes identified included OUVF concentrations in aquatic environments, and hormonal effects. Emerging themes included improving the sensitivity of analytical detection methods for both OUVFs and their metabolites, consequences of OUVF transport to the marine environment, and concerns over prenatal exposure. Based on keyword analysis, benzophenone-3, 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, 3-benzylidene camphor, and ethylhexyl-methoxycinnamate are the most studied OUVFs, and effects on estrogenic activity, gene expression, reproduction, and more recently, oxidative stress, have received most attention from a toxicological perspective. Other prominent topics were sources of environmental contamination and ecological risk assessments. This study maps the major research domains of OUVF environmental toxicology research; explanations and implications of the findings are discussed; and emerging trends highlighted.

AB  - Background: Air pollution is a leading contributor to premature mortality worldwide and is often represented by particulate matter (PM), a key contributor to its harmful health effects. Concentration-response relationships are useful for quantifying the effects of air pollution in relevant populations and in considering potential effect thresholds. Controlled human exposures can provide data on acute effects and concentration?response re-lationships that complement epidemiological studies. Objectives: We examined PM concentration-responses after controlled human air pollution exposures to examine exposure?response markers, assess effect modifiers, and identify potential effect thresholds. Methods: We reviewed primary research from published controlled human exposure studies where responses were reported at multiple target PM concentrations or summarized per unit change in PM to identify concentration-dependent effects. Results: Of the 191 publications identified through PubMed and supplementary searches, 31 were eligible. Eligible studies collectively represented four pollutant models: concentrated ambient particles, engineered car-bon nanoparticles, diesel exhaust, and woodsmoke. We identified concentration-dependent effects on oxidative stress markers, inflammation, and cardiovascular function that overlapped across different pollutants. Metabolic syndrome and glutathione s-transferase mu 1 genotype were identified as potential effect modifiers. Discussion: Improved understanding of concentration?response relationships is integral to biomonitoring and mitigation of health effects through impact assessment and policy. Although we identified potential concen-tration?response markers, thresholds, and modifiers, our conclusions on these relationships were limited by a dearth of eligible publications, considerable variability in methodology, and inconsistent reporting standards between studies. More research is required to validate these observations. We recommend that future studies harmonize estimate reporting to facilitate the identification of robust response markers across research and applied settings.

As it combines individual, social and structural factors and shifts the focus of attention from the actual behavior towards available options for health behaviors that people can actually choose from, it may help advance our understanding of complex health issues.ObjectivesThe aim of this article is to identify and describe tools available to measure capabilities within the context of health, with a specific focus on capabilities for health-enhancing physical activity.MethodWe conducted a systematic literature review using 11 databases covering scientific journal articles published in English or German between the years 2000 and 2020 with a focus on capabilities for health or physical activity.ResultsWe found a total of 51 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. Four articles measured capabilities using qualitative methods, one combined qualitative and quantitative methods, while the rest used quantitative methods. We identified a total 11 different capability questionnaires, all showing moderate to good validity/reliability. Only one questionnaire and one interview-based tool specifically dealt with capabilities for health enhancing physical activity.ConclusionAlthough we were able to identify measurement tools for capabilities in health, this review has shown that there is no generic tool available for the measurement across all population- and age-groups, and tools focusing on physical activity are scarce. However, our results can be used as guide for future projects that aim at measuring capabilities.

AB  - Aggression in correctional and psychiatric settings is relatively common and has a negative effect on physical and mental health both among inmates/clients and staff, as well as organizational-level functioning. The aim of the present study was to critically review the evidence on the effectiveness of nutritional supplements in reducing aggression and violence to contribute to a better understanding of options available for managing aggressive behaviors in adults. The EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases were searched for effectiveness studies published in English anytime up until March 2020. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Altogether, 14 studies met inclusion criteria; 2 investigated micronutrients, 10 examined macronutrients, while further 2 examined a combination of micro and macronutrients. Out of the 14 studies, 5 reported a beneficial effect of nutritional supplementation (omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins/minerals, S-adenosyl- l-methionine, or tryptophan). Five studies did not report a significant beneficial effect of nutritional supplementation (omega-3 fatty acids, folic acid, tryptophan, broad range supplement containing vitamins and fatty acids, and fatty acids in augmentation with valproic acid), while four studies reported mixed effects (on l-tryptophan, broad-range micronutrient formula, folic acid, and omega-3 fatty acids). The results overall indicated that research in this area is in its infancy: very few studies examined the same composition of nutritional supplementation and when they did so the results were contradictory. The methodological shortcoming of existing studies and directions for future research are discussed to facilitate high-quality research in this evolving area of nutritional psychiatry.

AB  - Chronic constipation is one of the most prominent prodromal symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), and Lewy bodies, enriched with aggregated alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn), propagation from the gut into the brain has been proposed to play a key role in PD etiopathogenesis. BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and Netrin-1 promote both neuronal survival and regulate the gut functions. We hypothesize that C/EBP beta represses BDNF and Netrin-1 in peripheral nervous system and central nervous system, contributing to GI tract and brain malfunctions in PD. To test the hypothesis, we performed the studies in both human PD gut tissues and BDNF or Netrin-1 gut conditional KO mice models. Lewy bodies with alpha-Syn aggregation and neuro-inflammation were measured in the colon and brain samples from PD patients and healthy controls and rotenone or vehicle-treated WT and CEBP beta (+/-) mice. We show that both BDNF and Netrin-1 are strongly decreased in the brain and the gut of PD patients, and conditional KO of these trophic factors in the gut elicits dopaminergic neuronal loss, constipation and motor dysfunctions. Interestingly, the inflammation and oxidative stress-induced transcription factor C/EBP beta acts as a robust repressor for both BDNF and Netrin-1 and suppresses the expression of trophic factors, and its levels inversely correlate with BDNF and Netrin-1 in PD patients. Our findings support that gut inflammation induces C/EBP beta activation that leads to both BDNF and Netrin-1 reduction and triggers PD non-motor and motor symptoms. Possibly, C/EBP beta-mediated biological events might be early diagnostic biomarkers for PD.

AB  - This article presents the basic achievements of the psychology of religion in the Lvov-Warsaw School of K. Twardowski, their developments and significance for the contemporary psychology of religion. Twardowski's School existed parallel to other European psychological schools: the Wurzburg School, founded by Oswald Kulpe, and the Dorpat School of the Psychology of Religion, founded by Karl Girgensohn (unfortunately without mutual scientific relations). The article presents two research trends in the psychology of religion resulting from Twardowski's works, specifically research on mental acts and religious beliefs with use of introspection and research in the field of cultural-historical psychology. The theory of acts and products, and the theory of cratism/power (similar to the theory of Alfred Adler) played crucial roles here. Psychological investigations into religious beliefs were also dominated by the psychological principle of contradiction, and the obtained results also seem to be important today.

AB  - Objective Musculoskeletal disorders are one of the most important occupational problems especially among nurses. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in upper limbs and its associated psychosocial factors in the workplace. Methods A systematic review was conducted by searching the Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, ISI/web of knowledge and Google Scholar databases. The authors classified studies into categories of psychological work stressors and musculoskeletal problems. The statistical analysis was performed using Stata software. Results We found 1742 articles in our initial search. After reviewing the titles, abstracts and full texts, 66 articles were finally analyzed. Psychosocial factors affecting the prevalence of upper limb musculoskeletal disorders among nurses were identified which included boring work, inadequate staffing, job demands, insufficient support, time pressure, decision latitude, job dissatisfaction, and job stress. There was a significant relationship between these factors and prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in the wrists, shoulders, neck and shoulders, and wrists and hands. Conclusion Collectively, the results of this study provide strong evidence of some psychosocial factors affecting the prevalence of upper limb musculoskeletal disorders among nurses. Thus, organizational interventions to minimize these stressors may be promising in reducing one risk factor for the development of nurses' musculoskeletal disorders. These interventions should not only consider the factors of physical ergonomics but also seek to improve the organizational aspects of the workplace.

AB  - Social cognitive abilities are affected by preterm birth, but pathways to, and risk factors for this outcome are not well mapped. We examined direct assessment tasks including objective coding of parent-child play to chart social development in infancy and pre-school years. A systematic search and data-extraction procedure yielded seventynine studies (4930 preterm and 2109 term children, aged birth -five years), for inclusion. We detected a pattern of reduced social attention in the first 12 months of life with evidence of reduced performance in social cognitive tasks later in the preschool years. However, we did not identify a consistent, distinctive preterm social phenotype in early life. Instead, the interactive behaviour of preterm infants reflects factors from outside the social cognitive domain, such as attention, language, and socioeconomic status. By combining data across samples and measures we revealed the role of domain-general skills, which may in future prove fruitful intervention targets.

AB  - Climate change (CC) is a key, global driver of change of marine ecosystems. At local and regional scales, other local human stressors (LS) can interact with CC and modify its effects on marine ecosystems. Understanding the response of the marine environment to the combined effects of CC and LS is crucial to inform marine ecosystem-based management and planning, yet our knowledge of the potential effects of such interactions is fragmented.
   At a global scale, we explored how cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) have addressed CC in the marine realm and discuss progress and shortcomings of current approaches. For this we conducted a systematic review on how CEAs investigated at different levels of biological organization ecological responses, functional aspects, and the combined effect of CC and HS.
   Globally, the effects of 52 LS and of 27 CC-related stressors on the marine environment have been studied in combination, such as industrial fisheries with change in temperature, or sea level rise with artisanal fisheries, marine litter, change in sediment load and introduced alien species. CC generally intensified the effects of LS at species level. At trophic groups and ecosystem levels, the effects of CC either intensified or mitigated the effects of other HS depending on the trophic groups or the environmental conditions involved, thus suggesting that the combined effects of CC and LS are context-dependent and vary among and within ecosystems. Our results highlight that large-scale assessments on the spatial interaction and combined effects of CC and LS remain limited. More importantly, our results strengthen the urgent need of CEAs to capture local-scale effects of stressors that can exacerbate climate-induced changes. Ultimately, this will allow identifying management measures that aid counteracting CC effects at relevant scales. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

KW  - glymphatic system
KW  - unfolded protein response
KW  - oxidative stress
KW  - sleep disruption
AB  - Sleep-wake disruptions are among the most prevalent and burdensome non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical studies have demonstrated that these disturbances can precede the onset of typical motor symptoms by years, indicating that they may play a primary function in the pathogenesis of PD. Animal studies suggest that sleep facilitates the removal of metabolic wastes through the glymphatic system via convective flow from the periarterial space to the perivenous space, upregulates antioxidative defenses, and promotes the maintenance of neuronal protein homeostasis. Therefore, disruptions to the sleep-wake cycle have been associated with inefficient metabolic clearance and increased oxidative stress in the central nervous system (CNS). This leads to excessive accumulation of alpha-synuclein and the induction of neuronal loss, both of which have been proposed to be contributing factors to the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Additionally, recent studies have suggested that PD-related pathophysiological alterations during the prodromal phase disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. Taken together, these findings indicate potential mechanistic interactions between sleep-wake disorders and PD progression as proposed in this review. Further research into the hypothetical mechanisms underlying these interactions would be valuable, as positive findings may provide promising insights into novel therapeutic interventions for PD.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to synthesize available cohorts about the relationship between various types of noise and hypertension, and to explore the potential dose-response relationship between them in an updated meta-analysis.
   Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched through October 2019 to identify cohort studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria. A random-effects model was used to combine the results of included studies. Dose-response meta-analysis was conducted to examine the potential dose-response relationship.
   Results: Eleven cohort studies involving 224,829 participants were included in this systematic review. Pooled result showed that living or working in environment with noise exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of hypertension (RR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.32), with low heterogeneity (P = 0.098, I-2 = 42.1%). We found no evidence of a nonlinear association of elevated noise with hypertension risk (P = 0.443). The summary risk ratio of hypertension for an increment of per 10 dB(A) of noise was 1.13 (95% CI: 0.99 to 1.28), with moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.003, I-2 = 72.1%).
   Conclusions: Integrated evidence from cohort studies supports the hypothesis that exposure to noise may be a risk factor of hypertension.

KW  - relapse
AB  - Objective The risk of relapse following successful antidepressant treatment, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), is substantial. Lithium has been suggested to effectively prevent relapse, yet data remain limited and inconclusive. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of continuation treatment with lithium in preventing relapse following a successful acute course of ECT in patients with major depression, in comparison to continuation treatment without lithium. We also assessed the role of several study characteristics, possibly impacting the treatment effect.
   Methods A systematic literature search, using the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases (up to June 2020), was conducted for prospective and retrospective studies, including patients with unipolar or bipolar depression, that assessed the efficacy of lithium for post-ECT depressive relapse prevention.
   Results Of 2556 records screened, 14 articles reporting on 9748 participants who received continuation treatment either with (N = 1571) or without lithium (N = 8177) were included in the meta-analysis. Patients receiving lithium were less likely to experience depressive relapse after a successful acute course of ECT, compared to patients receiving post-ECT prophylaxis without lithium (weighted odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.34, 0.82), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 7 (95% CI = 4, 21). We found some limited evidence that older patients may benefit more from continuation treatment with lithium, compared to younger patients. Using the GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence for our outcome measure (i.e., relapse rate) was rated as very low.
   Conclusion Continuation treatment with lithium may have superior efficacy in reducing the risk of relapse after a successful acute ECT course for major depression, in comparison to continuation treatment without lithium. High-quality studies are needed to confirm this finding.

AB  - Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) are common mental disorders with a high degree of comorbidity. However, no systematic review with meta-analysis has aimed to quantify the degree of comorbidity between both disorders. To this end we performed a systematic search of the literature in October 2020. In a meta-analysis of 71 studies with 646,766 participants from 18 countries, it was found that about one in thirteen adults with ADHD was also diagnosed with BD (7.95 %; 95 % CI: 5.31?11.06), and nearly one in six adults with BD had ADHD (17.11 %; 95 % CI: 13.05?21.59 %). Substantial heterogeneity of comor-bidity rates was present, highlighting the importance of contextual factors: Heterogeneity could partially be explained by diagnostic system, sample size and geographical location. Age of BD onset occurred earlier in patients with comorbid ADHD (3.96 years; 95 % CI: 2.65?5.26, p < 0.001). Cultural and methodological dif-ferences deserve attention for evaluating diagnostic criteria and clinicians should be aware of the high comor-bidity rates to prevent misdiagnosis and provide optimal care for both disorders.

AB  - The passage of US immigrant-related policies at the federal, state, and local level is on the rise. These policies may affect child health through several mechanisms. We performed a systematic review of English-language, peer-reviewed, quantitative studies examining US immigrant-related policies and the mental and physical health of youth in immigrant families. We searched PubMed and five social science databases for studies published between 1986 and 2019. Two independent reviewers screened the studies and appraised study quality. Of the final 17 studies, ten studies examined birth outcomes and seven studies examined other outcomes in childhood and adolescence (e.g., self-rated health). Generally, exclusionary policies were associated with worse health outcomes and inclusive policies were associated with better health outcomes. Several studies did not observe an association, but only one study found an association of the opposite direction. In that study, similar trends in different policy environments and across foreign-born and US-born women suggest alternative causes for the observed association. Overall, we find that exclusionary policies are, at best, neutral, but likely harmful towards child wellbeing, while inclusive policies can be beneficial.

AB  - Background The Most Significant Change is a story-based evaluation approach used in many international development programs. This practice review summarises practical experience with the approach in complex health interventions in ten countries, with the objective of making it more accessible in evaluation of other complex health interventions. Results Participatory research practitioners and trainees discussed five themes following brief presentations by each of the seven attendees who led the exercise: (i) sampling and recruitment; (ii) phrasing the questions to elicit stories; (iii) story collection strategies; (iv) quality assurance; and (v) analysis. Notes taken during the meeting provided the framework for this article. Recruitment strategies in small studies included universal engagement and, in larger studies, a purposive, systematic or random sampling. Meeting attendees recommended careful phrasing and piloting of the question(s) as this affects the quality and focus of the stories generated. They stressed the importance of careful training and monitoring of fieldworkers collecting stories to ensure full stories are elicited and recorded. For recording, in most settings they preferred note taking with back-checking or self-writing of stories by story tellers, rather than audio-recording. Analysis can combine participatory selection of a small number of stories, deductive or inductive thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Meeting attendees noted that involvement in collection of the stories and their analysis and discussion had a positive impact for research team members. Conclusions Our review confirms the plasticity, feasibility and acceptability of the Most Significant Change technique across different sociopolitical, cultural and environmental contexts of complex interventions. Although the approach can surface unexpected impacts, it is not a 360-degree evaluation. Its strength lies in characterising the changes, where these happen, in the words of the beneficiaries. We hope this distillation of our practice makes the technique more readily available to health sector researchers.

KW  - s disease
KW  - Dopamine
AB  - Methamphetamine (METH), a highly addictive psychostimulant, is the second most widely used illicit drug. METH produces damage dopamine neurons and apoptosis via multiple inter-regulating mechanisms, including dopamine overload, hyperthermia, oxidative stress, mitochondria dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, protein degradation system dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Increasing evidence suggests that chronic METH abuse is associated with neurodegenerative changes in the human brain and an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). METH use and PD may share some common steps in causing neurotoxicity. Accumulation of alpha-synuclein, a presynaptic protein, is the pathological hallmark of PD. Intriguingly, alpha-synuclein upregulation and aggregation are also found in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in chronic METH users. This suggests alpha-synuclein may play a role in METH-induced neurotoxicity. The mechanism of alpha-synuclein cytotoxicity in PD has attracted considerable attention; however, how alpha-synuclein affects METH-induced neurotoxicity has not been reviewed. In this review, we summarize the relationship between METH use and PD, interdependent mechanisms that are involved in METH-induced neurotoxicity and the significance of alpha-synuclein upregulation in response to METH use. The identification of alpha-synuclein overexpression and aggregation as a contributor to METH-induced neurotoxicity may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of the deleterious effect of this drug and drug addiction.

AB  - We propose that neural damage in Parkinson's disease (PD) is due to dysregulation of iron utilization rather than to high iron levels per se. Iron deposits are associated with neuronal cell death in substantia nigra (SN) resulting in PD where high levels of iron in SNs are due to dysregulation of iron utilization. Cytosolic aconitase (ACO1) upon losing an iron-sulfur cluster becomes iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1). Rotenone increases levels of IRP1 and induces PD in rats. An increase in iron leads to inactivation of IRP1. We propose a novel treatment strategy to prevent PD. Specifically in rats given rotenone by subcutaneous injections, iron, from iron carbonyl from which iron is slowly absorbed, given three times a day by gavage will keep iron levels constant in the gut whereby iron levels and iron utilization systematically can be tightly regulated. Rotenone adversely affects complex 1 iron-sulfur proteins. Iron supplementation will increase iron-sulfur cluster formation switching IRP1 to ACO1. With IRP1 levels kept constantly low, iron utilization will systematically be tightly regulated stopping dysregulation of complex 1 and the neural damage done by rotenone preventing PD.

AB  - Toxicity of aluminum(Al) is a serious problem for agricultural plants, especially due to excessive soil acidification caused by continuous intensive agriculture and modified environmental conditions related with global climate change. Decreased root elongation and shoot growth, reduced biomass production, nutrient imbalance and altered physiological and metabolic processes are responsible for lower yield and crop quality and therefore, decreased variability and productivity of the land. Recently, biochar is gaining popularity for ameliorating metal toxicity in soils. However, there is a lack of comprehensive information regarding the effects of biochar and its functioning. Multiple mechanisms are involved in ameliorating Al toxicity in which inherent properties of biochar influencing Al adsorption, absorption, complexation, cation exchange and electrostatic interaction are considered to play major roles. Modification of biochar to enhance these mechanisms might hold the key for long term solution. Present review indicates gaps for further research. Long term field studies are needed to understand the effects of biochar on Al toxicity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Obesity and adverse metabolic outcomes in patients with severe mental illness are clinically significant but potentially preventable. Importantly, the evidence for switching to antipsychotics to reduce cardiometabolic burden is unclear.Method: PubMED, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane were searched from inception to March 8, 2020. Articles reporting weight and metabolic changes after antipsychotic switching vs staying on the previous antipsychotic were meta-analyzed both across and within group.Results: Of 61 identified studies, 59 were meta-analyzed (40% rated high quality). In the switch-vs-stay pairwise meta-analyses, only aripiprazole significantly reduced weight (-5.52 kg, 95% CI -10.63, -0.42, P = .03), while olanzapine significantly increased weight (2.46 kg, 95% CI 0.34, 4.57, P = .02). Switching to aripiprazole also significantly improved fasting glucose (-3.99 mg/dl, 95% CI -7.34, -0.64, P = .02) and triglycerides (-31.03 mg/ dl, 95% CI -48.73, -13.34, P = .0001). Dropout and psychosis ratings did not differ between switch and stay groups for aripiprazole and olanzapine. In before-to-after switch meta-analyses, aripiprazole (-1.96 kg, 95% CI -3.07, -0.85, P < .001) and ziprasidone (-2.22 kg, 95% CI -3.84, -0.60, P = .007) were associated with weight loss, whereas olanzapine (2.71 kg, 95% CI 1.87, 3.55, P < .001), and clozapine (2.80 kg, 95% CI 0.26, 5.34, P = .03) were associated with weight gain. No significant weight or other cardiometabolic changes were observed when switching to amisulpride, paliperidone/risperidone, quetiapine, or lurasidone. Conclusions: Switching antipsychotics to agents with lower weight gain potential, notably to aripiprazole and ziprasidone, can improve weight profile and other cardiometabolic outcomes. When choosing switch agents, both the weight gain potential of the pre- and post-switch antipsychotic must be considered. Antipsychotic switching in psychiatrically stable patients must be weighed against the risk of psychiatric worsening.

AB  - Wheat is an important cereal crop, and its significance is more due to compete for dietary products in the world. Many constraints facing by the wheat crop due to environmental hazardous, biotic, abiotic stress and heavy matters factors, as a result, decrease the yield. Understanding the molecular mechanism related to these factors is significant to figure out genes regulate under specific conditions. Classical breeding using hybridization has been used to increase the yield but not prospered at the desired level. With the development of newly emerging technologies in biological sciences i.e., marker assisted breeding (MAB), QTLs mapping, mutation breeding, proteomics, metabolomics, next-generation sequencing (NGS), RNA_sequencing, transcriptomics, differential expression genes (DEGs), computational resources and genome editing techniques i.e. (CRISPR cas9; Cas13) advances in the field of omics. Application of new breeding technologies develops huge data; considerable development is needed in bioinformatics science to interpret the data. However, combined omics application to address physiological questions linked with genetics is still a challenge. Moreover, viroid discovery opens the new direction for research, economics, and target specification. Comparative genomics important to figure gene of interest processes are further discussed about considering the identification of genes, genomic loci, and biochemical pathways linked with stress resilience in wheat. Furthermore, this review extensively discussed the omics approaches and their effective use. Integrated plant omics technologies have been used viroid genomes associated with CRISPR and CRISPR-associated Cas13a proteins system used for engineering of viroid interference along with high-performance multidimensional phenotyping as a significant limiting factor for increasing stress resistance in wheat.

TI  - Occupational heat stress and economic burden: A review of global evidence
KW  - Workplace
KW  - Heat stress
KW  - Cost
KW  - Climate change
KW  - Labor productivity
AB  - Background: The adverse effects of heat on workers' health and work productivity are well documented. However, the resultant economic consequences and productivity loss are less understood. This review aims to summarize the retrospective and potential future economic burden of workplace heat exposure in the context of climate change.
   Methods: Literature was searched from database inception to October 2020 using Embase, PubMed, and Scopus. Articles were limited to original human studies investigating costs from occupational heat stress in English.
   Results: Twenty studies met criteria for inclusion. Eighteen studies estimated costs secondary to heat-induced labor productivity loss. Predicted global costs from lost worktime, in US$, were 280 billion in 1995, 311 billion in 2010 (approximate to 0.5% of GDP), 2.4-2.5 trillion in 2030 (>1% of GDP) and up to 4.0% of GDP by 2100. Three studies estimated heat-related healthcare expenses from occupational injuries with averaged annual costs (US$) exceeding 1 million in Spain, 1 million in Guangzhou, China and 250,000 in Adelaide, Australia. Low- and middle-income countries and countries with warmer climates had greater losses as a proportion of GDP. Greater costs per worker were observed in outdoor industries, medium-sized businesses, amongst males, and workers aged 25-44 years.
   Conclusions: The estimated global economic burden of occupational heat stress is substantial. Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies should be implemented to likely minimize future costs. Further research exploring the relationship between occupational heat stress and related expenses from lost productivity, decreased work efficiency and healthcare, and costs stratified by demographic factors, is warranted.
   Key messages. The estimated retrospective and future economic burden from occupational heat stress is large. Responding to climate change is crucial to minimize this burden. Analyzing heat-attributable occupational costs may guide the development of workplace heat management policies and practices as part of global warming strategies.

AB  - Decompression theory has been mainly based on studies on terrestrial mammals, and may not translate well to marine mammals. However, evidence that marine mammals experience gas bubbles during diving is growing, causing concern that these bubbles may cause gas emboli pathology (GEP) under unusual circumstances. Marine mammal management, and usual avoidance, of gas emboli and GEP, or the bends, became a topic of intense scientific interest after sonar-exposed, mass stranded deep-diving whales were observed with gas bubbles. Theoretical models, based on our current understanding of diving physiology in cetaceans, predict that the tissue and blood N-2 levels in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) are at levels that would result in severe DCS symptoms in similar sized terrestrial mammals. However, the dolphins appear to have physiological or behavioral mechanisms to avoid excessive blood N-2 levels, or may be more resistant to circulating bubbles through immunological/biochemical adaptations. Studies on behavior, anatomy and physiology of marine mammals have enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms that are thought to prevent excessive uptake of N-2. This has led to the selective gas exchange hypothesis, which provides a mechanism how stress-induced behavioral change may cause failure of the normal physiology, which results in excessive uptake of N-2, and in extreme cases may cause formation of symptomatic gas emboli. Studies on cardiorespiratory function have been integral to the development of this hypothesis, with work initially being conducted on excised tissues and cadavers, followed by studies on anesthetized animals or trained animals under human care. These studies enabled research on free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, FL, and off Bermuda, and have included work on the metabolic and cardiorespiratory physiology of both shallowand deep-diving dolphins and have been integral to better understand how cetaceans can dive to extreme depths, for long durations.

AB  - Trans and gender non-conforming (TGNC) people experience poor health care and health outcomes. We conducted a qualitative scoping review of studies addressing TGNC people's experiences receiving physical health care to inform research and practice solutions. A systematic search resulted in 35 qualitative studies for analysis. Studies included 1,607 TGNC participants, ages 16-64 years. Analytic methods included mostly interviews and focus groups; the most common analysis strategy was theme analysis. Key themes in findings were patient challenges, needs, and strengths. Challenges dominated findings and could be summarized by lack of provider knowledge and sensitivity and financial and insurance barriers, which hurt TGNC people's health. Future qualitative research should explore the experiences of diverse and specific groups of TGNC people (youth, non-binary, racial/ethnic minority), include community-based methods, and theory development. Practice-wise, training for providers and skills and support for TGNC people to advocate to improve their health, are required.

AB  - Objective: To curb the burden of perinatal depression (PND) in Africa, it is important to have an accurate estimate of its burden in the continent. Hence, we determined the prevalence of (major) depressive disorder in the perinatal period in Africa.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Africa Index Medicus, and Africa Journal Online, to identify studies reporting the prevalence of (major) depressive disorder in the perinatal period in Africa, between January 1st 2000 and February 17th 2020. PND prevalence was estimated using Bayesian modelling.
   Results: We identified 154 studies (192 data points; 113,147 women). In pregnant women, the prevalence of depressive disorder was 22.8% (95%Credible interval [CrI]: 21.5-24.1) among women with no specific condition and 31.9% (95%CrI: 30.2-33.6) among those with HIV. In post-partum, the prevalence was 21.2% (95%CrI: 20.0-22.5), 30.0% (95%CrI: 28.2-31.8), and 44.6% (95%CrI: 35.9-53.8) among women with no specific condition, with HIV, and with poor pregnancy outcomes, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study depicted a high prevalence of PND in Africa. This prevalence varied across pre-defined clinical profiles. HIV-infected women or those with poor pregnancy outcomes having a higher prevalence of depression. This highlights the need for more attention and preventive interventions geared towards these subgroups.

TI  - The Current Evidence Levels for Biofeedback and Neurofeedback Interventions in Treating Depression: A Narrative Review
AB  - This article is aimed at showing the current level of evidence for the usage of biofeedback and neurofeedback to treat depression along with a detailed review of the studies in the field and a discussion of rationale for utilizing each protocol. La Vaque et al. criteria endorsed by the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback and International Society for Neuroregulation & Research were accepted as a means of study evaluation. Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback was found to be moderately supportable as a treatment of MDD while outcome measure was a subjective questionnaire like Beck Depression Inventory (level 3/5, "probably efficacious"). Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback protocols, namely, alpha-theta, alpha, and sensorimotor rhythm upregulation, all qualify for level 2/5, "possibly efficacious." Frontal alpha asymmetry protocol also received limited evidence of effect in depression (level 2/5, "possibly efficacious"). Finally, the two most influential real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback protocols targeting the amygdala and the frontal cortices both demonstrate some effectiveness, though lack replications (level 2/5, "possibly efficacious"). Thus, neurofeedback specifically targeting depression is moderately supported by existing studies (all fit level 2/5, "possibly efficacious"). The greatest complication preventing certain protocols from reaching higher evidence levels is a relatively high number of uncontrolled studies and an absence of accurate replications arising from the heterogeneity in protocol details, course lengths, measures of improvement, control conditions, and sample characteristics.

AB  - Objective
   Debates about the effectiveness of workplace wellness programs (WWPs) call for a review of the evidence for return on investment (ROI) of WWPs. We examined literature on the heterogeneity in methods used in the ROI of WWPs to show how this heterogeneity may affect conclusions and inferences about ROI.
   Methods
   We conducted a scoping review using systematic review methods and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We reviewed PubMed, EconLit, Proquest Central, and Scopus databases for published articles. We included articles that (1) were published before December 20, 2019, when our last search was conducted, and (2) met our inclusion criteria that were based on target population, target intervention, evaluation method, and ROI as the main outcome.
   Results
   We identified 47 peer-reviewed articles from the selected databases that met our inclusion criteria. We explored the effect of study characteristics on ROI estimates. Thirty-one articles had ROI measures. Studies with costs of presenteeism had the lowest ROI estimates compared with other cost combinations associated with health care and absenteeism. Studies with components of disease management produced higher ROI than programs with components of wellness. We found a positive relationship between ROI and program length and a negative relationship between ROI and conflict of interest. Evaluations in small companies (<= 500 employees) were associated with lower ROI estimates than evaluations in large companies (>500 employees). Studies with lower reporting quality scores, including studies that were missing information on statistical inference, had lower ROI estimates. Higher methodologic quality was associated with lower ROI estimates.
   Conclusion
   This review provides recommendations that can improve the methodologic quality of studies to validate the ROI and public health effects of WWPs.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a vision-threatening, chronic, and challenging eye disease in the diabetic population. Despite recent advancements in the clinical management of diabetes, DR remains the major cause of blindness in working-age adults. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of DR development will aid in identifying therapeutic targets. Emerging pieces of evidence from recent research in the field of ER stress have demonstrated a close association between unfolded protein response (UPR)-associated cellular activities and DR development. In this minireview article, we shall provide an emerging understating of how UPR influences DR pathogenesis at the cellular level.

AB  - Noninvasive brain stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are promising add-on treatments for a number of psychiatric conditions. Yet, some of the initial excitement is wearing off. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) have found inconsistent results. This inconsistency is suspected to be the consequence of variation in treatment effects and solvable by identifying responders in RCTs and individualizing treatment. However, is there enough evidence from RCTs that patients respond differently to treatment? This question can be addressed by comparing the variability in the active stimulation group with the variability in the sham group. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and included all double-blinded, sham-controlled RCTs and crossover trials that used TMS or tDCS in adults with a unipolar or bipolar depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder. In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines to ensure data quality and validity, we extracted a measure of variability of the primary outcome. A total of 130 studies with 5748 patients were considered in the analysis. We calculated variance-weighted variability ratios for each comparison of active stimulation vs sham and entered them into a random-effects model. We hypothesized that treatment effect variability in TMS or tDCS would be reflected by increased variability after active compared with sham stimulation, or in other words, a variability ratio greater than one. Across diagnoses, we found only a minimal increase in variability after active stimulation compared with sham that did not reach statistical significance (variability ratio = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.97, 1.08, P = 0.358). In conclusion, this study found little evidence for treatment effect variability in brain stimulation, suggesting that the need for personalized or stratified medicine is still an open question.

AB  - Crack-cocaine is a cocaine by-product widely consumed by general population in developing countries. The drug is low cost and is associated with more intense effects when compared to other illicit drugs. Genotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response are considered crucial events in carcinogenesis, since they actively participate in the multistep process. The purpose of this paper was to provide a mini review regarding the relationship between carcinogenesis and genotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation induced by crack-cocaine. The present study was conducted on search of the scientific literature from the published studies available in PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar for all kind of articles (all publications to November 2020) using the following key words: crack-cocaine, DNA damage, genotoxicity, cellular death, cytotoxicity, mutation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and mutagenicity. The results showed that published papers available were almost all in vivo test system being conducted in humans or rodents. Crack-cocaine was able to induce genotoxicity and oxidative stress in mammalian cells. However, the role of inflammatory response after exposure to crack-cocaine was not conclusive so far. In summary, this study is consistent with the notion that crack-cocaine is a chemical carcinogen as a result of genotoxicity and oxidative stress induced in mammalian and non-mammalian cells.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging provides an avenue for earlier diagnosis and tailored treatment of psychological disorders characterised by emotional impairment. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) offers ecological advantages compared to other neuroimaging techniques and suitability of measuring regions involved in emotion functions. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the capacity of NIRS to detect activation during emotion processing and to provide recommendations for future research. Following a comprehensive literature search, we reviewed 85 journal articles, which compared activation during emotional experience, regulation or perception with either a neutral condition or baseline period among healthy participants. The quantitative synthesis of outcomes was limited to thematical analysis, owing to the lack of standardisation between studies. Although most studies found increased prefrontal activity during emotional experience and regulation, the findings were more inconsistent for emotion perception. Some researchers reported increased activity during the task, some reported decreases, some no significant changes, and some reported mixed findings depending on the valence and region. We propose that variations in the cognitive task and stimuli, recruited sample, and measurement and analysis of data are the primary causes of inconsistency. Recommendations to improve consistency in future research by carefully considering the choice of population, cognitive task and analysis approach are provided.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of major neurocognitive disorder (MNCD), formerly known as dementia, is of increasing concern as the elderly population continues to grow. Doll therapy (DT) is a controversial method observed in clinical practice that has both promising benefits and potential ethical concerns. To date, little research has been done on this therapy. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed using the keywords "dementia," "elderly," "dolls," "doll therapy," and "Alzheimer's disease." A list of pertinent articles was assembled, with irrelevant articles excluded. References from these articles were also reviewed and additional articles were included in the final list. RESULTS: Research on the utility of DT for patients with MNCD is limited. Current literature suggests that DT may be beneficial in decreasing the use of pharmacologic interventions and alleviating symptoms such as agitation and anxiety. However, most studies consisted of small, unrepresentative sample populations. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary studies favor DT as an effective management strategy for behavioral symptoms of MNCD. However, the few existing randomized controlled trials are limited in size and demographics. Further research involving larger, more diverse study samples with more male patients is needed. Additionally, the exact parameters to guide this therapy have not been established and require investigative study.

AB  - Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is an important livelihood activity in many low- and middle-income countries. It is widely acknowledged that there are a myriad of health risk and opportunities associated with ASM. However, little is known with regard to which aspects of health have been studied in ASM settings. We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed publications, using readily available electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) from inception to 14 July 2020. Relevant information was synthesized with an emphasis on human and environmental exposures and health effects in a context of ASM. Our search yielded 2764 records. After systematic screening, 176 health studies from 38 countries were retained for final analysis. Most of the studies (n = 155) focused on health in ASM extracting gold. While many of the studies included the collection of environmental and human samples (n = 154), only few (n = 30) investigated infectious diseases. Little attention was given to vulnerable groups, such as women of reproductive age and children. Our scoping review provides a detailed characterisation of health studies in ASM contexts. Future research in ASM settings should address health more comprehensively, including the potential spread of infectious diseases, and effects on mental health and well-being.

AB  - Color is an important environmental factor that in multiple ways affects human and animal behavior and physiology. Widely used in neuroscience research, various experimental (animal) models may help improve our understanding of how different colors impact brain and behavioral processes. Complementing laboratory rodents, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is rapidly emerging as an important novel model species to explore complex neurobehavioral processes. The growing utility of zebrafish in biomedicine makes it timely to consider the role of colors in their behavioral and physiological responses. Here, we summarize mounting evidence implicating colors as a critical variable in zebrafish models and neurobehavioral traits, with a particular relevance to CNS disease modeling, genetic and pharmacological modulation, as well as environmental enrichment and animal welfare. We also discuss the growing value of zebrafish models to study color neurobiology and color-related neurobehavioral phenomics, and outline future directions of research in this field.

AB  - A neuronal dysfunction based on the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory cortical-subcortical neurotransmission seems at the basis of migraine. Intercritical neuronal abnormal excitability can culminate in the bioelectrical phenomenon of Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD) with secondary involvement of the vascular system and release of inflammatory mediators, modulating in turn neuronal activity. Neuronal dysfunction encompasses the altered connectivity between the brain areas implicated in the genesis, maintenance and chronic evolution of migraine. Advanced neuroimaging techniques allow to identify changes in functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in pain processes. Through a narrative review, we re-searched case-control studies on FC in migraine, between 2015 and 2020, by inserting the words migraine, fMRI, EEG, MEG, connectivity, pain in Pubmed. Studies on FC have shown that cortical processes, in the neurolimbic pain network, are likely to be prevalent for triggering attacks, in response to predisposing factors, and that these lead to a demodulation of the subcortical areas, at the basis of migraine maintenance. The link between brain dysfunction and peripheral interactions through the inhibition of CGRP, the main mediator of sterile migraine inflammation needs to be further investigated. Preliminary evidence could suggest that peripheral nerves inference at somatic and trigeminal levels, appears to change brain FC.

AB  - This scoping review aims to describe occupational therapy interventions carried out with multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients in occupational therapy. A peer review of the literature was conducted in different databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase, and in some occupational therapy journals. A search of the literature published was carried out before December 2019. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) articles evaluating the intervention of occupational therapy in MS or ALS including experimental, randomized, nonrandomized and exploratory studies; (2) written in English or Spanish; (3) adult population (over 18 years old). The initial search identified 836 articles of which we included 32 divided into four areas of intervention: fatigue-targeted interventions, cognitive interventions, physical interventions and others. Only 16 studies were carried out exclusively by occupational therapists. Most occupational therapy interventions are aimed at fatigue and physical rehabilitation. The majority of the studies in our review included MS patients, with little representation from the ALS population. These interventions have shown an improvement in perceived fatigue, manual dexterity, falls prevention and improvement in cognitive aspects such as memory, communication, depression and quality of life in the MS and ALS populations.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The pollution of air, soil, and sea has grown in recent decades at the same pace as human development. Climate changes add further damage to the ecosystems. Nowadays, pollutants that derive from the anthropization of the environment are indicated as "emerging pollutants". Marine organisms, especially invertebrates, are used as model systems for ecotoxicological studies also regarding the nervous system, even if studies on pollutants' neurotoxic effects are still few. A great leap forward in knowledge can come from integrated omics studies that bring together genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data. These studies have revealed that pollutants are dangerous for the life of marine organisms, and not only because they can be modified in the environment, but also because they can combine giving rise to new mixtures. These new combinations can be even more harmful than individual pollutants. We must not forget that many marine organisms, both invertebrates and vertebrates, become part of the human food chain. Therefore, ultimately, the pollutants that contaminate the air, soil, and sea are potentially harmful to human health. The purpose of this review is to focus on some of the pollutants that are most frequently present in marine environments and analyze their neurotoxic potential effects on some marine model organisms.
   Invertebrates represent about 95% of existing species, and most of them belong to aquatic ecosystems. Marine invertebrates are found at intermediate levels of the food chain and, therefore, they play a central role in the biodiversity of ecosystems. Furthermore, these organisms have a short life cycle, easy laboratory manipulation, and high sensitivity to marine pollution and, therefore, they are considered to be optimal bioindicators for assessing detrimental chemical agents that are related to the marine environment and with potential toxicity to human health, including neurotoxicity. In general, albeit simple, the nervous system of marine invertebrates is composed of neuronal and glial cells, and it exhibits biochemical and functional similarities with the vertebrate nervous system, including humans. In recent decades, new genetic and transcriptomic technologies have made the identification of many neural genes and transcription factors homologous to those in humans possible. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and altered levels of neurotransmitters are some of the aspects of neurotoxic effects that can also occur in marine invertebrate organisms. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of major marine pollutants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and micro and nano-plastics, with a focus on their neurotoxic effects in marine invertebrate organisms. This review could be a stimulus to bio-research towards the use of invertebrate model systems other than traditional, ethically questionable, time-consuming, and highly expensive mammalian models.

AB  - The aim of this study was to synthesize the evidence on the effects of active video games (AVGs) on mental health, physical fitness and body composition of children and adolescents. A search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed; MEDLINE (by Ovid); SportDiscus, Cochrane library systematic reviews (CENTRAL) and EMBASE with no language restrictions during October 2020. Reviews on the use of AVGs were included in the study. We use the AMSTAR (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) scale to analyze the methodological quality of the studies. Seventeen systematic reviews and meta-analyzes were included on the effects of AVGs with 30 to 4728 children and adolescents of both sexes with ages ranging from 6 to 19 years. In five studies, the population was overweight or obese. Regarding the quality, 12 studies were of moderate quality, two had high quality, two had low quality and one showed very low quality. The analyzed data indicate that the use of AVGs with a frequency of 1 to 3 times a week with durations of between 10 and 90 min per day shows positive effects on mental health and physical functioning. There was moderate quality evidence that AVGs can result in benefits for self-esteem, increased energy expenditure, physical activity and reduced body mass index in children and adolescents who used AVGs in the home environment. Further research is needed on this tool to help in the process of social isolation and consequently in promoting health and well-being.

AB  - Athletes must distribute their attention to many relevant cues during a match. Therefore, athletes' ability to deal with dual-tasks may be different from the non-athlete population, demanding a deeper investigation within the sports domain. This study aimed to systematically review the acute and chronic effects of dual-tasks in motor and cognitive performances in athletes from different modalities. The search for articles followed all the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The keywords used were: "dual-task" OR "double task" OR "multi-task" OR "divided attention" OR "secondary task" OR "second task" AND "working memory" OR "visual" OR "decision making" OR "gaze behavior" OR "attention" AND "sports" OR "athletes" OR "players". The Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases were screened for studies comparing single and dual-tasks, in which the participants were athletes competing at any level, and in which at least one of the following variables were investigated: working memory, decision-making, visual search behavior, perception, anticipation, attention, or motor tasks. Articles were screened using pre-defined selection criteria, and methodological quality was assessed by two researchers independently. Following the eligibility criteria, we included 18 articles in the review: 13 on the acute effects, and five on the chronic effects. This review showed that the acute effect of dual-tasks impairs the motor and cognitive performances of athletes (dual-task cost). However, training with dual-tasks (chronic effect) improved working memory skills and attentional control. We conclude that dual-tasks acutely and chronically impacts motor and cognitive performance.

TI  - The association between lithium in drinking water and neuropsychiatric outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis from across 2678 regions containing 113 million people
KW  - Neuropsychiatric outcomes
KW  - lithium
KW  - drinking water
KW  - suicide
KW  - public health
AB  - Background:
   Lithium in drinking water may have significant mental health benefits. We investigated the evidence on the association between lithium concentrations in drinking water and their neuropsychiatric outcomes.
   Methods:
   We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and CINAHL up to 19 January 2020, for peer-reviewed research examining the association between lithium concentrations in drinking water and neuropsychiatric outcomes. We used a pairwise analysis and a random effects model to meta-analyse suicide rates and psychiatric hospital admissions. We assessed for publication bias using Egger's test and Duval and Tweedie's Trim and Fill analysis.
   Results:
   Twenty-seven studies including 113 million subjects were included in this systematic review. Meta-analysis of 14 studies including 94 million people found higher lithium concentrations were associated with reduced suicide rates (r = -0.191, 95% confidence interval = [-0.287, -0.090], p < 0.001) and meta-analysis of two studies including 5 million people found higher lithium concentrations were associated with fewer hospital admissions (r = -0.413, 95% confidence interval = [-0.689, -0.031], p = 0.035). We found significant heterogeneity between studies (Q = 67.4, p < 0.001, I-2 = 80.7%) and the presence of publication bias (Egger's test; t value = 2.90, p = 0.013). Other included studies did not provide sufficient data to analyse other neuropsychiatric outcomes quantitatively.
   Conclusion:
   Higher lithium concentrations in drinking water may be associated with reduced suicide rates and inpatient psychiatric admissions. The relationship with other neuropsychiatric outcomes and complications remains unclear. Further research is required before any public health recommendations can be made.

AB  - Background: Neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV-2 have allowed the hypothesis of several pathogenic mechanisms related to acute and chronic neurological sequelae. However, neuropathological correlates have been poorly systematically investigated, being retrieved from reports of single case or limited case series still. Methods: A PubMed search was carried out to review all publications on autopsy in subjects with "COronaVIrus Disease-19" (COVID-19). Among them, we focused on histological findings of the brain, which were compared with those from the authors' autoptic studies performed in some COVID-19 patients. Results: Only seven studies reported histological evidence of brain pathology in patients deceased for COVID-19, including three with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction evidence of viral infection. All these studies, in line with our experience, showed vascular-related and infection-related secondary inflammatory tissue damage due to an abnormal immune response. It is still unclear, however, whether these findings are the effect of a direct viral pathology or rather reflect a non-specific consequence of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease on the brain. Conclusions: Notwithstanding the limited evidence available and the heterogeneity of the studies, we provide a preliminary description of the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and brain sequelae. Systematic autoptic investigations are needed for accurate detection and adequate management of these patients.

AB  - The number of studies investigating sex differences in executive functions, particularly those using human functional neuroimaging techniques, has risen dramatically in the past decade. However, the influences of sex on executive function are still underexplored and poorly characterized. To address this, we conducted a systematic literature review of functional neuroimaging studies investigating sex differences in three prominent executive control domains of cognitive set-shifting, performance monitoring, and response inhibition. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched. Following the application of exclusion criteria, 21 studies were included, with a total of 677 females and 686 males. Ten of these studies were fMRI and PET, eight were EEG, and three were NIRS. At present, there is evidence for sex differences in the neural networks underlying all tasks of executive control included in this review suggesting males and females engage different strategies depending on task demands. There was one task exception, the 2-Back task, which showed no sex differences. Due to methodological variability and the involvement of multiple neural networks, a simple overarching statement with regard to gender differences during executive control cannot be provided. As such, we discuss limitations within the current literature and methodological considerations that should be employed in future research. Importantly, sex differences in neural mechanisms are present in the majority of tasks assessed, and thus should not be ignored in future research.

AB  - The unmet needs perceived by community-dwelling stroke survivors may truly reflect the needs of patients, which is crucial for pleasant emotional experiences and a better quality of life for community-dwelling survivors not living in institutionalized organizations. The purpose of the study is to identify the scope of unmet needs from the perspectives of stroke patients in the community. A qualitative meta-synthesis was performed according to the Joanna Briggs Institute method. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to February 2020. A total of 24 articles were involved, providing data on 378 stroke survivors. Eight categories were derived from 63 findings, and then summarized into four synthesized findings based on the framework of ICF: (1) unmet needs regarding with the disease-related information; (2) unmet physical recovery and activity/participation needs; (3) unmet needs for social environmental resources; (4) unmet psycho-emotional support needs. We found the framework of ICF mostly complete, but unmet information needs still remain. The needs that are mainly unsatisfied include physical, psychosocial and informational, as well as the practical support from professional or environment resources. The ever-present unmet needs perceived by community-dwelling stroke survivors who do not live in institutions are discoverable and mitigable. Future studies should focus on quantifying unmet needs comprehensively derived from experiential domains, assessing the rationality of the unmet needs expressed by patients' perspectives and developing flexible strategies for long-term and changing needs.

TI  - Fracture Hits in Unconventional Reservoirs: A Critical Review
AB  - "Fracture hit" was initially coined to refer to the phenomenon of an infill-well fracture interacting with an adjacent well during the hydraulic-fracturing process. However, over time, its use has been extended to any type of well interference or interaction in unconventional reservoirs. In this study, an exhaustive literature survey was performed on fracture hits to identify key factors affecting the fracture hits and suggest different strategies to manage fracture hits. The impact of fracture hits is dictated by a complex interplay of petrophysical properties (high-permeability streaks, mineralogy, matrix permeability, natural fractures), geomechanical properties (near-field and far-field stresses, tensile strength, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio), completion parameters (stage length, cluster spacing, pumping rate, fluid and proppant amount), and development decisions (well spacing, well scheduling, fracture sequencing). It is difficult to predict the impact of fracture hits, and they affect both parent and child wells. The impact on the child wells is predominantly negative, whereas the effect on parent wells can be either positive or negative. The "child wells" in this context refer to the wells drilled with pre-existing active/inactive well(s) around. The "parent well" refers to any well drilled without any pre-existing well around. Overall, fracture hits tend to negatively affect both the production and economics of lease development. The optimal approach rests in identifying the reservoir properties and accordingly making field-development decisions that minimize the negative impact of fracture hits. The different strategies proposed to minimize the negative impact of fracture hits are simultaneous lease development, thus avoiding parent/child wells (i.e., rolling-, tank-, and cube-development methods); repressuring or refracturing parent wells; using far-field diverters and high-permeability plugging agents in the child-well fracturing fluid; and optimizing stage and cluster spacing through modeling studies and field tests. Finally, the study concludes with a recommended approach to manage fracture hits. There is no silver bullet, and the problem of fracture hits in each shale play is unique, but by using the available data and published knowledge to understand how fractures propagate downhole, measures can be taken to minimize or even completely avoid fracture hits.

   Constant exposure to endogenous and environmental factors induces oxidative stress and DNA damage. Rare brain disorders caused by defects in DNA repair and DNA damage response (DDR) signaling establish that failure to process DNA damage may lead to neurodegeneration. In this review, we present mechanisms that link DDR with neurodegeneration in these disorders and discuss their relevance for common age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Moreover, we highlight recent insight into the crosstalk between the DDR and other cellular processes known to be disturbed during NDDs.
   Genomic integrity is maintained by DNA repair and the DNA damage response (DDR). Defects in certain DNA repair genes give rise to many rare progressive neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as ocular motor ataxia, Huntington disease (HD), and spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). Dysregulation or dysfunction of DDR is also proposed to contribute to more common NDDs, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Here, we present mechanisms that link DDR with neurodegeneration in rare NDDs caused by defects in the DDR and discuss the relevance for more common age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we highlight recent insight into the crosstalk between the DDR and other cellular processes known to be disturbed during NDDs. We compare the strengths and limitations of established model systems to model human NDDs, ranging from C. elegans and mouse models towards advanced stem cell-based 3D models.

AB  - The idea that a longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) leads to poorer outcomes has contributed to extensive changes in mental health ser-vices worldwide and has attracted considerable research interest over the past 30 years. However, the strength of the evidence underlying this notion is unclear. To address this issue, we conducted an umbrella review of available meta-analyses and performed a random-effects meta-analysis of primary studies. MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched from inception to September 3, 2020 to identify relevant meta-analyses of studies including patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, first-episode psychosis, or affective and non-affective psychosis. Thirteen meta-analyses were included, corresponding to 129 individual studies with a total sample size of 25,657 patients. We detected potential violations of statistical assumptions in some of these meta-analyses. We therefore conducted a new random-effects meta-analysis of primary studies. The association between DUP and each outcome was graded according to a standardized classification into convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or non-significant. At first presentation, there was suggestive evidence for a relationship between longer DUP and more severe negative symptoms (beta=-0.07, p=3.6x10(-5)) and higher chance of previous self-harm (odds ratio, OR=1.89, p=1.1x10(-5)). At follow-up, there was highly suggestive evidence for a relationship between longer DUP and more severe positive symptoms (beta=-0.16, p=4.5x10(-8)), more severe negative symptoms (beta=-0.11, p=3.5x10(-10)) and lower chance of remission (OR=2.16, p=3.0x10(-10)), and suggestive evidence for a relationship between longer DUP and poorer overall functioning (beta=-0.11, p=2.2x10(-6)) and more severe global psychopathology (beta=-0.16, p=4.7x10(-6)). Results were unchanged when analysis was restricted to prospective studies. These effect sizes are clinically meaningful, with a DUP of four weeks predicting >20% more severe symptoms at follow-up relative to a DUP of one week. We conclude that DUP is an important prognostic factor at first presentation and predicts clinically relevant outcomes over the course of illness. We discuss conceptual issues in DUP research and methodological limitations of current evidence, and provide recommendations for future research.

AB  - Background: Exposure to air pollution during the first 1000 days of life (from conception to the 2nd year of life) might be of particular relevance for long-term child health. Changes in molecular markers such as DNA methylation and telomere length could underlie the association between air pollution exposure and pollution related diseases as well as serve as biomarkers for past exposure. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the association between air pollution exposure during pregnancy and the first two years of life and changes in DNA methylation or telomere length in children.
   Methods: PubMed was searched in October 2020 by using terms relative to ambient air pollution exposure, DNA methylation, telomere length and the population of interest: mother/child dyads and children. Screening and selection of the articles was completed independently by two reviewers. Thirty-two articles matched our criteria. The majority of the articles focused on gestational air pollution exposure and measured DNA methylation/ telomere length in newborn cord blood or placental tissue, to study global, candidate-gene or epigenome-wide methylation patterns and/or telomere length. The number of studies in children was limited.
   Results: Ambient air pollution exposure during pregnancy was associated with global loss of methylation in newborn cord blood and placenta, indicating the beginning of the pregnancy as a potential period of susceptibility. Candidate gene and epigenome-wide association studies provided evidence that gestational exposure to air pollutants can lead to locus-specific changes in methylation, in newborn cord blood and placenta, particularly in genes involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, inflammation, growth and early life development. Telomere length shortening in newborns and children was seen in relation to gestational pollutant exposure.
   Conclusions: Ambient air pollution during pregnancy is associated with changes in both global and locus-specific DNA methylation and with telomere length shortening. Future studies need to test the robustness of the association across different populations, to explore potential windows of vulnerability and assess the role of the methylation and telomere length as mediators in the association between early exposure to ambient air pollutants and specific childhood health outcomes.

AB  - The purpose of our scoping review was to describe the current use of mHealth technology for long-term assessment of patient-reported outcomes in community-dwelling individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI). Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of literature meeting these criteria: (1) civilians or military veterans, all ages; (2) self-reported or caregiver-reported outcomes assessed via mobile device in the community (not exclusively clinic/hospital); (3) published in English; (4) published in 2015-2019. We searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) < 1946 to 16 August 2019, MEDLINE InProcess, EPub, Embase, and PsycINFO databases for articles. Thirteen manuscripts representing 12 distinct studies were organized by type of ABI [traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke] to extract outcomes, mHealth technology used, design, and inclusion of ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Outcomes included post-concussive, depressive, and affective symptoms, fatigue, daily activities, stroke risk factors, and cognitive exertion. Overall, collecting patient-reported outcomes via mHealth was feasible and acceptable in the chronic ABI population. Studies consistently showed advantage for using EMA despite variability in EMA timing/schedules. To ensure best clinical measurement, research on post-ABI outcomes should consider EMA designs (versus single time-point assessments) that provide the best timing schedules for their respective aims and outcomes and that leverage mHealth for data collection.

KW  - oxidative stress
KW  - thermal stress

AB  - Simple Summary
   Environmental changes in oxygen concentration, temperature, and mechanical stimulation lead to the activation of specific transcriptional factors and induce the expression of each downstream gene. In general, these responses are protective machinery against such environmental stresses, while these transcriptional factors also regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and organ development in mammals. In the case of pluripotent stem cells, similar response mechanisms normally work and sometimes stimulate the differentiation cues. Up to now, differentiation protocols utilizing such environmental stresses have been reported to obtain various types of somatic cells from pluripotent stem cells. Basically, environmental stresses as hypoxia (low oxygen), hyperoxia, (high oxygen) and mechanical stress from cell culture plates are relatively safer than chemicals and gene transfers, which affect the genome irreversibly. Therefore, protocols designed with such environments in mind could be useful for the technology development of cell therapy and regenerative medicine. In this manuscript, we summarize recent findings of environmental stress-induced differentiation protocols and discuss their mechanisms.
   Pluripotent stem cells have unique characteristics compared to somatic cells. In this review, we summarize the response to environmental stresses (hypoxic, oxidative, thermal, and mechanical stresses) in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their applications in the differentiation methods directed to specific lineages. Those stresses lead to activation of each specific transcription factor followed by the induction of downstream genes, and one of them regulates lineage specification. In short, hypoxic stress promotes the differentiation of ESCs to mesodermal lineages via HIF-1 alpha activation. Concerning mechanical stress, high stiffness tends to promote mesodermal differentiation, while low stiffness promotes ectodermal differentiation via the modulation of YAP1. Furthermore, each step in the same lineage differentiation favors each appropriate stiffness of culture plate; for example, definitive endoderm favors high stiffness, while pancreatic progenitor favors low stiffness during pancreatic differentiation of human ESCs. Overall, treatments utilizing those stresses have no genotoxic or carcinogenic effects except oxidative stress; therefore, the differentiated cells are safe and could be useful for cell replacement therapy. In particular, the effect of mechanical stress on differentiation is becoming attractive for the field of regenerative medicine. Therefore, the development of a stress-mediated differentiation protocol is an important matter for the future.

AB  - Background: Social media has changed the communication landscape, exposing individuals to an ever-growing amount of information while also allowing them to create and share content. Although vaccine skepticism is not new, social media has amplified public concerns and facilitated their spread globally. Multiple studies have been conducted to monitor vaccination discussions on social media. However, there is currently insufficient evidence on the best methods to perform social media monitoring.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the methods most commonly used for monitoring vaccination-related topics on different social media platforms, along with their effectiveness and limitations.
   Methods: A systematic scoping review was conducted by applying a comprehensive search strategy to multiple databases in December 2018. The articles' titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened by two reviewers using inclusion and exclusion criteria. After data extraction, a descriptive analysis was performed to summarize the methods used to monitor and analyze social media, including data extraction tools; ethical considerations; search strategies; periods monitored; geolocalization of content; and sentiments, content, and reach analyses.
   Results: This review identified 86 articles on social media monitoring of vaccination, most of which were published after 2015. Although 35 out of the 86 studies used manual browser search tools to collect data from social media, this was time-consuming and only allowed for the analysis of small samples compared to social media application program interfaces or automated monitoring tools. Although simple search strategies were considered less precise, only 10 out of the 86 studies used comprehensive lists of keywords (eg, with hashtags or words related to specific events or concerns). Partly due to privacy settings, geolocalization of data was extremely difficult to obtain, limiting the possibility of performing country-specific analyses. Finally, 20 out of the 86 studies performed trend or content analyses, whereas most of the studies (70%, 60/86) analyzed sentiments toward vaccination. Automated sentiment analyses, performed using leverage, supervised machine learning, or automated software, were fast and provided strong and accurate results. Most studies focused on negative (n=33) and positive (n=31) sentiments toward vaccination, and may have failed to capture the nuances and complexity of emotions around vaccination. Finally, 49 out of the 86 studies determined the reach of social media posts by looking at numbers of followers and engagement (eg, retweets, shares, likes).
   Conclusions: Social media monitoring still constitutes a new means to research and understand public sentiments around vaccination. A wide range of methods are currently used by researchers. Future research should focus on evaluating these methods to offer more evidence and support the development of social media monitoring as a valuable research design.

TI  - Emotional Eating and Weight Status in Adolescents: A Systematic Review
KW  - emotional eating
KW  - adolescents
KW  - review
KW  - weight status
KW  - BMI
AB  - Background: Despite evidence that emotional eating is associated with weight gain in adults, less is known about this association in adolescents. The purpose of the current study was to conduct a systematic review to assess the association between emotional eating and weight status in adolescents. This study also sought to describe existing measures of emotional eating in adolescents and explore weight-loss interventions that assessed emotional eating in relation to weight status in this population. Methods: Two independent reviewers searched the database PubMed for published or in press peer-reviewed studies that assessed the association between emotional eating and weight status in adolescents aged 12 to 19 years. Studies were excluded from this review if they were not written in the English language, did not include a measure of emotional eating, or were a dissertation study. Results: A total of 13 studies met full inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Of the six longitudinal studies in the review, only one found a prospective association between emotional eating and weight status. The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire was the most widely used measure of emotional eating in the systematic review (n = 6; 46.2%). The one intervention study included in this review found that baseline emotional eating was not associated with weight outcomes 2 years following gastric bypass surgery in obese Swedish adolescents (13-18 years). Conclusions: While there were some inconsistent findings across the studies included in this review, taken as a whole, the results largely do not support an association between emotional eating and elevated weight status or reduced weight loss in adolescents.

AB  - (1) Background: Teenagers (in particular, females) suffering from eating disorders report being not satisfied with their physical aspect and they often perceive their body image in a wrong way; they report an excessive use of websites, defined as PRO-ANA and PRO-MIA, that promote an ideal of thinness, providing advice and suggestions about how to obtain super slim bodies. (2) Aim: The aim of this review is to explore the psychological impact of pro-ana and pro-mia websites on female teenagers. (3) Methods: We have carried out a systematic review of the literature on PubMed. The search terms that have been used are: "Pro" AND "Ana" OR "Blogging" AND "Mia". Initially, 161 publications were identified, but in total, in compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 studies have been analyzed. (4) Results: The recent scientific literature has identified a growing number of Pro Ana and Pro Mia blogs which play an important role in the etiology of anorexia and bulimia, above all in female teenagers. The feelings of discomfort and dissatisfaction with their physical aspect, therefore, reduce their self-esteem. (5) Conclusion: These websites encourage anorexic and bulimic behaviors, in particular in female teenagers. Attention to healthy eating guidelines and policies during adolescence, focused on correcting eating behavioral aspects, is very important to prevent severe forms of psychopathology with more vulnerability in the perception of body image, social desirability, and negative emotional feedback.

AB  - In this paper, DeWitt's formalism for field theories is presented; it provides a framework in which the quantization of fields possessing infinite-dimensional invariance groups may be carried out in a manifestly covariant (non-Hamiltonian) fashion, even in curved space-time. Another important virtue of DeWitt's approach is that it emphasizes the common features of apparently very different theories such as Yang-Mills theories and General Relativity; moreover, it makes it possible to classify all gauge theories in three categories characterized in a purely geometrical way, i.e. by the algebra which the generators of the gauge group obey; the geometry of such theories is the fundamental reason underlying the emergence of ghost fields in the corresponding quantum theories, too. These "tricky extra particles", as Feynman called them in 1964, contribute to a physical observable such as the stress-energy tensor, which can be expressed in terms of Feynman's Green function itself. Therefore, an entire section is devoted to the study of the Green functions of the neutron scalar meson: in flat space-time, the choice of a particular Green's function is the choice of an integration contour in the "momentum" space; in curved space-time the momentum space is no longer available, and the definition of the different Green functions requires a careful discussion itself. After the necessary introduction of bitensors, world function and parallel displacement tensor, an expansion for the Feynman propagator in curved space-time is obtained. Most calculations are explicitly shown.

KW  - neuropsychological profile
AB  - Background: Major depression is a psychiatric disorder characterized neuropsychologically by poor performance in tasks of memory, attention, processing speed, and executive function. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the evidence regarding the neuropsychological profile of people with major depression and to determine which of two explanatory models-the processing speed hypothesis or the cognitive effort hypothesis-has most empirical support. Methods: We searched three relevant databases and reviewed the reference lists of the articles retrieved. The results obtained with the Trail Making Test and the Stroop Color-Word Test were reviewed for 37 studies published between 1993 and 2020. Results: The empirical evidence supports both hypotheses: cognitive effort and processing speed, suggesting that depression is not only characterized by psychomotor slowing but also involves a specific deficit in executive function. Discussion: We discuss potentially relevant variables that should be considered in future research in order to improve knowledge about the neurocognitive profile of depression. The main limitation of this study derives from the considerable heterogeneity of participants with MD, which makes it difficult to compare and integrate the data.

KW  - violence
KW  - healthcare workers
AB  - Objectives
   To provide systematically evaluated evidence of prospective associations between exposure to physical, psychological and gender-based violence and health among healthcare, social care and education workers.
   Methods
   The guidelines on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were followed. Medline, Cinahl, Web of Science and PsycInfo were searched for population: human service workers; exposure: workplace violence; and study type: prospective or longitudinal in articles published 1990-August 2019. Quality assessment was performed based on a modified version of the Cochrane's 'Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies'.
   Results
   After deduplication, 3566 studies remained, of which 132 articles were selected for full-text screening and 28 were included in the systematic review. A majority of the studies focused on healthcare personnel, were from the Nordic countries and were assessed to have medium quality. Nine of 11 associations between physical violence and poor mental health were statistically significant, and 3 of 4 associations between physical violence and sickness absence. Ten of 13 associations between psychological violence and poor mental health were statistically significant and 6 of 6 associations between psychological violence and sickness absence. The only study on gender-based violence and health reported a statistically non-significant association.
   Conclusion
   There is consistent evidence mainly in medium quality studies of prospective associations between psychological violence and poor mental health and sickness absence, and between physical violence and poor mental health in human service workers. More research using objective outcomes, improved exposure assessment and that focus on gender-based violence is needed.

AB  - A great portion of Earth's freshwater and land resources are salt-affected and thus have restricted use or may be come unsuitable for most human activities. Some of the recent scenarios warn that environmental salinization processes will continue to be exacerbated due to global climate change. The most relevant implications and side-effects in ecosystems under excessive salinity are destructive and long lasting (e.g. soil dispersion, water/soil hypersalinity, desertification, ruined biodiversity), often with non-feasible on site remediation, especially at larger scales. Agro-ecosystems are very sensitive to salinization; after a certain threshold is reached, yields and food quality start to deteriorate sharply. Additionally, salinity often coincides with numerous other environmental constrains (drought, waterlogging, pollution, acidity, nutrient deficiency, etc.) that progressively aggravate the threat to food security and general ecosystem resilience. Some well-proven, widely-used and costeffective traditional ameliorative strategies (e.g. conservation agriculture, application of natural conditioners) help against salinity and other constraints, especially in developing countries. Remotely-sensed and integrated data of salt-affected areas combined with in situ and lab-based observations have never been so easy and rapid to acquire, precise and applicable on huge scales, representing a valuable tool for policy-makers and other stakeholders in implementing targeted measures to control and prevent ecosystem degradation (top-tobottom approach). Continued progress in biotechnology and ecoengineering offers some of the most advanced and effective solutions against salinity (e.g. nanomaterials, marker-assisted breeding, genome editing, plantmicrobial associations), albeit many knowledge gaps and ethical frontiers remain to be overcome before a successful transfer of these potential solutions to the industrial-scale food production can be effective.

KW  - SATISFACTION
KW  - BENEFITS
KW  - HARMS
AB  - Background: The evaluation of participant experience is an essential part of monitoring the quality of breast cancer screening services. Satisfaction of services can lead to good adherence and hence affect health outcomes. Methods: We performed a systematic review to assess how satisfied women were with organized breast cancer screening programs. A literature search in Medline, CINAHL, Embase and PsycINFO from 1965 to October 2019 was performed. Articles reporting a quantitative measure of satisfaction collected via questionnaires in programs using mammography as a screening test were selected. We narratively synthesized the data and used tabulated summaries. Results: Out of 4310 individual citations, 3099 abstracts were reviewed by two independent researchers, and 126 articles were selected for full-text reading. Finally, 48 studies, published between 1990 and 2018, were included in analysis, reporting 54 surveys in the context of an organized screening program, 37 on satisfaction with screening mammography, 14 on satisfaction with further assessments and 3 with counseling. Most studies reported a high level of satisfaction for both mammography and further assessments. Despite commonly reported temporary pain, discomfort and anxiety, the willingness to be re-screened was very high. Effective information transfer, the staff's interpersonal skills and quick delivery of results correlated with high satisfaction. Only 7 out of 54 surveys used recognized satisfaction instruments or their modifications. Conclusions: In general, satisfaction with breast cancer screening is high, but its evaluation is mainly performed using non-validated instruments. Emphasis should be put on effective communication, the staffs interpersonal skills and quick delivery of results.

AB  - The swiftly changing climate presents a challenge to organismal fitness by creating a mismatch between the current environment and phenotypes adapted to historic conditions. Acclimatory mechanisms may be especially crucial for sessile benthic marine taxa, such as reef-building corals, where climate change factors including ocean acidification and increasing temperature elicit strong negative physiological responses such as bleaching, disease and mortality. Here, within the context of multiple stressors threatening marine organisms, I describe the wealth of metaorganism response mechanisms to rapid ocean change and the ontogenetic shifts in organism interactions with the environment that can generate plasticity. I then highlight the need to consider the interactions of rapid and evolutionary responses in an adaptive (epi)genetic continuum. Building on the definitions of these mechanisms and continuum, I also present how the interplay of the microbiome, epigenetics and parental effects creates additional avenues for rapid acclimatization. To consider under what conditions epigenetic inheritance has a more substantial role, I propose investigation into the offset of timing of gametogenesis leading to different environmental integration times between eggs and sperm and the consequences of this for gamete epigenetic compatibility. Collectively, non-genetic, yet heritable phenotypic plasticity will have significant ecological and evolutionary implications for sessile marine organism persistence under rapid climate change. As such, reef-building corals present ideal and time-sensitive models for further development of our understanding of adaptive feedback loops in a multi-player (epi)genetic continuum.

AB  - Regular physical activity has multiple health benefits for both the prevention and management of disease, including for older adults. However, additional precautions are needed with ageing given physiological changes and the increasing prevalence of comorbidities. Hot ambient temperatures increase the risks of exercise at any age, but are particularly important given thermoregulatory changes in older people. This narrative review informs planning of physical activity programs for older people living in rural areas with very hot climates for a period of the year. A multi-database search of peer-reviewed literature was undertaken with attention to its relevance to Australia, starting with definitions and standard advice in relation to physical activity programming and the incremental limitations imposed by age, rurality, and extreme heat. The enablers of and barriers to increasing physical activities in older adults and how they can be modified for those living in extreme hot climates is described. We describe multiple considerations in program design to improve safety, adherence and sustaining physical activity, including supervision, simple instructions, provision of reminders, social support, encouraging self-efficacy. Group-based activities may be preferred by some and can accommodate special populations, cultural considerations. Risk management is an important consideration and recommendations are provided to assist program planning.

AB  - Alveolar hypoxia is the most prominent feature of high altitude environment with well-known consequences for the cardio-pulmonary system, including development of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension due to an exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction contributes to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), a life-threatening disorder, occurring at high altitudes in non-acclimatized healthy individuals. Despite a strong physiologic rationale for using vasodilators for prevention and treatment of HAPE, no systematic studies of their efficacy have been conducted to date. Calcium-channel blockers are currently recommended for drug prophylaxis in high-risk individuals with a clear history of recurrent HAPE based on the extensive clinical experience with nifedipine in HAPE prevention in susceptible individuals. Chronic exposure to hypoxia induces pulmonary vascular remodeling and development of pulmonary hypertension, which places an increased pressure load on the right ventricle leading to right heart failure. Further, pulmonary hypertension along with excessive erythrocytosis may complicate chronic mountain sickness, another high altitude maladaptation disorder. Importantly, other causes than hypoxia may potentially underlie and/or contribute to pulmonary hypertension at high altitude, such as chronic heart and lung diseases, thrombotic or embolic diseases. Extensive clinical experience with drugs in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension suggests their potential for treatment of high altitude pulmonary hypertension. Small studies have demonstrated their efficacy in reducing pulmonary artery pressure in high altitude residents. However, no drugs have been approved to date for the therapy of chronic high altitude pulmonary hypertension. This work provides a literature review on the role of pulmonary hypertension in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic high altitude maladaptation disorders and summarizes current knowledge regarding potential treatment options.

AB  - This study presents the results of a systematic review on the prevalence of sexual abuse experienced in adulthood by individuals with intellectual disability. An electronic and manual search of academic journals was performed on four databases via EBSCO Host: Academic Search Complete, PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL Full-Text. In addition, PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Science (core collection) were searched. After an initial selection of 1037 documents, 25 articles remained for quantitative synthesis. The combined prevalence of sexual abuse in adults with intellectual disability was 32.9% (95% CI: 22.7-43.0) and sensitivity analysis revealed that the prevalence was not outweighed by a single study. Overall, the United Kingdom had the highest prevalence (r = 34.1%), and the USA had the lowest (r = 15.2%). The overall prevalence in females was lower (r = 31.8%) than that in males (r = 39.9%). Subgroup analyses revealed that prevalence of sexual abuse was higher in institutionalized individuals. The most prevalent profile of abuser is of a peer with intellectual disability. Prevalence increases from mild to severe levels of intellectual disability and decreases in profound levels. It is also more prevalent when the informant is the individual with intellectual disability than when someone else reports abuse. In sum, one in three adults with intellectual disability suffers sexual abuse in adulthood. Special attention should be paid for early detection and intervention in high risk situations.

AB  - Community care nurses educate adolescents about body image, but their interventions appear to be ineffective. Body dissatisfaction predicts unhealthy behaviors among adolescents. This study aimed to understand the meanings and factors that influence the concept of body image through a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies from the perspective of adolescents. Ten studies published from 2009-2019 were identified by a search of relevant systematic databases between September and December 2019. The review followed the seven steps of meta-ethnography developed by Noblit and Hare, including a line-of-argument. The synthesis revealed six themes: self-perception of body image; opinions of friends and colleagues; opinions of family; specific features of the school environment; expectations perceived across the mass-media; and strategies, practices, and self-management of body image. An explanatory model was developed that showed adolescents' development of body image and the path towards its establishment. In conclusion, these results should be considered to implement strategies to promote a healthy body image in adolescents by community health and mental health nurses.

AB  - Mind-body exercise has been proposed to confer both physical and mental health benefits. However, there is no clear consensus on the neural mechanisms underlying the improvements in health. Herein, we conducted a systematic review to reveal which brain region or network is regulated by mind-body exercise. PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were systematically searched to identify cross-sectional and intervention studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the effect of mind-body exercise on brain structure and function, from their inception to June 2020. The risk of bias for cross-sectional studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist, whereas that of interventional studies was analyzed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis revealed that mind-body exercise modulated brain structure, brain neural activity, and functional connectivity, mainly in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus/medial temporal lobe, lateral temporal lobe, insula, and the cingulate cortex, as well as the cognitive control and default mode networks, which might underlie the beneficial effects of such exercises on health. However, due to the heterogeneity of included studies, more randomized controlled trials with rigorous designs, similar measured outcomes, and whole-brain analyses are warranted.

AB  - Agriculture, and livestock production in particular, is criticized for being a contributor to global environmental change, including emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Methane (CH4) from grazing ruminants accounts for most of livestock's carbon footprint because a large share of them are reared under suboptimal grazing conditions, usually resulting in both low herbage intake and animal performance. Consequently, the CH4 quota attributed to animal maintenance is spread across few or no animal outputs, increasing the CH4 intensity [g CH4/kg live weight (LW) gain or g CH4/kg milk yield]. In this review, the generalized idea relating tropical pastures with low quality and intrinsically higher CH4 intensity is challenged by showing evidence that emissions from animals grazing tropical pastures can equal those of temperate grasses. We demonstrate the medium-to-high mitigation potential of some grazing management strategies to mitigate CH4 emissions from grazing ruminants and stress the predominant role that sward canopy structure (e.g., height) has over animal behavioral responses (e.g., intake rate), daily forage intake and resulting CH4 emissions. From this ecological perspective, we identify a grazing management concept aiming to offer the best sward structure that allows animals to optimize their daily herbage intake, creating opportunities to reduce CH4 intensity. We show the trade-off between animal performance and CH4 intensity, stressing that mitigation is substantial when grazing management is conducted under light-to-moderate intensities and optimize herbage intake and animal performance. We conclude that optimizing LW gain of grazing sheep and cattle to a threshold of 0.14 and 0.7 kg/day, respectively, would dramatically reduce CH4 intensity to approximately 0.2 kg CH4/kg LW gain, as observed in some intensive feeding systems. This could represent a mitigation potential of around 55% for livestock commodities in pasture-based systems. Our results offer new insights to the debate concerning mitigation of environmental impacts of pastoral ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microcystis spp., are Gram-negative, oxygenic, photosynthetic prokaryotes which use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and minerals into organic compounds and biomass. Eutrophication, rising CO2 concentrations and global warming are increasing Microcystis blooms globally. Due to its high availability and protein content, Microcystis biomass has been suggested as a protein source for animal feeds. This would reduce dependency on soybean and other agricultural crops and could make use of "waste" biomass when Microcystis scums and blooms are harvested. Besides proteins, Microcystis contain further nutrients induding lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. However, Microcystis produce cyanobacterial toxins, induding microcystins (MCs) and other bioactive metabolites, which present health hazards. In this review, challenges of using Microcystis blooms in feeds are identified. First, nutritional and toxicological (nutri-toxicogical) data, including toxicity of Microcystis to mollusks, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, mammals and birds, is reviewed. Inclusion of Microcystis in diets caused greater mortality, lesser growth, cachexia, histopathological changes and oxidative stress in liver, kidney, gill, intestine and spleen of several fish species. Estimated daily intake (EDI) of MCs in musde of fish fed Microcystis might exceed the provisional tolerable daily intake (TDI) for humans. 0.04 mu g/kg body mass (bm)/day, as established by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is thus not safe. Musde of fish fed M. aeruginosa is of low nutritional value and exhibits poor palatability/taste. Microcystis also causes hepatotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity and immunotoxidty to mollusks, crustaceans, amphibians, mammals and birds. Microbial pathogens can also occur in blooms of Microcystis. Thus, cyanotoxins/xenobiotics/pathogens in Micmcystis biomass should be removed/degraded/inactivated sufficiently to assure safety for use of the biomass as a primary/main/supplemental ingredient in animal feed. As an ameliorative measure, antidotes/detoxicants can be used to avoid/reduce the toxic effects. Before using Microcystis in feed ingredients/supplements, further screening for health protection and cost control is required. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: To synthesise and investigate how sleep disturbances relate to psychotic symptoms, functioning and Quality of Life (QoL) in At Risk Mental State (ARMS) youth.
   Method: A comprehensive search of six databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and CENTRAL) was conducted. Eligible studies provided data on sleep disturbances or disorders in ARMS patients.
   Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 1962 ARMS patients) including 7 cross-sectional studies, 2 RCTs and 7 cohort studies. Narrative synthesis revealed that self-reported sleep (e.g., general disturbances, fragmented night time sleep and nightmares) was poorer among ARMS patients compared to healthy controls. In the limited studies (n = 4) including objective measurements of sleep disturbances, ARMS patients experienced higher levels of movement during sleep, more daytime naps and increased sleep latency compared to controls. Furthermore, sleep disturbances were associated with attenuated psychotic symptoms and functional outcomes cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Only one study investigated the relationship between sleep and QoL. The exploratory meta-analysis revealed a significant difference in self-reported sleep disturbances measured by the PSQI (mean difference in score: 3.30 (95% CI 1.87, 4.74), p < 0.00001) and SIPS (mean difference in score: 1.58 (95% CI 0.80, 235), p < 0.00001) of ARMS patients compared to control groups.
   Conclusions: ARMS individuals report impaired sleep quality and reduced sleep quantity compared to healthy controls. However, further research is needed to explore the longitudinal relationship between sleep disruptions and QoL in early psychosis. Significant variations in how sleep is measured across studies highlight a need to assess disturbances to sleep using robust and consistent approaches in this patient group. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

KW  - reviews
AB  - Background: The burden of drug abuse is becoming a public health concern in Nigeria. Preventive measures should include identifying the root causes of the burden for targeted intervention. We, therefore, aim to conduct a scoping review of the literature to summarize the findings of epidemiological studies on drug abuse and provisions of drug laws in Nigeria. The review also provides appropriate recommendations as interventions for prevention.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the literature on PubMed to identify information on drug abuse and drug laws in Nigeria from the inception of the database to March 2020. Additional information was retrieved from Google Scholar, a manual search of included articles, discussion with experts on the subject matter, and gray literature. Study selection was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements. Information from gray literature was assessed for quality and accuracy using the AACODS checklist (authority, accuracy, coverage, objectively, date, significance).
   Results: The systematic search of the literature generated 253 studies. Nine articles were obtained from other sources. After the selection process, 23 eligible studies were included for review. A prevalence of 20-40% and 20.9% of drug abuse was reported among students and youths, respectively. Commonly abused drugs include cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, heroin, diazepam, codeine, cough syrup and tramadol. Sources where abusers obtained drugs, were pharmacies/patent medicine shops, open drug markets, drug hawkers, fellow drug abusers, friends, and drug pushers. Drug abuse was common among undergraduates and secondary school students, youths, commercial bus drivers, farmers, and sex workers. Reason for use included to increase physical performance, stress and to derive pleasure. Poor socioeconomic factors and low educational background were the common risk factors associated with drug abuse. We identified several drug laws and policies that were established under government agencies such as the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), National Agency for Foods and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) and a Presidential Advisory Committee.
   Conclusion: Findings from epidemiological studies on drug abuse in Nigeria has demonstrated that the burden of drug abuse is still high despite the existing drug laws, policies, and strategies for prevention. Measures to reduce the burden should involve the community, government, and religious bodies. Preventive measures should target the youths, the students, identified sources of the drugs, reasons and risk factors associated with drug abuse in Nigeria.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia with the aging population has led to scrutiny of the efficacy of cognition-oriented treatments (COTs) aiming to maintain functioning, and delay or prevent further cognitive decline. However, little is known regarding the role of individual differences patient-variables (such as depression, self-efficacy, and motivation) in moderating the efficacy of COTs. This systematic review aimed to identify and analyze COT trials which investigated the relationship between differences in these patient-variables and intervention outcomes for older adults across healthy, MCI, and dementia populations. Of the 4854 studies extracted from the systematic search, 14 were included for analysis. While results were mixed across interventions and populations, on balance, greater depression severity predicted poorer cognitive functioning, and improvement in depressive symptom severity may account for at least part of the cognitive benefits seen at post-intervention. These findings were strongest for studies of MCI populations, with there being limited evidence of a relationship for healthy older adults or those with dementia. Overall, this review demonstrates the need for further investigation into the role of individual differences and clinical variables - particularly depression symptom severity - in attenuating COT outcomes through larger sample, high-quality randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Redox dysfunctions and neuro-oxidative stress play a major role in the pathophysiology and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Glutathione (GSH) and the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio are lowered in oxidative stress conditions and may lead to increased oxidative toxicity. GSH is involved not only in neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative processes, including thiol redox signaling, but also in cell proliferation and differentiation and in the regulation of cell death, including apoptotic pathways. Lowered GSH metabolism and a low GSH/GSSG ratio following oxidative stress are associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions and constitute a critical factor in the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes accompanying PD. This review provides indirect evidence that GSH redox signaling is associated with the pathophysiology of PD. Nevertheless, it has not been delineated whether GSH redox imbalances are a causative factor in PD or whether PD-associated pathways cause the GSH redox imbalances in PD. The results show that antioxidant approaches, including neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory agents, which neutralize reactive oxygen species, may have therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of PD and its progression.

AB  - Introduction: Impulsivity and compulsivity are important constructs, relevant to understanding behaviour in the general population, as well as in particular mental disorders (e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder). The current paper provides a narrative review of self-report impulsivity and compulsivity scales.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted using the following terms: ("impulsivity" OR "compulsivity") AND ("self-report" OR "questionnaire" OR "psychometric" OR "scale").
   Results: 25 impulsive and 11 compulsive scales were identified, which varied considerably in psychometric properties, convenience, and validity. For impulsivity, the most commonly used scales were the BIS and the UPPS-P, whilst for compulsivity, the Padua Inventory was commonly used. The majority of compulsivity scales measured OCD symptoms (obsessions and compulsions) rather than being trans-diagnostic or specific to compulsivity (as opposed to obsessions). Scales capable of overcoming these limitations were highlighted.
   Discussion: This review provides clarity regarding relative advantages and disadvantages of different scales relevant to the measurement of impulsivity and compulsivity in many contexts. Areas for further research and refinement are highlighted.

AB  - Recent focus on the consequences of early life adversity (ELA) in neurobiological research led to a variety of findings suggesting alterations in several physiological systems, such as the cardiovascular system. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we focused on the relationship between early life maltreatment (ELM), one form of ELA, and resting vagal activity indexed by resting-state heart rate variability (HRV). A systematic search of the literature yielded 1 ' 264 hits, of which 32 studies reporting data for group comparisons or correlations were included. By quantitative synthesis of existing studies using random-effect models, we found no evidence for a relationship between ELM exposure and resting vagal activity in principal. Conducting meta-regression analyses, however, we found the relationship between ELM and resting vagal activity to significantly vary as a function of both age and the presence of psychopathology. In light of the current multitude of vastly unclear pathways linking ELM to the onset of disease, we emphasize the need for further research and outline several aspects to consider in future studies.

AB  - Plant endophytic bacteria have received special attention in recent decades for their ability to improve plant response to multiple stresses. A positive effect of endophytes on plant's ability to cope with drought, salinity, nitrogen deficiency, and pathogens have already been demonstrated in numerous studies, and recently this evidence was consolidated in a meta-analysis of published data. Endophytic bacteria have also been implicated in increasing resistance to heavy metals in plants; despite the important biotechnological applications of such effect in heavy metal bioremediation and agriculture, efforts to systematically analyze studies in this field have been limited. In this study, we address this task with the objective of establishing whether the findings made for other types of stresses extend to the response to heavy metals. Specifically, we seek to establish if plant inoculation with plant-growth promoting endophytic bacteria have an impact on their tolerance to heavy metal stress? We carried out a meta-analysis of the effect size of inoculation with endophytic bacteria on the host plant biomass in response to heavy metal stress (aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, copper, chromium, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc), which included 27 (from 76 published in the last 10 years) studies under controlled conditions that evaluated 19 host plants and 20 bacterial genera. Our results suggest that endophytic bacteria increase the biomass production of host plants subjected to different heavy metals, indicating their effectiveness in protecting plants from a wide range of metal toxicities. Stress mitigation by the bacteria was similar among the different plant groups with the exception of non-accumulating plants that benefit most from the symbiotic association. Host identity and heavy metal concentration seem to influence the effect of the bacteria. Our analysis revealed that bacterial consortia provide the greatest benefit although the most common biotechnological applications are not directed towards them, and support the value of endophytic bacteria as an alternative to mitigate heavy metal stress in a wide variety of hosts.

AB  - Aim:
   The review aimed to identify and explore the association of level of support received by people with severe mental illness in supported accommodation and participation.
   Method:
   The authors conducted a systematic search in MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, CINAHL Plus and ASSIA. Searches were restricted to articles published in English and participants aged 18 years and over with severe mental illness. Articles were included based on level of support received in mental health supported accommodation, classified according to the Simple Taxonomy for Supported Accommodation, and three factors of participation: social participation, daily living functioning and personal empowerment. Studies of in-patient settings and nursing homes were excluded. The review protocol is registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42019161808).
   Results:
   Six articles were included in the review from USA, Australia, Sweden and Taiwan. Factors of participation for people living in accommodation with moderate support and accommodation with high support were explored. Data indicated an association between level of support and participation showing that people living in accommodation with moderate support had increased participation compared to people living in accommodation with high support.
   Conclusion:
   This review identified an association between level of formal support and participation. People with SMI living in accommodation with medium support participated in more community occupations, more activities and had a higher level of personal empowerment than people living in accommodation with high support.

AB  - The discovery and development of safinamide, an alpha-aminoamide, has been a valuable addition to the existing clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD). The journey of safinamide dates back to the year 1983, when an alpha-aminoamide called milacemide showed a weak anticonvulsant activity. Milacemide was then structurally modified to give rise to safinamide, which in turn produced robust anticonvulsant activity. The underlying mechanism behind this action of safinamide is attributed to the inhibition of voltage gated calcium and sodium channels. Moreover, owing to the importance of ion channels in maintaining neuronal circuitry and neurotransmitter release, numerous studies explored the potential of safinamide in neurological diseases including PD, stroke, multiple sclerosis and neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonias. Nevertheless, evidence from multiple preclinical studies suggested a potent, selective and reversible inhibitory activity of safinamide against monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B enzyme which is responsible for degrading dopamine, a neurotransmitter primarily implicated in the pathophysiology of PD. Therefore, clinical studies were conducted to assess safety and efficacy of safinamide in PD. Indeed, results from various Phase 3 clinical trials suggested strong evidence of safinamide as an add-on therapy in controlling the exacerbation of PD. This review presents a thorough developmental history of safinamide in PD and provides comprehensive insight into plausible mechanisms via which safinamide can be explored in other neurological and muscular diseases.

AB  - One third of depressive patients do not achieve remission after several steps of treatment and are considered as treatment resistant. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) improves symptoms in 70 to 90% of such cases. Resistant depression is associated with a dysregulation of the immune system with a dysbalance between the pro- and the anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we aimed to measure the kinetic of cytokines levels before, during and at the end of ECT. To test this hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis assessing cytokines plasma levels before, during and after ECT in patients with major depressive disorders. After a systematic database search, means and standard deviations were extracted to calculate standardized mean differences. We found that IL-6 levels increased after 1 or 2 ECT session (p = 0.01) then decrease after 4 ECT sessions (p < 0.01) with no difference at the end of ECT (p = 0.94). A small number of studies were included and there was heterogeneity across them. The present meta-analysis reveals that ECT induces an initial increase of IL-6 levels and a potential decrease of TNF-? levels. No changes on IL-4 and IL-10 levels were found. Further work is necessary to clarify the impact of ECT on peripheral cytokines.

AB  - The nanotechnology enabled the development of nanomaterials (NMs) with a variety of industrial, biomedical, and consumer applications. However, the mechanism of action (MoA) and toxicity of NMs remain unclear, especially in the male reproductive system. Thus, this study aimed to perform a bibliometric and systematic review of the literature on the toxic effects of different types of NMs on the male reproductive system and function in mammalian models. A series of 236 articles related to the in vitro and in vivo reproductive toxicity of NMs in mammalian models were analyzed. The data concerning the bioaccumulation, experimental conditions (types of NMs, species, cell lines, exposure period, and routes of exposure), and the MoA and toxicity of NMs were summarized and discussed. Results showed that this field of research began in 2005 and has experienced an exponential increase since 2012. Revised data confirmed that the NMs have the ability to cross the blood-testis barrier and bioaccumulate in several organs of the male reproductive system, such as testis, prostate, epididymis, and seminal vesicle. A similar MoA and toxicity were observed after in vitro and in vivo exposure to NMs. The NM reproductive toxicity was mainly related to ROS production, oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis. In conclusion, the NM exposure induces bioaccumulation and toxic effects on male reproductive system of mammal models, confirming its potential risk to human and environmental health. The knowledge concerning the NM reproductive toxicity contributes to safety and sustainable use of nanotechnology. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, both in marine and freshwater reservoirs, is a major concern of global environmental protection. Among the drugs that are most commonly used, NSAIDs tend to dominate. Currently, being aware of the problem caused by drug contamination, it is extremely important to evaluate the scale and the full spectrum of its consequences, from short-term to long-term effects. The influence on non-target aquatic animals can take place at many levels, and the effects can be seen both in behaviour and physiology, but also in genetic alterations or reproduction disorders, affecting the development of entire populations. This review summarises all the advances made to estimate the impact of NSAIDs on aquatic animals. Multicellular animals from all trophic levels, inhabiting both inland waters, seas and oceans, have been considered. Particular attention has been paid to chronic studies, conducted at low, environmentally-relevant concentrations, to estimate the real effects of the present pollution. The number of such studies has indeed increased in recent years, allowing for a better insight into the possible consequences of pharmaceutical pollution. It should be stressed, however, that our knowledge is still limited to a few model species, while there are many groups of organisms completely unexplored regarding the effects of drugs. Therefore, the main aim of this paper was to summarise the current state of knowledge on the toxicity of NSAIDs in aquatic animals, also identifying important gaps and major issues requiring further analysis.

AB  - Four most concerned heavy metal pollutants, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury may share common mechanisms to induce metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, recent studies exploring the relationships between MetS and metal exposure presented inconsistent findings. We aimed to clarify the relationship between heavy metal exposure biomarkers and MetS using a meta-analysis and systematic review approach. Literature search was conducted in international and the Chinese national databases up to June 2020. Of selected studies, we extracted the relevant data and evaluated the quality of each study's methodology. We then calculated the pooled effect sizes (ESs), standardized mean differences (SMDs), and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effect meta-analysis approach followed by stratification analyses for control of potential confounders. Involving 55,536 participants, the included 22 articles covered 52 observational studies reporting ESs and/or metal concentrations on specific metal and gender. Our results show that participants with MetS had significantly higher levels of heavy metal exposure [pooled ES = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.23; n = 42, heterogeneity I-2 = 75.6%; and SMD = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.29; n = 32, I-2 = 94.2%] than those without MetS. Pooled ESs in the subgroups stratified by arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury were 1.04 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.10; n = 8, I-2 = 61.0%), 1.10 (0.95, 1.27; 11, 45.0%), 1.21 (1.00, 1.48; 12, 82.9%), and 1.26 (1.06, 1.48; 11, 67.7%), respectively. Pooled ESs in the subgroups stratified by blood, urine, and the other specimen were 1.22 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.38; n = 26, I-2 = 75.8%), 1.06 (1.00, 1.13; 14, 58.1%), and 2.41 (1.30, 4.43; 2, 0.0%), respectively. In conclusion, heavy metal exposure was positively associated with MetS. Further studies are warranted to examine the effects of individual metals and their interaction on the relationship between MetS and heavy metals. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cerebellar development begins during the late embryological period and continues to undergo organizational changes long after birth. The cerebellum is particularly susceptible to developmental abnormalities on exposure to oxidants and free radicals, thus leading to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between reactive oxygen species generation and antioxidant defences which may disrupt signalling pathways, leading to cerebellar anomalies and dysfunction. In this regard, this review assesses current research underlining the importance of the cerebellum, provides an update on substances affecting cerebellar development and highlights some promising antioxidants that may play a role in attenuating toxicity in the developing cerebellum. To accomplish this, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) system was employed and key scientific databases such as Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched to explore and collect information on the cerebellum and the role of antioxidants during its development. Originally, 109 articles were obtained but 22 articles which met the inclusion criteria were selected for the review. These findings provide an updated compilation of antioxidants capable of attenuating oxidative damage in the developing cerebellum, thus allowing future interdisciplinary studies in the form of clinical applications for screening and possible development of novel therapeutic agents from the identified products.

AB  - Evolution fuels interindividual variability in neuroplasticity, reflected in brain anatomy and functional connectivity of the expanding neocortical regions subserving reading ability. Such variability is orchestrated by an evolutionarily conserved, competitive balance between epigenetic, stress-induced, and cognitive-growth gene expression programs. An evolutionary developmental model of dyslexia, suggests that prenatal and childhood subclinical stress becomes a risk factor for dyslexia when physiological adaptations to stress promoting adaptive fitness, may attenuate neuroplasticity in the brain regions recruited for reading. Stress has the potential to blunt the cognitive-growth functions of the predominantly right hemisphere Ventral and Dorsal attention networks, which are primed with high entropic levels of synaptic plasticity, and are critical for acquiring beginning reading skills. The attentional networks, in collaboration with the stress-responsive Default Mode network, modulate the entrainment and processing of the low frequency auditory oscillations (1-8 Hz) and visuospatial orienting linked etiologically to dyslexia. Thus, dyslexia may result from positive, but costly adaptations to stress system dysregulation: protective measures that reset the stress/growth balance of processing to favor the Default Mode network, compromising development of the attentional networks. Such a normal-variability conceptualization of dyslexia is at odds with the frequent assumption that dyslexia results from a neurological abnormality. To put the normal-variability model in the broader perspective of the state of the field, a traditional evolutionary account of dyslexia is presented to stimulate discussion of the scientific merits of the two approaches.

AB  - Introduction: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a commonly used brain stimulation treatment for treatment-resistant or severe depression. This study was planned to find the effects of ECT on brain connectivity by conducting a systematic review and coordinate-based meta-analysis of the studies performing resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) in patients with depression receiving ECT.
   Methods: We systematically searched the databases published up to July 31, 2020, for studies in patients having depression that compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) before and after a course of pulse wave ECT. Meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation method after extracting details about coordinates, voxel size, and method for correction of multiple comparisons corresponding to the significant clusters and the respective rsFC analysis measure with its method of extraction.
   Results: Among 41 articles selected for full-text review, 31 articles were included in the systematic review. Among them, 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis, and a total of 73 foci of 21 experiments were examined using activation likelihood estimation in 10 sets. Using the cluster-level interference method, one voxel-wise analysis with the measure of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations and one seed-voxel analysis with the right hippocampus showed a significant reduction (p < 0.0001) in the left cingulate gyrus (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) and a significant increase (p < 0.0001) in the right hippocampus with the right parahippocampal gyrus, respectively. Another analysis with the studies implementing network-wise (posterior default mode network: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) resting state functional connectivity showed a significant increase (p < 0.001) in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. There was considerable variability as well as a few key deficits in the preprocessing and analysis of the neuroimages and the reporting of results in the included studies. Due to lesser studies, we could not do further analysis to address the neuroimaging variability and subject-related differences.
   Conclusion: The brain regions noted in this meta-analysis are reasonably specific and distinguished, and they had significant changes in resting state functional connectivity after a course of ECT for depression. More studies with better neuroimaging standards should be conducted in the future to confirm these results in different subgroups of depression and with varied aspects of ECT.

AB  - Increasing attention has been given to understanding resilience to brain diseases, often described as brain or cognitive reserve. Among the protective factors for the development of resilience, physical activity/exercise has been considered to play an important role. Exercise is known to induce many positive effects on the brain. As such, exercise represents an important tool to influence neurodevelopment and shape the adult brain to react to life's challenges. Among many beneficial effects, exercise intervention has been associated with cognitive improvement and stress resilience in humans and animal models. Thus, a growing number of studies have demonstrated that exercise not only recovers or minimizes cognitive deficits by inducing better neuroplasticity and cognitive reserve but also counteracts brain pathology. This is evidenced before disease onset or after it has been established. In this review, we aimed to present encouraging data from current clinical and pre-clinical neuroscience research and discuss the possible biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of physical exercise on resilience. We consider the implication of physical exercise for resilience from brain development to aging and for some neurological diseases. Overall, the literature indicates that brain/cognitive reserve built up by regular exercise in several stages of life, prepares the brain to be more resilient to cognitive impairment and consequently to brain pathology.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Personalized treatment choices would increase the effectiveness of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression to the extent that patients differ in interventions that better suit them.
   OBJECTIVE To provide personalized estimates of short-term and long-term relative efficacy of guided and unguided iCBT for depression using patient-level information.
   DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published up to January 1, 2019.
   STUDY SELECTION Eligible RCTs were those comparing guided or unguided iCBT against each other or against any control intervention in individuals with depression. Available individual patient data (IPD) was collected from all eligible studies. Depression symptom severity was assessed after treatment, 6 months, and 12 months after randomization.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS We conducted a systematic review and IPD network meta-analysis and estimated relative treatment effect sizes across different patient characteristics through IPD network meta-regression.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores.
   RESULTS Of 42 eligible RCTs, 39 studies comprising 9751 participants with depression contributed IPD to the IPD network meta-analysis, of which 8107 IPD were synthesized. Overall, both guided and unguided iCBT were associated with more effectiveness as measured by PHQ-0 scores than control treatments over the short term and the long term. Guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT (mean difference [MD] in posttreatment PHQ-9 scores, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.2), but we found no evidence of a difference at 6 or 12 months following randomization. Baseline depression was found to be the most important modifier of the relative association for efficacy of guided vs unguided iCBT. Differences between unguided and guided iCBT in people with baseline symptoms of subthreshold depression (PHQ-9 scores 5-9) were small, while guided iCBT was associated with overall better outcomes in patients with baseline PHQ-9 greater than 9.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this network meta-analysis with IPD, guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT for individuals with depression, benefits were more substantial in individuals with moderate to severe depression. Unguided iCBT was associated with similar effectiveness among individuals with symptoms of mild/subthreshold depression. Personalized treatment selection is entirely possible and necessary to ensure the best allocation of treatment resources for depression.

AB  - Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image which usually leads to low caloric intake and hyperactivity. The underlying mechanism and pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa is still poorly understood. In order to learn more about the underlying pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa and to find further possible treatment options, several animal models mimicking anorexia nervosa have been developed. The aim of this review is to systematically search different databases and provide an overview of existing animal models and to discuss the current knowledge gained from animal models of anorexia nervosa. For the systematic data search, the Pubmed-Medline database, Embase database, and Web of Science database were searched. After removal of duplicates and the systematic process of selection, 108 original research papers were included in this systematic review. One hundred and six studies were performed with rodents and 2 on monkeys. Eighteen different animal models for anorexia nervosa were used in these studies. Parameters assessed in many studies were body weight, food intake, physical activity, cessation of the estrous cycle in female animals, behavioral changes, metabolic and hormonal alterations. The most commonly used animal model (75 of the studies) is the activity-based anorexia model in which typically young rodents are exposed to time-reduced access to food (a certain number of hours a day) with unrestricted access to a running wheel. Of the genetic animal models, one that is of particular interest is the anx/anx mice model. Animal models have so far contributed many findings to the understanding of mechanisms of hunger and satiety, physical activity and cognition in an underweight state and other mechanisms relevant for anorexia nervosa in humans.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and progressive neurodegenerative disease. The presence of beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques and phosphorylated Tau tangles are considered to be the two main hallmarks of AD. Recent findings have shown that different changes in the structure and dynamics of mitochondria play an important role in AD pathology progression. Mitochondria! changes in AD are expressed as enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and changes in the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, targeting mitochondria and associated mitochondrial proteins seems to be a promising alternative instead of targeting A beta and Tau in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The dynamin-related protein (Drp1) is one such protein that plays an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial division and maintenance of mitochondria! structures. Few researchers have shown that inhibition of Drp1 GTPase activity in neuronal cells rescues excessive mitochondrial fragmentation. In addition, the growing evidence revealed that Drp1 can interact with both A beta and Tau protein in human brain tissues and mouse models. In this review, we would like to update existing knowledge about various changes in and around mitochondria related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with particular emphasis on mitophagy and autophagy.

AB  - The incidence of metabolic disorders, as well as of neurodegenerative diseases-mainly the sporadic forms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease-are increasing worldwide. Notably, obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia have been indicated as early risk factors for sporadic forms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These conditions share a range of molecular and cellular features, including protein aggregation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, all of which contribute to neuronal death and cognitive impairment. Rodent models of obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia exhibit all the hallmarks of these degenerative diseases, and represent an interesting approach to the study of the phenotypic features and pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders. We review the main pathological aspects of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as summarized in rodent models of obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.

AB  - Self-stigma is associated with poor clinical and functional outcomes in Serious Mental Illness (SMI). There has been no review of self-stigma frequency and correlates in different cultural and geographic areas and SMI. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to review the frequency, correlates, and consequences of self-stigma in individuals with SMI; (2) to compare self-stigma in different geographical areas and to review its potential association with cultural factors; (3) to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the current body of evidence to guide future research. A systematic electronic database search (PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Ovid SP Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL]) following PRISMA guidelines, was conducted on the frequency, correlates, and consequences of self-stigma in SMI. Out of 272 articles, 80 (29.4%) reported on the frequency of self-stigma (n = 25 458), 241 (88.6%) on cross-sectional correlates of self-stigma and 41 (15.0%) on the longitudinal correlates and consequences of self-stigma. On average, 31.3% of SMI patients reported high self-stigma. The highest frequency was in South-East Asia (39.7%) and the Middle East (39%). Sociodemographic and illness-related predictors yielded mixed results. Perceived and experienced stigma-including from mental health providers-predicted self-stigma, which supports the need to develop anti-stigma campaigns and recovery-oriented practices. Increased transition to psychosis and poor clinical and functional outcomes are both associated with self-stigma. Psychiatric rehabilitation and recovery-oriented early interventions could reduce self-stigma and should be better integrated into public policy.

AB  - The role of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in insulin-dependent signaling is well-known; GLP-1 enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and lowers blood glucose in diabetes. GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) are also widely expressed in the brain, and in addition to its role in neuroprotection, it affects reward pathways. This systematic review aimed to analyze the studies on GLP-1 and reward pathways and its currently identified mechanisms.
   Methods: "Web of Science" and "Pubmed" were searched to identify relevant studies using GLP-1 as the keyword. Among the identified 26,539 studies, 30 clinical, and 71 preclinical studies were included. Data is presented by grouping rodent studies on palatable food intake, drugs of abuse, and studies on humans focusing on GLP-1 and reward systems.
   Results: GLP-1Rs are located in reward-related areas, and GLP-1, its agonists, and DPP-IV inhibitors are effective in decreasing palatable food intake, along with reducing cocaine, amphetamine, alcohol, and nicotine use in animals. GLP-1 modulates dopamine levels and glutamatergic neurotransmission, which results in observed behavioral changes. In humans, GLP-1 alters palatable food intake and improves activity deficits in the insula, hypothalamus, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). GLP-1 reduces food cravings partially by decreasing activity to the anticipation of food in the left insula of obese patients with diabetes and may inhibit overeating by increasing activity to the consumption of food in the right OFC of obese and left insula of obese with diabetes.
   Conclusion: Current preclinical studies support the view that GLP-1 can be a target for reward system related disorders. More translational research is needed to evaluate its efficacy on human reward system related disorders.

KW  - Mental illness

KW  - Schizophrenia
KW  - Bipolar disorder
KW  - Psychosis
KW  - Personality disorder
AB  - Background; Australian national mental health policy outlines the need for a nationally coordinated strategy to address stigma and discrimination, particularly towards people with complex mental illness that is poorly understood in the community. To inform implementation of this policy, this review aimed to identify and examine the effectiveness of existing Australian programs or initiatives that aim to reduce stigma and discrimination.
   Method: Programs were identified via a search of academic databases and grey literature, and an online survey of key stakeholder organisations. Eligible programs aimed to reduce stigma towards people with complex mental illness, defined as schizophrenia, psychosis, personality disorder, or bipolar disorder; or they focused on nonspecific 'mental illness' but were conducted in settings relevant to individuals with the above diagnoses, or they included the above diagnoses in program content. Key relevant data from programs identified from the literature search and survey were extracted and synthesized descriptively.
   Results: We identified 61 programs or initiatives currently available in Australia. These included face-to-face programs (n = 29), online resources (n = 19), awareness campaigns (n = 8), and advocacy work (n = 5). The primary target audiences for these initiatives were professionals (health or emergency), people with mental illness, family or carers of people with mental illness, and members of the general population. Most commonly, programs tended to focus on stigma towards people with non-specific mental illness rather than on particular diagnostic labels. Evidence for effectiveness was generally lacking. Face-to-face programs were the most well-evaluated, but only two used a randomised controlled trial design.
   Conclusions: This study identified areas of strength and weakness in current Australian practice for the reduction of stigma towards people with complex mental illness. Most programs have significant input from people with lived experience, and programs involving education and contact with a person with mental illness are a particular strength. Nevertheless, best-practice programs are not widely implemented, and we identified few programs targeting stigma for people with mental illness and their families, or for culturally and linguistically diverse communities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and LGBTIQ people. These can inform stakeholder consultations on effective options for a national stigma and discrimination reduction strategy.

KW  - Antibiotic-resistance bacteria

KW  - environmental mineral interface
AB  - The antibiotic resistance (AR) is a threatening risk for human health at a global scale. The propagation, dissemination and evolution of AR have been well-studied these years. With development of AR, the antibiotic-resistance bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) have been detected in almost all environmental systems and matrices. Herein, we attempted to summarize how ARB/ARGs become persist when they enter water environments and further be involved in geochemical processes especially at the interface of natural mineral with light irradiation. During the processes, bacteria have different form of transformation and come into stressed or non-stressed states. Their existed forms will be varied including being inactivated, transient tolerance and persistence phenotypes, which make AR problem become stubborn and complicated. Besides, separation of ARB and ARGs further intensified complexity of AR problem after naked ARGs diffusing into water, which acted as reservoir of ARGs and set stage for their transfer between bacteria. Furthermore, acquisition of ARGs mediated plasmid could even bring some advantages or disadvantage to bacteria, making problem more complex and uncontrollable. To enable AR under control, it is critical to understand the mechanism how ARB/ARGs participate in environmental geochemical transformation and in what condition that AR persistence happen. Understanding ponderance of AR persistence is not only key to properly assess its risk, but also to seriously prevent the continued development of AR.

AB  - Current therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) are palliative, of which the levodopa/carbidopa therapy remains the primary choice but is unable to modulate the progression of neurodegeneration. Due to the complication of such a multifactorial disorder and significant limitations of the therapy, numerous genetic approaches have been proved effective in finding out genes and mechanisms implicated in this disease. Following the observation of a higher frequency of PD in Gaucher's disease (GD), a lysosomal storage condition, mutations of glycosylceramidase beta (GBA) encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase) have been shown to be involved and have been explored in the context of PD. GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor of PD. Various studies have revealed the relationships between PD and GBA gene mutations, facilitating a better understanding of this disorder. Various hypotheses delineate that the pathological mutations of GBA minimize the enzymatic activity of GCase, which affects the proliferation and clearance of alpha-synuclein; this affects the lysosomal homeostasis, exacerbating the endoplasmic reticulum stress or encouraging the mitochondrial dysfunction. Identification of the pathological mechanisms underlying the GBA-associated parkinsonism (GBA + PD) advances our understanding of PD. This review based on current literature aims to elucidate various genetic and clinical characteristics correlated with GBA mutations and to identify the numerous pathological processes underlying GBA + PD. We also delineate the therapeutic strategies to interfere with the mutant GCase function for further improvement of the related alpha-synuclein-GCase crosstalks. Moreover, the various therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy, chaperone proteins, and histone deacetylase inhibitors for the treatment of GBA + PD are discussed.

AB  - Facial expressions of emotion play an important role in human social interactions. However, posed expressions of emotion are not always the same as genuine feelings. Recent research has found that facial expressions are increasingly used as a tool for understanding social interactions instead of personal emotions. Therefore, the credibility assessment of facial expressions, namely, the discrimination of genuine (spontaneous) expressions from posed (deliberate/volitional/deceptive) ones, is a crucial yet challenging task in facial expression understanding. With recent advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques, rapid progress has been made in recent years for automatic detection of genuine and posed facial expressions. This paper presents a general review of the relevant research, including several spontaneous vs. posed (SVP) facial expression databases and various computer vision based detection methods. In addition, a variety of factors that will influence the performance of SVP detection methods are discussed along with open issues and technical challenges in this nascent field.

AB  - Despite the high prevalence of self-harm among young people, as well as their extensive use of mobile apps for seeking support with their mental healthcare, it is unclear whether the design of mobile apps aimed at targeting self-harm is underpinned by behavior change techniques (BCTs). To systematically analyze and identify (a) what BCTs and (b) what theories are present in self-harm apps for young people in an attempt to understand their active components. Systematic searches in Apple store, followed by thorough screening, were conducted to identify free mobile apps targeting self-harm in young people. Five apps met the inclusion criteria and were used by trained researchers, who coded identified features against the BCT Taxonomy V1. Despite the majority of apps being underpinned by principles of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), no other information is available about specific theories underpinning these apps. Nineteen of the 93 BCTs were identified across the five apps. The most frequently used BCT was "Distraction" (54.2%), offering ideas for activities to distract users from self-harming. Other techniques that were used often were "Social Support (unspecified)" (27.0%) and "Behavior Substitution" (10.6%). This study provides the first analysis of BCTs present in mental health apps which are designed to target the reduction of self-harm in young people. Future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the apps, as well as assess the effectiveness of the BCTs present.

AB  - Background: Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution poses a great threat on global health. Previous studies have reported that PM2.5 regulates circulating fibrinogen and IL-6 levels in the development of cardiovascular and respiratory disease. However, the correlation between PM2.5 exposure and both biomarkers remains inconsistent.
   Methods: We searched related articles through PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect. Random effects model was used to obtain a pooled estimate effect of both biomarkers as PM2.5 concentration increased by every 10 mg/m(3). Meta-regression analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were conducted to evaluate the heterogeneity, stability and reliability of this meta-analysis.
   Results: A total of 22 articles were included. Each 10 mg/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentration was significantly correlated with a 1.76% increase in circulating fibrinogen level (95% CI: 0.38%-3.14%, P = 0.013) and a 4.66% increase in IL-6 level (95% CI: 1.14%-8.18%, P = 0.010). Subgroup analysis revealed that high-level PM2.5 exposure had a more significant association with circulating IL-6 level (11.67%, 95% CI: 0.66%-22.69%, P = 0.038) than low-level exposure, but this association was not observed in fibrinogen (2.50%, 95% CI: 0.78%-5.77%, P = 0.135). Sensitivity analysis and publication bias test confirmed the stability of the results.
   Conclusion: Circulating fibrinogen and IL-6 significantly increased with exposure to PM2.5, may serve as promising biomarkers for PM2.5-related adverse effects. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - Neurodegeneration
AB  - The review article briefly discusses a hypothesis based on the potential participation of iron dyshomeostasis and iron-mediated cell death (ferroptosis) in the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases. Iron dyshomeostasis (especially cellular iron overload) is considered to be a critical condition of neurodegeneration. The etiopathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, Multiple sclerosis, and others, is different. However, there are several identical cellular processes, such as iron dyshomeostasis (an excessive iron deposition), iron-induced oxidative stress, the accumulation of lipid-generated reactive oxygen species, and ferroptosis that accompany these diseases. Based on the existing theoretical and experimental evidence, the article provides current insight into iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. In addition, special attention is addressed to the possible relationship between cellular iron overload and key pathological features of selected neurodegenerative diseases, such as beta-amyloid and tau proteins, alpha-synuclein, and demyelination. The mechanism by which ferroptosis may be involved in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases is not fully elucidated. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to clarify the hypothesis on the potential role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

KW  - Systematic review
AB  - This systematic review draws together evidence from the literature for the pathological, neurological, cognitive, psychological, and behavioural outcomes of non-fatal strangulation in domestic and sexual violence. A systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO, CINHAL, Proquest, ASSIA, Web of Science, WestLaw, Open Grey, and Ethos was conducted, with no date limits set, to identify eligible studies. Thirty empirical, peer-reviewed studies were found which met the inclusion criteria. Pathological changes included arterial dissection and stroke. Neurological consequences included loss of consciousness, indicating at least mild acquired brain injury, seizures, motor and speech disorders, and paralysis. Psychological outcomes included PTSD, depression, suicidality, and dissociation. Cognitive and behavioural sequelae were described less frequently, but included memory loss, increased aggression, compliance, and lack of help-seeking. However, no studies used formal neuropsychological assessment: the majority were medical case studies or based on self-report. Furthermore, few authors were able to control for possible confounds, including other physical violence and existing psychosocial difficulties. There is therefore a need for further neuropsychological research, focusing on cognitive and behavioural outcomes, using standardized tools, and control groups where possible. This is urgent, given societal normalization of strangulation, and legal systems which often do not reflect the act's severity and its consequences.

AB  - Introduction: Mental health rehabilitation services provide essential support to people with complex and longer term mental health problems. They include inpatient services and community teams providing clinical input to people living in supported accommodation services. This systematic review included international studies evaluating the effectiveness of inpatient and community rehabilitation services.
   Methods: We searched six online databases for quantitative studies evaluating mental health rehabilitation services that reported on one or both of two outcomes: move-on to a more independent setting (i.e. discharge from an inpatient unit to the community or from a higher to lower level of supported accommodation); inpatient service use. The search was further expanded by screening references and citations of included studies. Heterogeneity between studies was too great to allow meta-analysis and therefore a narrative synthesis was carried out.
   Results: We included a total of 65 studies, grouped as: contemporary mental health rehabilitation services (n = 34); services for homeless people with severe mental health problems (n = 13); deinstitutionalization programmes (n = 18). The strongest evidence was for services for homeless people. Access to inpatient rehabilitation services was associated with a reduction in acute inpatient service use post discharge. Fewer than one half of people moved on from higher to lower levels of supported accommodation within expected timeframes.
   Conclusions: Inpatient and community rehabilitation services may reduce the need for inpatient service use over the long term but more high quality research of contemporary rehabilitation services with comparison groups is required.
   Review registration: This review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42019133579).

AB  - Aims. Occupational Burnout (OB) is currently measured through several Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and some of them have become widely used in occupational health research and practice. We, therefore, aimed to review and grade the psychometric validity of the five OB PROMs considered as valid for OB measure in mental health professionals (the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the Pines' Burnout Measure (BM), the Psychologist Burnout Inventory (PBI), the OLdenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI)).
   Methods. We conducted systematic literature searches in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE databases. We reviewed studies published between January 1980 and September 2018 following a methodological framework, in which each step of PROM validation, the reference method, analytical technics and result interpretation criteria were assessed. Using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments we evaluated the risk of bias in studies assessing content and criterion validity, structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, measurement error, hypotheses testing and responsiveness of each PROM. Finally, we assessed the level of evidence for the validity of each PROM using the GRADE approach.
   Results. We identified 6541 studies, 19 of which were included for review. Fifteen studies dealt with MBI whereas BM, PBI, OLBI and CBI were each examined in only one study. OLBI had the most complete validation, followed by CBI, MBI, BM and PBI, respectively. When examining the result interpretation correctness, the strongest disagreement was observed for MBI (27% of results), BM (25%) and CBI (17%). There was no disagreement regarding PBI and OLBI. For OLBI and CBI, the quality of evidence for sufficient content validity, the crucial psychometric property, was moderate; for MBI, BM and PBI, it was very low.
   Conclusion. To be validly and reliably used in medical research and practice, PROM should exhibit robust psychometric properties. Among the five PROMs reviewed, CBI and, to a lesser extent, OLBI meet this prerequisite. The cross-cultural validity of these PROMs was beyond the scope of our work and should be addressed in the future. Moreover, the development of a diagnostic standard for OB would be helpful to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the PROMs and further reexamine their validity.

AB  - Within affective science, the central line of inquiry, animated by basic emotion theory and constructivist accounts, has been the search for one-to-one mappings between six emotions and their subjective experiences, prototypical expressions, and underlying brain states. We offer an alternative perspective: semantic space theory. This computational approach uses wide-ranging naturalistic stimuli and open-ended statistical techniques to capture systematic variation in emotion-related behaviors. Upwards of 25 distinct varieties of emotional experience have distinct profiles of associated antecedents and expressions. These emotions are high-dimensional, categorical, and often blended. This approach also reveals that specific emotions, more than valence, organize emotional experience, expression, and neural processing. Overall, moving beyond traditional models to study broader semantic spaces of emotion can enrich our understanding of human experience.

AB  - The importance of crude oil has come at a great cost. In many developing economies of the world, it can be described as the bitter-sweet crude for its double-edged impacts on the welfare, wellness and wellness of the people. Agitations and restiveness remain characteristic features of Niger Delta following claims of exploitation and neglect of the local population by the multinationals. Literature on the environmental and public health impacts of crude oil was searched from relevant databases such as google scholar, Science Direct, Scopus and PubMed. This paper is a translational scientific and toxicological insight on what should be done by the major players rather than casting unending aspersions. Since living near oil spills and crude oil production sites is an environmental stressor occasioned by exposure to both chemical pollutants and physical menace that are all detrimental to health, cumulative risk assessment CRA is proposed as a viable approach for a comprehensive understanding of the size of this problem. Multinational oil companies should support development of Environmental Medicine Research which will in turn generate data on both how to harness the natural resources to combat the public health issues associated with oil exploration and the mitigation and remediation of the environment. This endeavor will create a waste-to-wealth program that will pacify the restiveness in oil exploring communities. It will be interesting to know that in the same environment that breeds the elephant-in the-parlor lies the natural antidotes to check-mate the public health malady.

KW  - HEALTH
AB  - Background
   COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, by the World Health Organization. The pandemic has had unprecedented worldwide implications, in particular on marginalized populations.
   Aims
   The aim of this study is to review the impact of the pandemic on patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
   Method
   A number of databases were searched for this review, including PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Search terms included psychosis and COVID-19, schizophrenia and COVID-19, and severe mental illness and COVID-19. We included all English language papers and preprints. The final search was done on 15 July 2020.
   Results
   Forty-seven relevant studies were identified and included in this review. Studies were summarised into five main subcategories: potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical health outcomes of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, impact on mental health outcomes, review of case reports and case series to date, treatment recommendation guidelines and risk of increased prevalence of psychosis.
   Conclusions
   Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This patient population has a number of risk factors, including psychosocial adversities and illness related factors. Continuous monitoring and long-term studies of the impact of the pandemic on this patient population are required.

AB  - Background Awareness of burnout and its implications within the medical field has been growing. However, an understanding of the prevalence and consequences of burnout among underrepresented minority (URM), specifically underrepresented minority in medicine (UiM) populations, is not readily available.
   Objective To examine literature investigating burnout among UiM compared to non-UiM, with particular attention to which measures of burnout are currently being used for which racial/ethnic groups.
   Methods The authors identified peer-reviewed articles, published in English through systematic examination using PubMed, PsycINFO, Countway Discovery Medicine, and Web of Science databases. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were summarized and study quality was assessed.
   Results Sixteen studies assessing racial/ethnic differences in burnout were eligible for inclusion. Nearly all studies were cross-sectional (n = 15) in design and conducted among populations in North America (n = 15). Most studies examined burnout among medical students or physicians and used the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Differences in burnout among UiM and non-UiM are inconclusive, although several studies have nuanced findings.
   Conclusion Increased focus on burnout measurement, conceptualization, and mitigation among UiM populations may be useful in improving recruitment, retention, and thriving.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change, namely climate alterations induced by human activities, is causing some issues to agricultural systems for their vulnerability to extreme events. Forecasts predict a global population increase in the near years that will exacerbate this situation, elevating the global demand for food. It will pose severe concerns in terms of natural resource usage and availability. Agriculture is one of the anthropogenic activities that will be more affected in the future. Climate extremes menace to affect the quantity and quality of crop production severely. Drought, water and soil salinity are considered among the most problematic factors that anthropogenic climate change will increase. This complex and worrying scenario requires the urgent implementation of sustainable measures which are capable of improving crop yield and quality, fostering the robustness and resilience of cropping systems.
   Among the more current methodology, the use of natural plant biostimulants (PBs) has been proposed to improve plant resistance to abiotic environmental stresses. The advantage of using these substances is due to their effectiveness in improving crop productivity and quality. Therefore, in this review, the most recent researches dealing with the use of natural PBs for improving plant resistance to drought and salinity, in an anthropogenic climate change scenario, have been reported and critically discussed.

AB  - BackgroundHealth and social care workers (HSCWs) have carried a heavy burden during the COVID-19 crisis and, in the challenge to control the virus, have directly faced its consequences. Supporting their psychological wellbeing continues, therefore, to be a priority. This rapid review was carried out to establish whether there are any identifiable risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes amongst HSCWs during the COVID-19 crisis.MethodsWe undertook a rapid review of the literature following guidelines by the WHO and the Cochrane Collaboration's recommendations. We searched across 14 databases, executing the search at two different time points. We included published, observational and experimental studies that reported the psychological effects on HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.ResultsThe 24 studies included in this review reported data predominantly from China (18 out of 24 included studies) and most sampled urban hospital staff. Our study indicates that COVID-19 has a considerable impact on the psychological wellbeing of front-line hospital staff. Results suggest that nurses may be at higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during this pandemic, but no studies compare this group with the primary care workforce. Furthermore, no studies investigated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social care staff. Other risk factors identified were underlying organic illness, gender (female), concern about family, fear of infection, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and close contact with COVID-19. Systemic support, adequate knowledge and resilience were identified as factors protecting against adverse mental health outcomes.ConclusionsThe evidence to date suggests that female nurses with close contact with COVID-19 patients may have the most to gain from efforts aimed at supporting psychological well-being. However, inconsistencies in findings and a lack of data collected outside of hospital settings, suggest that we should not exclude any groups when addressing psychological well-being in health and social care workers. Whilst psychological interventions aimed at enhancing resilience in the individual may be of benefit, it is evident that to build a resilient workforce, occupational and environmental factors must be addressed. Further research including social care workers and analysis of wider societal structural factors is recommended.

KW  - Perpetration
KW  - Victimization
KW  - Prevention
KW  - Randomized controlled trial
AB  - Introduction: Adolescent dating violence (ADV), including psychological, physical, threatening, and/or sexual abuse between adolescent romantic partners, is an epidemic in the United States, with youth report rates ranging from 15 to 77% for perpetration and 14-73% for victimization. ADV victimization is associated with multiple adverse outcomes in both adolescence and adulthood (e.g., suicidal ideation, substance use, bullying), as is ADV perpetration (e.g., sexually transmitted infections, intimate partner violence in adulthood). Given the high prevalence and profound impact of ADV on youth in the US, many prevention efforts have emerged in the past 20 years. Previous reviews of these efforts have focused primarily on school-based interventions or have broadly reviewed programs including all research design types and outcomes. This review is the first to provide a comprehensive, quantitative synthesis of all existing ADV prevention programs tested using randomized controlled trial designs with a control group, specifically measuring ADV perpetration and/or victimization as outcomes.
   Methods: Employing a systematic literature search and screening protocol, nine studies were identified for meta-analysis.
   Results: Results indicate that ADV prevention programs may decrease the risk of emotional, physical, and sexual perpetration, as well as emotional and physical victimization.
   Conclusions: This is the first review to uncover significant intervention effects on the actual occurrence of ADV, with previous reviews only finding effects on outcomes such as ADV knowledge and attitude. Findings suggest that ADV prevention programs are promising and may warrant implementation more broadly with youth, and this review provides methodological suggestions for future research evaluating new ADV prevention programs.

AB  - Background: Diabetic retinopathy is a common microvascular complication in diabetic patients and is considered the main cause of visual loss worldwide. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition, which compromises dental supporting tissues. The chronic bacterial challenge in periodontitis is a persistent source of inflammatory mediators that may be associated with insulin resistance, increasing the risk of complications of diabetes mellitus. This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence in the association between diabetic retinopathy and periodontitis.
   Methods: This review was registered under the number CRD 42019142267. A search strategy in five electronic databases and a gray literature source was performed based on the PECO acronym. After data extraction, the qualitative synthesis and risk of bias analyses were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The level of evidence of all studies taken together was evaluated through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
   Results: Out of the 253 citations screened, five cross-sectional studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis, in which two were judged to be of good quality, one as fair quality, and two as poor quality. Among the included studies, a significant relationship between the severity of periodontitis (CAL > 5 mm) and the severity of diabetic retinopathy (p < 0.05) was reported by four studies. Also, an association between both diseases in non-obese adults was found after adjustments [OR 2.206 (1.114-4.366); p = 0.0232). However, the analysis of evidence by GRADE assessment was rated as low.
   Conclusions: Although the results of individual studies suggest an association between diabetic retinopathy and periodontitis, the quality of the body of evidence was judged to be low by the GRADE approach. Further studies with larger sample sizes, adequate models of cofounders' adjustments, and prospective analysis of periodontitis and diabetes conditions ought to be conducted to clarify this association.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 prevention and mitigation efforts were abrupt and challenging for most countries with the protracted lockdown straining socioeconomic activities. Marginalized groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of the pandemic such as human rights abuses and violations which can lead to psychological distress. In this review, we focus on mental distress and disturbances that have emanated due to human rights restrictions and violations amidst the pandemic. We underscore how mental health is both directly impacted by the force of pandemic and by prevention and mitigation structures put in place to combat the disease.
   Methods: We conducted a review of relevant studies examining human rights violations in COVID-19 response, with a focus on vulnerable populations, and its association with mental health and psychological well-being. We searched PubMed and Embase databases for studies between December 2019 to July 2020. Three reviewers evaluated the eligibility criteria and extracted data.
   Results: Twenty-four studies were included in the systematic inquiry reporting on distress due to human rights violations. Unanimously, the studies found vulnerable populations to be at a high risk for mental distress. Limited mobility rights disproportionately harmed psychiatric patients, low-income individuals, and minorities who were at higher risk for self-harm and worsening mental health. Healthcare workers suffered negative mental health consequences due to stigma and lack of personal protective equipment and stigma. Other vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, and refugees also experienced negative consequences.
   Conclusions: This review emphasizes the need to uphold human rights and address long term mental health needs of populations that have suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. Countries can embed a proactive psychosocial response to medical management as well as in existing prevention strategies. International human rights guidelines are useful in this direction but an emphasis should be placed on strengthening rights informed psychosocial response with specific strategies to enhance mental health in the long-term. We underscore that various fundamental human rights are interdependent and therefore undermining one leads to a poor impact on the others. We strongly recommend global efforts toward focusing both on minimizing fatalities, protecting human rights, and promoting long term mental well-being.

AB  - Background Substance use is a serious public health problem in the world, and the relapse rate among abstinent substance users is very high. The purpose of this study was to clarify the factors affecting substance use relapse based on the ecological approach by reviewing the relevant literature.
   Methods Applying different search strategies, we searched electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Psychinfo, Embase, Science Direct as well as Magiran, Iran Medex, and SID up to June 2018. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist was employed for critical appraisal. All searches were limited to studies published in English and Persian.
   Results The literature search identified 3481 articles. After screening titles, abstracts, and full texts, 39 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings were classified based on ecological model (intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, environment, community, public policy). The most frequent factors affecting substance use relapse at any level of the ecological model included unpleasant emotion (at the intrapersonal level), addicted friends and family disputes (at the interpersonal level), poor follow up (at the organizational level), society rejection (at the community level), drug availability and unhealthy environment (at the environmental level).
   Conclusion According to the findings of the present study, it is indicated that designing interventions approaches based on the ecological model to prevent relapse of substance use seems to be useful.

This study aims to investigate: 1) the cultural factors related to stigmatizing beliefs about mental illness in Pacific Rim region, and 2) culture-specific measures and interventions on stigma of mental illness.MethodsA systematic search of papers was conducted in the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google scholar through January 2003 to April 2019.ResultsForty-one studies in Pacific Rim region which met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The rate of stigma of mental illness (e.g., public stigma: from 25.4 to 85.2%) was relatively high in Pacific Rim region. Culture factors (e.g., Collectivism, Confucianism, face concern and familism, religion and supernatural beliefs) contributed to people's stigmatizing behaviors and attitudes toward persons with mental illness, their relatives and mental health professionals. Certain measurements were developed and employed to assess different type of cultural factors related to stigma of mental illness.ConclusionsCultural factors play an important role in influencing the rate and performance of stigma of mental illness. Further research on stigma of mental illness and culture-specific interventions to reduce the stigma should be conducted in the Pacific Rim region.

KW  - Scoping review
AB  - BackgroundSuicide and risk management protocols in mental health research aim to ensure patient safety, provide vital information on how to assess suicidal ideation, manage risk, and respond to unexpected and expected situations. However, there is a lack of literature that identifies specific components and strategies to include in suicide and risk management protocols (SRMPs) for mental health research. The goal of this scoping review was to review academic and grey literature to determine core components and associated strategies, which can be used to inform SRMPs in mental health research.Methods and analysisThe methodological framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley was used for this scoping review. The search strategy, conducted by a medical librarian, was multidisciplinary and included seven databases. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility criteria in each document and used a standardized charting form to extract relevant data. The extracted data were then examined using qualitative content analysis. Specifically, summative content analysis was used to identify the core components and strategies used in SRMPs. The data synthesis process was iterative.ResultsThis review included 36 documents, specifically 22 peer-reviewed articles and 14 documents from the grey literature. Five core components of SRMPs emerged from the reviewed literature including: training; educational resources for research staff; educational resources for research participants; risk assessment and management strategies; and clinical and research oversight. Potentials strategies for risk mitigation within each of the core components are outlined.ConclusionsThe five core components and associated strategies for inclusion in SRMPs will assist mental health researchers in conducting research safely and rigorously. Findings can inform the development of SRMPs and how to tailor them across various research contexts.

AB  - Esketamine is a promising drug which can induce antidepressant effects in Major Depression Disorder (MDD). Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been implemented to assess the efficacy and safety of esketamine for the treatment of MDD. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis to assess adverse effect profiles of esketamine for the treatment of MDD. We searched RCTs which were implemented from January 2010 to June 2020 by searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. Finally, four RCTs with 551 patients were included in our study. We pooled 551 patients from 4 RCTs. Compared with placebo. an increased risk of adverse effects was observed in our analysis. After using esketamine, the risk of nausea (RR = 2.34, 95% CI, 1.04 to 5.25, P = 0.04), dissociation (RR = 4.54, 95% CI, 2.36 to 8.73, P < 0.00001), dizziness (RR = 3.00, 95% CI, 1.80 to 5.00, P <0.0001), vertigo (RR = 7.47, 95% CI, 2.55 to 21.86, P= 0.0002), hypoesthesia (RR = 5.68, 95% CI, 2.06 to 15.63, P = 0.0008), sedation (RR = 3.96, 95% CI, 1.29 to 12.15. P = 0.02) and paresthesia(RR = 3.05, 95% CI, 1.07 to 8.65, P = 0.04)were significantly increased compared with placebo. Our synthesized data analysis revealed drug specific risk profiles. The most frequent adverse effects under treatment with esketamine were nausea, dissociation, dizziness, vertigo, hypoesthesia.sedation and paresthesia.

A sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out method and subgroup analysis by region were performed.ResultsA total of 21 studies were included in the analysis. Every 10 mu g/m(3) increment in PM2.5 and PM10 resulted in a 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5-1.5) and 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2-0.6) increase in hospital admission or ER visit for pneumonia, respectively. Every 1ppm increase of CO and 10ppb increase of NO2, SO2, and O-3 was associated with 4.2% (95% CI: 0.6-7.9), 3.2% (95% CI: 1.3-5.1), 2.4% (95% CI: -2.0-7.1), and 0.4% (95% CI: 0-0.8) increase in pneumonia-specific hospital admission or ER visit, respectively. Except for CO, the sensitivity analyses yielded similar results, demonstrating the robustness of the results. In a subgroup analysis by region, PM2.5 increased hospital admission or ER visit for pneumonia in East Asia but not in North America.ConclusionBy combining the inconsistent findings of several studies, this study revealed the associations between short-term exposure of air pollutants and pneumonia-specific hospital admission or ER visit, especially for PM and NO2. Based on the results, stricter intervention policies regarding air pollution and programs for protecting human respiratory health should be implemented.

AB  - This review presents compiled results of complex biomonitoring studies that have been conducted in the Holy Cross Mountains, south-central part of Poland, since the 1990s. The significance of these studies results from several aspects: (i) a number and a variety of plant organisms used, e.g., mosses, lichens, coniferous and deciduous trees, and their tissues (wood, bark, needles, leaves, the aboveground parts of several vascular plants); (ii) applications of a broad scope of instrumental methods aiming at determining major and trace elements (including rare earth elements), organic compounds (PAHs, PCBs, phenols), and stable sulfur isotopes (delta S-34); and (iii) different methodological and environmental issues addressed. The comparison and interpretation of results derived from seventeen sampling campaigns carried out between 1994 and 2017 are a valuable source of information on the following: (i) bioaccumulative properties of organisms used in air quality monitoring, (ii) identification and variations of local and regional pollution sources and geochemical landscape patterns and processes over years, and (iii) establishing environmental factors that variously affected chemical composition of plants growing under physiological stress, including roadside vegetation and plants from acid mine drainage areas.

AB  - Tinnitus refers to the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus. This can be problematic and can lead to health problems in some sufferers, including effects on cognitive functions such as attention and memory. Although several studies have examined the effectiveness of tinnitus interventions, e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy and sound therapy, it is still unclear as to the overall quality and limitations of these studies and whether their results could be generalized. Clarification is also needed as to whether poor cognitive function will lead to a less favorable intervention outcome in tinnitus patients. The present systematic review was therefore designed to critically appraise and synthesize findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of tinnitus intervention and its effects on cognition. The methodology followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Medline (PubMed), Embase, and PsycINFO were searched. Only RCTs that compared the effectiveness of a tinnitus intervention and a measure of cognitive function in adult participants with tinnitus were included. A total of 8 studies involving 610 participants tested using 11 cognitive function assessment tools (e.g., Stroop Color and Word Test and Visual Continuous Performance Task) and 5 tinnitus intervention outcome measurements (e.g., Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Tinnitus Questionnaire) were included and analyzed. The outcomes of the review suggest that tinnitus intervention not only facilitates tinnitus management but also improves cognitive functions. It is likely that cognition and emotion play an important role in a patient's adjustment to tinnitus. Whether cognition can predict treatment outcomes is unclear due to insufficient evidence. Future research is needed using a standardized assessment protocol focusing on the effect of sound-based interventions on tinnitus severity and cognitive functions. Studies on whether cognitive function measurement can be used as a predictor for the effectiveness of tinnitus therapy are also needed.

AB  - The association between religion and health has been the subject of growing interest in academia. However, limited reviews of such studies in Canada exist. The paper systematically reviews and synthesizes existing literature on the relationship between spirituality and health in Canada. Available general databases such as: Medline; Web of Science, PubMed, Sociological abstract, Social Service s, Google scholar, Humanities International Index, JSTOR, CPI.Q Canadian Periodicals, and American Theological Library Association were searched for the period between 2000 and April 2019 inclusive. Collected data were then systematically analysed for common themes about spirituality and health in Canada. In total, 151 articles were found, but only 128 had relevance with the study objectives. Overall, the analysis showed that religion and spirituality do influence health behaviours, and well-being. However, more gender-based studies need to be conducted to tease out the differences in religion/spirituality and health across different genders, and ethnic groups in Canada.

AB  - Outpatient civil commitment (OCC) requires the provision of needed-treatment, as a less restrictive alternative (LRA) to psychiatric-hospitalization in order to protect against imminent-threats to health and safety associated with severe mental illness (SMI). OCC-reviews aggregating all studies report inconsistent outcomes and interpret such as intervention failure. This review, considering those studies whose outcome criteria are consistent with the provisions of OCC-law, seeks to determine OCC-effectiveness in meeting its legislated objectives. This review incorporated studies from previous systematic-reviews, used their search methodology, and added investigations through August 2020. Selected OCC-studies evaluated samples of all eligible patients in a jurisdiction. Their outcome-measures were threats to health or safety or the receipt of needed-treatment exclusive of post-OCC-assignment-hospitalization, the latter being the OCC-default for providing needed-treatment in the absence of an LRA and dependent on bed-availability. A study's evidence-quality was evaluated with the Berkeley Evidence Ranking and the New Castle Ottawa systems. Thirty-nine OCC-outcome-studies in sixoutcome-areas directly addressed OCC-statute objectives: 21 considered imminent threats to health and safety, 10 compliance with providing needed-treatment, and 8 conformity to the LRA-standard. With the top evidence-rank equal to one, the studies M = 2.55. OCC-assignment was associated with reducing mortality-risk, increasing access to acutemedical-care, and reducing risks of violence and victimization. It enabled reaching these objectives as a LRA to hospitalization and facilitated the use of community-services by individuals refusing such assistance when outside of OCC-supervision. OCC's appears to enable recovery by reducing potentially life-altering health and safety risks associated with SMI.

AB  - Cortical thickness (CTh) via surface-based morphometry analysis is a popular method to characterize brain morphometry. Many studies have been performed to investigate CTh abnormalities in migraine. However, the results from these studies were not consistent and even conflicting. These divergent results hinder us to obtain a clear picture of brain morphometry regarding CTh alterations in migraine. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) is a promising technique to quantitatively pool individual neuroimaging studies to identify consistent brain areas involved. Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and SinoMed) and other sources (bioRxiv and reference lists of relevant articles and reviews) were systematically searched for studies that compared regional CTh differences between patients with migraine and healthy controls (HCs) up to May 15, 2020. A CBMA was performed using the Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images approach. In total, we identified 16 studies with 17 datasets reported that were eligible for the CBMA. The 17 datasets included 872 patients with migraine (average sample size 51.3, mean age 39.6 years, 721 females) and 949 HCs (average sample size 59.3, mean age 44.2 years, 680 females). The CBMA detected no statistically significant consistency of CTh alterations in patients with migraine relative to HCs. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis verified this result to be robust. Metaregression analyses revealed that this CBMA result was not confounded by age, gender, aura, attack frequency per month, and illness duration. Our CBMA adds to the evidence of the replication crisis in neuroimaging research that is increasingly recognized. Many potential confounders, such as underpowered sample size, heterogeneous patient selection criteria, and differences in imaging collection and methodology, may contribute to the inconsistencies of CTh alterations in migraine, which merit attention before planning future research on this topic.

AB  - This piece examines and critiques the massive literature on China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It details how research currently seems stuck on the road to nowhere. In addition, it identifies a number of the potholes that collective research endeavors are hitting such as that they are poorly synchronized. It also stresses that lines of analysis are proliferating rather than optimizing, with studies broadening in thematic coverage, rather than becoming deeper. It points out that BRI participants are regularly related to the role of a bit player in many analyses and research often is disconnected from other literatures. Among other things, this article recommends analysts focus on the Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI) or Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) in specific regions or countries. It also argues for a research core that focuses on the implementation issue (i.e., the issue of MSRI and SREB project implementation), project effects (i.e., the economic and political costs and benefits of projects), and the translation issue (i.e., the domestic and foreign policy effects of projects) and does work that goes beyond the usual suspects. On a related note, research need to identify, more precisely, participants and projects, undertake causal analysis, and take into account countervailing factors. Furthermore, studies need to make more extensive use of the Chinese foreign policy literature. Moreover, works examining subjects like soft power need to improve variable conceptualization and operationalization and deliver more nuanced analyses. Finally, studies, especially by area specialists, should take the area, not the China, perspective.

AB  - There is increasing awareness that oxidative stress may be implicated in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we aimed to investigate blood oxidative stress marker profile in ASD children by a meta-analysis. Two independent investigators systematically searched Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library and extracted data from 87 studies with 4928 ASD children and 4181 healthy control (HC) children. The meta-analysis showed that blood concentrations of oxidative glutathione (GSSG), malondialdehyde, homocysteine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, nitric oxide, and copper were higher in children with ASD than that of HC children. In contrast, blood reduced glutathione (GSH), total glutathione (tGSH), GSH/GSSG, tGSH/GSSG, methionine, cysteine, vitamin B9, vitamin D, vitamin B12, vitamin E, S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine, and calcium concentrations were significantly reduced in children with ASD relative to HC children. However, there were no significance differences between ASD children and HC children for the other 17 potential markers. Heterogeneities among studies were found for most markers, and meta-regressions indicated that age and publication year may influence the meta-analysis results. These results therefore clarified blood oxidative stress profile in children with ASD, strengthening clinical evidence of increased oxidative stress implicating in pathogenesis of ASD. Additionally, given the consistent and large effective size, glutathione metabolism biomarkers have the potential to inform early diagnosis of ASD.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recently declared a pandemic by the WHO. This outbreak threatens not only physical health but also has significant repercussions on mental health. In recent world history, major infectious outbreaks were associated with severe mental health sequelae, including suicide. In this study, we systematically review the literature on suicidal outcomes during major international respiratory outbreaks, including COVID-19. We reviewed descriptive and analytic articles addressing suicide during major international respiratory outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Psyclnfo databases and then utilized an independent method for study selection by a pair of reviewers. Two reviewers completed data abstraction and conducted a narrative summary of the findings. Our search generated 2,153 articles. Nine studies (three descriptive, five analytical, and one with mixed methodology) were eligible. The included studies were heterogeneous, divergent in methods, and with a low degree of evidence. Deducing an association between pandemics, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes remains thus poorly supported. Future research with better methodological characteristics, the use of longitudinal studies, and a focus on suicide as the primary outcome would allow for an in-depth understanding and formulation of the scope of this problem.

AB  - While there is significant investigation and investment in brain and neurodegenerative disease research, current understanding of the etiologies of illnesses like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and brain cancer remains limited. Environmental exposure to the pollutant formaldehyde, an emerging neurotoxin widely used in industry, is suspected to play a critical role in mediating these disorders, although findings are limited and inconsistent. Focusing on highly exposed groups, we performed a meta-analysis of human epidemiological studies of formaldehyde and neurodegenerative disease (N = 19) or brain tumors (N = 12). To assess the biological plausibility of observed associations, we then conducted a bioinformatics analysis using WikiPathways and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and identified candidate genes and pathways that may be related to these interactions. We reported the meta-relative risk (meta-RR) of ALS following high exposures to formaldehyde was increased by 78% (meta-RR = 1.78, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.20-2.65). Similarly, the meta-RR for brain cancer was increased by 71% (meta-RR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.07-2.73) among highly exposed individuals. Multiple sensitivity analyses did not reveal sources of heterogeneity or bias. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that the oxidative stress genes superoxide dismutase (SOD1, SOD2) and the pro-inflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were identified as the top relevant genes, and the folate metabolism, vitamin B-12 metabolism, and the ALS pathways were highly affected by formaldehyde and related to the most brain diseases of interest. Further inquiry revealed the two metabolic pathways are also intimately tied with the formaldehyde cycle. Overall, our bioinformatics analysis supports the link of formaldehyde exposure to ALS or brain tumor reported from our meta-analysis. This new multifactorial approach enabled us to both interrogate the robustness of the epidemiological data and identify genes and pathways that may be involved in these interactions, ultimately lending strong evidence and potential biological plausibility for the association between formaldehyde exposure and brain disease.

AB  - Social spatial cognition refers to the interaction between self, place, and partners, with emphasis on the impact of the social environment on spatial behavior and on how individual spatial representations converge to form collective spatial behavior i.e., common places and routes. Recent studies suggest that in addition to their mental representation (cognitive map) of the physical environment, humans and other animals also have a social cognitive map. We suggest that while social spatial cognition relies on knowledge of both the physical and the social environments, it is the latter hat predominates. This dominance is illustrated here in the modulation of spatial behavior according to dynamic social interactions, ranging from group formation to an attenuation of drug-induced stereotypy through the mere presence of a normal subject. Consequently we suggest that the numerous studies on the biobehavioral controlling mechanisms of spatial behavior (i.e. the hippocampal formation, animal models for mental disorders) should also consider the social environment rather than solely focusing on the spatial behavior of lone animals.

AB  - Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely spread ecological contaminants. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are present with mobile genetic elements (MGE) in the bacteria. There are molecular evidences that PAHs may induce the development of ARGs in contaminated soils. Also, the abundance of ARGs related to tetracycline, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, ampicillin, and fluoroquinolones is high in PAH-contaminated environments. Genes encoding the efflux pump are located in the MGE and, along with class 1 integrons, have a significant role as a connecting link between PAH contamination and enrichment of ARGs. The horizontal gene transfer mechanisms further make this interaction more dynamic. Therefore, necessary steps to control ARGs into the environment and risk management plan of PAHs should be enforced. In this review, influence of PAH on evolution of ARGs in the contaminated soil, and its spread in the environment, has been described. The co-occurrence of antibiotic resistance and PAH degradation abilities in bacterial isolates has raised the concerns. Also, presence of ARGs in the microbiome of PAH-contaminated soil has been discussed as environmental hotspots for ARG spread. In addition to this, the possible links of molecular interactions between ARGs and PAHs, and their effect on environmental health has been explored.

AB  - Background There are more than half a million military Reserve Component (RC) connected children but little research that has examined the effects of parental deployment on this population. Much of what is known comes from active duty families. There is a need to better understand the effects of RC parental deployment on children and families. Objective This scoping review examined the current literature on the impact of parental deployment in RC families. Method We used the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) to guide the search, data charting, synthesis, and review. We searched PubMed, PsychInfo, Scopus, and Social Work s databases for relevant articles published in English on impact of parental deployment on military connected children. Results Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria out of the total 1393 studies identified in our search. These studies were all conducted in the USA, and years of publication ranged between 2002 and 2017. Findings were classified into four themes, namely, role changes for non-deployed parents, behavior changes in children, child anxiety and fear, and support networks. Conclusions Knowing if deployment impacts RC children and families differently from active duty families will guide development of appropriate policy and programs that better support them during periods of prolonged active duty service and to enhance recruitment and retention. Therefore, further research is needed to identify and develop interventions to address problems highlighted in our themes including, behavioral problems in children, child anxiety and fear, and role changes for the non-deployed parents/children, and support networks.

AB  - Body-specific mental rotation is thought to rely upon internal representations of motor actions. Handedness is a source of distinctly different motor experience that shapes the development of such internal representations. Yet, the influence of handedness upon hand mental rotation has never been systematically evaluated. Five databases were searched for studies evaluating hand left/right judgement tasks in adults. Two independent reviewers performed screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal. Eighty-seven datasets were included, with 72 datasets pooled; all had unclear/high risk of bias. Meta-analyses showed that right-handers were faster, but not more accurate, than left-handers at hand mental rotation. A unique effect of handedness was found on performance facilitation for images corresponding to the dominant hand. Meta-analyses showed that right-handers were quicker at identifying images of right hands than left hands-a dominance advantage not evident in left-handers. Differing hand representations (more lateralised hand dominance in right-handers) likely underpin these findings. Given potential differences between hand preference and motor performance, future research exploring their distinct contributions to mental rotation is warranted.

AB  - Background: Communication difficulties are one of the primary symptoms associated with dementia, and mobile applications have shown promise as tools for facilitating communication in patients with dementia (PwD). The literature regarding mobile health (mHealth) applications, especially communications-based mHealth applications, is limited.
   Objective: This review aims to compile the existing literature on communications-based mobile applications regarding dementia and assess their opportunities and limitations. A PICO framework was applied with a Population consisting of PwD, Interventions consisting of communication technology, focusing primarily on mobile applications, Comparisons between patient well-being with and without technological intervention, and Outcomes that vary but can include usability of technology, quality of communication, and user acceptance.
   Methods: Searches of PubMed, IEEE XPLORE, and ACM Digital Library databases were conducted to establish a comprehensive understanding of the current literature on dementia care as related to 1) mobile applications, 2) communication technology, and 3) communications-based mobile applications. Applying certain inclusion and exclusion criteria, yielded a set of articles (n = 11).
   Results: The literature suggests that mobile applications as tools for facilitating communication in PwD are promising. Mobile applications are not only feasible socially, logistically, and financially, but also produce meaningful communication improvements in PwD and their caregivers. However, the number of satisfactory communications-based mobile applications in the mHealth marketplace and their usability is still insufficient.
   Conclusion: Despite favorable outcomes, more research involving PwD using these applications are imperative to shed further light on their communication needs and on the role of mHealth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed the entire world population's physical and mental wellbeing irrespective of the person being infected or not. Flourishing numbers of new research recommends physiotherapy for the management of COVID-19 patients. However, there are cavities in the study in the recommendation of physiotherapy specific to the current pandemic.
   OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to synthesize physiotherapy-related articles to COVID-19 and summarize their efficacious highlights.
   METHODS: For the literature search PubMed, PEDro, DOAJ and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were used. The keywords included "Physiotherapy", "COVID-19", and "Coronavirus". The Boolean search was applied as required. Selection criteria included studies that included physiotherapy intervention as a tool for recovery of COVID-19. Exclusion criteria included animal studies, non-COVID-19 studies and physiotherapy as an adjunct treatment. The study evaluated evidence of all full-text articles in English from December 2019 to August 2020.
   RESULTS: Of the retrieved 577 articles, 390 articles were excluded at the title and abstract screening. 167 articles underwent full-text screening and further narrowed to 11 studies matching the expected criteria. 156 studies were excluded for various reasons.
   CONCLUSION: The current study findings support that physiotherapy interventions facilitate recovery in COVID-19 patients and act as a protective barrier. Further results include a reduced length of stay in intensive care and reduced treatment cost since this outbreak has brought a significant economic burden to many countries.

AB  - The personality traits commonly seen in abdominal surgeons remains undefined, and its potential influence on decision-making and patient outcomes underexplored. This systematic review identified studies on abdominal surgeons who had undergone validated personality testing, with assessment of decision-making and post-operative patient outcomes. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (University of York, UK (CRD42019151375)). MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and Cochrane Library databases were searched using the keywords: surgeon; surgeon personality; outcomes. All study designs were accepted including adult visceral surgeons published in English. Five articles from 3056 abstracts met our inclusion criteria and one article was identified from hand searches with two reviewers screening studies. Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Six studies included 386 surgeons. Studies assessing personality using the Five Factor Model (four studies, 329 surgeons) demonstrated higher levels of conscientiousness (self-discipline, thoughtfulness), extraversion (sociability, emotional expression) and openness (creative, conventional) in surgeons versus population norms. Surgeon characterisation of agreeableness and emotional stability was less clear, with studies reporting mixed results. Post-operative outcomes were reported by only one study. Further exploration of the influence of surgeon personality and its influence on decision-making is necessary to deliver patient-centred care and targeted non-technical skills training for surgeons.

AB  - Background:
   Regression discontinuity designs are non-randomized study designs that permit strong causal inference with relatively weak assumptions. Interest in these designs is growing but there is limited knowledge of the extent of their application in health. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review of the use of regression discontinuity designs in health research.
   Methods:
   We included studies that used regression discontinuity designs to investigate the physical or mental health outcomes of any interventions or exposures in any populations. We searched 32 health, social science, and gray literature databases (1 January 1960 to 1 January 2019). We critically appraised studies using eight criteria adapted from the What Works Clearinghouse Standards for regression discontinuity designs. We conducted a narrative synthesis, analyzing the forcing variables and threshold rules used in each study.
   Results:
   The literature search retrieved 7658 records, producing 325 studies that met the inclusion criteria. A broad range of health topics was represented. The forcing variables used to implement the design were age, socioeconomic measures, date or time of exposure or implementation, environmental measures such as air quality, geographic location, and clinical measures that act as a threshold for treatment. Twelve percent of the studies fully met the eight quality appraisal criteria. Fifteen percent of studies reported a prespecified primary outcome or study protocol.
   Conclusions:
   This systematic review demonstrates that regression discontinuity designs have been widely applied in health research and could be used more widely still. Shortcomings in study quality and reporting suggest that the potential benefits of this method have not yet been fully realized.

AB  - Background: Climate change affects human health with those with the least resources being most vulnerable. However, little is known about the impact of climate change on human health and effective adaptation methods in informal settlements in low- and middle-income countries.
   Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to identify, characterize, and summarize research evidence on the impact of climate change on human health in informal settlements and the available adaptation methods and interventions.
   Method: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. The four bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched. Eligibility criteria were all types of peer-reviewed publications reporting on climate change or related extreme weather events (as defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), informal settlements (as defined by UN-Habitat), low- and middle-income countries (as defined by the World Bank) and immediate human health impacts. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using a predefined form.
   Results: Out of 1197 studies initially identified, 15 articles were retained. We found nine original research articles, and six reviews, commentaries, and editorials. The articles were reporting on the exposures flooding, temperature changes and perceptions of climate change with health outcomes broadly categorized as mental health, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases. Six studies had a geographical focus on Asia, four on Africa, and one on South America, the remaining four articles had no geographical focus. One article investigated an adaptation method for heat exposure. Serval other adaptation methods were proposed, though they were not investigated by the articles in this review.
   Conclusion: There is a paucity of original research and solid study designs. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the impact, the most effective adaptation methods and to inform policy making.

AB  - Background: One in seven people living in the United Kingdom (UK) is an international migrant, rendering migrants an important population group with diverse and dynamic health and healthcare needs. However, there has been no attempt to map contemporary trends within migration health research conducted in the UK. The aim of this scoping review was to describe trends within migration health research and identify gaps for future research agendas.
   Methods: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for empirical research with a primary focus on the concepts "health" and "migrants" published between 2001 and 2019. Findings were analysed using the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health Conceptual Framework for Migration and Health.
   Results: In total, 399 studies were included, with almost half (41.1%; 164/399) published in the last five years of the study period between 2015 and 2019 and a third (34.1%; 136/399) conducted in London. Studies included asylum seekers (14.8%; 59/399), refugees (12.3%; 49/399), and undocumented migrants or migrants with insecure status (3.5%; 14/399), but most articles (74.9%; 299/399) did not specify a migrant sub-group. The most studied health topics were specific disease outcomes such as infectious diseases (24.1% of studies) and mental health (19.1%) compared to examining systems or structures that impact health (27.8%), access to healthcare (26.3%), or specific exposures or behaviours (35.3%).
   Conclusions: There has been a growing interest in migration health. Ensuring a diverse geographic distribution of research conducted in the UK and disaggregation by migrant sub-group is required for a nuanced and region-specific understanding of specific health needs, interventions and appropriate service delivery for different migrant populations. More research is needed to understand how migration policy and legislation intersect with both the social determinants of health and access to healthcare to shape the health of migrants in the UK.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Integrated approaches are valued in several occupational health strategic programmatic orientations. A better understanding of the use of integrative prevention in coordinating measures is needed to develop its use in workplaces.
   OBJECTIVE: Identify workplace integrative prevention approaches and definitions of prevention (primary, secondary and tertiary) in the literature.
   METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O'Malley (2005). The literature search was carried out in three databases without date restrictions. In order to be retained, the articles needed to address at least two levels of prevention using an integrative approach in a workplace setting. A qualitative analysis was conducted.
   RESULTS: The review yielded 16 published articles between 1995 and 2017. The articles addressed mental health, musculoskeletal disorder prevention and comprehensive approaches. Integrative prevention approaches are diverse and are not always named as such. Prevention definitions are not homogenous.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review identified some of the integrative prevention characteristics aimed at coordinated action for prevention in the workplace and to clarify measures taken at different levels of prevention. Further studies are needed to elaborate on the implementation of integrative prevention in the workplace.

AB  - care (e.g. sunscreens) and plastic items. This review summarizes the available data regarding the toxic effects of OUVFs on marine and freshwater organisms and generates the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values necessary for assessing ecological risk. Through a systematic search of the literature, 89 studies were identified and ecotoxicological data extracted. Collectively, these studies described toxicity testing with 39 OUVF from 10 structural classes, with derivatives of benzophenones (49%) and camphors (16%) most studied. There was a bias towards selecting freshwater species (61%), and evaluating single OUVF effects (87%) rather than OUVF mixtures. Short-term (acute) experimentation (58%) was marginally more common than long-term (chronic) testing (42%). Reproductive, developmental, genetic, and neurological toxicity were the most commonly identified effects in aquatic organism, and were associated with molecular interactions with steroid receptors, DNA, or the production of reactive oxygen species. Species sensitivity distribution and/or assessment factors were used to calculate PNECs for 22 OUVFs and the risk quotients for 12 OUVFs. When using maximum concentrations, high risk was observed for six OUVFs in marine environments (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, octocrylene, padimate-O, benzophenone-1, and oxybenzone, ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate), and for four OUVFs in freshwater environments (ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, avobenzone and oxybenzone). When using median concentrations, a risk to marine environments was observed for oxybenzone. The results of this review underline that there is limited knowledge of the pathological effects of OUVFs and their metabolites in aquatic environments, and this inhibits the development of informed water-quality guidelines.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Degenerating neurons contain abnormal aggregates called Lewy bodies, that are predominantly composed of the misfolded and/or mutated alpha-synuclein protein. Post-translational modifications, cellular stress, inflammation and gene mutations are thought to trigger its pathological misfolding and aggregation. With alpha-synuclein pathology being strongly associated with dopaminergic neuronal toxicity, strategies aimed to reduce its burden are expected to be beneficial in slowing disease progression. Moreover, multiple sources of evidence suggest a cell-to-cell transmission of pathological alpha-synuclein in a prion-like manner. Therefore, antibodies targeting extra- or intracellular alpha-synuclein could be efficient in limiting the aggregation and transmission. Several active and passive immunization strategies have been explored to target alpha-synuclein. Here, we summarize immunotherapeutic approaches that were tested in pre-clinical or clinical studies in the last two decades in an attempt to treat Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Headache disorders have a strong impact on sufferers' lives. However, the "content" of assessment instruments addressing concepts, such as disability and quality of life (QoL), has not comprehensively been addressed. We searched SCOPUS for research papers in which outcome measures were used in adult populations of patients with migraine, tension-type headache (TTH), and cluster headache (CH). The content of single instruments was then mapped against the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. A total of 150 papers and 26 instruments were included: 15 addressed disability or impact, two addressed work-related difficulties, and nine addressed QoL. Few instruments were commonly used across the conditions and covered domains of functioning were impact on daily life activities, homework, school, and work-related tasks, leisure time, informal and family relations, pain, emotional difficulties, energy level, and impulse control. Most of the research is based on instruments that were developed for migraine, which is critical for CH, and the impact of headache disorders on work-related activities is poorly acknowledged. Further research is needed to expand the scope of headaches impact on daily life activities, and on environmental factors relevant to headache disorders to raise knowledge on the less represented areas, e.g., TTH impact.

AB  - Prevention of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in healthcare workers (HCWs) facing the current COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge worldwide as HCWs are likely to experience acute and chronic, often unpredictable, occupational stressors leading to PTSS. This review aims to analyze the literature to discover which topics have been focused on and what the latest developments are in managing the occupational risk of PTSS in HCWs during the current pandemic. For the purpose of this review, we searched for publications in MEDLINE/Pubmed using selected keywords. The articles were reviewed and categorized into one or more of the following categories based on their subject matter: risk assessment, risk management, occurrence rates. A total of 16 publications matched our inclusion criteria. The topics discussed were: "Risk Assessment", "Occurrence Rates", and "Risk Management". Young age, low work experience, female gender, heavy workload, working in unsafe settings, and lack of training and social support were found to be predictors of PTSS. This review's findings showed the need for urgent interventions aimed at protecting HCWs from the psychological impact of traumatic events related to the pandemic and leading to PTSS; healthcare policies need to consider preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, in HCWs.

AB  - The aim of this study was to conduct a literature scope review of the association between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and health outcomes. The search was carried out in the PubMed, Web of Science and LILACS data-bases. Studies that assessed the association between the consumption of ultra-processed foods, identified on the NOVA classification, and health outcomes were eligible. The review process resulted in the selection of 63 studies, which were analyzed in terms of quality using a tool from the National Institutes of Health. The outcomes found included obesity, metabolic risk markers, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, asthma, depression, frailty, gastrointestinal diseases and mortality indicators. The evidence was particularly consistent for obesity (or indicators related to it) in adults, whose association with the consumption of ultra-processed foods was demonstrated, with dose-response effect, in cross-sectional studies with representative samples from five countries, in four large cohort studies and in a randomized clinical trial. Large cohort studies have also found a significant association between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer - even after adjusting for obesity. Two cohort studies have shown an association of ultra-processed foods consumption with depression and four cohort studies with all-cause mortality. This review summarized the studies' results that described the association between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and various non-communicable diseases and their risk factors, which has important implications for public health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has put health systems under unprecedented pressure, challenging their work-force, especially nurses.
   OBJECTIVE: The current paper presented a review of the early literature concerning emerging nursing challenges during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   METHODS: A systematic search of the published literature between January and May 2020 was carried out in Medline, Science Direct, and Google Scholar to identify relevant quantitative and qualitative studies.
   RESULTS: Twenty-two original articles were retrieved, the majority of which were survey studies from China. Synthesis of the evidence resulted in four overarching themes including "being physically and mentally drained in the face of fear and uncertainty," "shortage of personal protective equipment and usability issues," "psychosomatic disturbances among nurses," and "moderators to mitigate nurses' challenges."
   CONCLUSIONS: Providing care for demanding COVID-19 patients, nurses experienced a gruelling situation, during which a significant amount of psychological and physical distress was inflicted to them. However, receiving proper support from their organization and society could improve the condition substantially. Further research is required to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses, especially from Western countries.

KW  - Occupational Therapy
KW  - Concept Formation
KW  - Review Literature as Topic
AB  - The production of national knowledge of occupational therapy took place in a contextualized way in line with the development of the profession, in its various fields of activity. In the last decades, there were propositions of expanded perspectives and concepts that point to possible interlocutions in this plurality. In this sense, this study sought to understand how the expression "life production" has been used by the national literature of occupational therapy, based on a bibliographic review of multidimensional strategy. The LILACS database and national journals in the area were consulted, identifying 29 productions with the expression "production of life" or similar, to analyze the profile of publications, authors, and references and the meanings involved in understanding the expression. The findings have become numerically more significant over the past ten years; they were related to themes of mental health, social field, arts and culture, collective health, occupational therapy foundations, and work field; and the references cited occupational therapy, psychiatry, philosophy, psychoanalysis, psychology, collective health, and anthropology authors. The analysis of their understanding indicated four categories: work as social emancipation; expanding health actions; creative experience and cultural transformation; and maintenance of existence. Emphasizing the consistent production on the expression 'life production', we concluded that the expression involves meanings in the construction of know-how more connected to the world, the different ways of existing and being the protagonist of life.

AB  - Objective: The present study aims to examine childbirth self-efficacy levels with potential moderating variables.
   Methods: The systematic searches were conducted in nine databases in July 2019. The PRISMA checklist was used. The quality of studies was evaluated by two researchers. The random-effect model was used in the present meta-analysis. The heterogeneity tests and moderator analyses were performed. There were 18 eligible articles.
   Results: Results indicated that childbirth self-efficacy levels do not change based on parity (Q = 0.784, p = 0.376 for efficacy expectancy, Q = 0.190, p = 0.663 for outcome expectancy). The between-study variance was not significant for subdimensions of CBSEI (Qb = 1.531, p = .216), which means no significant difference between OE and EE levels was found. The between-study variance was not significant for OE levels (Qb = 0.333,p = .847), which means no significant difference was found between Outcome-AL, Outcome-SS, and OE-16. The moderator analysis, including Efficacy-AL, Efficacy-SS, and EE-16 presented a higher pooled mean score for EE-16 (111.56; 95% CI = 98.66 to 124.46). However, the between-study variance was not significant for EE levels (Qb = 4.240, p = .120). Despite the moderator analysis, the finding of high heterogeneity suggests the need for further studies which examine the concept of childbirth self-efficacy with additional variables.
   Conclusion: The study presents that childbirth self-efficacy levels do not change based on parity, stages of labor and subdimensions of CBSEI. Researchers need to examine the concept of childbirth self-efficacy with new variables for further clarify of concept.

KW  - PREVALENCE
AB  - Background While recent reviews highlight high burnout prevalence among physicians in the World Health Organization's (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), there has been a limited exploration into the role of gender and related factors in this problem.
   Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the prevalence of physician burnout and its relationship to gender, physician specialties, and age in the WHO's EMR based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Al Manhal databases and synthesized the findings from the included studies.
   Results Among the 78 studies included, data was available from 16/22 (72.7%) countries and territories in the EMR covering a total of 16 016 physicians. The pooled prevalence of overall burnout among physicians in the region was estimated to be 24.5%. Among the sub-components of burnout, we estimated a high pooled prevalence of 44.26% for emotional exhaustion followed by 37.83% for depersonalization and 36.57% for low personal achievement. There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence across the countries in the EMR and among the sub-categories of specialist medical practitioners. There was no statistically significant difference across the two genders at a regionally aggregated level.
   Conclusions The levels of physician burnout including the three sub-components in EMR are high by any standards. Based on our review of available studies, it is difficult to ascertain gender differences with certainty in burnout levels among physicians in the EMR nations. There is a need for better quality studies in this area.

AB  - Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer. Many countries in Europe have already implemented systematic screening programmes as per the recommendations by the European Union. The impact of screening is highly dependent on participation rates. The aim of the study was to identify barriers, facilitators and modifiers to participation in systematised, stool sample-based, publicly financed CRC screening programmes.
   Study design: Systematic review.
   Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL Google Scholar and PsycINFO was undertaken. We included both qualitative and quantitative studies reporting on barriers and facilitators (excluding sociodemographic variables) to participation in stool sample -based CRC screening. Barriers and facilitators to participation were summarised and analysed.
   Results: The inclusion criteria were met in 21 studies. Reported barriers and facilitators were categorised into the following seven themes (examples): psychology (fear of cancer), religion (believing cancer is the will of God), logistics (not knowing how to conduct the test), health-related factors (mental health), knowledge and awareness (lack of knowledge about the test), role of the general practitioner (being supported in taking the test by the general practitioner), and environmental factors (knowing someone who has participated in a screening programme). Six studies reported that non-participation was not due to a negative attitude towards screening for CRC.
   Conclusion: Many barriers to screening were found. It is important to work with peoples' fear of screening. Moreover, this review suggests that it might be possible to increase participation rates, if the population-wide awareness and knowledge of potential health benefits of CRC screening are increased and proper logistical support is provided.

AB  - The worldwide prevalence of obesity has dramatically increased, mostly in children and adolescents. The Emotional Eating theoretical model has proposed that the failure in emotional regulation could represent a risk factor for establishing maladaptive overeating behavior that represents an inadequate response to negative emotions and allows increasing body-weight. This systematic review investigates the relationship between overeating and both emotional regulation and emotional intelligence in childhood and adolescence, considering both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Moreover, another goal of the review is evaluating whether emotional regulation and emotional intelligence can cause overeating behaviors. The systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA-statement in the databases Medline, PsychArtcles, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences, and allows 484 records to be extracted. Twenty-six studies were selected according to inclusion (e.g., studies focused on children and adolescents without clinical conditions; groups of participants overweight or with obesity) and exclusion (e.g., studies that adopted qualitative assessment or cognitive-affective tasks to measure emotional variables; reviews, commentary, or brief reports) criteria detailed in the methods. Cross-sectional studies showed a negative association between emotional regulation and overeating behavior that was confirmed by longitudinal studies. These findings highlighted the role of maladaptive emotion regulation on overeating and being overweight. The relationship between these constructs in children and adolescents was consistent. The results indicated the complexity of this association, which would be influenced by many physiological, psychological, and social factors. These findings underline the need for further studies focused on emotion regulation in the development of overeating. They should analyze the mediation role of other variables (e.g., attachment style, peer pressure) and identify interventions to prevent and reduce worldwide overweight prevalence.

AB  - Background: Although many studies have investigated the association between stress and risk of dementia, findings are inconsistent due to the variation in the measures used to assess stress.
   Objective: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between psychological stress (including neuroticism, stressful life events, and perceived stress) and the risk of incident dementia and mild cognitive impairment in adults.
   Methods: PsycINFO, Embase, and MEDLINE were searched to October 2020 for eligible observational, prospective studies. Of the 1,607 studies screened, 26 (24 unique cohorts) were included in the qualitative analysis and 16 (15 unique cohorts) were included in the quantitative analysis.
   Results: Across studies, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (Cases/Total N= 207/860: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.38) and all-cause dementia (Cases/Total N= 203/1,882: HR =1.44, 95% CI= 1.07-1.95). Exposure to two or more stressful life events (versus none) was significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (Cases/Total N= 3,354/11,597: HR =1.72, 95% CI = 1.14-2.60), while one or more stressful life events was not. Higher neuroticism was significantly associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease dementia (Cases/Total N= 497/4,771: HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01-1.12), but not all-cause dementia.
   Conclusion: This review suggests that psychological stress in adulthood is associated with an increased risk of dementia. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying these associations.

KW  - child development
AB  - A child's development is embedded within a complex system of relationships. Among the many relationships that influence children's growth and development, perhaps the most influential is the one that exists between parent and child. Recognition of the critical importance of early parent-child relationship quality for children's socioemotional, cognitive, neurobiological, and health outcomes has contributed to a shift in efforts to identify relational determinants of child outcomes. Recent efforts to extend models of relational health to the field of child development highlight the role that parent, child, and contextual factors play in supporting the development and maintenance of healthy parent-child relationships. This review presents a parent-child relational health perspective on development, with an emphasis on socioemotional outcomes in early childhood, along with brief attention to obesity and eating behavior as a relationally informed health outcome. Also emphasized here is the parent-health care provider relationship as a context for supporting healthy outcomes within families as well as screening and intervention efforts to support optimal relational health within families, with the goal of improving mental and physical health within our communities.

AB  - studies evaluating effective drugs for health conditions are of crucial importance for public health. Methylene blue (MB) is an accessible synthetic drug that presents low toxicity and has been used in several health areas due to its effectiveness. Objective: this scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant research regarding the use of MB for the treatment of health conditions. Methods: a five-stage framework Arksey and O'maley scoping review was conducted. The literature was searched in Cochrane Library database using Mesh term "methylene blue". Data were collected by two independent reviewers and submitted to descriptive synthesis. Results: The search resulted in 429 records, from which 16 were included after exclusion criteria were applied. The therapeutic use of MB was identified for acute conditions (malaria and septic shock), chronic conditions (discogenic back pain, bipolar disorder, refractory neuropathic pain, and post-traumatic stress disorder), and postoperative care (vasoplegic syndrome, and pain after haemorrhoidectomy, lumbar discectomy, and traumatic thoracolumbar fixation). Conclusion: there is much evidence emerging from clinical trials about the therapeutic use of MB for acute, chronic, and postoperative conditions; however, many gaps were identified, which open further avenues for future research.

AB  - Difficulties of the hearing impaired have increased due to COVID-19, leading to lack of inclusiveness along with the breakdown of their mental, physical, and social health. The study objective was to assess the challenges faced by the deaf and hearing-impaired people during COVID-19 by a literature review. Literature search was done using keywords such as "challenges" OR "barriers" and "COVID-19" OR "Deaf" OR "Hearing Impaired" OR "Communication" on PubMed and Google Scholar from November 2019 to June 2020. The challenges faced were lack of information, face mask making communication difficult, social distancing affecting their physical, mental health, stigma and barriers related to the health-care system. Strategies included use of technology, help from sign language instructors, and preparedness of health-care settings for the hearing disabled. System strengthening, tele-medicine, and policy amendments can be the pillars to build up the support system for the hearing impaired to protect them from COVID-19.

AB  - The effects of motor imagery (MI) on functional recovery of patients with neurological pathologies, such as stroke, has been recently proven. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of MI on motor recovery and quality of life (QOL) in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). A search was carried out in the following scientific databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PEDro, Scopus, Cochrane and Web of Science, up to November 2020. The grey literature and reference lists of potentially relevant articles were also searched. The Checklist for Measuring Quality and The Cochrane collaboration's tool were used to assess the methodological quality and risk of bias of the studies. Five studies were included in the systematic review. Findings showed that pwMS using MI had significant improvements in walking speed and distance, fatigue and QOL. In addition, several benefits were also found in dynamic balance and perceived walking ability. Although the evidence is limited, rehabilitation using MI with the application of musical and verbal guides (compared to non-intervention or other interventions), can produce benefits on gait, fatigue and QOL in pwMS with a low score in the Expanded Disability Status Scale.

AB  - Background. Due to the role of correct habits in students' academic progress, this study is aimed at evaluateing students' study habits in Iranian medical universities.
   Material and methods. Data collection method in this study was a systematic review and meta-analysis based on searches for articles published on reputable Iranian and international sites for words such as "study habits," "students," "University of Medical Sciences," and "Iran"; it was conducted without any time limit. It used a standard questionnaire of 45 study habits by Palsane and Sharma (PSSHI). Also, in the dataj analysis, computer software R version 3.6.3 was used to estimate the average score of students' study habits.
   Results. In the present study, 13 articles were reviewed, as a result of which 2,665 students who were studying at one of the Iranian medical universities from 2006 to 2018 were assessed. The overall score for students' study habits was 49.03 out of a maximum score of 90. Similarly, eight areas of students' study habits were calculated separately: time allocated was 5.61 out of a maximum score of 10; physical conditions was 6.94 out of a maximum score of 12; reading capability was 14.8 out of a maximum score of 16; note-taking was 3.17 out of a maximum score of 6; learning motivation was 6.93 out of a maximum score of 12; memory was 4.61 out of a maximum score of 8; taking exams was 9.92 out of a maximum score of 20; and health was 3.23 out of a maximum score of 6.
   Conclusions. The overall score of the students' study habits was moderate and the score for "taking exams" was the weakest. Consequently, bearing in mind that these areas of study are related to people's health, it is probable that these students will have study habits that are better and higher than average; the Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education of Iran should consider this point. Medical universities can assess their students' study habits before they enroll in the university, and if necessary, improve these habits by performing some educational interventions, such as organizing training courses, and using mobile educational applications, etc.

AB  - Background: Noninvasive stimulation has been widely used in the past 30 years to study and treat a large number of neurological diseases, including movement disorders. Objective: In this critical review,we illustrate the rationale for use of these techniques in movement disorders and summarize the best medical evidence based on the main clinical trials performed to date. Methods: A nationally representative group of experts performed a comprehensive review of the literature in order to analyze the key clinical decision-making factors driving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in movement disorders. Classes of evidence and recommendations were described for each disease. Results: Despite unavoidable heterogeneities and low effect size, TMS is likely to be effective for treating motor symptoms and depression in Parkinson's disease (PD).The efficacy in other movement disorders is unclear. TMS is possibly effective for focal hand dystonia, essential tremor and cerebellar ataxia. Additionally, it is likely to be ineffective in reducing tics in Tourette syndrome. Lastly, tDCS is likely to be effective in improving gait in PD. Conclusions: There is encouraging evidence for the use of noninvasive stimulation on a subset of symptoms in selected movement disorders, although the means to optimize protocols for improving positive outcomes in routine clinical practice remain undetermined. Similarly, the best stimulation paradigms and responder profile need to be investigated in large clinical trials with established therapeutic and assessment paradigms that could also allow genuine long-term benefits to be determined.

AB  - Background: Accuracy, speed, efficiency, and applicability of activities in the workplace are among the most important effective factors on people's productivity, which is in turn affected by environmental factors, such as light. Therefore, the present research aimed to review the studies performed about the effects of light on attention and reaction time.
   Sudy Design: A systematic review.
   Methods: This review study systematically searched articles from 2000-2019 in databases of Google Scholar, ISC, SID, Magiran, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus using keywords of light, lighting, attention, and reaction time. The titles and abstracts of articles containing relevant results over the past 20 years were extracted. Thereafter, they were categorized and analyzed according to the title, author name, publication year, study method, study type, and evaluation results.
   Results: Based on the results, the light with shorter wavelengths, higher intensity, and higher color temperature led to suppressed melatonin, higher consciousness, less somnolence, increased attention, and faster reaction time. Simultaneous exposure to harmful levels of environmental factors affects cognitive and physiological parameters, acting independently with a separate mechanism or synergistically with a similar mechanism. The best light in the regulation of psychological, biological, and cognitive processes is bright daylight in the morning with a short wavelength, high intensity, and more lasting effects.
   Conclusion: As evidenced by the obtained results, light is a powerful modulator of non-visual performance in cognitive tasks. The wavelength, color temperature, and light intensity modulate brain responses to cognitive tasks, including attention and reaction time. Therefore, these parameters, along with personal and environmental factors, should be considered in designing and using light.

AB  - Introduction: The literature regarding the teachers' work context has documented working conditions and their effects on health. However, there is limited evidence of the Mental Workload (MW) effects in this group, despite being a psychosocial risk that is constructed from typical factors of teaching work. Objective: Literature about mental workload perceived by professors and their relation with work conditions and the effects on their health were explored. Method: An integrative review was realized in databases Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, PubMed, and Scielo using descriptors in English and Spanish. The inclusion criteria were quantitative, qualitative, and mixed studies published between 2013 and 2019. In addition, a manual search was made obtaining relevant one study for the approach of the subject. The studies were evaluated according to levels of evidence developed by the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. Results: 20 articles were selected and divided into analytical categories: work conditions of professors, work effect on health, mental workload perceived by them, in addition to establishing suggestions for occupational health. Conclusion: The characteristics of the work environment include factors specific to mental workload, including high work intensity and strenuous work times, noise, a high number of students, bad interpersonal relationships, work instability, and lack of resources.

KW  - review
AB  - Aim:
   Precarious employment is known to be detrimental to health, and some population subgroups (young individuals, migrant workers, and females) are at higher risk of precarious employment. However, it is not known if the risk to poor health outcomes is consistent across population subgroups. This scoping review explores differential impacts of precarious employment on health.
   Methods:
   Relevant studies published between 2009 and February 2019 were identified across PubMed, OVID Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Articles were included if (1) they presented original data, (2) examined precarious employment within one of the subpopulations of interest, and (3) examined health outcomes.
   Results:
   Searches yielded 279 unique results, of which 14 met the eligibility criteria. Of the included studies, 12 studies examined differences between gender, 3 examined the health impacts on young individuals, and 3 examined the health of migrant workers. Mental health was explored in nine studies, general health in four studies, and mortality in two studies.
   Conclusion:
   Mental health was generally poorer in both male and female employees as a result of precarious employment, and males were also at higher risk of mortality. There was limited evidence that met our inclusion criteria, examining the health impacts on young individuals or migrant workers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the main evidence from educational interventions designed to increase levels of physical activity (PA) among Brazilian adults.
   METHODS: Systematic review of intervention studies carried out in Brazil that implemented educational components aimed at promoting increased levels of PA among adult populations (18 to 65 years old). In October 2020, systematic searches were conducted in six databases, and in the reference lists of the assessed studies.
   RESULTS: Of the initial 2,511 studies, nine were included in the synthesis. Samples with specific characteristics (such as social vulnerability, physical inactivity, and overweight or obesity) were observed, with a greater number of women. Five interventions (55.6%) occurred in primary healthcare settings (PHC) of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Only four studies (44.4%) described the pedagogical frameworks structuring the educational approaches, among which counseling was the most used strategy, such as those carried out through face-to-face meetings, home visits, lectures, and phone calls (n = 8; 88.9%). Positive results were observed in three different indicators: increase in weekly PA volume (n = 4); increase in leisure-time PA rate (n = 1); and increase in the proportion of women classified as "very active/active" (n = 1). Given the sampling specificities, the domain "participant selection" showed a high number of interventions with high risk of bias.
   CONCLUSIONS: Educational approaches engendered some positive effects on different PA indicators, notably counseling as the main strategy used and approaches involving other health themes, such as nutrition and stress. However, considering the several determinants of PA in Brazil, future interventions should be conducted in different locations of Brazil in order to evaluate, in a broader way, their implementation processes and articulation with the many professionals working in PHC.

AB  - Subjective tinnitus is a phantom sound heard only by the affected person and may be a symptom of various diseases. Tinnitus diagnosis and monitoring is based on subjective audiometric and psychometric methods. This review aimed to synthesize evidence for tinnitus presence or its severity.
   We searched several electronic databases, citation searches of the included primary studies through Web of Science, and further hand searches. At least two authors performed all systematic review steps. Sixty-two records were included and were categorized according the biological variable. Evidence for possible tinnitus biomarkers come from oxidative stress, interleukins, steroids and neurotransmitters categories. We found conflicting evidence for full blood count, vitamins, lipid profile, neurotrophic factors, or inorganic ions. There was no evidence for an association between tinnitus and the remaining categories. The current review evidences that larger studies, with stricter exclusion criteria and powerful harmonized methodological design are needed.

AB  - The economic and health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic pose a particular threat to vulnerable groups, such as migrants, particularly forcibly displaced populations. The aim of this review is (i) to synthesize the evidence on risk of infection and transmission among migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced populations, and (ii) the effect of lockdown measures on these populations. We searched MEDLINE and WOS, preprint servers, and pertinent websites between 1st December 2019 and 26th June 2020. The included studies showed a high heterogeneity in study design, population, outcome and quality. The incidence risk of SARSCoV-2 varied from 0 center dot 12% to 2 center dot 08% in non-outbreak settings and from 5 center dot 64% to 21 center dot 15% in outbreak settings. Migrants showed a lower hospitalization rate compared to non-migrants. Negative impacts on mental health due to lockdown measures were found across respective studies. However, findings show a tenuous and heterogeneous data situation, showing the need for more robust and comparative study designs.

AB  - Objectives The individual peripheral vascular disease risk factors are well documented, but the role of work conditions remains equivocal. This systematic review aims to assess relationships between lower limb peripheral venous diseases (lower limb varicose veins (LLVV), venous thromboembolism (VTE) comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication, aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm) and occupational constraints among working adults.
   Methods Several databases were systematically searched until February 2019 for observational studies and clinical trials. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method was used for article selection. Quality assessment and risk of bias were evaluated using Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and Newcastle-Ottawa scales.
   Results Among the 720 screened articles, 37 remained after full-text evaluation. Among the 21 studies on LLVV, prolonged standing was significantly associated to a higher risk of varicose veins with a threshold probably around >3 to 4 hours/day but exposure duration in years was not sufficiently considered. Seated immobility was often observed in workers, with no sufficient evidence to prove that prolonged sitting at work is related to VTE. Carrying heavy loads, stress at work and exposure to high temperatures have emerged more recently notably in relation to varicose veins but need to be better explored. Only three studies discussed the potential role of work on peripheral arterial disease development.
   Conclusions Although some observational studies showed that prolonged standing can be related to varicose veins and that seated immobility at work could be linked to VTE, very little is known about peripheral arterial disease and occupational constraints. Clinical trials to determine preventive strategies at work are needed.

AB  - Vitamin E deficiency is associated with many neurological problems. Although the mechanisms of vitamin E action in neurodegenerative diseases are not clear, there are many possible mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms are the protective effects of vitamin E against oxidative stress damage and its suppressive role in the expression of many genes involved in the development of neurodegeneration. Many studies have evaluated the relationship between vitamin E intake or vitamin E levels in body fluids and neurodegenerative diseases. Some studies concluded that vitamin E can play a protective role in neurodegeneration with respect to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Vitamin E supplementation was also associated with risk factors for some neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the possible effects of vitamin E on the development and course of AD, PD, stroke and ALS, and the potential mechanisms involved.

AB  - Marine macroalgae, the main primary producers in coastal waters, play important roles in the fishery industry and global carbon cycles. With progressive ocean global changes, however, they are increasingly exposed to enhanced levels of multiple environmental drivers, such as ocean acidification, warming, heatwaves, UV radiation and deoxygenation. While most macroalgae have developed physiological strategies against variations of these drivers, their eco-physiological responses to each or combinations of the drivers differ spatiotemporally and species-specifically. Many freshwater macroalgae are tolerant of pH drop and its diel fluctuations and capable of acclimating to changes in carbonate chemistry. However, calcifying species, such as coralline algae, are very sensitive to acidification of seawater, which reduces their calcification, and additionally, temperature rise and UV further decrease their physiological performance. Except for these calcifying species, both economically important and harmful macroalgae can benefit from elevated CO2 concentrations and moderate temperature rise, which might be responsible for increasing events of harmful macroalgal blooms including green macroalgal blooms caused by Ulva spp. and golden tides caused by Sargassum spp. Upper intertidal macroalgae, especially those tolerant of dehydration during low tide, increase their photosynthesis under elevated CO2 concentrations during the initial dehydration period, however, these species might be endangered by heatwaves, which can expose them to high temperature levels above their thermal windows' upper limit. On the other hand, since macroalgae are distributed in shallow waters, they are inevitably exposed to solar UV radiation. The effects of UV radiation, depending on weather conditions and species, can be harmful as well as beneficial to many species. Moderate levels of UV-A (315-400nm) can enhance photosynthesis of green, brown and red algae, while UV-B (280-315nm) mainly show inhibitory impacts. Although little has been documented on the combined effects of elevated CO2, temperature or heatwaves with UV radiation, exposures to heatwaves during midday under high levels of UV radiation can be detrimental to most species, especially to their microscopic stages which are less tolerant of climate change induced stress. In parallel, reduced availability of dissolved O-2 in coastal water along with eutrophication might favour the macroalgae's carboxylation process by suppressing their oxygenation or photorespiration. In this review, we analyse effects of climate change-relevant drivers individually and/or jointly on different macroalgal groups and different life cycle stages based on the literatures surveyed, and provide perspectives for future studies.

AB  - Introduction: This narrative review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses aims at compiling available evidence in various aspects of neurocognitive functioning in Bipolar Disorder (BD).
   Methods: We conducted a MEDLINE literature search and identified 38 relevant systematic reviews and metaanalyses.
   Results: Current evidence suggests that BD is associated with cognitive impairment across multiple domains and during all clinical states. However, there is a considerable cognitive heterogeneity within BD, which cannot be explained by clinical subtypes, and the pattern of neurocognitive impairment in BD overlaps with other psychiatric conditions such as major depression and schizophrenia. Residual depressive symptoms, poor clinical course and higher number of manic episodes may negatively impact cognitive performance, which is a major predictor of general functioning in BD. Evidence from available prospective studies does not support the notion of progressive cognitive decline in BD while some evidence exists to suggest patients may show some improvements in cognitive functioning following the first manic episode. Furthermore, a subset of patients may show premorbid cognitive abnormalities that could signal an early neurodevelopmental aetiology. Preliminary findings from small studies identify potential pro-cognitive effects of Cognitive Remediation, erythropoietin, intranasal insulin, lurasidone, mifepristone, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in BD.
   Discussion: Longitudinal studies in high-risk individuals can provide a better understanding of the development and progression of neurocognitive impairment in BD. Largescale randomised control trials are needed to compare the pro-cognitive efficacy of various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in different cognitive subgroups of patients at different stages of BD.

AB  - Adolescent suse internet via several devices to gather information or communicate. Sleep, as a key factor of adolescents' development, contributes to their physical and mental health. Over the past decades insufficient sleep among adolescents has been wide spread, and one of its attributing factors is the increased availability of technology. This review aims to investigate the body of evidence regarding the impact of problematic internet use on adolescent sleep. Extensive search of databases was performed according to PRISMA guidelines for studies published within the last decade, regarding subjects aged 10-19. The final step of the search yielded 12 original studies. The quality of extracted data was evaluated with the AXIS tool, in order to estimate the risk of bias. All studies showed a negative correlation between adolescent sleep and problematic internet use. It was found to affect sleep quality and quantity and provoke insomnia symptoms. Interestingly, adolescent's sex, parental educational level, type of family and use for leisure or academic reasons appeared as affecting factors of the problematic internet use-sleep relationship. Problematic internet use has several effects on adolescents' sleep. Results of relevant studies should be embedded in educational interventions addressed to adolescents as well as parents, to eliminate the negative outcomes of problematic internet use on sleep and adolescence's health in general.

AB  - Large diasporas of former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants are found in the USA, Germany, and Israel. To synthesize evidence, identify limitations, and propose future directions we conducted an integrative review on the health literacy of FSU immigrants, migrants, or refugees in four languages. Following integrative review and PRISMA guidelines, we searched four databases in English and performed supplementary searches in Russian, German, and Hebrew to identify qualitative and quantitative studies on FSU immigrants and health literacy. Six articles met inclusion criteria in English and one in German; the majority were published in the last five years. Only two articles measured health literacy of FSU immigrants, which was lower than the general population. Four articles were about immigrants with a mean age >= 50 years. All articles stressed the value of translated, culturally relevant health information. The health literacy of FSU immigrants is understudied, despite clear needs. Future research should include assessments of FSU immigrants' health literacy and include diverse (e.g., age, gender) yet well-defined populations to determine both barriers and facilitators to their health literacy. This review, an example of a multilingual search, provided a comprehensive understanding of existing literature and is a useful approach for global health literacy research.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology involves progressive degeneration and death of vulnerable dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Extensive axonal arborization and distinct functions make this type of neurons particularly sensitive to homeostatic perturbations, such as protein misfolding and Ca2+ dysregulation. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a cell compartment orchestrating protein synthesis and folding, as well as synthesis of lipids and maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis in eukaryotic cells. When misfolded proteins start to accumulate in ER lumen the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. UPR is an adaptive signaling machinery aimed at relieving of protein folding load in the ER. When UPR is chronic, it can either boost neurodegeneration and apoptosis or cause neuronal dysfunctions. We have recently discovered that mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) exerts its prosurvival action in dopamine neurons and in an animal model of PD through the direct binding to UPR sensor inositol-requiring protein 1 alpha (IRE1 alpha) and attenuation of UPR. In line with this, UPR targeting resulted in neuroprotection and neurorestoration in various preclinical animal models of PD. Therefore, growth factors (GFs), possessing both neurorestorative activity and restoration of protein folding capacity are attractive as drug candidates for PD treatment especially their blood-brain barrier penetrating analogs and small molecule mimetics. In this review, we discuss ER stress as a therapeutic target to treat PD; we summarize the existing preclinical data on the regulation of ER stress for PD treatment. In addition, we point out the crucial aspects for successful clinical translation of UPR-regulating GFs and new prospective in GFs-based treatments of PD, focusing on ER stress regulation.

AB  - A decade has passed since we published a comprehensive review in this journal addressing the topic of promoting successful cognitive aging, making this a good time to take stock of the field. Because there have been limited large-scale, randomized controlled trials, especially following individuals from middle age to late life, some experts have questioned whether recommendations can be legitimately offered about reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Despite uncertainties, clinicians often need to at least make provisional recommendations to patients based on the highest quality data available. Converging lines of evidence from epidemiological/cohort studies, animal/basic science studies, human proof-of-concept studies, and human intervention studies can provide guidance, highlighting strategies for enhancing cognitive reserve and preventing loss of cognitive capacity. Many of the suggestions made in 2010 have been supported by additional research. Importantly, there is a growing consensus among major health organizations about recommendations to mitigate cognitive decline and promote healthy cognitive aging. Regular physical activity and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors have been supported by all of these organizations. Most organizations have also embraced cognitively stimulating activities, a heart-healthy diet, smoking cessation, and countering metabolic syndrome. Other behaviors like regular social engagement, limiting alcohol use, stress management, getting adequate sleep, avoiding anticholinergic medications, addressing sensory deficits, and protecting the brain against physical and toxic damage also have been endorsed, although less consistently. In this update, we review the evidence for each of these recommendations and offer practical advice about behavior-change techniques to help patients adopt brain-healthy behaviors.

AB  - Background: The high production volume of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) may lead to high pressure on the environment, and a scientific assessment of ENMs that bioaccumulate in organisms and biomagnify in the food web is necessary. Within the regulation of chemicals in several jurisdictions, such as the European regulation REACH, the bioconcentration factor is the standard endpoint. The bioconcentration factor is mostly determined by flow-through fish tests. However, nanomaterials tend to agglomerate, which may lead to sedimentation in aquatic environments. The bioavailability of the tested nanomaterials may be thus impaired for pelagic species, including fish, in comparison to benthic or filtrating species. Several risk assessment regulations allow the usage of data gained during tests using invertebrates and such data may allow a waiver of further tests using vertebrates. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential of different freshwater invertebrate species to be used in laboratory bioaccumulation studies on ENMs and to give some guidance for the use of bioaccumulation endpoints derived from studies using aquatic invertebrate species in the risk assessment process for ENMs.
   Results: The existing literature related to the testing of nanomaterial bioaccumulation with freshwater invertebrates was screened and reviewed to find suitable test species with regard to their ecology and physiology, as well as laboratory test systems allowing to investigate the bioavailability/bioaccumulation of nanomaterials with the respective species. Bivalvia, gastropoda, isopoda, amphipoda, and branchiopoda were reviewed and their suitability for bioaccumulation testing was assessed. Amphipods and bivalves represent worst-case scenarios and show clear advantages to be used as test organisms. However, only amphipods allow the examination of two clearly independent exposure pathways (water and diet).
   Conclusion: Amphipods are suitable test organisms for bioaccumulation testing of ENMs. The results from amphipod bioconcentration and biomagnification tests can be included in a tiered assessment suggested at the end of this study allowing a clear grading of the tested nanomaterials as "bioaccumulative" or "non bioaccumulative." Due to the worst-case scenario of the amphipod test, this approach may allow a waiver of further vertebrate tests.

KW  - SYMPTOMS
AB  - Introduction. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that performs multiple functions in the body. In addition to regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body and contributing to bone mineralization, it participates in various brain and neurocognitive processes. In fact, the deficiency of this vitamin has also been linked to various psychiatric disorders, including depression.
   Objective. To review if the administration of vitamin D is effective in the treatment of depression in adults compared to placebo.
   Methodology. An electronic search was carried out in 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science-Science Citation Index and Scopus) of randomized clinical trials (RCT) to assess the efficacy of vitamin D, in adults with depression compared to placebo, from 2013 to date of search (2019). The outcome measure used for the effect size calculation was the depressive symptom score. The effect sizes for the trials were calculated using the standardized mean difference and the 1 2 test was used to assess sample heterogeneity. The critical evaluation of the articles was carried out using the funnel plot tool.
   Results. A total of 10 RCTs involving 1.393 participants were included in the study. Given the heterogeneity of the studies, the random effects model was used. The result of the meta-analysis indicates that oral administration of vitamin D did not have a significant effect on the reduction of post-intervention depression scores. The standardized mean difference for the pooled data was -0,91 (95% confidence interval -2,02 - 0,19).
   Conclusions. This study has not detected a significant therapeutic effect in the administration of vitamin D in depression.

AB  - The purpose of this scoping review was to identify the family and child quality of life variables that have been studied in relation to one another in children with Down syndrome, the frequency with which different relationships have been studied, and the extent to which family variables were the focus of the research aims. A literature search was conducted to find studies published between January 2007 and June 2018. The initial search yielded 2314 studies; of these, 43 were selected for a final review. Researchers most often addressed family resources and family problem-solving and coping concerning child personal development and physical well-being. Little attention to child emotional well-being was observed, with none considering family appraisal of child emotional well-being. The relationship between family variables and child QoL rarely was the primary focus of the study. Methodologically, most reviewed studies used cross-sectional designs, were conducted in North America and based on maternal report. From future research considering the issues found in this review, healthcare providers can obtain an in-depth understanding of relationships between children and family variables.

AB  - There is an extensive literature relating to factors associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but less is known about factors which may contribute to its progression. This review examined the literature with regard to 15 factors which were suggested by PubMed search to be positively associated with the cognitive and/or neuropathological progression of AD. The factors were grouped as potentially modifiable (vascular risk factors, comorbidities, malnutrition, educational level, inflammation, and oxidative stress), non-modifiable (age at clinical onset, family history of dementia, gender, Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4, genetic variants, and altered gene regulation), and clinical (baseline cognitive level, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and extrapyramidal signs). Although conflicting results were found for the majority of factors, a positive association was found in nearly all studies which investigated the relationship of six factors to AD progression: malnutrition, genetic variants, altered gene regulation, baseline cognitive level, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and extrapyramidal signs. Whether these or other factors which have been suggested to be associated with AD progression actually influence the rate of decline of AD patients is unclear. Therapeutic approaches which include addressing of modifiable factors associated with AD progression should be considered.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species were discovered in living organisms in the early 1950's and their action has been implicated in diverse biological processes. First formulated by H. Sies in 1985, the oxidative stress concept stimulated substantial interest in reactive oxygen species and it is now common that fundamental research in various biomedical fields includes mention of research on the involvement of oxidative stress. Such strong interest has resulted in the development of definitions and classifications of oxidative stress and much research progress in the field. Although we clearly understand the limitations of various definitions or classifications, such parameters may help to provide quantitative descriptions, compare related processes among different laboratories, and introduce some measurable parameters. This paper highlights recent advances in the areas of oxidative stress definitions and the classification of oxidative stresses. Such items are directly associated with our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in organismal responses to oxidative insults. The knowledge accumulated to date indicates that selective expression of specific genes is a central player in the adaptive response to oxidative stress and reversible oxidation of cysteine residues of sensor proteins is a key process regulating responses to oxidative stress.

AB  - Introduction: Due to global nursing shortages, recruitment and retention of nurses is a major international concern, exacerbated in rural and remote areas. Existing research reveals that individual factors influence healthcare professionals' decision making to work in rural and remote settings. However, existing evidence does not fully consider the multiple influences that may impact nurses' decisions to remain or leave rural and remote areas. This limits the effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies. The objectives of this study were to explore the influences on nurses' decisions to work in rural and remote healthcare settings, using a systematic review and thematic meta-synthesis of qualitative studies.
   Methods: Databases Medline, Journals@OVID Full text, PsycInfo and specialist journals were searched from January 1990 to January 2020. Inclusion criteria were applied to all records by two independent reviewers. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative studies was used for independent quality critique by two reviewers. Thematic synthesis was conducted using a three step process: (1) the results sections of each article were extracted and inductively coded line by line; (2) master themes and subthemes were organised into tables; (3) relationships between the themes were identified and examined to develop an overarching analytical framework.
   Results: A total of 121 articles were screened and 40 were included for data extraction and thematic synthesis. Thematic analysis identified three interrelated dimensions that influenced nurses' retention and migration decision-making, namely 'person/al', 'profession/al' and 'place' with 18 inter-related domains. The 'person/al' dimension contained five domains: a sense of belonging/connectedness, knowledge of rural culture, blurring of personal and professional lives, anonymity and job satisfaction/stress. The 'profession/al' dimension contained eight domains: expert generalist, advanced nurse practitioner, professional isolation, mentorship, education, autonomy and empowerment, role conflict, and recruitment and retention. The 'place' dimension identified five domains: terrain and weather, fewer resources, geographical isolation, safety and rural culture. The data informed the development of the MacKay's 3P (person/al, profession/al and place) model to capture the complex phenomenon of the influences on nurses' decision making to work in rural and remote settings.
   Conclusion: Multiple dimensions and domains influence nurses' decision making to work in rural and remote settings. MacKay's 3P model provides a theoretical framework to explore the complex interplay between the person/al, profession/al and place-related dimensions of rural nursing. These findings can inform the development of future recruitment and retention initiatives.

AB  - There have been an increasing overweight and obesity in very anxious children. Furthermore, obesity is a condition that occurs due to the accumulation of excess or abnormal fat. This disorder is believed to be the most significant public health problem that affects children in the 21st century. This study aimed to examine the literature review, articles and research results analyzing the effectiveness of family or parent empowerment interventions through health education. Many research articles were searched on several databases such as PubMed and PreQuest, using the following keywords which include "family empowerment", "overweight", "obesity", "health lifestyle", "BMI", "children", "RCT" starting from 2014 to 2019. The searched results obtained 162 articles on family empowerment, overweight and obesity. Out of the 162 articles, 20 were selected that discussed family empowerment interventions for overweight and obesity. Critical analysis of the 20 articles was carried out based on design, sample, treatment, parameters, findings and conclusions. The literature review analysis showed that family empowerment interventions in the form of health education or promotion activities vary widely in terms of methods, components, duration, individuals involved, specificity and effectiveness. Furthermore, this intervention consists of training activities, courses, and teaching practices. Statistical analysis showed that all these methods significantly increased the ability and independence of the family in controlling overweight and obesity. In conclusion, health education interventions that are packaged in various programs are proven to significantly improve the ability of families or parents in preventing and controlling overweight and obesity in children.

AB  - Background: Considering limitations of the established osteoarthritis (OA) medications, attention to adjuvant and complementary treatments has increased in OA individuals. Recent investigations have reported advantages of pomegranate in OA and indicate that pomegranate can be a therapeutic option; nevertheless, no systematic review exists regarding OA and pomegranate. Therefore, we systematically studied accessible researches regarding pomegranate and OA in human, animal, and in vitro models and likely mechanistic pathways.
   Methods: Present systematic review study was recorded on the international prospective register of systematic reviews database. Electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, Embase, WOS, ProQuest) and search engine Google Scholar were searched until February 2021. Search alerts were turned on to recognize papers published following the primary search. Two investigators independently searched using MESH and non-MESH words in title, abstract, and keywords. Inclusion criteria were related clinical, animal, and in vitro studies published in any language as a full text. Exclusion criteria were reviews, book chapters, conference abstracts, and articles regarding pomegranate in health problems other than OA. Hand searching was used to check the references or citations of eligible papers and grey literature (theses etc.) to find potential researches.
   Results: Twenty-three articles were included in our systematic review. Human, animal, and in vitro researches demonstrated favorable properties of pomegranate in improving clinical features and reducing inflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in OA.
   Conclusion: Present paper provides convincing evidence about the efficacy of pomegranate in OA and gives a justification for the importance of additional clinical studies.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor impairments as well as non-motor symptoms. While dopamine-based therapies are effective in fighting the symptoms in the early stages of the disease, a lack of neuroprotective drugs means that the disease continues to progress. Along with the traditionally recognised pathological hallmarks of dopaminergic neuronal death and intracellular a-synuclein (alpha-syn) depositions, iron accumulation, elevated oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation damage are further conspicuous features of PD pathophysiology. However, the underlying mechanisms linking these pathological hallmarks with neurodegeneration still remain unclear. Ferroptosis, a regulated iron dependent cell death pathway involving a lethal accumulation of lipid peroxides, shares several features with PD pathophysiology. Interestingly, alpha-syn has been functionally linked with the metabolism of both iron and lipid, suggesting a possible interplay between dysregulated alpha-syn and other PD pathological hallmarks related to ferroptosis. This review will address the importance for understanding these disease mechanisms that could be targeted therapeutically. Anti-ferroptosis molecules are neuroprotective in PD animal models and the anti-ferroptotic iron chelator, deferiprone, slowed disease progression and improved motor function in two independent clinical trials for PD. An ongoing larger multi-centre phase 2 clinical trial will confirm the therapeutic potential of deferiprone and the relevance of ferroptosis in PD. This review addresses the known pathological features of PD in relation to the ferroptosis pathway with therapeutic implications of targeting this cell death pathway.

AB  - The use of genome wide association studies (GWAS) in Huntington's disease (HD) research, driven by unbiased human data analysis, has transformed the focus of new targets that could affect age at onset. While there is a significant depth of information on DNA damage repair, with many drugs and drug targets, most of this development has taken place in the context of cancer therapy. DNA damage repair in neurons does not rely on DNA replication correction mechanisms. However, there is a strong connection between DNA repair and neuronal metabolism, mediated by nucleotide salvaging and the poly ADP-ribose (PAR) response, and this connection has been implicated in other age-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Validation of leads including the mismatch repair protein MSH3, and interstrand cross-link repair protein FAN1, suggest the mechanism is driven by somatic CAG instability, which is supported by the protective effect of CAA substitutions in the CAG tract. We currently do not understand: how somatic instability is triggered; the state of DNA damage within expanding alleles in the brain; whether this damage induces mismatch repair and interstrand cross-link pathways; whether instability mediates toxicity, and how this relates to human ageing. We discuss DNA damage pathways uncovered by HD GWAS, known roles of other polyglutamine disease proteins in DNA damage repair, and a panel of hypotheses for pathogenic mechanisms.

AB  - Global pandemic due to corona virus disease (COVID-19) has exposed vulnerabilities of the geriatric population all over the world. India has been adding progressively increasing number of elderly to its population. This is happening with increasing life expectancy and decreasing mortality. In comparison to children, the population as well as deaths in elderly are rising with changing demography. The elderly population has its own vulnerabilities based on education, socioeconomic condition, gender, place of residence etc. They are affected by various non-communicable diseases which form predominant cause of morbidity and mortality like cardiovascular diseases, stroke, cancer, respiratory illnesses etc. The elderly also contribute to various kinds of disabilities like movement, vision, hearing and in many cases multiple disabilities. They are also more vulnerable to mental health problems and cognitive impairment. The article also suggests a way forward in dealing with rising geriatric age group and its associated problems. The programs supporting this population are largely scattered which needs to be consolidated to include social security, pension and food security along with health benefits. The approach to health care of the elderly needs a comprehensive strategy instead of the present fragmented approach where different disease based programs for non-communicable diseases, cancer and mental health cater to specific health issues of the elderly. Greater awareness, training and skill building in geriatric health for primary care physicians need focus and energy. Prioritizing training and research in this field including the need for more geriatricians has been highlighted.

AB  - Introduction:Cervical spine pain with or without radiculopathy (CSp R) has significant negative impacts to a person's quality of life. Psychosocial factors and/or mental health symptoms are associated with spinal pain with or without radiculopathy and negatively impact health outcomes. This area of research is not yet established for CSp R. Our objective is to conduct a systematic review assessing the association between psychosocial factors and/or mental health symptoms and health outcomes in adults with CSp +/- R.Methods:A systematic electronic search of 3 online databases will retrieve studies in which adults (older than 18 years) with CSp +/- R, assessing how psychosocial factors or mental health symptoms impact outcomes related to disability, pain, and/or healthcare utilisation. Data extracted will include study design, CSp +/- R definition, psychosocial and/or mental health symptoms, and health outcomes. Reporting study quality through the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Scale Assessment and certainty through Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations will be completed. Studies will be assessed from a clinical perspective, methodology design, and statistical testing to determine whether studies can be pooled for meta-analysis. If there is significant clinical heterogeneity, narrative description will be undertaken.Perspective:This will be a comprehensive synthesis review to enhance understanding of the association of psychosocial factors and/or mental health symptoms and CSp +/- R on health outcomes. The findings will support the formulation of prognosis, collaborative management decisions, and guide healthcare resources to improve outcomes for this patient group. The review will identify gaps in research, thereby informing future experimental and observational study design.

AB  - Objective: Our study's motive was to recognize various immune-mediated inflammatory processes involved in the pathogenesis of depression and psoriasis and interlink between them based on inflammatory mediators. Methods: A careful and comprehensive literature search was done through various databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and EBSCO. A total of 56 studies were included in our study after careful screening. Results: The immune-mediated inflammatory process was significantly associated with the pathogenesis of both depression and psoriasis. Most of the inflammatory markers involved in Psoriasis (TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-6, IL-23, IL-1 beta, IL-10), and increased serotonin transporters (5-HTT) were also found in the pathogenesis of depression, showing the immune-inflammatory linkage between psoriasis and major depression. Based on immune chemistry, the levels of CD2(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) T-lymphocytes were also found to be raised in both depression and psoriasis, validating their relationship. Hyperactivity of HPA-axis was also found another interlink between them along with reduced melatonin amount. Conclusions: According to various studies, the neuro-dermatological association between psoriasis and depression is significant. Different immune markers involved in the pathogenesis of depression and psoriasis also show the bidirectional association between them. However, this association between psoriasis and depression is positively correlated, but more work is required to answer why all depressed patients fail to develop psoriasis and why all psoriatic patients fail to develop depression.

AB  - Layer V pyramidal neurons constitute principle output neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/neocortex to subcortical regions including the intralaminar/midline thalamic nuclei, amygdala, basal ganglia, brainstem nuclei and the spinal cord. The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on layer V pyramidal cells primarily reflect a range of excitatory influences through 5-HT2A receptors and inhibitory influences through non-5-HT2A receptors, including 5-HT1A receptors. While the 5-HT2A receptor is primarily a postsynaptic receptor on throughout the apical dendritic field of 5-HT2A receptors, activation of a minority of 5-HT2A receptors also appears to increase spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents/potentials (EPSCs/EPSPs) via a presynaptic effect on thalamocortical terminals arising from the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors by the phenethylamine hallucinogen also appears to increase asynchronous release of glutamate upon the layer V pyramidal dendritic field, an effect that is suppressed by 5-HT itself through non-5-HT2A receptors. Serotonergic hallucinogens acting on 5-HT2A receptors also appears to increase gene expression of immediate early genes (iEG) and other receptors appearing to induce an iEG-like response like BDNF. Psychedelic hallucinogens acting on 5-HT2A receptors also induce head twitches in rodents that appear related to induction of glutamate release. These electrophysiological, biochemical and behavioral effects of serotonergic hallucinogens appear to be related tomodulating glutamatergic thalamocortical neurotransmission and/or shifting the balance toward 5-HT2A receptor activation and away from non-5-HT2A receptor activation. These 5-HT2A receptor induced responses are modulated by feedback homeostatic mechanisms through mGlu(2), mGlu(4), and mGlu(8) presynaptic receptors on thalamocortical terminals. These 5-HT2A receptor and glutamatergic interactions also appear to play a role on higher cortical functions of the mPFC such as motoric impulsivity and antidepressant-like behavioral responses on the differential-reinforcement-of low rate 72-s (DRL 72-s schedule). These mutually opposing effects between 5-HT2A receptor and mGlu autoreceptor activation (e.g., blocking 5-HT2A receptors and enhancing activity at mGlu(2) receptors) may play a clinical role with respect to currently prescribed or novel antidepressant drugs. Thus, there is an important balance between 5-HT2A receptor activation and activation of mGlu autoreceptors on prefrontal cortical layer V pyramidal cells with respect to the electrophysiological, biochemical and behavioral effects serotonergic hallucinogenic drugs.

AB  - It is well established that persons with a severe mental illness (SMI) have a greater risk of physical comorbid conditions and premature mortality. Most studies in the field of community mental health care (CMHC) have only focused on improving cardiovascular health in people with a SMI using lifestyle approaches. Studies using organizational modifications are rather scarce. This systematic review aimed to synthesize and describe possible organizational strategies to improve physical health for persons with a SMI in CMHC. The primary outcome was Health-related Quality of Life (HR-QOL). Results suggested modest effects on quality of life and were inconsistent throughout all the included studies. Despite these findings, it appears that a more integrated approach had a positive effect on health outcomes, patient satisfaction and HR-QOL. The complexity of the processes involved in community care delivery makes it difficult to compare different models and organizational approaches. Mental health nurses were identified as possible key professionals in care organization, but no clear description of their role was found. This review could provide new insights into contributing factors for integrated care. Future research targeting the identification of the nurses' role and facilitating factors in integrated care, in order to improve treatment and follow-up of somatic comorbidities, is recommended.

AB  - This scoping review of UK evidence aimed to describe what is known about Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans (LGBT+) health inequalities in relation to cancer, mental health, and palliative care to inform research, policy and public health interventions. Using a scoping review methodology, we identified studies from database searches, citation tracking, and expert consultation. The in/exclusion criteria was based on the PICOS framework. The data were charted and then summarised to map the theoretical approaches and the main types of evidence and identify knowledge gaps. In total, 279 articles were screened and 83 were included in the final review. We found that there is limited UK research examining LGBT+ health inequality in cancer, mental health and palliative care. We would argue that this thin evidence base is partly due to national policy discussions of LGBT+ health inequality that are framed within a depoliticised 'it's getting better' narrative, and an unwillingness to adequately acknowledge the unjust social and economic relations that produce LGBT+ health inequality. In addition, LGBT+ health inequality is depoliticised by existing public health explanatory theories, models and frameworks that exclude sexual orientation and gender diversity as dimensions of power that interlock with those of socio-economic, race and ethnicity. This is a barrier to developing public health interventions that can successfully tackle LGBT+ health inequality

AB  - The cerebral hypoxia-ischemia can induce a wide spectrum of biologic responses that include depolarization, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and result in neurodegeneration. Several adaptive and survival endogenous mechanisms can also be activated giving an opportunity for the affected cells to remain alive, waiting for helper signals that avoid apoptosis. These signals appear to help cells, depending on intensity, chronicity, and proximity to the central hypoxic area of the affected tissue. These mechanisms are present not only in a large list of brain pathologies affecting commonly older individuals, but also in other pathologies such as refractory epilepsies, encephalopathies, or brain trauma, where neurodegenerative features such as cognitive and/or motor deficits sequelae can be developed. The hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is a master transcription factor driving a wide spectrum cellular response. HIF-1 alpha may induce erythropoietin (EPO) receptor overexpression, which provides the therapeutic opportunity to administer pharmacological doses of EPO to rescue and/or repair affected brain tissue. Intranasal administration of EPO combined with other antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds could become an effective therapeutic alternative, to avoid and/or slow down neurodegenerative deterioration without producing adverse peripheral effects.

TI  - Anxiety and intellectual functioning in autistic children: A systematic review and meta-analysis
KW  - anxiety
KW  - autism
KW  - autism spectrum disorder
KW  - intelligence quotient
KW  - meta-analysis
AB  - Autistic children experience higher levels of anxiety than their peers. Making appropriate diagnoses of anxiety disorders and providing effective treatment for these children is particularly difficult. Inconsistent evidence suggests that levels of anxiety in autistic children are related to intellectual functioning. We provide the first meta-analysis of this evidence. A systematic search identified 49 papers for review. These papers included measures of anxiety and intelligence quotient in 18,430 autistic children. Studies employing correlations showed evidence of a significant relationship between intelligence quotient and anxiety in autistic children: children with higher intelligence quotient scored higher on measures of anxiety. Studies directly comparing groups of autistic children with and without intellectual disability also supported this conclusion. Most studies employing other designs also supported this finding. Employing a quality assessment framework identified common threats to validity. Many studies used measures of anxiety that were not validated across the samples they measure. This was most notable for those autistic children with an intellectual disability. It is vital that future research determines whether the identified relationship between intelligence quotient and anxiety reflects something important in the mechanism for anxiety in autistic children, or quantifies the lack of sensitivity of our measures of anxiety across different groups.
   Lay abstract
   Autistic children often experience higher levels of anxiety than their peers. It can be difficult to diagnose and treat anxiety disorders in autistic children, in part because of the high degree of variability in their underlying abilities and presentations. Some evidence suggests that autistic children with higher intelligence (as measured by intelligence quotient) experience higher levels of anxiety than autistic children with lower intelligence. However, the evidence is inconsistent, with other papers not finding a difference or finding higher levels of anxiety in autistic children with lower intelligence. In this article, we review existing literature to see whether autistic children with higher intelligence quotients have higher anxiety than autistic children with lower intelligence quotients. A systematic search of the literature was conducted which identified 49 papers on the topic. The methods of all the papers were reviewed using an objective quality assessment framework. When combining the data statistically, there was evidence that autistic children with higher intelligence quotients are more anxious than autistic children with lower intelligence quotients. The quality review raised common weaknesses across studies. Most importantly, few studies used measures of anxiety that have been shown to be valid for children with very low intelligence quotients. Similarly, many studies used measures of anxiety that have not been shown to be valid for autistic children. These factors are important because autistic children and those with low intelligence quotient may experience or understand anxiety differently. Future research should use fully validated measures to test whether high intelligence quotient is associated with high levels of anxiety in autistic children.

AB  - Background: Person-centered care (PCC) is an important concept in many countries' national guidelines and dementia plans. Key intervention categories, i.e., a taxonomy of person-centered (PC)-interventions, to provide person-centered dementia care, are difficult to identify from literature.
   Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify and categorize published PC-interventions into key intervention categories to guide the provision of person-centered dementia care.
   Methods: Conduct of this systematic review followed Cochrane guidelines. A search of the dimensions 'Dementia', 'Person-Centered Care', and 'Intervention' combined was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Study selection was based on 2-stage screening against eligibility criteria, limited to controlled study designs. Information about interventions and outcomes was extracted into an "Effects Table". The identified PC-interventions were categorized in intervention categories to provide person-centered dementia care.
   Results: Searches identified 1,806 records. 19 studies were included. These covered a range of psychosocial interventions, oftentimes multi-component interventions, which followed heterogeneous approaches. Studies were conducted in long-term care/hospital settings. Nine key intervention categories were identified: social contact, physical activities, cognitive training, sensory enhancement, daily living assistance, life history oriented emotional support, training and support for professional caregivers, environmental adjustments, and care organization.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide a current overview of published PC-interventions in dementia, which followed heterogeneous approaches under the PCC-concept. The heterogeneity made it challenging to identify a well-defined concept of PCC and common key intervention categories. An effectiveness-evaluation of "PC", including "relationship-centered"-interventions may be valuable, to assess whether an explicit focus on relationships around PCC-interventions yields an added benefit.

TI  - A rapid review of evidence on the determinants of and strategies for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in low- and middle-income countries
KW  - HESITANCY
AB  - Background Vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among the general population and health care workers play an important role in successfully controlling the Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. While there is evidence for vaccine hesitancy across the globe, wide variation in factors influencing vaccine acceptance has been reported, mainly from High-Income Countries (HIC). However, the evidence from Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) remains unclear. The objective of this review was to describe the determinants of vaccine acceptance and strategies to address those in an LMIC context.
   Methods The World Health Organization's (WHO) Measuring Behavioral and Social Drivers of Vaccination (BeSD) Increasing Vaccination Model was employed to identify factors that influenced vaccine acceptance. All evidence related to supply-side and demand-side determinants and social and health system processes were examined. A comprehensive search for published literature was conducted in three databases and grey literature in relevant websites of government, multinational agencies, and COVID-19 resource aggregators, followed by a narrative synthesis.
   Results Overall, the results showed that the vaccine acceptance rates differed across LMICs, with a wide variety of reasons cited for vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine acceptance was reportedly greater among males, those with higher education, elevated socio-economic status, the unmarried, those employed as health care workers. Evidence suggested that exposure to misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and public concerns over the safety of vaccines may contribute to lower acceptance rates. Strategies to increase vaccine acceptance rates included direct engagement with communities through influencers, including community leaders and health experts; clear and transparent communication about COVID-19 vaccines, financial and non-financial incentives; and strong endorsement from health care workers. Trust in government was identified as a significant enabler of vaccine acceptance.
   Conclusions There is a need for measures to address public acceptability, trust and concern over the safety and benefit of approved vaccines. Local context is essential to consider while developing programs to promote vaccine uptake. The governments worldwide also need to strategize to develop plans to address the anxiety and vaccine related concerns of community regarding vaccine hesitancy. There is a need for further research to evaluate strategies to address vaccine hesitancy in LMIC.

AB  - Poor housing is an important determinant of poor health. One key aspect of housing quality is lighting. Light is important for visual performance and safety, and also plays a vital role in regulating human physiological functions. This review aims to synthesise existing evidence on the relationship between lighting in the home and health and recommends areas for future research. Three databases were searched for relevant literature using pre-defined inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Extracted data were qualitatively synthesised according to type of lighting (natural light, artificial light and light at night) and stratified by broad health domains (physical, mental and sleep health). Of the 4043 records retrieved, 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. There was considerable heterogeneity in light exposure metrics used and specific health outcome assessed by the studies. Lighting in the home can negatively affect health but the current evidence base is limited to a small number of studies in different domains of light and health. Further research surrounding specific health outcomes is required to better inform housing quality assessments and lighting practises in the home.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing Joint Estimates of the work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates), with contributions from a large network of experts. Evidence from mechanistic data suggests that exposure to long working hours may increase alcohol consumption and cause alcohol use disorder. In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.
   Objectives: We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and >55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on alcohol consumption, risky drinking (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality) and alcohol use disorder (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality).
   Data sources: We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic bibliographic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including the WHO International Clinical Trials Register, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and CISDOC on 30 June 2018. Searches on PubMed were updated on 18 April 2020. We also searched electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand searched reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consulted additional experts.
   Study eligibility and criteria: We included working-age (15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We considered for inclusion randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other nonrandomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and 55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on alcohol consumption (in g/week), risky drinking, and alcohol use disorder (prevalence, incidence or mortality). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from publications related to qualifying studies. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project.
   Results: Fourteen cohort studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 104,599 participants (52,107 females) in six countries of three WHO regions (Americas, South-East Asia, and Europe). The exposure and outcome were assessed with self-reported measures in most studies. Across included studies, risk of bias was generally probably high, with risk judged high or probably high for detection bias and missing data for alcohol consumption and risky drinking. Compared to working 35-40 h/week, exposure to working 41-48 h/week increased alcohol consumption by 10.4 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.59-15.20; seven studies; 25,904 participants, I2 71%, low quality evidence). Exposure to working 49-54 h/week increased alcohol consumption by 17.69 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.16-26.22; seven studies, 19,158 participants, I2 82%, low quality evidence). Exposure to working >55 h/week increased alcohol consumption by 16.29 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.93-24.65; seven studies; 19,692 participants; I2 82%, low quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of exposure to working 41-48 h/week, compared with working 35-40 h/week on developing risky drinking (relative risk 1.08; 95% CI 0.86-1.36; 12 studies; I2 52%, low certainty evidence). Working 49-54 h/week did not increase the risk of developing risky drinking (relative risk 1.12; 95% CI 0.90-1.39; 12 studies; 3832 participants; I2 24%, moderate certainty evidence), nor working >55 h/week (relative risk 1.11; 95% CI 0.95-1.30; 12 studies; 4525 participants; I2 0%, moderate certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses indicated that age may influence the association between long working hours and both alcohol consumption and risky drinking. We did not identify studies for which we had access to results on alcohol use disorder.
   Conclusions: Overall, for alcohol consumption in g/week and for risky drinking, we judged this body of evidence to be of low certainty. Exposure to long working hours may have increased alcohol consumption, but we are uncertain about the effect on risky drinking. We found no eligible studies on the effect on alcohol use disorder. Producing estimates for the burden of alcohol use disorder attributable to exposure to long working hours appears to not be evidence-based at this time.

AB  - The past decade has seen rapid growth in research that evaluates methods for reducing prejudice. This essay reviews 418 experiments reported in 309 manuscripts from 2007 to 2019 to assess which approaches work best and why. Our quantitative assessment uses meta-analysis to estimate average effects. Our qualitative assessment calls attention to landmark studies that are noteworthy for sustained interventions, imaginative measurement, and transparency. However, 76% of all studies evaluate light touch interventions, the long-term impact of which remains unclear. The modal intervention uses mentalizing as a salve for prejudice. Although these studies report optimistic conclusions, we identify troubling indications of publication bias that may exaggerate effects. Furthermore, landmark studies often find limited effects, which suggests the need for further theoretical innovation or synergies with other kinds of psychological or structural interventions. We conclude that much research effort is theoretically and empirically ill-suited to provide actionable, evidence-based recommendations for reducing prejudice.

AB  - (1) Background: A considerable number of systematic reviews, with substantial heterogeneity regarding their methods and included populations, on the impact of COVID-19 on infected pregnant women and their neonates, has emerged. The aim was to describe the obstetric-perinatal and neonatal outcome of infected pregnant women and their newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Methods: Three bibliographical databases were searched (last search: 10 September 2020). Quality assessment was performed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Primary outcomes included mode of delivery, preterm delivery/labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM/pPROM) and abortions/miscarriages. Outcomes were mainly presented as ranges. A separate analysis, including only moderate and high-quality systematic reviews, was also conducted. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020214447); (3) Results: Thirty-nine reviews were analyzed. Reported rates, regarding both preterm and term gestations, varied between 52.3 and 95.8% for cesarean sections; 4.2-44.7% for vaginal deliveries; 14.3-63.8% specifically for preterm deliveries and 22.7-32.2% for preterm labor; 5.3-12.7% for PROM and 6.4-16.1% for pPROM. Maternal anxiety for potential fetal infection contributed to abortion decisions, while SARS-CoV-2-related miscarriages could not be excluded. Maternal ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were 3-28.5% and 1.4-12%, respectively. Maternal mortality rate was <2%, while stillbirth, neonatal ICU admission and mortality rates were <2.5%, 3.1-76.9% and <3%, respectively. Neonatal PCR positivity rates ranged between 1.6% and 10%. After accounting for quality of studies, ranges of our primary outcomes remained almost unchanged, while among our secondary outcomes, maternal ICU admission (3-10%) and mechanical ventilation rates (1.4-5.5%) were found to be relatively lower; (4) Conclusions: Increased rates of cesarean sections and preterm birth rates were found, with iatrogenic reasons potentially involved. In cases of symptomatic women with confirmed infection, high maternal and neonatal ICU admission rates should raise some concerns. The probability of vertical transmission cannot be excluded. Further original studies on women from all trimesters are warranted.

AB  - Adolescence is a period that is characterized by growth and development rapidly. They have only limited knowledge regarding sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Adolescents girls are more marginalized and face many problems in society. Owing to a lack of knowledge on SRH, they succumb to various situations such as unhealthy menstrual hygiene practices, unwanted sex, teenage pregnancy, unsafe abortions, reproductive tract infections (RTIs), and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as HIV/AIDS. These have adverse effects on their mental health. This article reviews the literature to explore the knowledge, attitude, practices, and life skills regarding SRH among adolescent girls. Need for the inclusion of SRH and life skill education for adolescents in schools, strengthening health care programs, and involvement of various Non-Governmental organizations (NGO for adolescent wellbeing. A Search of relevant publications between 2011 and 2020 was done through multiple electronic databases such as MEDLINE, PUBMED, and Google scholar. A manual search on world health statistics, national programs regarding SRH was done.

AB  - Y Stroke is the leading cause of disability and thesecond leading cause of death worldwide. With the global population aged 65 and over growing faster than all other age groups, the incidence of stroke is also increasing. In addition, there is a shift in the overall stroke burden towards younger age groups, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Stroke in most cases is caused due to an abrupt blockage of an artery (ischemic stroke), but in some instances stroke may be caused due to bleeding into brain tissue when a blood vessel ruptures (hemorrhagic stroke). Although treatment options for stroke are still limited, with the advancement in recanalization therapy using both pharmacological and mechanical thrombolysis some progress has been made in helping patients recover from ischemic stroke. However, there is still a substantial need for the development of therapeutic agents for neuroprotection in acute ischemic stroke to protect the brain from damage prior to and during recanalization, extend the therapeutic time window for intervention and further improve functional outcome. The current review has assessed the past challenges in developing neuroprotective strategies, evaluated the recent advances in clinical trials, discussed the recent initiative by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in USA for the search of novel neuroprotectants (Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network, SPAN) and identified emerging neuroprotectants being currently evaluated in preclinical studies. The underlying molecular mechanism of each of the neuroprotective strategies have also been summarized, which could assist in the development of future strategies for combinational therapy in stroke treatment.

AB  - Background People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) must contend with a significant burden of disease. However, current studies of this demographic have yielded wide variations in the incidence of suicidality (defined as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and suicide deaths).
   Aims This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the lifetime incidence and prevalence of suicidality in PLWHA.
   Methods Publications were identified from PubMed (MEDLINE), SCOPUS, OVID (MEDLINE), Joanna Briggs Institute EBP and Cochrane Library databases (from inception to before 1 February 2020). The search strategy included a combination of Medical Subject Headings associated with suicide and HIV. Researchers independently screened records, extracted outcome measures and assessed study quality. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore the associated risk factors and to identify the sources of heterogeneity. Main outcomes were lifetime incidence of suicide completion and lifetime incidence and prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt.
   Results A total of 185 199 PLWHA were identified from 40 studies (12 cohorts, 27 cross-sectional and 1 nested case-control). The overall incidence of suicide completion in PLWHA was 10.2/1000 persons (95%CI: 4.5 to 23.1), translating to 100-fold higher suicide deaths than the global general population rate of 0.11/1000 persons. The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was 158.3/1000 persons (95%CI: 106.9 to 228.2) and of suicidal ideation was 228.3/1000 persons (95%CI: 150.8 to 330.1). Meta-regression revealed that for every 10-percentage point increase in the proportion of people living with HIV with advanced disease (AIDS), the risk of suicide completion increased by 34 per 1000 persons. The quality of evidence by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations for the suicide deaths was graded as 'moderate' quality.
   Conclusions The risk of suicide death is 100-fold higher in people living with HIV than in the general population. Lifetime incidence of suicidal ideation and attempts are substantially high. Suicide risk assessments should be a priority in PLWHA, especially for those with more advanced disease.

AB  - Background: Stroke is among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Interventions for stroke rehabilitation aim to minimize sequelae, promote individuals' independence and potentially recover functional damage. The role of aerobic exercise as a facilitator of post stroke neuroplasticity in humans is still questionable. Objective: To investigate the impact of aerobic exercise on neuroplasticity in patients with stroke sequelae. Methods: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials and crossover studies was performed, with searches for human studies in the following databases: PUBMED, EMBASE, LILACS and PeDRO, only in English, following the PRISMA protocol. The keywords used for selecting articles were defined based on the PICO strategy. Results: This systematic review evaluated the impacts of aerobic exercise on neuroplasticity through assessment of neural networks and neuronal excitability, neurotrophic factors, or cognitive and functional assessment. Studies that evaluated the effects of aerobic exercise on neuroplasticity after stroke measured through functional resonance (fMRI) or cortical excitability have shown divergent results, but aerobic exercise potentially can modify the neural network, as measured through fMRI. Additionally, aerobic exercise combined with cognitive training improves certain cognitive domains linked to motor learning. Studies that involved analysis of neurotrophic factors to assess neuroplasticity had conflicting results. Conclusions: Physical exercise is a therapeutic intervention in rehabilitation programs that, beyond the known benefits relating to physical conditioning, functionality, mood and cardiovascular health, may also potentiate the neuroplasticity process. Neuroplasticity responses seem more robust in moderate to high-intensity exercise training programs, but dose-response heterogeneity and non-uniform neuroplasticity assessments limit generalizability.

AB  - Background: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is the most prominent among the 'third wave' psychotherapies. This is the first systematic review that evaluates the current body of evidence for the efficacy of ACT as a therapeutic modality in OCD. Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the PubMed and Medline databases. The publications thus obtained were screened by title, abstract, and main text. Articles meeting the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed, and the results presented under the relevant sub-headings, to depict the various study designs employed in the included studies. Results: Out of 690 articles that were evaluated, 16 articles were finally included in the review. ACT was found to produce a significant decrease in OCD symptoms, with the gains largely being maintained at follow-up. Although ACT was more effective than control conditions like wait-list and placebo, it did not outperform the established frontline psychological treatments for OCD, i.e., traditional CBT and ERP. However, when combined with pharmacological management, ACT was comparable to a combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy in treating OCD. Conclusion: There is potential evidence to support the utility of ACT as a therapeutic intervention in OCD when used in combination with pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Introduction: The incidence of chronic kidney disease of unknown or uncertain etiology (CKDu) is recognized as a global non-communicable health crisis. The goal of this work is to compare the types of research studies in Latin America and Asia, two regions with increasing CKDu incidence.
   Methods: A comparative literature review was conducted to evaluate the CKDu research design for peer-reviewed articles published from 2015 to 2019. Full texts were reviewed to identify study location, study type, study design, risk factors evaluated, and if applicable, sample type and number.
   Results: In Asia and Latin America, 82 and 65 articles were identified in total, respectively, with 55 field studies in Asia versus 34 in Latin America. In Asia, research was focused on drinking water (34), heavy metals (20), and agrochemical product usage (19) as potential risk factors. In Latin America, research focused mostly on heat stress/dehydration (36) and agrochemical product usage (18) as potential CKDu risk factors. Biological samples were collected more frequently than environmental samples, especially in Latin America.
   Discussion: Research to pinpoint the risk factors associated with CKDu to date is not standardized and typically limited in geographical scope. The emphasis of CKDu research varies by geographic region, with a greater priority placed on water quality and chemical exposure in Asia, versus dehydration and heat stress in Latin America. Using a harmonized approach to CKDu research would yield improved understanding of the risk factors associated with CKDu and how they compare across affected regions.

KW  - KEY INGREDIENTS
KW  - STIGMA
AB  - The lived experience of people with mental illness is a powerful way to promote mental health literacy and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. However, there is little guidance on how to do this safely. Mental Illness Education ACT is an Australian organisation that since 1993 has supported volunteer educators to share their individual stories of lived experience to school and community groups. In 2011, they developed the DoNOHarm Framework to assist volunteers to be able to talk about their experiences in a way that is safe for them and for their audience, a gap that they recognised in the field. This study reports a review of the Framework, considering the extent to which it is supported by the current literature and how it is being implemented and experienced by the volunteer educators. These research questions were addressed by a literature review and interviews with 14 volunteer educators and the staff that support them. The review of published literature over the past 10 years showed strong evidence for three of the six principles of the Framework: Context and Purpose, Recovery Emphasis, and Safe Talking. Although the principle of Respectful and Inclusive Language is widely promoted in the mental health field, no recent studies investigated the benefits of this approach. Similarly, there was no recent research into the two principles of Limits to Helping and Self Care. The interviews revealed strong support for the Framework among volunteers. It was seen to be effective to protect the safety of both presenter and audience, ensure the relevance of the presentation, give educators confidence in their message and delivery, convey a hopeful message, and make certain that presentations were engaging for the audience. Overall, this review shows that the DoNOHarm Framework fills an important gap for mental health education, with a sound evidence base where there is published evidence available.

AB  - A major thrust of our laboratory has been to identify how physiological stress is transduced into transcriptional responses that feed back to overcome the inciting stress or its consequences, thereby fostering survival and repair. To this end, we have adopted the use of an in vitro model of ferroptosis, a caspase-independent, but iron dependent form of cell death (Dixon et al., 2012; Ratan, 2020). In this review, we highlight three distinct epigenetic targets that have evolved from our studies and which have been validated in vivo studies. In the first section, we discuss our studies of broad, pan-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in ferroptosis and how these studies led to the validation of HDAC inhibitors as candidate therapeutics in a host of disease models. In the second section, we discuss our studies that revealed a role for transglutaminase as an epigenetic modulator of proferroptotic pathways and how these studies set the stage for recent elucidation of monoamines as post translation modifiers of histone function. In the final section, we discuss our studies of iron-, 2-oxoglutarate-, and oxygen-dependent dioxygenases and the role of one family of these enzymes, the HIF prolyl hydroxylases, in mediating transcriptional events necessary for ferroptosis in vitro and for dysfunction in a host of neurological conditions. Overall, our studies highlight the importance of epigenetic proteins in mediating prodeath and prosurvival responses to ferroptosis. Pharmacological agents that target these epigenetic proteins are showing robust beneficial effects in diverse rodent models of stroke, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Incorporating both heritage (e.g., Latino) and national (e.g., American) cultural systems into our sense of self (i.e., bicultural identity) and developing the ability to successfully respond to demands associated with each of these systems (i.e., bicultural competence) have been theorized to be central to the development and positive adjustment of U.S. Latinos, a group that represents a large segment of the country's population. In this comprehensive review, we examined empirical research on biculturalism among U.S. Latinos spanning four decades (1980-2020), with a focus on synthesizing the field's understanding of antecedents and consequents associated with biculturalism and identifying directions for future research. Our review of 152 empirical articles revealed that this literature was characterized by multiple approaches to the conceptualization (i.e., dual-cultural adaptation, dual-cultural identity, bicultural identity integration, and bicultural competence) and subsequent operationalization of biculturalism. Although each conceptualization has different implications for the conclusions that can be drawn regarding an aspect or facet of biculturalism and potential influence on adjustment, a significant majority (78%) of studies, across conceptualizations, provided evidence supporting a positive association between biculturalism and Latinos' adjustment. In addition, a relatively small body of qualitative work was identified, and findings largely informed potential antecedents of biculturalism. We review this literature with attention to: the aspects of biculturalism that are associated with Latinos' adjustment (i.e., psychosocial and physical health), how sample characteristics may limit the generalizability of this work, and important directions for future research both in terms of conceptualization and study design.

AB  - The present meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between MS patients and control subjects in terms of their circulating levels of arsenic (As), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd). We searched Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase up until June 2020 to identify all studies that examined the concentrations of heavy metals in MS patients. Statistical tests used to assess inter-study heterogeneity were Cochrane's Q test and the I2 statistic. Given the observed significant heterogeneity, the random-effects model was employed to pool the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Out of a total of 1181 articles, 16 studies with 1650 participants (772 patients with MS and 878 controls) were included in this review meta-analysis. Pooled results using random-effects model showed that the levels of Pb (WMD= 0.73 mu g/L, 95 % CI= 0.33 to 1.12, P< 0.001), As (WMD= 2.48 mu g/L, 95 % CI= 1.44 to 3.53, P <0.001; I-2= 98.9 %, P <0.001), and Cd (WMD= 0.17 mu g/L, 95 % CI= 0.09 to 0.26, P <0.001) were significantly higher in MS patients than those of the controls. However, there were no significant differences in the levels of Hg (WMD=-0.14 mu g/L, 95 % CI=-0.77 to 0.49, P= 0.658) among both groups. Sensitivity analysis indicated that after excluding one-by-one study, the overall pooled WMD of Pb was changed. This meta-analysis showed that patients with MS had significantly higher levels of circulatory As and Cd compared to the controls. Yet, there was no statistically significant difference between circulating levels of Hg and Pb among MS patients and controls.

AB  - Narcissism, a trait reflecting egocentric exceptionalism and social selfishness, has captured scholarly interest due to its intricate composition and social implications. The construct is polyhedric, comprising several key forms: grandiose versus vulnerable, agentic versus communal, admirative versus rivalrous, collective versus individual. These forms can be integrated into structural models that add predictive power or process models that add explanatory power. The narcissistic nucleus is argued, and partly shown, to be brittle in the face of self-threat. The nucleus may derive from being overvalued, or inconsistently socialised, by parents. Narcissism entails intrapersonal benefits, as it can confer psychological health, buffer against adversity, and facilitate performance. But it can also be an interpersonal and societal liability, partly remediable with narcissism-reduction interventions.

AB  - Objective: To consolidate existing qualitative studies which examined the experiences and needs of adults living with IBS, and to gather a holistic insight for future directions and avenues to support these adults.
   Methods: A qualitative systematic review was conducted and six databases were searched for qualitative studies, beginning from each database's inception to July 2020. The qualitative data were meta-synthesised and thematic analysis was adopted. Any discrepancies that arose were discussed between the reviewers until a consensus was reached throughout the process of data screening, selection, critical appraisal and synthesis.
   Results: Seventeen studies with a total of 299 adults diagnosed with IBS were included. Four themes were identified: (1) physical, psychological, and social consequences; (2) impact of IBS on working adults; (3) dealing with IBS; and (4) sources of support and support needs.
   Conclusion: Future research across geographically diverse locations are needed to gather a thorough perspective of the experiences and needs of adults living with IBS. The development and evaluation of technology-based, trained peer-led volunteers, and interventions that adopt mindfulness, active coping strategies, cognitive behavioural therapy and acceptance, and commitment therapy are needed. Ultimately, the collaboration between the relevant stakeholders is essential for standardised instruments and materials for accurate testing, diagnosis, assessment, treatment and management of IBS.

AB  - Background: Globally, there is increasing scientific evidence of critical links between the oceans and human health, with research into issues such as pollution, harmful algal blooms and nutritional contributions. However, Oceans and Human Health (OHH) remains an emerging discipline. As such these links are poorly recognized in policy efforts such as the Sustainable Development Goals, with OHH not included in either marine (SDG14) or health (SDG3) goals. This is arguably short-sighted given recent development strategies such as the EU Blue Growth Agenda.
   Objectives: In this systematic map we aim to build on recent efforts to enhance OHH in Europe by setting a baseline of existing evidence, asking: What links have been researched between marine environments and the positive and negative impacts to human health and wellbeing?
   Methods: We searched eight bibliographic databases and queried 57 organizations identified through stakeholder consultation. Results include primary research and systematic reviews which were screened double blind against pre-defined inclusion criteria as per a published protocol. Studies were limited to Europe, US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Data was extracted according to a stakeholder-defined code book. A narrative synthesis explores the current evidence for relationships between marine exposures and human health outcomes, trends in knowledge gaps and change over time in the OHH research landscape. The resulting database is available on the website of the Seas, Oceans and Public Health in Europe website (https://sophie2020.eu/).
   Results: A total of 1,542 unique articles were included in the database, including those examined within 56 systematic reviews. Research was dominated by a US focus representing 50.1% of articles. A high number of articles were found to link: marine biotechnology and cardiovascular or immune conditions, consumption of seafood and cardiovascular health, chemical pollution and neurological conditions, microbial pollution and gastrointestinal or respiratory health, and oil industry occupations with mental health. A lack of evidence relates to direct impacts of plastic pollution and work within a number of industries identified as relevant by stakeholders. Research over time is dominated by marine biotechnology, though this is narrow in focus. Pollution, food and disease/injury research follow similar trajectories. Wellbeing and climate change have emerged more recently as key topics but lag behind other categories in volume of evidence.
   Conclusions: The evidence base for OHH of relevance to European policy is growing but remains patchy and poorly co-ordinated. Considerable scope for future evidence synthesis exists to better inform policy-makers, though reviews need to better incorporate complex exposures. Priorities for future research include: proactive assessments of chemical pollutants, measurable impacts arising from climate change, effects of emerging marine industries, and regional and global assessments for OHH interactions. Understanding of synergistic effects across multiple exposures and outcomes using systems approaches is recommended to guide policies within the Blue Growth Strategy. Co-ordination of research across Europe and dedicated centres of research would be effective first steps.

AB  - Serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic regions (5-HTTLPR) have been investigated intensively in suicide with inconsistent findings. However, a recent meta-analysis has observed an association of S allele with violent attempted suicide. The S allele causes a lower expression of 5-HTTLPR and is correlated with higher amygdala response to unpleasant stimuli. However, studies show that effect 5-HTTLPR genotype on mRNA expression is additive and linear. It suggests that apart from genotype, the expression of 5-HTTLPR is also controlled by epigenetic factors. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative review is to re-evaluate the findings of retrospective studies 5-HTTLPR in suicide with their limitations and highlight a new approach to understand the role of 5-HTTLPR in suicide. Reviews, meta-analysis, research articles, brief reports, and scientific correspondence were searched through PubMed, library web portal of Sikkim University, Bio-Med, and Science Direct using the terms such as "serotonin or serotonin system and suicide," "5-HTTLPR and suicide," "5-HTTLPR and attempted suicide," "5-HTTLPR and completed suicide," "5-HTTLPR meta-analysis and suicide," and "5-HTTLPR and epigenetics." The articles written in English were initially screened by title and later selected by abstract for possible inclusion. After the literature review, it was observed that previous studies were limited by variability of sample size, heterogeneous populations, varied social stressors, and variations in the assay and statistical methods. Hence, the cumulative study of environmental factors, 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism, and epigenetic factors is hereby proposed in the well-defined ethnic population to understand the role of 5-HTTLPR in suicide.

KW  - deep brain stimulation
KW  - major depressive disorder
KW  - treatment-resistant depression
KW  - medial forebrain bundle
AB  - Purpose: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a relatively new and still experimental treatment modality for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). There is preliminary evidence that stimulation of brain reward circuit structures or their connecting white matter bundles may exert an antidepressant effect. The main nucleus of the reward circuit is the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which plays a critical role in reward-seeking behavior, motivation, and addiction. Also, white matter bundles connecting different structures of the reward circuit have been studied clinically as targets for DBS, including the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) - a central component of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward circuit. This review aims to present the clinical outcomes of MFB DBS for TRD.
   Views: The scientific literature was reviewed using the following keywords: 'DBS', 'major depressive disorders', 'TRD', and 'MFB'. The identified studies were assessed on the basis of patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, and adverse events related to DBS. The search revealed five open-label clinical case studies and four case reports reporting the cumulative number of 35 patients treated by MFB DBS for TRD.
   Conclusions: The current clinical data of MFB DBS are limited by small sample size and the small number of clinical open-label trials. There is an urgent need for more clinical trials targeting the MFB for TRD. The results obtained in these studies showed a very rapid antidepressant effect observed within one week after the start of stimulation. MFB DBS for TRD should be considered as a last resort treatment due to its invasive character. However, this treatment may be a promising alternative for TRD patients.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered as the most common cause of dementia in elderly population. While the exact mechanism of AD has not been discovered, hyperbolic oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been proven to be effective in the treatment of this degenerative disease. The objectives of this article are to review the literature available on molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying HBOT and its efficacy in treating AD and to review the effectiveness of HBOT as an alternate treatment intervention in both human and animal models. 391 full text articles were included in the review after literature search between 1980-2021 from two online data base (ScienceDirect and PubMed). The following key words were used: 'hyperbaric oxygen therapy' and 'Alzheimer disease.' Based on the outcomes of clinical and experimental studies, this review advocates the use of HBOT for the treatment of AD. This review explores future directions and recommends further research into a treatment protocol that will maintain long-term cognitive health of AD patients.

KW  - DISORDERS
AB  - Background The World Health Organization (WHO)'s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP)-Intervention Guide (IG) aims to integrate mental health into primary care/community-based settings by equipping non-specialists with tools, training, and support to deliver evidence-based interventions. With the growing popularity of the mhGAP-IG, a systematic review was conducted by Keynejad and colleagues (2018) to identify articles reporting on evidence generated from the implementation and evaluation of the mhGAP-IG in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Their review identified peer-reviewed articles and one thesis. In this current review, we report on the implementation and use of mhGAP-IG documented in the grey literature, an important and accessible channel to share information for LMICs.
   Methods We searched grey literature databases for documents that reported on the implementation and/or use of the mhGAP-IG or its training modules: ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, the Mental Health Innovation Network (MHIN) database, the WHO website, the mhGAP Newsletter, and the first 10 pages of Google search results. Authors developed and adapted search strategies according to database characteristics. Database searches were completed by November 12, 2019.
   Results One hundred and fifty-one (n = 151) documents were included in our review. We report on where the mhGAP-IG has been implemented and/or used worldwide. Many types of personnel were trained in the mhGAP-IG and/ or used it in clinical practice. Contextual barriers and facilitators may influence the implementation and/or use of the mhGAP-IG, and we organized these according to structural, organizational, provider, patient, and innovation characteristics. Some information on evaluating the mhGAP-IG was documented in the grey literature. Outcomes included: feasibility of implementing and/or using the mhGAP-IG, its coverage, its impact on the capacities of personnel, patient outcomes, and policies, as well as program costs.
   Conclusions This review of the grey literature provides rich experiential knowledge that can complement information documented in the peer-reviewed literature. It is important for researchers conducting reviews on global health/global mental health topics to consider incorporating grey literature search strategies in their reviews. This may not only help to acknowledge the research/dissemination realities of many LMICs, but also to generate findings that reinforce and/or expand those documented in peer-reviewed articles.

AB  - Thyroid disorders account for a majority of endocrine diseases. The most frequent among them are Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid nodules and cancer with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Many thyroid patients travel a lot and therefore require appropriate guidance from their doctor. The aim of the review article is to discuss various aspects of travel in order to determine the optimal travel conditions for thyroid patients. Thyroid travelers must be well prepared for their journey. They should put particular emphasis on the choice of destination, the season and iodine resources at the planned place of stay. Before going on a journey, they are advised to check their health insurance, buy enough medications, prepare a copy of prescriptions and all other necessary documents. Depending on the means of transport, a few precautions should be taken to avoid infections or worsening of thyroid symptoms during travel. To deal with unpredictable events which might occur at the place of stay, travelers are recommended to take a first-aid kit containing basic medications. It needs to be stressed that many drugs are responsible for thyroid function disruptions and should only be used after consultation with a healthcare professional. Avoiding stress, maintaining good night's rest, as well as following a healthy diet, are all of great importance in managing thyroid diseases. Observing a few simple rules can minimize the frequency of flare-ups and the occurrence of the life-threatening thyroid storm. Traveling is an inseparable element of life for many people. Therefore, ensuring that patients are well informed about how to travel safely may prevent unwanted health events during travel.

AB  - Studies attempting to deconstruct the heterogeneity of schizophrenia and the attenuated psychosis syndrome consistently find that negative symptoms are a core dimension that is distinct from other aspects of the illness (e.g., positive and disorganized symptoms). Negative symptoms are also highly predictive of poor community-based functional outcomes, suggesting they are a critical treatment target. Unfortunately, pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for negative symptoms have demonstrated limited effectiveness. To address this critical unmet therapeutic need, the NIMH sponsored a consensus development conference to delineate research priorities for the field and stimulate treatment development. A primary conclusion of this meeting was that next-generation negative symptom rating scales should be developed to address methodological and conceptual limitations of existing instruments. Although second-generation rating scales were developed for adults with schizophrenia, progress in this area has lagged behind for youth at clinical-high risk (CHR) for developing psychosis (i.e. those meeting criteria for a prodromal syndrome). Given that negative symptoms are highly predictive of the transition to diagnosable psychotic illness, enhancing our ability to detect negative symptoms in CHR youth is paramount. The current paper discusses conceptual and methodological limitations inherent to existing scales that assess negative symptoms in CHR youth. The theoretical and clinical implications of these limitations are evaluated. It is concluded that new scales specifically designed to assess negative symptoms in CHR youth are needed to accurately chart mental illness trajectories and determine when, where, and how to intervene. Recent efforts to develop next-generation measures designed specifically for CHR youth to meet this urgent need in the field are discussed. These new approaches offer significant progress for addressing issues inherent to earlier scales. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mind-Body Physical Activity (MBPA) in educational settings is one possible preventive strategy for ameliorating stress-related physiological health parameters. The objectives of this study were to conduct a systematic review of the literature with meta-analyses on the effects of MBPA on stress-related physiological health markers in primary, secondary, and higher education students. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, the search for peer-reviewed articles published in English was conducted in PubMed, EBSCOhost, PsychInfo, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases. Criteria for inclusion consisted of empirical studies targeting the student population (primary, secondary, higher education), studies examining the effectiveness of an MBPA intervention, studies including a control or comparison group (pre-test/post-test studies excluded), studies targeting physiological marker outcomes such as heart rate, blood glucose, cortisol, and blood pressure, and finally, studies examining interventions implemented within educational settings. Twenty-six interventions were eligible for the review and quantitative synthesis, which comprised a total of 1625 participants, with 783 students serving within the control/comparison group. There were statistically significant and large pooled effects for MBPA effectiveness for lowering heart rate (Hedges' g = -1.71, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -2.43, -0.98), cortisol (Hedges' g = -1.32, 95% CI: -2.50, -0.16), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Hedges' g = -1.04, 95% CI: -1.53, -0.58). These effects tended to be stronger in older students compared to younger students. Most analyses were characterized as having high heterogeneity and only 10 of the 26 studies were characterized as good quality (38.4%). MBPA interventions may have a positive impact on specific physiological health markers in students, especially in students within higher education. However, higher-quality research is needed in this area.

AB  - Background: High treatment burden is associated with poor adherence, wasted resources, poor quality of life and poor health outcomes. Identifying factors that impact treatment burden in Parkinson's disease can offer insights into strategies to mitigate them.
   Objective: To explore the experiences of treatment burden among people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) and their caregivers.
   Methods: A systematic review of studies published from year 2006 was conducted. Qualitative and mixed-method studies with a qualitative component that relate to usual care in Parkinson's disease were included. Quantitative studies and grey literature were excluded. Data synthesis was conducted using framework synthesis.
   Results: 1757 articles were screened, and 39 articles included. Understanding treatment burden in PwP and caregivers was not the primary aim in any of the included studies. The main issues of treatment burden in Parkinson's disease are: 1) work and challenges of taking medication; 2) healthcare provider obstacles including lack of patient-centered care, poor patient-provider relationships, lack of care coordination, inflexible organizational structures, lack of access to services and issues in care home or hospital settings; and 3) learning about health and challenges with information provision. The treatment burden led to physical and mental exhaustion of self-care and limitations on the role and social activities of PwP and caregivers.
   Conclusion: There are potential strategies to improve the treatment burden in Parkinson's disease at an individual level such as patient-centered approach to care, and at system level by improving access and care coordination between services. Future research is needed to determine the modifiable factors of treatment burden in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Background: A considerable endeavor had taken place in order to understand the associated challenges for children and adolescents with Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) but also in order to describe the necessary skills and approaches that the care givers have to develop to assist both children and parents. (1) Aim: The aim of this review is twofold. Firstly, to highlight the T1DM's potential impact on psychological well-being, on cognitive functioning and on school performance in children and adolescents who confront SLD. Secondly, to discuss the necessity of a multidiscipline approach of poor school performance in students with SLD and T1DM, presenting the serious contribution of care providers: (a) parents/carers in the family setting, (b) teachers and psychologists in the school setting and (c) health specialists (pediatricians, nutricians, nurses, child psychiatrists and psychologists) in the medical setting. (2) Methods: In this narrative literature review of 12 selected articles, each one studies a special aspect of approach, during the diagnosis and the treatment of individuals with T1DM and SLD. The review concerns the arising problems and difficulties in the adherence to diagnosis, the management of insulin, the mental and physical wellbeing, the school performance, the cognitive functioning and learning difficulties of patients. We tried to synthesize an interdisciplinary approach that involves collaboration between family, school and medical frame; facilitating children's and adolescents' difficulties management, as well as parent and teacher involvement during the intervention implementation. (3) Results: The main issues of concern were examined through the available literature, as different factors had to be re-examined in the previous studies, regarding the potential impact of T1DM in cognitive and psychological functioning, as well as the effects of the intervention/approach/treatment of children and adolescents with SLD and T1DM. (4) Conclusions: Although T1DM diagnosis and demanding treatment are a heavy burden for children and their families, T1DM may or may not be associated with a variety of academic and psychological outcomes. Despite the variability of the reviewed research design quality, it was clearly defined that the impact of T1DM is not uniform across educational and mental variables. Strengthening the children's physical, psychological and social wellbeing is an especially important factor, as it facilitates the insulin's management as well as the learning difficulties. This is possible by supporting the parental and teacher involvement in the intervention process. This review highlights the need to reduce the distance between theory/research and practice, in some of the proposed areas in this field of knowledge.

AB  - Introduction
   Disasters triggered by climate and other natural hazards are increasing in frequency, severity and duration worldwide. Disasters disproportionately impact women and girls, with some evidence suggesting that violence against women and girls (VAWG) increases in disaster settings. Suggested risk factors for postdisaster VAWG include increased life stressors, failure of law enforcement, exposure to high-risk environments, exacerbation of existing gender inequalities and unequal social norms. We aim to systematically appraise the global literature on the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG.
   Methods
   We conducted a systematic review using the following databases: Embase, Global Health, Medline, PubMed and Social Policy and Practice and searched grey literature. We included quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods studies published in English language that examined the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG. We summarised the findings using a narrative synthesis approach.
   Results
   Of 555 non-duplicate records, we included a total of 37 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Among the quantitative studies, eight studies found a positive association between disaster exposure and increased VAWG, and four additional studies found positive associations with some violence types but not others. Qualitative findings offered insights into three hypothesised pathways: disaster exposure associated with (1) an increase of stressors that trigger VAWG; (2) an increase of enabling environments for VAWG and (3) an exacerbation of underlying drivers of VAWG.
   Conclusion
   As the first known global systematic review on the relationship between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG, this review contributes to the evidence base. We were limited by the quality of quantitative studies, specifically study designs, the measurement of variables and geographic scope. The severe health consequences of VAWG and increasing frequency of extreme events means that rigorously designed and better quality studies are needed to inform evidence-based policies and safeguard women and girls during and after disasters.

AB  - Background: Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) professionals must base their advice and interventions on evidence from science, in balance with their expertise, and with workers' and other stakeholders' values and preferences. Evidence-based professional practice is one of the remedies against misinformation creating confusion and distrust in the society.
   Objectives: To present, for OSH professionals, an overview and critical considerations about concepts, strategies, and tools needed for an accurate search for evidence-based information.
   Methods: Information sources have been collected and discussed as a base for a documented vision on knowledge questions, online information sources, search engines, databases, and tools.
   Results: Every search should start with a carefully phrased question. To help finding a reliable answer, potential evidence-based online sources are presented. Systematic reviews and original scientific articles are regarded as primary sources. Secondary and tertiary sources are discussed, such as practice guidelines, point-of-care summaries, advisory reports, quality websites or apps, Wikipedia, quality videos, and e-lessons. To find sources, adequate use of search engines and databases is required. Examples are discussed briefly, such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Virtual Health Library, NICE, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Work, Google (Scholar), and YouTube.
   Conclusions: Evidence-based practice in OSH must be stimulated, relying mainly on trusted online sources. The breadth of appropriate information sources is wider than described in most publications. Search engines facilitate the finding of quality reports, videos, e-courses, and websites. Such sources can be explored by well-trained professionals to complement the use of scientific articles, reviews, point-of-care summaries, and guidelines. Adequate use of online information sources requires awareness, motivation, and skills in professionals and educators. To date, the quality of skills in searching is low, thus a more adequate education is crucial. The quality of sources, search engines. and databases will be considered more thoroughly in another study. International collaboration is profitable and needs new drivers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Work participation among employees with commonmental disorders (CMDs) is an increasingly important, yet highly complex phenomenon. Given the call for preventing instead of reacting to negative work outcomes, there is a need to understand how employees with CMDs can continue working.
   OBJECTIVES: 1) to provide insights in applying a realist approach to the literature review process and 2) to present a way to develop an explanatory framework on work participation, the related causal mechanisms and the interaction with the work context.
   METHODS: A systematic realist literature review, using stay at work (SAW) and work performance (WP) as outcomes of work participation. This protocol paper explains the rationale, tools and procedures developed and used for identification, selection, appraisal and synthesis of included studies.
   RESULTS: The review process entailed six steps to develop so called 'middle range program theories'. Each step followed a systematic, iterative procedure using context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Conducting a realist review adds on the understanding to promote work participation, by examining the heterogeneity and complexity of intervention- and observational studies. This paper facilitates other researchers within the field of occupational health by demonstrating ways to develop a framework on work participation using realist synthesis.

AB  - Introduction: Many Indigenous peoples around the world are disproportionately affected by mental health challenges, due to intergenerational and collective trauma stemming from historical losses and ongoing colonialism. A growing body of literature suggests that mental wellness initiatives are more culturally safe and result in more successful and sustainable outcomes when they are developed by, for and with Indigenous communities using community-driven approaches that prioritize and privilege Indigenous leadership, knowledge systems, beliefs and practices. However, knowledge has not been synthesized on mental wellness initiatives and the extent of community engagement during the development, implementation, and evaluation stages of these initiatives.
   Methods: The authors conducted a scoping review of studies on Indigenous community-based mental wellness initiatives to identify the (1) characteristics of these initiatives, (2) types of evaluation approaches (specific measures and assessment tools), (3) level of community engagement from inception to the evaluation stage of the initiative, and (4) lessons learned as identified by the authors. Published and grey literature were searched across several electronic databases. Inclusion criteria required that each study was published between January 2008 and June 2018, focused on Indigenous peoples and their communities in Canada, USA, Australia, and/or New Zealand, focused on a community-based mental wellness initiative, was meaningfully co-led or co-designed by the community, described the initiative and how it was evaluated, and was printed in English.
   Results: The search yielded 1491 unique articles, and 22 of these articles met all of the inclusion criteria. All included studies took place in Canada, the USA, or Australia. Most mental wellness initiatives addressed general mental wellness, substance use, suicide prevention, and/or co-occurring conditions, and many were tailored for Indigenous youth. Culture-based initiatives were emphasized in most studies, with cultural adaptation and relevance prioritized in all initiatives. Approaches to evaluation ranged from process evaluations to outcome evaluations. Most studies used a mixed methods approach and a wide range of assessment tools, including questionnaires and indicators of community capacity building. Many evaluations used a shared leadership model between community leaders and researchers and had combinations of community members, families, Elders, Knowledge Keepers, and leaders involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the mental wellness initiative. Common challenges in conducting evaluation research included limitations of funding structures and the burden on community staff and leaders during the project.
   Conclusion: Overall, across all studies, culture stood out as a major theme for community-based mental wellness initiatives among rural and remote Indigenous communities, with cultural teachings, cultural activities, appropriate use of culture, land-based programming and knowledge sharing integrated into community programming. However, culture and Indigenous leadership throughout were lacking in many of the research studies. Thus, as more Indigenous communities and leaders govern and guide the development of evidence-based mental wellness programming, culture as a form of healing needs to be incorporated into the development of the program, and culture should be a core competency in any evaluation research.

TI  - Critical Review of Sustainability Priorities in the Heritage Sector: Evidence from Latvia's Most Visited Museums

KW  - cultural heritage
KW  - museums
KW  - museum accreditation
AB  - A vibrant debate about the role and participation of museums in urbanisation, industrialisation, human rights protection, technological progress, climate change and other global challenges has persisted in the field of museums ever since the boom of theoretical museology, which coincided with the development of the sustainable development concept. However, often culture is considered a part of social sustainability pillar, covering manifestations such as equity, participation, social justice etc. (Murphy, 2012; Vallace et al., 2011; Cuthill, 2010) or ignoring cultural aspects altogether (Chiu, 2004). Many voices have called to promote culture as the fourth pillar of sustainable development as a necessary foundation, condition or groundwork through which understandings of social, economic, and environmental sustainability may appear (Soini & Birkeland, 2014; Hawkes, 2001). Although the potential of cultural heritage institutions such as museums towards sus-tainable development is outlined in relevant literature, there has been no radical shift in museum practice (Ross, 2004; Simon, 2010; Nomikou, 2015).
   The paper aims to propose the first-ever critical review of sustainable development priorities in Latvia's most popular museums with a view to finding out their strategic priorities and using these findings to identify to-day's specific thematic development lines relevant to the museum sector within the sustainable development framework and to apply this bottom-up principle to propose potential ways to improve the general goal of Latvia's museum accreditation system - that of promoting sustainable museum practices - with specific pointers and thematic building blocks for the broad umbrella concept of sustainable development.
   Research objectives include (1) conducting a critical review of relevant literature to identify the role of cultural heritage within the evolution of the sustainable development concept (2) identifying the themes of sustain-able development that have been communicated as strategic priorities to stakeholders by the country's nine most visited museums and (3) using research findings to illuminate and pinpoint a specific array of themes pursuant to the general goal of Latvia's museum accreditation system - that of promoting sustainable mu-seum practices - for the system to serve as a more comprehensive and targeted tool for fostering sustain-able development in the heritage sector and beyond.
   Qualitative content analysis has been chosen to analyse museum development strategies and their collection, research, and communication policies, that is, the museum strategic documents to be submitted by the muse-ums seeking to receive state recognition. The study covers Latvia's nine most popular museums, whose joint annual share of visits amounts to 50% of the country's total rate (Latvian Academy of Culture, 2018).
   The study reveals substantial diversity in how Latvia's most popular museums approach sustainable devel-opment goals while also exposing a few significant downsides. According to the findings, museum priorities include (1) heritage preservation, efforts to strengthen national identity, and information and communication technology sustainability in the context of cultural sustainability, (2) financial sustainability as well as tour- ism-multiplication and image-building in the context of economic sustainability, (3) eco-cultural resilience and improvements in the infrastructure for better energy efficiency as well as a degree of progress towards more sustainable transportation solutions in the context of environmental sustainability and (4) physical, in- tellectual, socio-economic and emotional accessibility and a focus on boosting social capital in the context of social sustainability. Adjustment of accreditation requirements to meet the sustainable development priori- ties, at least identified within the study, should, in the long run, raise awareness within the field, enable mu- seums to target their efforts at addressing their downsides and finding possibilities for growth in the context of sustainable development as well as foster sustainable development in the larger field of cultural heritage sites and institutions, which, unlike its kindred sector of museums, exists outside the scope of restrictions associated with accreditation. Such adjustments will help achieve a broader input from the heritage sector towards sustainable development goals.

AB  - Introduction: Catatonia is classically associated with psychiatric conditions but may occur in medical and neurologic disorders. Status epilepticus (SE) is a seizure lasting more than five minutes or two or more seizures within a five-minute period without interictal recovery of consciousness. Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is SE without prominent motor activity that may present with catatonic symptoms. The relevance of NCSE as a potential etiology for catatonia is not clear in the literature.
   Methods: A systematic review was completed to evaluate the literature on NCSE presenting with catatonia. PubMed and PsycInfo databases were searched and articles were reviewed for the presence of catatonia and NCSE.
   Results: 15 articles describing 27 cases meeting inclusion criteria were identified. The authors add 1 case to the literature. The most common catatonic symptoms identified in NCSE were mutism and stupor. Clinical features frequent in NCSE presenting with catatonia included new catatonic symptoms, age over 50 years, comorbid neurological conditions, or a change in medications that affect seizure threshold. A documented psychiatric history was also common and may contribute to delayed diagnosis.
   Discussion/Conclusion: It is important to consider NCSE in the differential diagnosis of new catatonic symptoms. A suggested approach to diagnostic evaluation is provided.

AB  - Background: Physical exercise has been found to impact neurophysiological and structural aspects of the human brain. However, most research has used animal models, which yields much confusion regarding the real effects of exercise on the human brain, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Objective: To present an update on the impact of physical exercise on brain health; and to review and analyze the evidence exclusively from human randomized controlled studies from the last six years. Methods: A search of the literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases for all randomized controlled trials published between January 2014 and January 2020. Results: Twenty-four human controlled trials that observed the relationship between exercise and structural or neurochemical changes were reviewed. Conclusions: Even though this review found that physical exercise improves brain plasticity in humans, particularly through changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), functional connectivity, basal ganglia and the hippocampus, many unanswered questions remain. Given the recent advances on this subject and its therapeutic potential for the general population, it is hoped that this review and future research correlating molecular, psychological and image data may help elucidate the mechanisms through which physical exercise improves brain health.

AB  - Objective
   Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) and related syndromes are common and place a substantial burden on both patients and society. Chronic psychological distress and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system may be common factors associated with MUPS, although previous studies have reported mixed results. The aims of this meta-analysis are to provide an updated synthesis of studies investigating heart rate variability (HRV) indices associated with autonomic nervous system functioning in three common MUPS syndromes and to explain inconsistencies in previous study findings. Methods
   Literature search yielded 58 studies comparing HRV indices of reduced parasympathetic activity of healthy individuals with those of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (n(patients) = 271), irritable bowel syndrome (n(patients) = 1005), and fibromyalgia (n(patients) = 534). Separate random-effects meta-analyses were conducted on studies measuring root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and high-frequency HRV (HF-HRV). Results
   Regardless of syndrome type, patients had significantly lower RMSSD (k = 22, Hedges g = -0.37 [-0.53 to -0.21], p < .001) and HF-HRV (k = 52, Hedges g = -0.69 [-1.03 to -0.36], p < .001) than did healthy individuals. Sample age and publication year explained a substantial variation in RMSSD, whereas controlling for confounders in statistical analyses explained variation in HF-HRV. Conclusions
   Lower RMSSD and HF-HRV in patients with MUPS versus healthy controls indicates that autonomic nervous system dysregulation, particularly lower parasympathetic activity, may play a role in patients with these conditions. This conclusion may have important implications for the underlying mechanisms and treatment of MUPS and related syndromes.

KW  - PHQ-9
AB  - Objectives: Perinatal depression (PND) is a prevalent and disabling problem both during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The legacy screening measure has been the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). This systematic review examines the validity of the PHQ-9 as a screener for PND.
   Methods: The following databases were searched from January 2001 (when the PHQ-9 was first published) through June 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychInfo. Studies that compared the PHQ-9 to a criterion standard psychiatric interview were used to determine the operating characteristics of sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC). Studies comparing the PHQ-9 to the EPDS and other depression scales evaluated convergent validity.
   Results: A total of 35 articles were eligible for criterion (n = 10) or convergent (n = 25) validity. Meta-analysis of the 7 criterion validity studies using the standard PHQ-9 cut point >= 10 showed a pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC of 0.84, 0.81 and 0.89, respectively. Operating characteristics of the PHQ-9 and EPDS were nearly identical in head-to-head comparison studies. The median correlation between the PHQ-9 and EPDS was 0.59, and categorical agreement was moderate.
   Conclusions: The PHQ-9 appears to be a viable option for perinatal depression screening with operating characteristics similar to the legacy EPDS.

AB  - Higher education students often suffer from physiological and psychological health problems caused by stress, which may negatively impact their academic performance (AP). Physical activity (PA) can be a promising strategy to buffer these stress-induced complaints. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to summarize evidence for the tridimensional construct of PA, stress, and AP, as well as to quantify the relationships among these variables. Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, SMEI, ERIC, and Web of Science) were systematically searched in November 2019 for publications that examined PA, stress, and AP of university students, without any restrictions regarding the publication period. The systematic review includes four original research studies with a moderate-to-high risk of bias. Results of included studies were narratively summarized and quantified in a meta-analysis using random effect models. Whereas study results point to a positive relation between PA and AP, relationships between PA and stress seem to be negative, while the relation between stress and AP is undecided. The meta-analysis found no significant associations and considerable heterogeneity of the results. Findings indicate a research gap concerning the connection of PA, stress, and AP in university students. Future studies should use validated measuring tools and consider the timepoint of data collection in order to extract truly stressful periods.

AB  - Background: Understanding the drivers of intimate partner violence (IPV), perpetrated by men and experienced by women, is a critical task for developing effective prevention programmes. Objectives: To provide a comprehensive assessment of the drivers of IPV. Methods: A comprehensive review of the drivers of IPV, at the end of a six-year programme of research through theWhat Works to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls Global Programmewith reference to other important research in the field. Results: Broadly, we argue that IPV is driven by poverty, patriarchal privilege, and the normative use of violence in interpersonal relationships. These factors also increase childhood trauma, poor mental health and substance misuse, and poor communication and conflict in relationships, which in turn impact on IPV. Disability status, and contexts of armed conflict, or post-conflict, further reinforce and exacerbate these risks. We move beyond describing associations towards describing the causal pathways through which these factors operate to increase IPV. Conclusions: Specific recommendations about the future of further research on drivers of IPV include a greater focus on understanding the causal pathways from drivers to IPV and clearly delineating association from causality in studies, particularly for women and girls with disabilities, in armed conflicts, and adolescent girls and young women. To achieve this, we recommend extensive in-depth qualitative research, and complex quantitative modeling studies. Understanding drivers and causal pathways better will enable the identification of points of entry for the development of more effective IPV prevention interventions.

AB  - Meta-analyses on the relation between socioeconomic status (SES) and performance on measures of cognitive ability and achievement arrive at the same general conclusion of a small to medium association. Advancements in methods make possible for meta-analyses to examine specific pathways linking SES to cognitive ability and achievement, as well as the moderators of these pathways. In this study, we conducted a systematic overview of meta-analyses on SES to address three research questions: 1) what is the direction and overall strength of association between SES and performance on measures of cognitive ability and achievement, and how precise are the effect sizes reported? 2) to what extent have meta-analyses examined moderation by components of SES, age, sex, and race/ethnicity? and 3) to what extent have meta-analyses examined mechanisms linking SES to cognitive ability and achievement? We conducted a systematic search using online archives (i.e., PsycINFO, ERIC, PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science), searching issues in Psychological Bulletin and Review of Educational Research, and examining references and citations. We identified 14 meta-analyses published between 1982 and 2019. These meta-analyses consistently reported positive associations of small to medium magnitude, indicating that SES is a meaningful contributor to the development of cognitive ability and achievement. Fewer meta-analyses reported evidence of moderation by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. None of the meta-analyses directly examined mechanisms, but provided evidence of possible mechanisms for future research. We suggest that meta-analyses can increase their contribution to future research, interventions, and policy by narrowing their focus on specific pathways.

AB  - Background:
   Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising treatment modality for Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several targets and stimulation parameters have been investigated, and while previous meta-analyses have suggested that rTMS is efficacious, these have pooled different stimulation parameters and targets, and the relative efficacy of each is unknown.
   Methods:
   We therefore performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO and retaining RCTs with at least 5 individuals per arm and clinician-rated PTSD symptoms (PROSPERO CRD42019134984). We adhered to PRISMA guidelines, and 2 independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility and extracted the primary outcome of clinician-rated PTSD symptoms. Dropouts were extracted as a proxy for acceptability. Random effects pairwise meta-analyses and a network meta-analysis were performed.
   Results:
   We synthesize data from 10 RCTs with a total of 421 participants. Two rTMS interventions targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) improved PTSD symptoms relative to sham: low-frequency stimulation (SMD = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.22 to 1.18) and high-frequency stimulation (SMD = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.11 to 1.31). Medial PFC dTMS, right DLPFC intermittent theta-burst stimulation, and left DLPFC high-frequency stimulation did not separate from sham. Dropouts as a proxy for acceptability revealed no differences between any of the active conditions or sham nor did any of the active conditions differ from each other.
   Conclusion:
   The current literature does not support efficacy differences between interventions; however, protocols stimulating the right DLPFC appear superior to sham. It is unclear whether this reflects heterogeneity in pathology requiring a personalized medicine approach or nonspecific mechanisms of rTMS.

AB  - Background Ageing in place has recently gained visibility in healthcare policies and services. Technology has the potential to facilitate independence at home. The objective of this systematic review is to identify technologies that have been rigorously evaluated for supporting the ageing in place of healthy older adults. As well we explored the methods in engagement with technology in healthy older adults. Methods Databases Pubmed, Scopus, PsycInfo and Cinahl were consulted for clinical controlled trials or randomised controlled trials between 2014 and 2019. Studies were included if they contained a technological intervention and focussed on supporting healthy older adults' independent living. PRISMA guidelines and the risk of bias tool of the Cochrane Collaboration were applied. Results The search identified 3662 articles of which only 7 made the final analysis. Through narrative analysis, technologies were categorised into three groups: accessible communication, emergency assistance and physical and mental well-being. Patient-centredness was extensively addressed by exploring how the participants engaged in the development and evaluation of the technology and how they were trained and monitored. Conclusions Literature concerning technology to support ageing, based on controlled trials and research performed in authentic home situations, is scarce. Thus, there is a need to investigate the subject in depth. The use of a neurofeedback headband, an accessible computer system, a wristband with pedometer, a biofeedback device and an online video platform can bring added value to ageing in place for healthy older adults. A patient-centred approach for developing, implementing and evaluating technology benefits ageing in place.

AB  - Stromal interaction molecules (STIMs), including STIM1 and STIM2, are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are located predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They serve as calcium ion (Ca2+) sensors within the ER. In the central nervous system (CNS), they are involved mainly in Orai-mediated store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). The key molecular components of the SOCE pathway are well-characterized, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of this pathway need further investigation. Numerous intracellular target proteins that are located in the plasma membrane, ER, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasm have been reported to play essential roles in concert with STIMs, such as conformational changes in STIMs, their translocation, the stabilization of their interactions with Orai, and the activation of other channels. The present review focuses on numerous regulators, such as Homer, SOCE-associated regulatory factor (SARAF), septin, synaptopodin, golli proteins, partner of STIM1 (POST), and transcription factors and proteasome inhibitors that regulate STIM-Orai interactions in the CNS. Further we describe novel roles of STIMs in mediating Ca2+ influx via other than Orai pathways, including TRPC channels, VGCCs, AMPA and NMDA receptors, and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. This review also summarizes recent findings on additional molecular targets of STIM proteins including SERCA, IP(3)Rs, end-binding proteins (EB), presenilin, and CaMKII. Dysregulation of the SOCE-associated toolkit, including STIMs, contributes to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease), traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and stroke. Emerging evidence points to the role of STIM proteins and several of their molecular effectors and regulators in neuronal and glial physiology and pathology, suggesting their potential application for future therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Whether in the West or the East, the connection between the ear and the rest of the body has been explored for a long time. Especially in the past century or more, the relevant theoretical and applied research on the ear has greatly promoted the development of ear therapy, and finally the concept of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proposed. The purpose of taVNS is to treat a disease non-invasively by applying electrical current to the cutaneous receptive field formed by the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear. In the past two decades, taVNS has been a topic of basic, clinical, and transformation research. It has been applied as an alternative to drug treatment for a variety of diseases. Based on the rapid understanding of the application of taVNS to human health and disease, some limitations in the development of this field have also been gradually exposed. Here, we comprehensively review the origin and research status of the field.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of necrotic cell death characterized by its dependency on iron and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis has attracted much attention recently in the area of neurodegeneration since the involvement of ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease (PD), a major neurodegenerative disease, has been indicated using animal models. Although PD is associated with both genetic and environmental factors, sporadic forms of PD account for more than 90% of total PD. Following the importance of environmental factors, various neurotoxins are used as chemical inducers of PD both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases (AD and HD), many of the characteristics of PD can be reproduced in vivo by the use of specific neurotoxins. Given the indication of ferroptosis in PD pathology, several studies have been conducted to examine whether ferroptosis plays role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. However, there are still few reports showing an authentic form of ferroptosis in neuronal cells during exposure to the neurotoxins used as PD inducers. In this review article, we summarize the history of the uses of chemicals to create PD models in vivo and in vitro. Besides, we also survey recent reports examining the possible involvement of ferroptosis in chemical models of PD.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2). TNBC constitutes about 15-30 percent of all diagnosed invasive breast cancer cases in the United States. African-American (AA) women have high prevalence of TNBC with worse clinical outcomes than European-American (EA) women. The contributing factors underlying racial disparities have been divided into two major categories based on whether they are related to lifestyle (non-biologic) or unrelated to lifestyle (biologic). Our objective in the present review article was to understand the potential interactions by which these risk factors intersect to drive the initiation and development of the disparities resulting in the aggressive TNBC subtypes in AA women more likely than in EA women. To reach our goal, we conducted literature searches using MEDLINE/PubMed to identify relevant articles published from 2005 to 2019 addressing breast cancer disparities primarily among AA and EA women in the United States. We found that disparities in TNBC may be attributed to racial differences in biological factors, such as tumor heterogeneity, population genetics, somatic genomic mutations, and increased expression of genes in AA breast tumors which have direct link to breast cancer. In addition, a large number of non-biologic factors, including socioeconomic deprivation adversities associated with poverty, social stress, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of healthcare access and pattern of reproductive factors, can promote comorbid diseases such as obesity and diabetes which may adversely contribute to the aggression of TNBC biology in AA women. Further, the biological risk factors directly linked to TNBC in AA women may potentially interact with non-biologic factors to promote a higher prevalence of TNBC, more aggressive biology, and poor survival. The relative contributions of the biologic and non-biologic factors and their potential interactions is essential to our understanding of disproportionately high burden and poor survival rates of AA women with TNBC.

AB  - Zonisamide has been used as an add-on treatment in order to overcome the deficiencies of the general therapies currently used to resolve the motor complications and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson disease. Various trials have been designed to investigate the mechanism of action and treatment effects of zonisamide in this condition. Most clinical trials of zonisamide in Parkinson disease were from Japan. The vast majority of studies used changes in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and daily "OFF" time as primary endpoints. Based on adequate randomized controlled trials, zonisamide is considered a safe and efficacious add-on treatment in Parkinson disease. The most convincing proof is available for a dosage of 25-50 mg, which was shown to lead to a significant reduction in the UPDRS III score and daily "OFF" time, without increasing disabling dyskinesia. Furthermore, zonisamide may play a beneficial role in improving non-motor symptoms in PD, including impulsive-compulsive disorder, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and dementia. Among the various mechanisms reported, inhibition of monoamine oxidase-B, blocking of T-type calcium channels, modulation of the levodopa-dopamine metabolism, modulation of receptor expression, and neuroprotection are the most often cited. The mechanisms underlying neuroprotection, including modulation of dopamine turnover, induction of neurotrophic factor expression, inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis, inhibition of neuroinflammation, modulation of synaptic transmission, and modulation of gene expression, have been most extensively studied. This review focuses on structure, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms, therapeutic effectiveness, and safety and tolerability of zonisamide in patients with Parkinson disease.

AB  - A fascinating challenge in the field of human-robot interaction is the possibility to endow robots with emotional intelligence in order to make the interaction more intuitive, genuine, and natural. To achieve this, a critical point is the capability of the robot to infer and interpret human emotions. Emotion recognition has been widely explored in the broader fields of human-machine interaction and affective computing. Here, we report recent advances in emotion recognition, with particular regard to the human-robot interaction context. Our aim is to review the state of the art of currently adopted emotional models, interaction modalities, and classification strategies and offer our point of view on future developments and critical issues. We focus on facial expressions, body poses and kinematics, voice, brain activity, and peripheral physiological responses, also providing a list of available datasets containing data from these modalities.

AB  - Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has detrimental effects on human health. It induces oxidative stress, deregulates signaling mechanisms, and produces DNA mutations, factors that ultimately can lead to the development of skin cancer. Therefore, reducing exposure to UVR is of major importance. Among available measures to diminish exposure is the use of sunscreens. However, recent studies indicate that several of the currently used filters have adverse effects on marine ecosystems and human health. This situation leads to the search for new photoprotective compounds that, apart from offering protection, are environmentally friendly. The answer may lie in the same marine ecosystems since molecules such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and scytonemin can serve as the defense system of some marine organisms against UVR. This review will discuss the harmful effects of UVR and the mechanisms that microalgae have developed to cope with it. Then it will focus on the biological distribution, characteristics, extraction, and purification methods of MAAs and scytonemin molecules to finally assess its potential as new filters for sunscreen formulation.

AB  - Objective To identify possible socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with Good Outcome (GO) as compared with Poor Outcome (PO) in adult patients diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder (BD) who received long-term treatment with lithium. Methods A comprehensive search of major electronic databases was performed to identify relevant studies that included adults patients (18 years or older) with a diagnosis of BD and reported sociodemographic and/or clinical variables associated with treatment response and/or with illness outcome during long-term treatment to lithium (> = 6 months). The quality of the studies was scored using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies from the National Institute of Health. Results Following review, 34 publications (from 31 independent datasets) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Most of them (n = 25) used a retrospective design. Only 11 studies were graded as good or borderline good quality. Forty-three potential predictors of outcome to lithium were identified. Four factors were associated with PO to lithium: alcohol use disorder; personality disorders; higher lifetime number of hospital admissions and rapid cycling pattern. Two factors were associated with GO in patients treated with lithium: good social support and episodic evolution of BD. However, when the synthesis of findings was limited to the highest (good or borderline good) quality studies (11 studies), only higher lifetime number of hospitalization admissions remained associated with PO to lithium and no associations remained for GO to lithium. Conclusion Despite decades of research on lithium and its clinical use, besides lifetime number of hospital admissions, no factor being consistently associated with GO or PO to lithium was identified. Hence, there remains a substantial gap in our understanding of predictors of outcome of lithium treatment indicating there is a need of high quality research on large representative samples.

TI  - Cultural competency training for psychiatry residents and mental health professionals: A systematic review
KW  - Cultural competence training
KW  - systematic review
KW  - psychiatry residents
KW  - cultural competence psychiatry
AB  - Introduction:
   Cultural competence is a prerequisite skill for a psychiatrist. There is a dearth of information on the methods used for training of cultural competence and their outcomes. This study aims to explore and determine the existing methods used for cultural competency training (CCT) for psychiatry residents and how useful these training methods are.
   Method:
   A systematic review methodology based on PRISMA guidelines was adopted for this study. The literature search reviewed databases of PubMed and MesH, using keywords 'psychiatry resident', 'psychiatry', 'psychiatrist', 'mental health', and 'mental health professional'. In the end,14 articles qualified for the detailed review. The level of evidence and quality of the studies were evaluated and recorded.
   Results:
   The methods of cultural competence training identified were grouped as, active/passive/mixed; group training/individual training. These included documentaries or non-feature films based teaching, secondary consultation and cross consultation models, case vignette discussions, Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), behavioral simulation, video demonstration, cultural discussion in rounds, and traditional clinical teaching. The studies covered participants from different cultural backgrounds, mainly urban and predominantly university/institution based.
   Conclusion:
   There is limited literature in the area to conclude one method to be better than the other with respect to CCT in psychiatry residents. However, this review identified a variety of training methods, which can be used and pave way for research on their effectiveness. Training and evaluation of psychiatry residents in the area of cultural competence should be done routinely during their training to enable them to practice in the multi ethic societies.

TI  - Living life with cerebral palsy? A description of the social safety nets for individuals with cerebral palsy in the Nordic countries
KW  - Cerebral palsy

KW  - environmental factors
KW  - disability
KW  - CPNorth
AB  - Aims:
   This report reviews major laws, acts and regulations of social benefits and services for individuals with disabilities, focusing on cerebral palsy in the five Nordic countries. It summarizes the available benefits and services and the re-application process and provides comparative analyses among the countries.
   Methods:
   Published reports, articles and relevant government and municipal websites were reviewed for each respective country and used to compile an overview and comparison between the countries.
   Results:
   In the Nordic countries, there are a number of laws and regulations in place to support individuals with cerebral palsy and their families. In addition, there are numerous social benefits available for which individuals with disabilities can apply. Although there are national differences, the similarities across the five countries regarding laws, social benefits offered for individuals with cerebral palsy and the application processes are clear. However, the application processes seem cumbersome and, at times, redundant. Physicians and other healthcare specialists repeatedly need to write 'medical certificates' describing the diagnosis and its consequences for a disability that is chronic and lifelong.
   Conclusions:
   Participation in society for individuals with cerebral palsy disabilities can be enabled by social benefits. By extension, social benefits may indirectly have implications for public health in individuals with disabilities. Although the lives of individuals with cerebral palsy - as with others - can improve in certain areas, the need for social benefits will generally increase, not decrease, over time. Although it is clearly important to have checks and balances that prevent system misuse, it might be worthwhile from a cost-benefit perspective to investigate whether the current systems could be improved to better manage time and resources and avoid emotional distress by streamlining the application process.

AB  - Background: There is no study that has systematically investigated the breadth and validity of the associations of folate and multiple health outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the quantity, validity, and credibility of evidence regarding associations between folate and multiple health outcomes by using umbrella review of meta-analysis.
   Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to May 20, 2018, to identify potential meta-analyses that examined the association of folate with any health outcome. For each included meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size and their 95% confidence interval using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. We used the AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) to assess methodological quality and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation working group classification) to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome included in the umbrella review.
   Results: Overall, 108 articles reporting 133 meta-analyses of observational studies and 154 meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the study. Among them, 108 unique exposure-outcome-population triplets (referred to as unique meta-analyses hereafter) of RCTs and 87 unique meta-analyses of observational studies were reanalyzed. Beneficial effects of folate were observed in the all-cause mortality rate and in a number of chronic diseases, including several birth/pregnancy outcomes, several cancers, cardiovascular disease and metabolic-related outcomes, neurological conditions, and several other diseases. However, adverse effects of folate were observed for prostate cancer, colorectal adenomatous lesions, asthma or wheezing, and wheezing as an isolated symptom and depression.
   Conclusions: Current evidence allows for the conclusion that folate is associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality and a wide range of chronic diseases. However, folate may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Further research is warranted to improve the certainty of the estimates.

AB  - Lead contamination is a widely recognised conservation problem for raptors worldwide. There are a number of studies in individual raptor species but those data have not been systematically evaluated to understand raptor-wide lead exposure and effects at a pan-European scale. To critically assess the extent of this problem, we performed a systematic review compiling all published data on lead in raptors (1983-2019) and, through a meta-analysis, determined if there was evidence for differences in exposure across feeding traits, geographical regions, between hunting and non-hunting periods, and changes over time. We also reviewed the impact of lead on raptors and the likely main source of exposure. We examined 114 studies that were unevenly distributed in terms of time of publication and the countries in which studies were performed. Peer-reviewed articles reported data for 39 raptor spedes but very few spedes were widely monitored across Europe. Obligate (vultures) and facultative scavengers (golden eagle, common buzzard and white-tailed sea eagle) accumulated the highest lead concentrations in tissues and generally were the species most at risk of lead poisoning. We found no evidence of a spatial or decadal trend in lead residues, but we demonstrated that high lead blood levels relate to hunting season. Exposure at levels associated with both subclinical and lethal effects is common and lead from rifle bullets and shot is often the likely source of exposure. Overall, our review illustrates the high incidence and ubiquity of lead contamination in raptors in Europe. However, we did not find studies that related exposure to quantitative impacts on European raptor populations nor detailed studies on the impact of mitigation measures. Such information is urgently needed and requires a more harmonised approach to quantifying lead contamination and effects in raptors across Europe. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Previous studies have shown contrasting results in determining efficacy of statins against amyloid beta accumulation. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of statin in AD.
   Method: We searched PubMed and Embase for relevant preclinical studies. A meta-analysis of the statin's efficacy on amyloidosis and cognitive impairment was performed. Also, stratified analysis was performed on several covariates including the type of statin used, gender and age of rodents and duration of statin therapy, to account for the reported heterogeneity in the results obtained. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018102557).
   Result: 17 studies including 22 comparisons, containing a sample size of 446 rodents, participated in the metaanalysis of statin's effect on overall A beta deposition. Although the effect of statin on overall A beta deposition was found to be protective (p < 0.00001) but as we categorized the efficacy of statin on different A beta species (soluble and insoluble A beta 40/42) and A beta plaque load, we found that significance in the protection decreased. A stratified meta-analysis demonstrated a significant role in the duration of statin supplements and rodents age on the heterogeneity of the results. Statin administered to rodents for the longest duration (> 6 months) and younger rodents (< 6 months of age) demonstrated significant efficacy of statin on A beta deposition.
   Conclusion: Statin showed reduction in A beta level but stratified analysis revealed that this effect of statin was dependent on rodent's age and duration of the treatment.

AB  - Parkinson's disease, diabetic retinopathy, hyperoxia induced retinopathy, and neuronal damage resulting from ischemia are among the notable neurodegenerative diseases in which oxidative stress occurs shortly before the onset of neurodegeneration. A shared feature of these diseases is the depletion of OXR1 (oxidation resistance 1) gene products shortly before the onset of neurodegeneration. In animal models of these diseases, restoration of OXR1 has been shown to reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress induced cell death, delay the onset of symptoms, and reduce overall severity. Moreover, increasing OXR1 expression in cells further increases oxidative stress resistance and delays onset of disease while showing no detectable side effects. Thus, restoring or increasing OXR1 function shows promise as a therapeutic for multiple neurodegenerative diseases. This review examines the role of OXR1 in oxidative stress resistance and its impact on neurodegenerative diseases. We describe the potential of OXR1 as a therapeutic in light of our current understanding of its function at the cellular and molecular level and propose a possible cascade of molecular events linked to OXR1's regulatory functions.

AB  - To assess and compare the QoL of the older people dwelling in traditional family versus nursing home/institution. A comprehensive literature search was performed on 10 January 2018 to identify studies that investigated the QoL of older adults dwelling in family versus nursing home settings. Analyses were run using random-effects meta-analyses. A total of six cross-sectional studies with 1623 people were included. The quality of included studies was moderate. Meta-analysis showed that compared with nursing home support, the family support could significantly improve the physical health (6 studies, SMD = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.32-0.68, p < 0.05), mental status (6 studies, SMD = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.26-0.65, p < 0.05), and social relationship (5 studies, SMD = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.19-0.83, p < 0.05). Traditional family support model demonstrated a significant improvement in the physical health, psychological status and social relationships among older adults. The conclusions were driven by cross-sectional studies, Larger, adequately powered RCTs are required to confirm our finding.

AB  - Much thought has been given to the impact of Amyloid Beta, Tau and Alpha-Synuclein in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the clinical failures of the recent decades indicate that there are further pathological mechanisms at work. Indeed, besides amyloids, AD and PD are characterized by the culminative interplay of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperfission, defective autophagy and mitophagy, systemic inflammation, BBB and vascular damage, demyelination, cerebral insulin resistance, the loss of dopamine production in PD, impaired neurogenesis and, of course, widespread axonal, synaptic and neuronal degeneration that leads to cognitive and motor impediments. Interestingly, the acylated form of the hormone ghrelin has shown the potential to ameliorate the latter pathologic changes, although some studies indicate a few complications that need to be considered in the long-term administration of the hormone. As such, this review will illustrate the wide-ranging neuroprotective properties of acylated ghrelin and critically evaluate the hormone's therapeutic benefits for the treatment of AD and PD.

A systematic search identified thirteen papers, which were full text reviewed and data extracted. An intersection of stigma and discrimination, fear and shame, cultural norms and societal expectations coalesce to influence the ability, either physically through lack of service provision or emotionally through personal restraint, of MSM to access HIV-related health services. Many of the factors continuing to drive the ongoing HIV epidemic across the Southeast Asia region have humanitarian origin - access to safe and non-discriminatory healthcare, education on sexual health, and not being persecuted for having a health condition. These must be addressed with an interdisciplinary response at local, government and regional level.

AB  - Difficulty with communication and social functioning are two outstanding core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, and physical activity has long been suggested to improve autism spectrum disorder symptoms. In this meta-analysis of controlled trials, we examined the effects of physical activity interventions compared to controls on communication and social functioning in autistic children and adolescents. Included studies are published articles in English with autism spectrum disorder participants younger than 18 years. Literature search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and related databases through 6 May 2020. Quality of study was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool regarding randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, attrition, and selective reporting. We included 12 controlled trials (N = 350) with communication outcomes (k = 8) and/or social functioning outcomes (k = 11). Results show small to moderate intervention benefits on communication (standardized mean change = 0.27, 95% confidence interval (0.06, 0.48)) and social functioning (standardized mean change = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (0.15, 0.63)), but the result for social functioning may be susceptible to publication bias. Better intervention outcomes are observed in younger participants, suggesting the importance of early participation. This study shows the benefits of physical activity interventions, and they could be considered a cost-effective means for autism spectrum disorder management in the future.
   Lay abstract
   Difficulty with communication and social functioning are two outstanding core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, while there is no efficacious pharmacologic treatment available to deal with them. Traditional behavioral therapies usually require specialist therapist and be conducted in specific settings, increasing burdens on families and individuals with autism. Physical activity has long been found to promote physical and mental well-beings, and it is more affordable and versatile than traditional therapies. There is preliminary support for the use of physical activity interventions to improve communication and social functioning in individuals with autism. In this study, we quantitatively aggregate data from existing controlled trials to provide an up-to-date inquiry into the effectiveness of physical activity interventions on communication and social functioning in autistic children and adolescents. We included 12 trials involving 350 participants (8 trials reported communication outcomes and 11 trials reported social functioning outcomes) and found small to moderate benefits on communication and social functioning. Further analyses showed that the benefit of physical activity interventions is greater in younger participants. Results of this study suggest that physical activity interventions are effective to improve communication and social functioning in autistic children and adolescents, and early participation in the interventions can be more beneficial. Given their affordability, versatility, and efficacy, physical activity interventions could be considered a cost-effective option for autism spectrum disorder management in the future.

KW  - CARERS
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of psychological nursing of patients with stroke in China. The Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were searched from inception to February 1, 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the efficacy of psychological nursing of patients with stroke were included. Revman 5.3 and Stata 15.0 were used for data analysis. Twelve RCTs and 1,013 patients with stroke were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The results revealed a significant difference in the Hamilton depression score between the psychological nursing and usual care groups. The meta-analysis of three studies (n = 235) that used a depressive symptom control of >= 25% as the outcome measure showed a significant difference between the two groups. In addition, significant differences were detected in the National Institute of Health stroke scale score and activities of daily living score between the two groups. The present meta-analysis suggests that in China, compared to the usual care, psychological nursing is more effective for alleviating depressive symptoms, improving neurological rehabilitation, and recovering the ability of daily life.

AB  - Background: In response to the potentially concurrent mental health crisis due to the COVID-19 outbreak, there have been ongoing mental health policies put in place in China. This review aims to systematically synthesize the implemented national-level mental health policies released by the Chinese government during the COVID-19 outbreak, and summarize the implementation of those mental health policies.
   Methods: Six databases and two websites were systematically searched, including published studies and gray literature published between December 1, 2019 and October 29, 2020.
   Results: A total of 40 studies were included. Among them, 19 were national-level policies on mental health released by the Chinese government, and 21 studies reported data on the implementation of those mental health policies. Mental health policies were issued for COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, medical staff, the general population, patients with mental illness, and mental institutions. In the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, attention was paid to psychological crisis intervention. In the later stage of the epidemic, the government focused mainly on psychological rehabilitation. During the COVID-19 outbreak, more than 500 psychiatrists from all over China were sent to Wuhan, about 625 hotlines were notified in 31 provinces, several online psychological consultation platforms were established, social software such as TikTok, Weibo, and WeChat were used for psychological education, and many books on mental health were published. Responding quickly, maximizing the use of resources, and emphasizing the importance of policy evaluation and implementation quality were characteristics of the mental health policies developed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Challenges facing China include a low rate of mental health service utilization, a lack of evaluation data on policy effects, and no existing national-level emergency response system and designated workforce to provide psychological crisis interventions during a national emergency or disaster.
   Conclusions: This review suggests that China has responded quickly and comprehensively to a possible mental health crisis during the COVID-19 outbreak, appropriate mental health policies were released for different members of the population. As the epidemic situation continues to change, the focus of mental health policies has been adjusted accordingly. However, we should note that there has been a lack of separate policies for specific mental health issues during the COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - Background Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in schizophrenia, and recent progress has been made in understanding the reciprocal deterioration of both symptoms through structural and functional brain imaging studies. To date, there is limited literature on this topic. In this review, we synthesized the recent literature on the neuroimaging features of schizophrenia patients with concurrent AVHs and depressive symptoms.
   Methods A literature search was conducted with the major databases using the keywords, mainly including schizophrenia, AVHs, depression, neuropsychiatric disorders, brain imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results The existing studies have shown that AVHs and depressive symptoms reciprocally deteriorate in patients with schizophrenia, which has challenged the conventional treatment of the disease. Interestingly, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) therapies have emerged as two efficacious brain stimulation treatments that can normalize the brain regions associated with the symptoms, as shown through functional and structural brain imaging studies. In light of these important findings, there is an urgent need to conduct in-depth neuronal mechanistic studies to identify targets for stimulation therapy.
   Conclusions These new findings may elucidate the pathological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia with concurrent AVHs and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, this review has important clinical implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies to alleviate the reciprocal deterioration AVHs and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia patients.

AB  - Background Mental health crisis requiring emergency access to psychiatric service can occur at any time. Psychiatric Emergency Service (PES) is described as one that provides an immediate response to an individual in crisis within the first 24 h. Presently, several types of PESs are available in the United Kingdom (UK) with the aim of providing prompt and effective assessment and management of patients. Therefore, this study aims to provide a detailed narrative literature review of the various types of Psychiatric Emergency Service (PES) currently available in the UK. Method Electronic search of five key databases (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE, AMED and PUBMED) was conducted. Studies were included if it described a mental health service in the UK that provides immediate response in mental health crisis within the first 24 h. Excluded studies did not describe a PES, non-English, and were not conducted in UK. Results Nine types of PESs were found. Amongst the 9 services, more papers described crisis resolution home treatment. Majority of the papers reported services within England than other countries within the UK. Conclusion All types of PESs were described as beneficial, particularly to mental health service users, but not without some shortcomings. There is a need to continue carrying out methodological research that evaluate impact, cost-effectiveness as well as identify methods of optimising the beneficial outcomes of the various types of PESs. This may help inform researchers, policy makers and commissioners, service users and carers, service providers and many more on how to ensure current and future PESs meet the needs as well as aid recovery during crisis.

AB  - Background
   To identify the reliable and consistent grey matter volume (GMV) abnormalities associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), we excluded the influence of confounding clinical characteristics, comorbidities and brain degeneration on brain morphological abnormalities by inclusion of non-comorbid and non-geriatric drug-naive MDD individuals experiencing first episode depressive.
   Methods
   The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Google scholar databases were searched for papers published in English up to April 2020.
   Results
   A total of 21 voxel based morphometric (VBM) studies comparing 845 individuals in the first depressive episode and medication-naive with 940 healthy control subjects were included. The results showed a grey matter volumes reductions in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal and temporal gyri, temporal pole, insular lobe, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and amygdala. In addition, increased grey matter volumes in the postcentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, insula, basal ganglia, thalamus, amygdala, cuneus, and precuneus differentiated the first depressive episode in medication-naive individuals from healthy subjects.
   Conclusion
   The present systematic review provided additional support for the involvement of grey matter structural abnormalities in limbic-cortical circuits as possibly specific structural abnormalities in the early stage of MDD.

AB  - Question How do deficits in social cognition diverge or overlap between individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)? Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 36 studies directly comparing social cognitive performance in individuals with SSDs vs ASD, there were no statistically significant differences in emotion processing or theory of mind. Meaning Similar levels of social cognitive impairment may be present in individuals with SSDs and ASD, but cross-disorder studies probing social cognitive domains with larger samples, consistent reporting of clinical measures, and neuroimaging are needed to substantiate these findings, clarify underlying mechanisms, and parse heterogeneity.
   Importance Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) both feature social cognitive deficits; however, these disorders historically have been examined separately using a range of tests and subdomain focus and at different time points in the life span. Moving beyond diagnostic categories and characterizing social cognitive deficits can enhance understanding of shared pathways across these disorders. Objective To investigate how deficits in social cognitive domains diverge or overlap between SSDs and ASD based on the extant literature. Data Sources Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science from database inception until July 26, 2020. Study Selection Original research articles were selected that reported performance-based measures of social cognition in both SSDs and ASD samples. Selected articles also had to be published in English and use International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, DSM-IV, or more recent diagnostic criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines, including data extraction and quality assessment using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures Effect sizes were calculated as Hedges g (SSDs vs ASD). The primary outcomes were performance on emotion processing tasks, theory of mind (ToM) tasks, and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) in SSDs compared with ASD. Meta-regressions were performed for age difference, publication year, quality assessment scores, and antipsychotic medication use. Results Of the 4175 screened articles, 36 studies directly comparing social cognitive performance in individuals with SSDs vs ASD were included in the qualitative analysis (n = 1212 for SSDs groups and n = 1109 for ASD groups), and 33 studies were included in the quantitative analyses (n = 1113 for SSDs groups and n = 1015 for ASD groups). Most study participants were male (number of studies [k] = 36, 72% [878 of 1212] in SSDs groups and 82% [907 of 1109] in ASD groups), and age (k = 35) was older in SSDs groups (mean [SD], 28.4 [9.5] years) than in ASD groups (mean [SD], 23.3 [7.6] years). Included studies highlighted the prevalence of small, male-predominant samples and a paucity of cross-disorder clinical measures. The meta-analyses revealed no statistically significant differences between SSDs and ASD on emotion processing measures (k = 15; g = 0.12 [95% CI, -0.07 to 0.30]; P = .21; I-2 = 51.0%; 1 outlier excluded), ToM measures (k = 17; g = -0.01 [95% CI, -0.21 to 0.19]; P = .92; I-2 = 56.5%; 1 outlier excluded), or the RMET (k = 13; g = 0.25 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.53]; P = .10; I-2 = 75.3%). However, SSDs vs ASD performance differences between studies were statistically significantly heterogeneous, which was only minimally explained by potential moderators. Conclusions and Relevance In this analysis, similar levels of social cognitive impairment were present, on average, in individuals with SSDs and ASD.
   Cross-disorder studies of social cognition, including larger samples, consensus batteries, and consistent reporting of measures, as well as data across multiple levels of analysis, are needed to help identify subgroups within and across disorders that may be more homogeneous in etiology and treatment response.
   This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates how deficits in social cognitive domains diverge or overlap between schizophrenia spectrum disorders and autism spectrum disorder based on the extant literature.

AB  - Objective Recent studies have shown a pathophysiologic link between headache and multiple sclerosis (MS), but the prevalence of primary headaches among patients with MS differs substantially across studies. This meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively gather available evidence to estimate the prevalence of primary headaches among patients with MS.
   Method We systematically searched the electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies that measured the prevalence of headache among patients with MS. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts to identify the eligible studies and the full texts of the included studies were reviewed. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the risk of bias of the included literatures. We then conducted a meta-analysis using Stata Software 15.0 to calculate the pooled prevalence of headaches among patients with MS and assess the source of heterogeneity.
   Results We identified 16 eligible studies covering a total of 3,560 patients with MS. The pooled estimated prevalence of primary headaches among patients with MS was 56%. The statistical heterogeneity was moderate with I-2 of 82.1% (p < .001). Both a visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger' regression tests revealed no significant publication bias (p = .44). The pooled estimated prevalence of migraine (55%) was higher in comparison with that of tension-type headache (20%). The prevalence of migraine subtype was 16% and 10% for migraine without aura and migraine with aura, respectively. The pooled prevalence of primary headache in case-control group (57%) was approximately in line with the cross-sectional group (56%).
   Conclusion The overall prevalence of primary headaches among patients with MS was considerably high. Clinical screening of headache among patients with MS will be helpful to formulate an individualized treatment plans and alleviate the physical and mental impact of the disease.

AB  - Background Various parent training interventions have been shown to have some effect on the symptoms of children with autism. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analyses to assess effectiveness of parental training for children with autism on their symptoms and parental stress. Methods Four electronic databases, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched until March 2020 for relevant literature. Two reviewers independently screened bibliographies using an eligibility checklist and extracted data using a structured proforma. We have also carried out meta-analyses when data were available for pooling. Results Seventeen papers from 15 studies were included for data analysis. Fifteen papers showed a positive treatment effect when compared with the control group, although not always significant. Meta-analysis based on pooled data from only two studies in each respective intervention, showed small to moderate treatment effects for three interventions, DIR/Floortime, Pivotal Response and Parent focused training respectively. Conclusions As in previous systematic reviews there was a mild to moderate treatment effects of three specific types of interventions respectively. However, it was difficult to draw any definitive conclusion about the effectiveness and generalisability of any intervention because of the wide variation in the interventions, control groups, outcome measures, small sample size, small number of studies in meta-analysis, overlap between the intervention and control procedures used in the included studies. There is an urgent need for experts in various international centres to jointly standardise a parent training intervention for children with autism and carry out a large scale RCT to assess its clinical and economic effectiveness.

AB  - Background There are a variety of residential and community service models of therapeutic interventions for people using substances. The focus of much of the currently available research is on adult populations with relatively little known about effective therapeutic interventions for adolescents. The aim of this paper is to identify the most effective therapeutic interventions for Australian adolescents using substances by conducting a systematic scoping literature review. Methods We followed the PRISMA guidelines to conduct a systematic scoping review that included searches of nine electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, EBSCO Host, APA PsycNet, SocIndex, Social Science s, Proquest Central Informit) and grey literature searches of government department and alcohol and other drugs peak body and service provider websites, Google Scholar and the Cochrane library. Results A total of 21 studies were identified. These studies included biological, psychological, social and technological therapeutic interventions targeted at different population groups and different substances. The review findings are limited and should considered with caution due to the inability to disaggregate the combinations of interventions provided and the low quality of most of the studies included. Conclusions This scoping review highlights the paucity of quality research on effective therapeutic interventions for Australian adolescents using substances. This is primarily due to the available studies not controlling for all of the therapeutic interventions provided. While there is an evidence-base for some of these interventions, others such as encounter groups and journaling require further and more substantive research for use with adolescents. This is necessary to enable informed service design and delivery decision-making and fiscal accountability.

AB  - Background: The use of atypical antipsychotics which currently form the primary choice pharmacotherapy for several mental health conditions have been linked to cardiovascular and metabolic side effects. This systematic review aimed to investigate the barriers to monitoring and management of cardiovascular co-morbidities in patients prescribed antipsychotic medicines.
   Methods: A protocol-led (CRD-42018106002) systematic literature review was conducted by searching Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases 2003 until October 2019. Cochrane, Centre for Review and Dissemination (CRD) and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Studies investigating barriers to monitoring and management of cardiovascular co-morbidities in patients prescribed antipsychotic medicines were included.
   Results: A total of 23 records were included. Key barriers included a) health-care system-related factors such as lack of knowledge and expertise amongst care providers, available resources, confusion around remit and roles, fragmentation of care such as across general practitioners and psychiatrists, and time constraints and b) patient-related factors such as disability resulting from mental health conditions, knowledge and skills of the patients.
   Conclusion: Barriers to monitoring and management of cardiovascular and metabolic health of patients taking antipsychotic medicines are multidimensional. Apart from educational interventions directed to both patients and health-care professionals, the results suggest a need for the improvement of wider system-related factors to improve physical health of patients prescribed antipsychotic medicines. Clearer guidelines, clarity of remit and roles amongst service providers are necessary in addition to educational interventions directed at patients and health-care professionals in improving physical health monitoring, counselling and management of patients prescribed antipsychotic medicines.

AB  - Suicide is an important public problem in China. The characteristics of Chinese graduate students' suicides and the reasons they occur have never been reported systematically. We conducted a systematic search of public reports on local media and medical websites in this review to gain a basic understanding of these questions. A total of 150 cases of graduate students' suicides were reported from 2000 to 2019. Among the 150 students, 65.8% were male, nearly half between 26 and 30 years old, most (83.3%) never married, and 43.4% of graduation students committed suicide in graduation year and postponed years. The top three suicide methods were jumping, hanging, and drowning. Graduation pressure, depression, and academic pressure were the three leading suicidal causes. There is an urgent need for the Chinese government and universities to pay more attention to prevent suicides among graduate students.

AB  - Objective To provide an estimate of the effect of interventions on comorbid depressive disorder (MDD) or subthreshold depression in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
   Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcome of depression treatments in diabetes and comorbid MDD or subthreshold symptoms published before August 2019 compared to care as usual (CAU), placebo, waiting list (WL), or active comparator treatment as in a comparative effectiveness trial (CET). Primary outcomes were depressive symptom severity and glycemic control. Cohen's d is reported.
   Results Forty-three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected, and 32 RCTs comprising 3,543 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that, compared to CAU, placebo or WL, all interventions showed a significant effect on combined outcome 0,485 (95% CI 0.360; 0.609). All interventions showed a significant effect on depression. Pharmacological treatment, group therapy, psychotherapy, and collaborative care had a significant effect on glycemic control. High baseline depression score was associated with a greater reduction in HbA(1)c and depressive outcome. High baseline HbA(1)c was associated with a greater reduction in HbA(1)c.
   Conclusion All treatments are effective for comorbid depression in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Over the last decade, new interventions with large effect sizes have been introduced, such as group-based therapy, online treatment, and exercise. Although all interventions were effective for depression, not all treatments were effective for glycemic control. Effective interventions in comorbid depressive disorder may not be as effective in comorbid subthreshold depression. Baseline depression and HbA(1)c scores modify the treatment effect. Based on the findings, we provide guidance for treatment depending on patient profile and desired outcome, and discuss possible avenues for further research.

AB  - The use of neuroscience tools to study consumer behavior and the decision making process in marketing has improved our understanding of cognitive, neuronal, and emotional mechanisms related to marketing-relevant behavior. However, knowledge about neuroscience tools that are used in consumer neuroscience research is scattered. In this article, we present the results of a literature review that aims to provide an overview of the available consumer neuroscience tools and classifies them according to their characteristics. We analyse a total of 219 full-texts in the area of consumer neuroscience. Our findings suggest that there are seven tools that are currently used in consumer neuroscience research. In particular, electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking (ET) are the most commonly used tools in the field. We also find that consumer neuroscience tools are used to study consumer preferences and behaviors in different marketing domains such as advertising, branding, online experience, pricing, product development and product experience. Finally, we identify two ready-to-use platforms, namely iMotions and GRAIL that can help in integrating the measurements of different consumer neuroscience tools simultaneously. Measuring brain activity and physiological responses on a common platform could help by (1) reducing time and costs for experiments and (2) linking cognitive and emotional aspects with neuronal processes. Overall, this article provides relevant input in setting directions for future research and for business applications in consumer neuroscience. We hope that this study will provide help to researchers and practitioners in identifying available, non-invasive and useful tools to study consumer behavior.

AB  - Objective
   This study tests the impact of threat on compassion and vaccination intention among healthcare workers (HCWs) with low and high socio-economic status (SES) in France.
   Design
   A total of 309 HCWs were analyzed (M-age =39.29, SD = 11.76). Participants with high (n = 138) or low (n = 171) SES were randomly assigned to a Threat (n = 187) versus a No-Threat (n = 122) condition through filling in MacArthur's scale. During this manipulation, participants read about an interaction involving a HCW with an SES higher than that of the participant. After filling in the MacArthur scale, all participants went through a compassion manipulation. Finally, participants read a text describing a patient's distress.
   Main Outcome Measures
   The primary outcome was the vaccination intention score. The secondary outcome included the compassion score.
   Results
   The interaction of the Group X SES Subjective on compassion was not significant (p = .34, eta(p)
   (2) = .003, 95%CI [-.39,.07]). The interaction of the Group X Diploma on vaccination intention with high compassion was significant (p<.001, eta(p)
   (2) = .173, 95%CI [.11,1.68]). Planned comparisons revealed a significant difference in vaccination intention score between HCWs with low SES between Threat (M = 3.58, SD = 2.56) and No-Threat (M = 5.27, SD = 2.27; p=.01) conditions.
   Conclusion
   Ultimately, compassion inhibited the distress elicited in the threat condition in HCWs with high compassion.

AB  - Objective: The dopaminergic system is involved in many psychiatric disorders as a GABAergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic system. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to elucidate the alteration of the dopaminergic system in anxiety and compulsive disorders.
   Methods: The databases of Pubmed, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched and articles reporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in patients with anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were recognized. The key research data were extracted from the included articles and standardized mean differences were calculated using meta-analyses if there were more than two studies with obtainable data. Sensitivity analyses were further performed to detect the stability of results, and the qualities of all the included studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale.
   Results: Finally, we identified 8 and 11 studies associated with anxiety disorder and OCD for further analysis, respectively. Most consistently, the striatal dopamine D-2 receptor (D2R) of OCD patients had decreased while no significant correlation was found between striatal D2R and disease severity. The striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) had not been significantly altered in both the anxiety disorder and OCD patients. The heterogeneity values from the meta-analyses were extremely high while those results remained stable after sensitivity analyses. Inconsistent data were found in the striatal D2R of patients with anxiety disorder. Limited data had suggested that dopamine synthesis increased in most regions of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum in OCD patients.
   Conclusions: The most convincing finding was that the D-2 receptor decreased in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. The dopamine transporter may have no relationship with anxiety and compulsive disorder.

AB  - Background: In the context of a growing body of literature on incorporating visual media in researching well-being and mental health, this systematic review examined the evidence of using photography-based research methods in exploring recovery from mental distress, their outcomes, but also limitations and challenges encountered by researchers.
   Methodology: Six cross-disciplinary electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, Arts & Humanities) were systematically searched resulting in a total of 15 qualitative and mixed-methods studies included in a thematic synthesis.
   Results: Photo-elicitation and photovoice were identified as the main photographic methods employed in recovery research along with less common, but nonetheless creative, techniques. Four key themes were identified through thematic analysis in photography-based recovery studies: enhanced understanding, collaboration and empowerment, situatedness, and storytelling. The results of this review revealed photography as a valuable methodological tool with potential to contribute to conceptualising recovery from the stance of research participants, but also facilitate and support their recovery processes.
   Conclusions: Recovery research can benefit from the use of photographic methods that are widely accessible, versatile, and interactive. They may offer mental health researchers alternative ways to explore individuals' perspective on recovery in ways that are creative, empowering, and supportive of their recovery.

AB  - Objectives
   Anhedonia, or the inability or the loss of the capacity to experience pleasure, is a core feature of several psychiatric disorders. Different types of anhedonia have been described including social and physical anhedonia, appetitive or motivational anhedonia, consummatory and anticipatory anhedonia. Musical anhedonia is a rare condition where individuals derive no reward responses from musical experience.
   Methods
   We searched the PubMed electronic database for all articles with the search term "musical anhedonia".
   Results
   A final set of 12 articles (six original research articles and six clinical case reports) comprised the set we reviewed.
   Conclusions
   Individuals with specific musical anhedonia show normal responses to other types of reward, suggesting a specific deficit in musical reward pathways. Those individuals are not necessarily affected by psychiatric conditions, have normal musical perception capacities, and normal recognition of emotions depicted in music. Individual differences in the tendency to derive pleasure from music are associated with structural connections from auditory association areas in the superior temporal gyrus to the anterior insula. White matter connectivity may reflect individual differences in the normal variations of reward experiences in music. The moderate amount of heterogeneity between the reviewed studies is a limitation to the generalizability of our conclusions.

Developments in identifying the neural correlates of pain-related fear are important for understanding the mechanisms underlying chronic pain and warrant synthesis to establish the state-of-the-art. Using effect-size signed differential mapping, this meta-analysis combined nine MRI studies and compared the overlap in these correlates of pain-related fear to those of other non-pain-related conditioned fears (55 studies). Pain-related fear was characterized by neural activation of the supramarginal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, inferior/middle frontal gyri, frontal operculum and insula, pre-/post-central gyri, medial frontal and (para-) cingulate cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and putamen. There were differences with other non-pain-related conditioned fears, specifically in the inferior frontal gyrus, medial superior frontal gyrus, post-central gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, parieto-occipital sulcus, and striatum. We conclude that pain-related and non-pain related conditioned fears recruit overlapping but distinguishable networks, with potential implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying different psychopathologies.

AB  - Background: This scoping review aimed to identify the available evidence related to physical activity (PA) and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A search in 6 databases (PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL) was conducted on July 23, 2020. Medical subject headings and keywords related to PA and COVID-19 were combined to conduct the online search, which covered the period from January to July 2020. Results: Overall, 1784 articles were retrieved. After duplicate removal and title, abstract, and full-text screening, 41 articles were included. Most of the included studies were quantitative and collected data through online interviews/questionnaires, with sample sizes larger than 100 and composed by adults and older adults. Changes in PA levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic were the most assessed outcome, followed by the association between mental health issues and PA. Only 2 studies assessed the direct effects of PA on COVID-19. Conclusion: Most of the evidence identified a decrease in PA levels due to social distancing measures and that PA might help to decrease the mental health burden related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

TI  - Risk communication in cyberspace: a brief review of the information-processing and mental models approaches
KW  - EYE-TRACKING
KW  - COMPREHENSION
KW  - WARNINGS
KW  - FMRI
AB  - Effective risk communication in cyberspace is critical for users to understand the potential security risks and make secure decisions. Two approaches to risk communication originating from psychology, the human information-processing approach and the mental-models approach, have been widely applied in other research fields of risk communication. The human information-processing approach characterizes the human as a communication system, with risk-communication information from a source delivered to the receiver, who processes the information via various stages. The mental-models approach emphasizes the importance of understanding experts' and non-experts' mental models, comparing these models, and drafting and evaluating risk-communication messages. With an overview of these two approaches and their applications, the goal of this paper is to provide insights for future use of these approaches in cybersecurity.

AB  - We undertook a scoping study to map the relevant evidence, summarise the findings, and to help identify gaps in the knowledge base on the relationship between land use/land-use change and human health in Australia. Our systematic search of the scientific literature for relevant articles up to August 2020 identified 37 articles. All 37 articles meeting our inclusion criteria were published after 2003. Zoonotic or vector-borne disease constituted the most common health outcome type studied. Agriculture/grazing was the land use/land-use change type most frequently represented in the literature, followed by coal seam gas extraction and open cut coal mining. The relationship between land use/land use change and human health in Australia, is not conclusive from the existing evidence. This is because of (1) a lack of comprehensive coverage of the topic, (2) a lack of coverage of the geography, (3) a lack of coverage of study types, and (4) conflicting results in the research already undertaken. If we are to protect human health and the ecosystems which support life, more high-quality, specific, end-user driven research is needed to support land management decisions in Australia. Until the health effects of further land use change are better known and understood, caution ought to be practiced in land management and land conversion.

AB  - The rapid uptake of the internet has provided a new platform for people to engage with almost all aspects of life. As such, it is currently crucial to investigate the relationship between the internet and cognition across contexts and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms driving this. We describe the current understanding of this relationship across the literature and outline the state of knowledge surrounding the potential neurobiological drivers. Through focusing on two key areas of the nascent but growing literature, first the individual- and population-level implications for attention processes and second the neurobiological drivers underpinning internet usage and memory, we describe the implications of the internet for cognition, assess the potential mechanisms linking brain structure to cognition, and elucidate how these influence behaviour. Finally, we identify areas that now require investigation, including (i) the importance of the variation in individual levels of internet usage, (ii) potential individual behavioural implications and emerging population-level effects, and the (iii) interplay between age and the internet-brain relationships across the stages of development.

AB  - Anomalies of imagination are frequent and handicapping in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) but neglected in psychopathology due to the lack of a conceptual framework to model disorders of imagination. Recently, the link between minimal self disorders and pathology of imagination has been emphasized. The aim of the present article is to discuss this initiative by stressing their paradigm drawing on the recent imaginary turn in phenomenological research. Although this field of research is currently very active in philosophy, there are very few translational approaches in psychopathology or cognitive sciences. In this paper, we examine how contemporary research concerning fantasy and imagination can lead to the elaboration of an epistemological and phenomenological framework for schizophrenia research. We first examine the psychopathological literature on anomalous fantasy and imagination in SSDs. Then we propose an exhaustive overview of the imaginary turn of philosophical phenomenology. Further, we examine the theoretical and practical implications of such a recasting of phenomenological research. We show how fantasy and imagination are involved in the embodiment process, and how identity and imagination are interlinked. Finally, we propose an overview of the possible implications for the understanding of psychotherapeutic processes and recovery strategies.

AB  - Indigenous peoples experience well documented health inequities compared to majority ethnic groups. More research into serious conditions like Bipolar Disorder (BD) is needed. A systematic review of published original research involving Indigenous peoples with BD was completed to identify areas of consistency, contradiction and gaps in available literature. Searches identified 396 studies, 25 met inclusion criteria. Six countries including New Zealand were represented. Studies commonly reported small numbers of Indigenous participants, for whom results were often incomplete. The design, population, and methods were also diverse, limiting the review synthesis. The only consistent finding in studies of similar methods suggested BD prevalence may be greater in Indigenous communities. Future research must be designed to inform knowledge about Indigenous peoples with BD, to identify their needs and experiences, and address any factors maintaining health inequities.

AB  - Key PointsQuestionAre patients with depression associated with impairment on behavioral tests of reward processing compared with healthy control individuals? FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of data from 48 case-control studies of reward-processing tasks, patients with depression showed a small to medium impairment in reward processing across all tasks. They showed medium to large impairments in reward bias, small to medium impairments in option valuation and reinforcement learning, and small (nonsignificant) impairments in reward response vigor. MeaningIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, depression is associated with behavioral reward-processing impairments, although this could vary depending on the precise subcomponent measured.
   ImportanceDysfunctional reward processing is a leading candidate mechanism for the development of certain depressive symptoms, such as anhedonia. However, to our knowledge, there has not yet been a systematic assessment of whether and to what extent depression is associated with impairments on behavioral reward-processing tasks. ObjectiveTo determine whether depression is associated with impairments in reward-processing behavior. Data SourcesThe MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo databases were searched for studies that investigated reward processing using performance on behavioral tasks by individuals with depression and nondepressed control groups, published between January 1, 1946, and August 16, 2019. Study SelectionStudies that contained data regarding performance by depressed and healthy control groups on reward-processing tasks were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Extraction and SynthesisSummary statistics comparing performance between depressed and healthy groups on reward-processing tasks were converted to standardized mean difference (SMD) scores, from which summary effect sizes for overall impairment in reward processing and 4 subcomponent categories were calculated. Study quality, heterogeneity, replicability-index, and publication bias were also assessed. Main Outcome and MeasuresPerformance on reward-processing tasks. ResultsThe final data set comprised 48 case-control studies (1387 healthy control individuals and 1767 individuals with major depressive disorder). The mean age was 37.85 years and 58% of the participants were women. These studies used tasks assessing option valuation (n=9), reward bias (n=6), reward response vigor (n=12), reinforcement learning (n=20), and grip force (n=1). Across all tasks, depression was associated with small to medium impairments in reward-processing behavior (SMD=0.345; 95% CI, 0.209-0.480). When examining reward-processing subcomponent categories, impairment was associated with tasks assessing option valuation (SMD=0.309; 95% CI, 0.147-0.471), reward bias (SMD=0.644; 95% CI, 0.270-1.017), and reinforcement learning (SMD=0.352; 95% CI, 0.115-0.588) but not reward response vigor (SMD=0.083; 95% CI, -0.144 to 0.309). The medication status of the major depressive disorder sample did not explain any of the variance in the overall effect size. There was significant between-study heterogeneity overall and in all subcomponent categories other than option valuation. Significant publication bias was identified overall and in the reinforcement learning category. Conclusions and RelevanceRelative to healthy control individuals, individuals with depression exhibit reward-processing impairments, particularly for tests of reward bias, option valuation, and reinforcement learning. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving these associations may assist in designing novel interventions.
   This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates whether depression is associated with impairments in reward-processing behavior.

AB  - Objectives:
   The aim of this scoping review was to map and synthesise peer-reviewed literature reporting on the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme and psychosocial disability.
   Method:
   The review followed the rigorous and systematic protocol of Arksey and O'Malley. Five databases were searched and, using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, publications were identified for inclusion. Data were extracted from publications, tabulated and graphically presented. A qualitative analysis was also completed.
   Results:
   Twenty-eight publications were included. While a wide range of issues were covered across this literature, only eight publications specifically focused on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Almost half of publications were only author commentary without analysis of external data. There were no evaluations and a paucity of publications documenting the lived experiences of people with psychosocial disability or their families. Qualitative analysis identified 59 separate themes. These were grouped using a modified strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats framework. While it was acknowledged that the Scheme has the capacity to enrich people's lives and enhance service integration, themes relating to weakness and threats dominated within this literature. These included a variety of existing or predicted problems such as poor integration of a recovery philosophy into the National Disability Insurance Scheme, complex application processes creating barriers to access, concern for those ineligible or not accessing the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the need to ensure National Disability Insurance Scheme plans address specific, changing participant needs and that services will be available to provide required supports.
   Conclusion:
   Given the significant impact of the National Disability Insurance Scheme on the lives of individuals and the wider mental health service system, there continues to be surprisingly limited peer-reviewed literature reporting on experiences and outcomes of the Scheme for people living with psychosocial disability. Future research examining outcomes and shedding light on National Disability Insurance Scheme experiences of people with psychosocial disability and their families are particularly important for ongoing development and evaluation of the Scheme.

AB  - Social networking site (SNS) use is a routine activity for millions of people around the world. Under certain circumstances, an increase in SNS use may lead to problematic social networking site use (PSNSU). Numerous studies have reported associations between PSNSU and various psychosocial variables. The present review briefly examines research methods that have been employed to investigate PSNSU. Cross-sectional studies have been a popular method of investigating PSNSU, but they have significant limitations. Longitudinal and neuroimaging studies may provide important insights, but they are more difficult to conduct and have been less utilised. The field would benefit from a clarification of research priorities, integration of research methods, and studies that include SNS users from various age groups.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has been applied in wildfire science and management since the 1990s, with early applications including neural networks and expert systems. Since then, the field has rapidly progressed congruently with the wide adoption of machine learning (ML) methods in the environmental sciences. Here, we present a scoping review of ML applications in wildfire science and management. Our overall objective is to improve awareness of ML methods among wildfire researchers and managers, as well as illustrate the diverse and challenging range of problems in wildfire science available to ML data scientists. To that end, we first present an overview of popular ML approaches used in wildfire science to date and then review the use of ML in wildfire science as broadly categorized into six problem domains, including (i) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; (ii) fire weather and climate change; (iii) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; (iv) fire behavior prediction; (v) fire effects; and (vi) fire management. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML approaches relating to data size, computational requirements, generalizability, and interpretability, as well as identify opportunities for future advances in the science and management of wildfires within a data science context. In total, to the end of 2019, we identified 300 relevant publications in which the most frequently used ML methods across problem domains included random forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. As such, there exists opportunities to apply more current ML methods - including deep learning and agent-based learning - in the wildfire sciences, especially in instances involving very large multivariate datasets. We must recognize, however, that despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own, expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods such as deep learning requires a dedicated and sophisticated knowledge of their application. Finally, we stress that the wildfire research and management communities play an active role in providing relevant, high-quality, and freely available wildfire data for use by practitioners of ML methods.

AB  - Objectives: Stomach cancer (SC) is one of the most common and deadly types of cancer. It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The effect of environmental and ecological factors in SC have been assessed in some studies. Thus, we aimed to synthesize the environmental and ecological factors of SC incidence and mortality.
   Content: In this systematic review study, the scientific databases, including Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed, were searched from inception to November 2019 for all primary articles written in English by using relevant Medical Subject Heading (Mesh) terms. Two independent authors conducted the screening process to decide on the eligibility and inclusion of the articles in the study. The third author acted as an arbiter to resolve any disagreements.
   Summary and Outlook: A total of 157 potentially relevant articles were identified from the initial search 38 of which met the eligibility criteria; finally, 34 articles were included in the systematic review. The results revealed that soil arsenic exposure, coal and other opencast mining installations, living near incinerators and installations for the recovery or disposal of hazardous waste, installations for the production of cement, lime, plaster, and magnesium oxide, proximity to a metal industry sources, dietary iron, ingested asbestos, farming, arsenic in soil, altitude, organochlorines and environmental exposure to cadmium and lead have positive associations with SC incidence or death. Most of the ecological and environmental factors such as living near the mineral industries, the disposal of hazardous waste, metal industry sources and environmental exposure to cadmium and lead are positively related to SC mortality and incidence. However, solar UV-B, heat index and dietary zinc can be taken into account as protective factors against SC mortality and incidence.

AB  - Uranium contamination is a global health concern. Regarding natural or anthropogenic uranium contamination, the major sources of concern are groundwater, mining, phosphate fertilizers, nuclear facilities, and military activities. Many epidemiological and laboratory studies have demonstrated that environmental and occupational uranium exposure can induce multifarious health problems. Uranium exposure may cause health risks because of its chemotoxicity and radiotoxicity in natural or anthropogenic scenarios: the former is generally thought to play a more significant role with regard to the natural uranium exposure, and the latter is more relevant to enriched uranium exposure. The understanding of the health risks and underlying toxicological mechanisms of uranium remains at a preliminary stage, and many controversial findings require further research. In order to present state-of-the-art status in this field, this review will primarily focus on the chemotoxicity of uranium, rather than its radiotoxicity, as well as the involved toxicological mechanisms. First, the natural or anthropogenic uranium contamination scenarios will be briefly summarized. Second, the health risks upon natural uranium exposure, for example, nephrotoxicity, bone toxicity, reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity, will be discussed based on the reported epidemiological cases and laboratory studies. Third, the recent advances regarding the toxicological mechanisms of uranium-induced chemotoxicity will be highlighted, including oxidative stress, genetic damage, protein impairment, inflammation, and metabolic disorder. Finally, the gaps and challenges in the knowledge of uranium-induced chemotoxicity and underlying mechanisms will be discussed.

AB  - Context: Self-immolation is defined as ending life by suicide, particularly through burning, which carries considerable morbidity and mortality. Although its prevalence is low in developed countries, in developing countries, it's an important problem.
   Evidence Acquisition: We systematically searched studies published in international and local databases on self-immolation in Iran (either in English or Persian) to identify relevant studies from the time of inception of databases to June 2017. Here, we presented the data regarding the prevalence and factors associated with self-immolation among Iranian women.
   Results: Sixteen studies were included in this review. In Iran, according to the reports of the forensic organization on deaths by suicide, from 2006 to 2010,16.4% of the committed suicide were via self-immolation. It is more common in females than males, particularly among young, married, and low educated women. Self-immolation is more common in the north and west of Iran. The most prevalent causes of self-immolation are reported as domestic violence and other stressful events such as family conflicts, intimate relationship break-ups, divorce, and financial difficulties.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of self-immolation is relatively high among young and middle-aged Iranian women. There are sociocultural factors that might contribute to this issue. Preventive measures should be strengthened, particularly for young and middle-aged women, to address this problem.

AB  - Background Food insecurity is a public health concern that affects health and quality of life, but its association with cardiometabolic risk is not well established. Thus, this systematic review evaluated the association between food insecurity and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults and the elderly.
   Methods Search was conducted according to the PRISMA protocol using Scielo, LILACS and PubMed databases. We included original articles published in Portuguese, English, and Spanish, which assessed the association between food insecurity and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults and the elderly. The search identified 877 articles but only 11 were included in the review.
   Results Food insecurity was directly associated with cardiometabolic risk (excess weight, hypertension, dyslipidemias, diabetes, and stress) after adjusting for interfering factors. A limitation of the cross-sectional study design is that the cause-effect relation between food insecurity and cardiometabolic risk cannot be established.
   Conclusions We conclude that food insecurity has a direct relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors, especially excess weight, hypertension, and dyslipidemias. The identification of food insecurity as health problems can contribute to the implementation of efficient public policies for the prevention and control of chronic diseases.

AB  - Background Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is a predictor of autonomic system dysfunction, and is considered as a potential mechanism of increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) induced by exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5). Previous studies have suggested that exposure to PM2.5 may lead to decreased HRV levels, but the results remain inconsistent. Methods An updated systematic review and meta-analysis of panel studies till November 1, 2019 was conducted to evaluate the acute effect of exposure to ambient PM2.5 on HRV. We searched electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) to identify panel studies reporting the associations between exposure to PM2.5 and the four indicators of HRV (standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences in adjacent normal-to-normal intervals (rMSSD), high frequency power (HF), and low frequency power (LF)). Random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled effect estimates. Results A total of 33 panel studies were included in our meta-analysis, with 16 studies conducted in North America, 12 studies in Asia, and 5 studies in Europe. The pooled results showed a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 exposure which was significantly associated with a - 0.92% change in SDNN (95% confidence intervals (95%CI) - 1.26%, - 0.59%), - 1.47% change in rMSSD (95%CI - 2.17%, - 0.77%), - 2.17% change in HF (95%CI - 3.24%, - 1.10%), and - 1.52% change in LF (95%CI - 2.50%, - 0.54%), respectively. Overall, subgroup analysis suggested that short-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with lower HRV levels in Asians, healthy population, and those aged >= 40 years. Conclusion Short-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with decreased HRV levels. Future studies are warranted to clarity the exact mechanism of exposure to PM2.5 on the cardiovascular system through disturbance of autonomic nervous function.

AB  - Previous research suggests that the inclusion of motivational strategies in interventions for intimate partner violence (IPV) offenders could increase their effectiveness. This review evaluated the effectiveness of interventions for IPV offenders that includes motivational strategies to reduce physical and psychological IPV, treatment dropout, official recidivism to IPV offending, and to increase intervention attendance dose. The present systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using PRISMA guidelines. The following databases were searched from 1983 to 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for IPV offenders that incorporated motivational strategies for adult participants that included men and included IPV behaviors as outcomes: Cochrane Collaboration, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL. A total 1,134 studies were identified. 12 RCTs were included in the narrative review and 7 in the meta-analysis. Results indicated that IPV interventions that incorporated motivational strategies were significantly more effective in increasing the intervention dose and reducing dropout than interventions without motivational strategies. IPV offenders receiving interventions with motivational strategies were 1.73 times less likely to intervention dropout compared to those in interventions without such strategies. For physical and psychological IPV and official recidivism (e.g., rearrests, police record), evidence favored interventions with motivational strategies, although not significantly. These findings have important practical implications, especially considering the high dropout rates in IPV offender programs and the link between dropout and higher rates of recidivism.

TI  - Use of a participatory quality assessment and improvement tool for maternal and neonatal hospital care. Part 1: Review of implementation features and observed quality gaps in 25 countries
KW  - NEWBORN HEALTH
KW  - CHILDREN
AB  - Background A substantial proportion of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity is attributable to gaps in quality of care. A systematic, standard-based tool for quality assessment and improvement for maternal and neonatal hospital care (QA/QI MN tool) was developed in 2009 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The tool guides the assessment process along the whole continuum from admission to discharge, collects the views of the recipients of care and engages hospital mangers and staff in identifying gaps and drafting an action plan.
   Methods Publications describing use of the WHO QA/QI MN tool from 2009 to 2017 and reports retrievable from WHO or other development partners' websites were searched and considered for inclusion in the review. Only scsessments of hospitals were considered. Quality gaps were classified as regarding case management in maternal care, case management in neonatal care, hospital infrastructure, hospital policies and according to severity and frequency. Quotations from women regarding key issues in effective communication, respect and dignity, emotional support and costs incurred were selected.
   Results In the period 2009-2017, use of the WHO QA/QI MN tool was documented in 25 countries, belonging to Central and Eastern Europe (8). Central Asia (4), Sub-Saharan Africa (11), Latin America (1) and Middle East (1). Overall, 133 hospitals were assessed. The tool allowed to identify in great detail serious quality gaps including: insufficient or incomplete adherence to recommended evidence-based procedures for normal childbirth and maternal and neonatal complications; excess of inappropriate or unnecessary interventions; insufficient infection control; failure to provide respectful care, adequate communication and emotional support to mothers and babies; poor use of information generated locally to analyse processes and outcomes. These gaps were observed in all countries. Significant differences were observed among facilities belonging to the same health systems, ie, with very similar staffing. infrastructure and equipment.
   Conclusions The experience made, the largest of this kind, provides comprehensive and detailed insight into the existing quality gaps in a wide variety of settings. QI cycles at facility level should be primarily based on assessments made by multidisciplinary teams of professionals to identify the parts of the care pathways which require improvement through a participatory approach involving managers, staff and patients.

AB  - Objectives: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the most important occupational problems. However, there has also been no worldwide review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of MSDs among operation room personnel. The present study aimed to investigate and estimate the prevalence of MSDs among operating room personnel using a systematic review and meta-analysis study.
   Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in 2019. The researchers searched Medline/PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Embase, and Google Scholar. Studies classified by categories of country and populations. In order to determine and control the quality assessment of articles, researchers use the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist.
   Results: A total of 111 articles from databases were found. Final screening included 12 into statistical analysis. Based on the random-effect model, the prevalence of MSDs in neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists & hands, upper back, lower back, hip, knees, and ankles & feet was 53.66% (CI 95%: 43.30-64.02), 55.63% (CI 95%: 43.90-67.36), 23.01% (CI 95%: 14.75-31.27), 38.79% (CI 95%: 21.95-55.62), 44.20% (CI 95%: 27.80-60.59), 61.48% (CI 95%: 44.33-78.64), 26.56% (CI 95%: 10.40-42.72), 43.43% (CI 95%: 23.80-63.06), and 57.06% (CI 95%: 48.25-65.87), respectively. Based on the results of meta-regression, there was no statistically significant relationship between prevalence of MSDs and mean of age, and year of study.
   Conclusion: The study results revealed the high prevalence of MSDs, specifically in lower back among the operating room personnel. Considering the difficult conditions of working in the operating room, MSDs and particularly back pain are unpreventable.

AB  - IMPORTANCE The sequential model emerged from the awareness that the persistence of residual symptoms and the frequent occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity were both associated with poor long-term outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD).
   OBJECTIVE To conduct an updated meta-analysis to examine the association of the sequential combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy with reduced risk of relapse and recurrence in MDD.
   DATA SOURCES Keyword searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception of each database through November 2019. Reference lists from relevant studies were examined using the following keywords: sequential treatment, drugs and psychotherapy, combined treatment, continuation or maintenance, relapse or recurrence and prevention, and depress* or major depress*, selecting adults and randomized controlled trials as additional limits. Authors of selected articles were contacted if needed.
   STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials examining the effectiveness of the sequential use of psychotherapy following response to acute-phase pharmacotherapy in the treatment of adult remitted patients with MDD were selected independently by 2 reviewers.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The methods used fulfilled the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Data extraction and methodologic quality assessment were conducted independently by the reviewers. Examination of the pooled results was performed based on the random-effects model. Heterogeneity between study results and likelihood of significant publication bias were assessed. Sensitivity analyses and meta-regressions were also run.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measures were relapse or recurrence rates of MDD, as defined by study investigators, at the longest available follow-up.
   RESULTS Seventeen randomized clinical trials met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, with 1 study yielding 2 comparisons (2283 patients overall, with 1208 patients in a sequential treatment arm and 1075 in a control arm). The pooled risk ratio for relapse/recurrence of MDD was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.74-0.94), suggesting a relative advantage in preventing relapse/recurrence for the sequential combination of treatments compared with control conditions.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that the sequential integration of psychotherapy following response to acute-phase pharmacotherapy, alone or combined with antidepressant medication, was associated with reduced risk of relapse and recurrence in MDD. The preventive value of the sequential strategy relies on abatement of residual symptoms and/or increase in psychological well-being. The steps for implementing the sequential approach in remitted patients with recurrent MDD are provided.

AB  - Background. Poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a common cause of disability among patients with stroke. Meanwhile, acupuncture has increasingly been used to improve motor and cognitive function for stroke patients. The aim of the present study was to summarize and evaluate the evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating PSCI. Methods. Eight databases (PubMed, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang Data, VIP, CBM, Medline, Embase databases) were searched from January 2010 to January 2020. Meta-analyses were conducted for the eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Assessments were performed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Barthel Index (BI), or modified Barthel Index (MBI). Results. A total of 657 relevant RCTs were identified, and 22 RCTs with 1856 patients were eventually included. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture appeared to be effective for improving cognitive function as assessed by MMSE (mean difference (MD) = 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.39, 2.06), P < 0.00001) and MoCA (MD=2.32, 95% CI (1.92, 2.73), P < 0.00001). Furthermore, it also suggested that acupuncture could improve the activities of daily life (ADL) for PSCI patients as assessed by BI or MBI (SMD=0.97, 95% CI (0.57, 1.38), P < 0.00001). Conclusions. Compared with nonacupuncture group, acupuncture group showed better effects in improving the scores of MMSE, MoCA, BI, and MBI. This meta-analysis provided positive evidence that acupuncture may be effective in improving cognitive function and activities of daily life for PSCI patients. Meanwhile, long retention time of acupuncture may improve cognitive function and activities of daily life, and twist technique may be an important factor that could influence cognitive function. However, further studies using large samples and a rigorous study design are needed to confirm the role of acupuncture in the treatment of PSCI.

AB  - Marine aerosol is a chemical complex system formed by inorganic salts and organic matter, together with airborne particulate matter from the surrounding environment. The primary particles transported in the marine aerosol can experiment different chemical reactions in the atmosphere, promoting the so-called Secondary Marine Aerosol particles. These kinds of particles (nitrates, sulfates, chlorides etc.), together with the natural crustal or mineral particles and the metallic airborne particulate matter emitted by anthropogenic sources (road traffic, industry, etc.) form clusters which then can be deposited on building materials from a specific construction following dry deposition processes. Apart from that, the acid aerosols (e.g. CO2, SO2, NOX, etc.) present in urban-industrial environments, coming also from anthropogenic sources, can be deposited in the buildings following dry or awet depositionmechanisms. The interactions of these natural and anthropogenic stressorswith building materials can promote different kind of pathologies. In this overview, the negative influence of different marine environments (direct or diffuse influence), with or without the influence of an urban-industrial area (direct or diffuse), on the conservation state of historical constructions including awide variety of building materials (sand-stones, limestones, artificial stones, bricks, plasters, cementitious materials, etc.) is presented.

AB  - Purpose
   Although studies have examined the effectiveness of telemental health programs, optimal approaches for their evaluation remain unclear. We sought to review the outcomes used to evaluate telemental health programs.
   Methods
   We conducted a literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed studies published between January 2010 until October 2019, and we excluded review articles, opinion papers, presentations, abstracts, and program report without data.
   Results
   1310 articles were identified, 34 of which were reviewed. Studies used a combination of non-clinical and clinical outcomes, most commonly engagement and impact rates, and standardised clinical measures. Very few studies examined technological feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and qualitative satisfaction reports.
   Conclusions
   This review is the first to summarise approaches to evaluate telemental health programs. Strengths and weaknesses of the evaluation outcomes are discussed in this review, highlighting essential factors that should be taken into consideration when developing a standardised framework for the evaluation of future telemental health programs.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study is to analyse the extent to which research and knowledge production on a key occupational health issue-the impact of precarious employment on health-incorporates, and is sensitive to, a gender perspective. Methods A systematic literature review was carried out to identify studies that analysed the relationship between precarious employment and mental health in the period January 2010-May 2018 through. A minimum of two independent reviewers assessed each article for quality and eligibility. A checklist was used to determine whether the articles included in the review incorporated a gender perspective. Results The search retrieved 1522 papers, of which 54 (corresponding to 53 studies) met the inclusion criteria. Of these 54 papers, 22 (40.7%) stratified the analyses by sex. Only 5.4% of the total of articles both stratified by sex and considered variables of household composition and marital status, while only 33.3% incorporated an intersectional perspective. None considered the distribution of domestic work and only a quarter (25.9%) approached the study and interpreted the results in terms of gender. Conclusion Too few studies researching paid work and health include a gender perspective. This omission necessarily implies a biased interpretation of the reality of precarious employment and its impact on health.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the provision of mental health care services and the ability to provide neuropsychological evaluations. The inability to conduct traditional evaluations has left neuropsychologists with the unprecedented task of determining how to modify existing paradigms while balancing the need to provide services and adhere to safety parameters. The COVID-19 literature suggests clinicians are modifying their evaluations based on the following models: (1) continuing to administer in-person evaluations; (2) discontinuing all evaluations due to issues related to standardization, test security, and patient-specific characteristics; (3) conducting virtual evaluations; and/or (4) adopting a hybrid model incorporating both traditional and technology-based modalities. Given the challenges with models 1-3, along with the modifications in telehealth guidelines and insurance reimbursement rates, neuropsychologists are more poised than ever to solidify the implementation of a hybrid model that lasts beyond COVID-19. We introduce the term Hybrid Neuropsychology, a model for the future of neuropsychological evaluations that includes three Action Items: (1) building a technology-based practice; (2) integrating data science; and (3) engaging with innovators in other fields. Hybrid Neuropsychology will enable clinicians to effectively modernize their practice, improve health care equity, and ensure neuropsychology secures its place in a technology-based world.

It is a caspase-independent, mitochondrial-linked paradigm of cell death and has been demonstrated to be related to the pathogenesis of various nervous system diseases. An in-depth understanding of the role that parthanatos plays in the pathological processes of these diseases can provide new targets for nervous system diseases treatments. In this review, on the basis of parthanatos mechanism, the involvement of parthanatos in the pathogenesis of nervous system diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, spinal cord injury and glioma will be summarized in detail.

AB  - Carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) are used for structural materials in the aircraft and automotive industries due to their lightweight and high strength characteristics. Up until now, Japanese companies have been considered as superior to others in this field because they have sophisticated technologies for the development of high-quality virgin carbon fiber (CF). However, in recent years, especially in the general industry, there has been a demand for inexpensive products that places more importance on price than on quality. Under such circumstances, though the disposal of CFRP is difficult, the recycling business is still virtually unestablished especially in Japan and waste CFRP has been mostly landfilled. Concerns about the effects of CF (dust/milled) on human health and ecosystems also gradually increase. As a result of the organizational issues associated with the commercialization of CFRP recycling technology in the Japanese industrial landscape, it is important to scientifically elucidate the anxiety of the effects of CF (dust/milled) generated during industrial processes including recycling on people and ecosystems before using CFRP recycled products on an industrial scale and distribute appropriate information, confirmed on scientific grounds, so that even ordinary citizens can feel safe and secure with the cyclic use of CF.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for the motor symptoms of movement disorders including Parkinson's Disease (PD). Despite its therapeutic benefits, STN-DBS has been associated with adverse effects on mood and cognition. Specifically, apathy, which is defined as a loss of motivation, has been reported to emerge or to worsen following STN-DBS. However, it is often challenging to disentangle the effects of STN-DBS per se from concurrent reduction of dopamine replacement therapy, from underlying PD pathology or from disease progression. To this end, pre-clinical models allow for the dissociation of each of these factors, and to establish neural substrates underlying the emergence of motivational symptoms following STN-DBS. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of rodent studies assessing the effects of STN-DBS on reward seeking, reward motivation and reward consumption across a variety of behavioral paradigms. We find that STN-DBS decreases reward seeking in the majority of experiments, and we outline how design of the behavioral task and DBS parameters can influence experimental outcomes. While an early hypothesis posited that DBS acts as a "functional lesion," an analysis of lesions and inhibition of the STN revealed no consistent pattern on reward-related behavior. Thus, we discuss alternative mechanisms that could contribute to the amotivational effects of STN-DBS. We also argue that optogenetic-assisted circuit dissection could yield important insight into the effects of the STN on motivated behavior in health and disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of STN-DBS on motivated behavior-will be critical for optimizing the clinical application of STN-DBS.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder with limited available treatments and diverse causes. In ASD patients, numerous researches demonstrated various alterations in inflammation/immune, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, and these alterations could be regulated by Nrf2. Hence, we aimed to systematically review the current evidence about the effects of Nrf2 activator supplementation on ASD objects from in vitro studies, animal studies, and clinical studies. Relevant articles were retrieved through searching for the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Scope, Embase, and CNKI databases (through September 23, 2020). Ultimately, we identified 22 preclinical studies, one cell culture study, and seven clinical studies, covering a total of five Nrf2 activators. For each Nrf2 activator, we focused on its definition, potential therapeutic mechanisms, latest research progress, research limitations, and future development directions. Our systematic review provided suggestive evidence that Nrf2 activators have a potentially beneficial role in improving autism-like behaviors and abnormal molecular alterations through oxidant stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These dietary phytochemicals are considered to be relatively safer and effective for ASD treatment. However, there are few clinical studies to support the Nrf2 activators as dietary phytochemicals in ASD, even though several preclinical studies. Therefore, caution should be warranted in attempting to extrapolate their effects in human studies, and better design and more rigorous research are required before they can be determined as a therapeutic option.

AB  - Objective: Insomnia is a major health challenge in the general population, but the results of the gender differences in the epidemiology of insomnia have been mixed. This is a meta-analysis to examine the gender difference in the prevalence of insomnia among the general population.
   Methods:Two reviewers independently searched relevant publications in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science from their inception to 16 April 2019. Studies that reported the gender-based prevalence of insomnia according to the international diagnostic criteria were included for analyses using the random-effects model.
   Results:Eventually 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of insomnia in the general population was 22.0% [n = 22,980, 95% confidence interval (CI): 17.0-28.0%], and females had a significantly higher prevalence of insomnia compared with males (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.35, 1.85, Z = 5.63, p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses showed that greater gender difference was associated with the use of case-control study design and consecutive sampling method. Meta-regression analyses also revealed that higher proportion of females and better study quality were significantly associated with greater gender difference.
   Conclusions:This meta-analysis found that the prevalence of insomnia in females was significantly higher than males in the included studies. Due to the negative effects of insomnia on health, regular screening, and effective interventions should be implemented in the general population particularly for females.

AB  - Background: Neuropathic and nociceptive pain frequently affect patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), with a prevalence close to 90% and significant impact on general health and quality of life. Pharmacological strategies are widely used to treat pain in MS, but their effectiveness and side-effects are controversial. Among non-pharmacological treatments for pain, non-invasive brain and spinal stimulation (NIBSS) has shown promising preliminary results in MS.
   Objective: Systematic review to investigate the effect of NIBSS for the management of pain in MS.
   Methods: A literature search using Pubmed, Science Direct and Web of Science was conducted from databases inception to February 21, 2020 for studies assessing the analgesic effect of NIBSS on pain in MS.
   Results: A total of 279 records were title- and abstract-screened, nine were assessed for full text and included. The NIBSS techniques explored were transcranial direct current stimulation (N = 5), transcranial magnetic stimulation (N = 2), transcranial random noise stimulation (N =1), transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (N = 1). The targets were the primary motor cortex (M1; N = 4), the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC; N = 3), the spinal cord (N = 1), unspecified brain target (N = 1). The study designs were randomized (N = 7), open label (N = 1), single case report (N = 1). Despite the differences in study design, target and NIBSS technique that impeded a meta-analysis, all the studies converge in showing a significant improvement of pain after active NIBSS with less consistent effects on other symptoms of the pain-related cluster (depression, fatigue, cognition) and quality of life.
   Conclusions: Excitatory NIBSS over M1, left DLPFC and spinal cord appear to be the most effective protocols for pain in MS. Open questions include the use of neurophysiological or neuroimaging surrogate outcome measures, the stratification of patients according to the clinical profiles and underlying pathogenetic mechanisms and the combination of NIBSS to pharmacological treatment, neurorehabilitation, or psychotherapy to improve the clinical effect. The duration of the effect to NIBSS and the feasibility and efficacy of telemedicine NIBSS protocols are other open key questions.

AB  - Introduction: There is an increasing emphasis on recovery-oriented care in the design and delivery of mental health services. Research has demonstrated that recovery-oriented services are understood differently depending on the stakeholders involved. Variations in interpretations of recovery lead to challenges in creating systematically organized environments that deliver a consistent recovery-oriented approach to care. The existing evidence on recovery-oriented practice is scattered and difficult to apply. Through this systematic scoping study, we aim to identify and map the essential elements that contribute to recovery outcomes for persons living with severe mental illness.
   Methods: We used the Arksey & O'Malley framework as our guiding approach. Seven key databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL/EBSCO, EMBASE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar) were searched using index terms and keywords relating to recovery and severe mental illness. To be included, studies had to be peer-reviewed, published after 1988, had persons with severe mental illness as the focal population, and have used recovery in the context of mental health. The search was conducted in August 2018 and last updated in February 2020.
   Results: Out of 4,496 sources identified, sixty (n = 60) sources were included that met all of the selection criteria. Three major elements of recovery that emerged from the synthesis (n = 60) include relationships, sense of meaning, and participation. Some sources (n = 20) highlighted specific elements such as hope, resilience, self-efficacy, spirituality, social support, empowerment, race/ethnicity etc. and their association with the processes underpinning recovery.
   Discussion: The findings of this study enable mental health professionals to incorporate the identified key elements into strategic interventions to facilitate recovery for clients with severe mental illness, and thereby facilitate recovery-oriented practice. The review also documents important gaps in knowledge related to the elements of recovery and identifies a critical need for future studies to address this issue.

AB  - Worldwide, growing concern with young people's mental health is spurring service reform efforts. Such reform requires a full understanding of the experiences of young people and their carers when seeking mental health help. To generate such an understanding, we conducted a meta-synthesis of qualitative literature on the perspectives of youths and their carers on navigating mental health systems. Five electronic databases were searched (Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, HealthSTAR). Studies were included if they explored the experiences of pathways to mental health services of persons aged 11-30 years and/or their carers; were published in English or French; and used qualitative methodology. Quality appraisal was conducted using the CASP tool. The synthesis of 31 included studies yielded three themes-initiating contact with mental health services; characteristics of services' response; and youths' and carers' appraisal of services. Themes about initiating contact included mental health literacy, structural barriers, and social support. Service response-related themes included complex pathways, waitlists, eligibility, and fragmented care. In terms of service appraisal, positive encounters featured providers who were accessible and perceived as caring. Negative appraisals resulted from feeling misunderstood and excluded and being ill-informed about treatment. Across diagnoses and settings, youths and carers had difficult experiences accessing mental healthcare. While individual, social, and healthcare factors shaping pathways to care varied, systemic complexities were a common inhibitor. This synthesis informs recommendations for improving mental health services and youths' pathways to them. It underlines the need for grounding reform in youths' and carers' perspectives and needs.

AB  - We analysed the Horizon 2020 project database, currently the European Union's (EU) largest framework programme for research and innovation-nearly 80 billion euros available over 7 years (2014-2020), to estimate the amount and type of EU-supported biomedical and health research and funding distribution among EU member states and non-European countries. Out of 20,877 projects as of 14th January 2019, a total of 4865 projects were classified as human health related. Ninety-four countries/territories worldwide participated in at least one biomedical project. The EU-15 original member states showed the highest participation as project leaders/partners and for acquired funding. Strong unequal funding distribution and participation between EU-15 and the 13 newest members-with EU-15 receiving about 87% of funding and EU-13 only 3%-have been evidenced. For both EU-15 and EU-13 we detected about 20% of projects involving the public and private sectors, according to Horizon 2020 guidelines. The largest percentage of projects was in the areas of biotechnological research (28.28%) and "basic research" (26.95%); these two sectors together accounted for 46.99% of the total funding assigned (7.9 billion euros). Research in neurosciences and neurological diseases appeared to be an increasing study area. Neurological and mental diseases covered about 21% of projects. Epidemiological studies accounted for about 5% of the total projects and for 14% of funding. Strong correlations were shown by indicators of financial and scientific capacity to identify success rates in obtaining EU funding, making the gap between countries with strong and weak research infrastructures difficult to overcome.

AB  - The present review draws together wide-ranging studies performed over the last decades that catalogue the effects of artificial-light-at-night (ALAN) upon living species and their environment. We provide an overview of the tremendous variety of light-detection strategies which have evolved in living organisms - unicellular, plants and animals, covering chloroplasts (plants), and the plethora of ocular and extra-ocular organs (animals). We describe the visual pigments which permit photo-detection, paying attention to their spectral characteristics, which extend from the ultraviolet into infrared. We discuss how organisms use light information in a way crucial for their development, growth and survival: phototropism, phototaxis, photoperiodism, and synchronization of circadian clocks. These aspects are treated in depth, as their perturbation underlies much of the disruptive effects of ALAN. The review goes into detail on circadian networks in living organisms, since these fundamental features are of critical importance in regulating the interface between environment and body. Especially, hormonal synthesis and secretion are often under circadian and circannual control, hence perturbation of the clock will lead to hormonal imbalance. The review addresses how the ubiquitous introduction of light-emitting diode technology may exacerbate, or in some cases reduce, the generalized ever-increasing light pollution. Numerous examples are given of how widespread exposure to ALAN is perturbing many aspects of plant and animal behaviour and survival: foraging, orientation, migration, seasonal reproduction, colonization and more. We examine the potential problems at the level of individual species and populations and extend the debate to the consequences for ecosystems. We stress, through a few examples, the synergistic harmful effects resulting from the impacts of ALAN combined with other anthropogenic pressures, which often impact the neuroendocrine loops in vertebrates. The article concludes by debating how these anthropogenic changes could be mitigated by more reasonable use of available technology - for example by restricting illumination to more essential areas and hours, directing lighting to avoid wasteful radiation and selecting spectral emissions, to reduce impact on circadian clocks. We end by discussing how society should take into account the potentially major consequences that ALAN has on the natural world and the repercussions for ongoing human health and welfare.

AB  - Background Globally, 20% of young people experience mental disorders. In India, only 7.3% of its 365 million youth report such problems. Although public stigma associated with mental health problems particularly affects help-seeking among young people, the extent of stigma among young people in India is unknown. Describing and characterizing public stigma among young people will inform targeted interventions to address such stigma in India, and globally. Thus, we examined the magnitude and manifestations of public stigma, and synthesised evidence of recommendations to reduce mental-health-related stigma among young people in India. Method A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was conducted. Nine electronic databases were searched and 30 studies (n = 6767) met inclusion criteria. Results Most studies (66%) focused on youth training to become health professionals. One-third of young people display poor knowledge of mental health problems and negative attitudes towards people with mental health problems and one in five had actual/intended stigmatizing behavior (I-2>=95%). Young people are unable to recognize causes and symptoms of mental health problems and believe that recovery is unlikely. People with mental health problems are perceived as dangerous and irresponsible, likely due to misinformation and misunderstanding of mental health problems as being solely comprised of severe mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia). However, psychiatric labels are not commonly used/understood. Conclusion Public education may use symptomatic vignettes (through relatable language and visuals) instead of psychiatric labels to improve young people's understanding of the range of mental health problems. Recommended strategies to reduce public stigma include awareness campaigns integrated with educational institutions and content relevant to culture and age-appropriate social roles.

AB  - Purpose Past suicide attempts (SA) are a major contributor to suicide. The prevalence of SA in pregnant and postpartum women varied significantly across studies. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to examine the prevalence of SA and its mediating factors in this population. Methods Relevant articles published in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Medline complete, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI), Chinese Wanfang and Chongqing VIP database were systematically searched from inception to March 28, 2019. Titles, abstracts and full texts were reviewed independently by three researchers. Studies were included if they reported data on SA prevalence or provided relevant data that enabled the calculation of SA prevalence. Data were extracted by two researchers and checked by one senior researcher. The random-effects model was used to analyze data by the CMA 2.0 and Stata 12.0, with the high degree of statistical heterogeneity present. The primary outcomes were prevalence of SA with 95% CI during pregnancy and during the first-year postpartum. Results Fourteen studies covering 6,406,245 pregnant and postpartum women were included. The pooled prevalence of SA was 680 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 0.10-4.69%) during pregnancy and 210 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 0.01-3.21%) during the first-year postpartum. Data source was significantly associated with prevalence of SA in the subgroup analysis (pregnancy, p < 0.001; the first-year postpartum, p = 0.013). Conclusion The prevalence of SA is not high in pregnant and postpartum women. Due to the potential loss of life and negative impact of SA on health outcomes, however, careful screening and effective preventive measures should be implemented for this population.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and primary psychosis are classified as distinct neurodevelopmental disorders, yet they display overlapping epidemiological, environmental, and genetic components as well as endophenotypic similarities. For instance, both disorders are characterized by impairments in facial expression processing, a crucial skill for effective social communication, and both disorders display an increased prevalence of adverse childhood events (ACE). This narrative review provides a brief summary of findings from neuroimaging studies investigating facial expression processing in ASD and primary psychosis with a focus on the commonalities and differences between these disorders. Individuals with ASD and primary psychosis activate the same brain regions as healthy controls during facial expression processing, albeit to a different extent. Overall, both groups display altered activation in the fusiform gyrus and amygdala as well as altered connectivity among the broader face processing network, probably indicating reduced facial expression processing abilities. Furthermore, delayed or reduced N170 responses have been reported in ASD and primary psychosis, but the significance of these findings is questioned, and alternative frequency-tagging electroencephalography (EEG) measures are currently explored to capture facial expression processing impairments more selectively. Face perception is an innate process, but it is also guided by visual learning and social experiences. Extreme environmental factors, such as adverse childhood events, can disrupt normative development and alter facial expression processing. ACE are hypothesized to induce altered neural facial expression processing, in particular a hyperactive amygdala response toward negative expressions. Future studies should account for the comorbidity among ASD, primary psychosis, and ACE when assessing facial expression processing in these clinical groups, as it may explain some of the inconsistencies and confound reported in the field.

AB  - Scientific evidence in the field of psychiatry is mainly derived from group-based ("nomothetic") studies that yield group-aggregated results, while often the need is to answer questions that apply to individuals. Particularly in the presence of great inter-individual differences and temporal complexities, information at the individual-person level may be valuable for personalized treatment decisions, individual predictions and diagnostics. The single-subject study design can be used to make inferences about individual persons. Yet, the single-subject study is not often used in the field of psychiatry. We believe that this is because of a lack of awareness of its value rather than a lack of usefulness or feasibility. In the present paper, we aimed to resolve some common misconceptions and beliefs about single-subject studies by discussing some commonly heard "facts and fictions." We also discuss some situations in which the single-subject study is more or less appropriate, and the potential of combining single-subject and group-based study designs into one study. While not intending to plea for single-subject studies at the expense of group-based studies, we hope to increase awareness of the value of single-subject research by informing the reader about several aspects of this design, resolving misunderstanding, and providing references for further reading.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic may affect the world severely in terms of quality of life, political, environmental, and economic sustainable development, and the global economy. Its impact is attested to by the number of research studies on it. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the psychology of sustainability (quality of life), on sustainable development, and on the global economy. A computerized literature search was performed, and journal articles from authentic sources were extracted, including MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Emerald Insight. The references in selected articles were screened to identify any relevant studies. The following inclusion criteria were followed: research articles based on the COVID-19 pandemic, and articles, research papers, journals, and news articles published 2010 to 2020. The exclusion criteria were as follow: psychology research, articles, and journals published before 2010 and research articles having no link with the current pandemic's impact on the psychology of sustainability, quality of life, and the global economy. Of the initial 350 articles identified, only 61 studies were found to be relevant and meet the inclusion criteria. Based on these articles, the review highlights that compared to developed countries, the developing nations and poor nations such as African countries with compromised health structures have been greatly affected. There are close associations between health, economic, environmental, and political issues globally. The pandemic can be managed if we follow new policies that implement economic and public health changes worldwide. A planned, coordinated approach between the public-private sector is required, designed according to each country's health system and economy. We can come out of this crisis if we work together and support both developed and developing nations.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability and mortality in children and young adults and has a profound impact on the socio-economic wellbeing of patients and their families. Initially, brain damage is caused by mechanical stress-induced axonal injury and vascular dysfunction, which can include hemorrhage, blood-brain barrier disruption, and ischemia. Subsequent neuronal degeneration, chronic inflammation, demyelination, oxidative stress, and the spread of excitotoxicity can further aggravate disease pathology. Thus, TBI treatment requires prompt intervention to protect against neuronal and vascular degeneration. Rapid advances in the field of stem cells (SCs) have revolutionized the prospect of repairing brain function following TBI. However, more than that, SCs can contribute substantially to our knowledge of this multifaced pathology. Research, based on human induced pluripotent SCs (hiPSCs) can help decode the molecular pathways of degeneration and recovery of neuronal and glial function, which makes these cells valuable tools for drug screening. Additionally, experimental approaches that include hiPSC-derived engineered tissues (brain organoids and bio-printed constructs) and biomaterials represent a step forward for the field of regenerative medicine since they provide a more suitable microenvironment that enhances cell survival and grafting success. In this review, we highlight the important role of hiPSCs in better understanding the molecular pathways of TBI-related pathology and in developing novel therapeutic approaches, building on where we are at present. We summarize some of the most relevant findings for regenerative therapies using biomaterials and outline key challenges for TBI treatments that remain to be addressed.

AB  - Though evidence exists on the association between diazinon (DZN), an organophosphate pesticide, with hyperglycemia, contrasting reports also exist. Herein, we performed a systematic and meta-analysis study to address this issue. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Ovid Medline, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science up to April 5, 2020, searching for animal studies (rodents and fish) that assessed the impact of DZN on blood glucose concentration. The risk of bias was assessed by the SYRCLE's RoB scale. Once each article's quality was assessed, a random-effects meta-regression was used to pool the data into a meta-analysis. Heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated with the I square and Q test. Random-effect meta-analysis of 19 studies (I-2 = 90.5%, p < 0.001) indicated low heterogeneity between the studies. DZN significantly increased blood glucose levels in the exposed versus control groups (95% CI: 2.46-4.94; Z = 5.86; p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated that the effect of high-dose (3.40 (95% CI: 2.03-4.76)) DZN on changes in blood glucose was more pronounced than in the low dose (4.83 (95% CI: 1.56-8.11)). It was also ascertained that the blood glucose level was significantly higher in females (3.55 (95% CI: 2.21-4.89)) versus males (4.87 (95% CI: 0.20-9.55)) exposed to DZN. No publication bias was observed. Sensitivity analysis showed the robustness of the (standardized mean differences: 3.26-4.03). Our findings establish an association between DZN exposure and hyperglycemia in rodents and fish, which is both dose- and gender-dependent.

AB  - Purpose
   Transition to parenthood (TTP) is a major life event that affects all aspects of one's psychosocial function. Similar to their partners, men experience a lot of psychological changes during the TTP process. As there are a few studies on this subject, so the purpose of this study is to review previous studies on psychological and functional changes in men during TTP.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This is a review study that reports the findings from a review of previous studies on psychological and functional changes in men during TTP. This study searched from the electronic database between articles published in between 2005-20.
   Findings
   This study was carried out in five stages: framing research questions; searching databases with an effective strategy; selecting relevant studies; findings mining; summarizing and classifying findings; and providing results. After the literature review, relevant studies were categorized into three groups. The first, second and third groups included studies on prenatal, labor and delivery and postnatal TTP, respectively. Psychological and functional changes in men during TTP significantly affect child-father relationships, development of children and sexual relationship with a partner. Therefore, further attention should be given to this important process, along with changes, expectations, needs, etc.
   Originality/value
   This study reviews men's functional changes along with their psychological changes during the parental transition. This study also reviews effective strategies and interventions for successful parental transition in men.

AB  - Objectives
   Startle response is an objective physiological measure integral to the human defense system and a promising target for endophenotype investigations of anxiety. Given the alterations in startle reactivity observed among anxiety and related disorders, we searched for genetic variants associated with startle reactivity as they may be further involved in pathological anxiety risk.
   Methods
   A systematic literature review was performed to identify genetic variants associated with startle reactivity in humans, specifically baseline and fear- or anxiety-potentiated startle.
   Results
   The polymorphisms Val66Met (rs6265) from brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Val158Met (rs4680) from catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) from the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) were most commonly studied in human startle. In addition, several other genetic variants have also been identified as potential candidates that warrant further research, especially given their novelty in in the context of anxiety.
   Conclusions
   Similar to psychiatric genetic studies, the studies on startle reactivity primarily focus on candidate genes and are plagued by non-replication. Startle reactivity is a promising endophenotype that requires concerted efforts to collect uniformly assessed, large, well-powered samples and hypothesis-free genome-wide strategies. To further support startle as an endophenotype for anxiety, this review suggests advanced genetic strategies for startle research.

AB  - Motor learning encompasses a broad set of phenomena that requires a diverse set of experimental paradigms. However, excessive variation in tasks across studies creates fragmentation that can adversely affect the collective advancement of knowledge. Here, we show that motor learning studies tend toward extreme fragmentation in the choice of tasks, with almost no overlap between task paradigms across studies. We argue that this extreme level of task fragmentation poses serious theoretical and methodological barriers to advancing the field. To address these barriers, we propose the need for developing common 'model' task paradigms which could be widely used across labs. Combined with the open sharing of methods and data, we suggest that these model task paradigms could be an important step in increasing the robustness of the motor learning literature and facilitate the cumulative process of science.

AB  - Background
   Available interventions for preventing and treating perinatal depression remain unsatisfactory.
   Aims
   We examined the prophylactic and therapeutic effects, as well as adverse effects, of n-3 PUFA supplementation in reducing depressive symptoms during perinatal periods.
   Methods
   We included randomized, placebo-controlled trials that reported the changes of depression severity after the perinatal participants received n-3 PUFA supplementation. After the comprehensive searches in October 2019, we selected the trials, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of included trials. We compared the standardized mean differences (SMD) of depression score changes between groups using a random-effect model.
   Results
   We included 11 trials in the meta-analysis and one more trial for qualitative analysis (N = 3,181). The pooled standardized mean of decreased depression scores revealed no statistically significant difference between the n-3 PUFA and the placebo groups (N = 920, SMDs = -0.05, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.10, I-2 = 21%). The pooled SMDs showed no statistically significant efficacy of n-3 PUFA supplementation for prevention (N = 779, SMDs = -0.03, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.13, I-2 = 24%) and treatment (N = 141, SMDs = -0.14, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.27, I-2 = 31%) of perinatal depression. The efficacy of n-3 PUFA supplementation was not associated with the daily doses of DHA, EPA, or DHA plus EPA. No trial reported any serious adverse effect of n-3 PUFA supplements.
   Conclusions
   Although n-3 PUFA supplementation may improve maternal and infant outcomes, our meta-analysis found insufficient evidence to determine its benefit for perinatal depression.

AB  - The effects of diazinon (DZN), an organophosphate pesticide, on lipid profiles have been extensively reported. However, controversy on this issue persists. Here, we performed a systematic and meta-analysis study to investigate the association between DZN exposure and dyslipidemia in rodents and fish species. This systematic review was prepared according to the PRISMA guidelines. Main databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science, were systematically searched through March 4, 2020. The risk of bias was evaluated with the SYRCLE's RoB tool. Once all articles were assessed for scientific quality, a random-effects model was applied to perform a pooled analysis. I-2 and Q test were used to assess the heterogeneity between articles, and Forest plots, indicating point and pooled estimates, were drawn. Twenty-eight articles were included; between them, 13 publications were selected for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis showed low heterogeneity between the articles. A pooled analysis indicated that DZN significantly increased total cholesterol levels (95% CI: 0.86-3.79; Z = 3.10; p = 0.002), triglyceride (95% CI: 0.38-3.22; Z = 2.48; p = 0.09), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (95% CI: 0.25-2.85; Z = 2.34; p = 0.7) in the DZN vs. control groups. In addition, DZN significantly decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (95% CI: - 2.92, - 0.42; Z = 2.62; p = 0.07) in the DZN vs. control groups. No publication bias was observed. Our findings suggest that DZN induces dyslipidemia in rodents and fish species in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - Background Quality of life (QoL) is multi-dimensional concept of an individual' general well-being status in relation to their value, environment, cultural and social context in which they live. This study aimed to quantitatively synthesise available evidence on the association between QoL and mortality in the general population. Methods An electronic search was conducted using three bibliographic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Inclusion criteria were studies that assessed QoL using standardized tools and examined mortality risk in a non-patient population. Qualitative data synthesis and meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed. Results Of 4184 articles identified, 47 were eligible for inclusion, involving approximately 1,200,000 participants. Studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of QoL measures, population characteristics and data analysis. In total, 43 studies (91.5%) reported that better QoL was associated with lower mortality risk. The results of four meta-analyses indicated that higher health-related QoL (HRQoL) is associated with lower mortality risk, which was consistent for overall HRQoL (HR 0.633, 95% CI: 0.514 to 0.780), physical function (HR 0.987, 95% CI: 0.982 to 0.992), physical component score (OR 0.950, 95% CI: 0.935 to 0.965), and mental component score (OR 0.980, 95% CI: 0.969 to 0.992). Conclusion These findings provide evidence that better QoL/HRQoL was associated with lower mortality risk. The utility of these measures in predicting mortality risk indicates that they should be considered further as potential screening tools in general clinical practice, beyond the traditional objective measures such as body mass index and the results of laboratory tests.

AB  - The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill significantly impacted the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) deep benthos (>125 m water depth) at different spatial scales and across all community size and taxa groups including microbes, foraminifera, meiofauna, macrofauna, megafauna, corals, and demersal fishes. The resilience across these communities was heterogeneous, with some requiring years if not decades to fully recover. To synthesize ecosystem impacts and recovery following DWH, the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI) Core 3 synthesis group subdivided the nGoM into four ecotypes: coastal, continental shelf, open-ocean, and deep benthic. Here we present a synopsis of the deep benthic ecotype status and discuss progress made on five tasks: (1) summarizing pre- and post-oil spill trends in abundance, species composition, and dynamics; (2) identifying missing data/analyses and proposing a strategy to fill in these gaps; (3) constructing a conceptual model of important species interactions and impacting factors; (4) evaluating resiliency and recovery potential of different species; and (5) providing recommendations for future long-term benthic ecosystem research programs. To address these tasks, we assessed time series to detect measures of population trends. Moreover, a benthic conceptual model for the GoM deep benthos was developed and a vulnerability-resilience analysis was performed to enable holistic interpretation of the interrelationships among ecotypes, resources, and stressors. The DWH oil spill underscores the overall need for a system-level benthic management decision support tool based on long-term measurement of ecological quality status (EQS). Production of such a decision support tool requires temporal baselines and time-series data collections. This approach provides EQS for multiple stressors affecting the GoM beyond oil spills. In many cases, the lessons learned from DWH, the gaps identified, and the recommended approaches for future long-term hypothesis-driven research can be utilized to better assess impacts of any ecosystem perturbation of industrial impact, including marine mineral extraction.

AB  - Introduction Depressive disorders are a common illness worldwide. Major depression is known as a significant predictor of the metabolic syndrome. However, the effects of depression on adipose tissue compartments are controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the state of research on the relationship between patients with depression and adipose tissue compartments as compared to nondepressed individuals.
   Methods The PubMed database was searched for human studies that measured adipose tissue compartments such as visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and/or organ-specific adipose tissue measurements using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan and reported the means and a measure of variance separately for depressed individuals and healthy controls. Twelve articles were identified, including a total of 1,141 depressed and 2,545 nondepressed individuals.
   Results Major depressive disorder and self-reported depressive symptoms were associated with elevated visceral adipose tissue and elevated subcutaneous adipose tissue. Subanalyses for gender, age, method of adipose tissue measurement, and method of depression assessment showed elevated visceral adipose in depressed individuals. The results could be replicated when focussing on studies controlling for body mass index (BMI). Regarding other adipose tissue compartments, meta-analysis could not be carried out due to lack of studies.
   Conclusions Depression is associated with enlarged visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Further, especially longitudinal, research is needed to identify the mechanism through which depressive disorders contribute to visceral adiposity.

AB  - Silicon (Si) is considered an important component for plant growth, development, and yield in many crop species. Silicon is also known to reduce plant pests. Although Si, the major component of soil next to oxygen, it is not used as a major nutrient by crop plants. However, extensive literature demonstrate the beneficial effects of soluble silicates, like silicon [orthosilicic acid (Si(H4SiO4)], on reducing biotic stress in crop ecosystems. In general, monocots tend to accumulate substantially more Si in plant tissues than dicots. Si accumulates in plant cell walls, providing protection by increasing the synthesis of lignin and phenolic compounds and activating the endogenous chemical defenses of plants including volatile and non-volatile compounds and other physical structures like trichomes. This review provides an overview of the history of silicon use in agriculture in India, for the management of insect pests. The future research needs in this field of study are also presented.

AB  - Purpose Malnutrition, whether characterized by not enough or too much nutrient intake, is detrimental to the liver. We herein provide a narrative literature revision relative to hepatic disease occurrence in over or undernourished subjects, to shed light on the paradox where both sides of malnutrition lead to similar liver dysfunction and fat accumulation. Methods Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for publications up to July 2020. Articles discussing the association between both chronic and acute liver pathology and malnutrition were evaluated together with studies reporting the dietary intake in subjects affected by malnutrition. Results The association between overnutrition and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is well recognized, as the beneficial effects of calorie restriction and very low carbohydrate diets. Conversely, the link between undernutrition and liver injury is more complex and less understood. In developing countries, early exposure to nutrient deficiency leads to marasmus and kwashiorkor, accompanied by fatty liver, whereas in developed countries anorexia nervosa is a more common form of undernutrition, associated with liver injury. Weight gain in undernutrition is associated with liver function improvement, whereas no study on the impact of macronutrient distribution is available. We hypothesized a role for very low carbohydrate diets in the management of undernutrition derived liver pathology, in addition to the established one in overnutrition-related NAFLD. Conclusions Further studies are warranted to update the knowledge regarding undernutrition-related liver disease, and a specific interest should be paid to macronutrient distribution both in the context of refeeding and relative to its role in the development of hepatic complications of anorexia nervosa.

AB  - The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents us with unusual challenges to the global health system and economics. The pandemic may not have an immediate impact on suicide rates, however, given that it is likely to result in a confluence of risk factors for suicide and economic crisis, it is highly possibly that it will lead to increases in suicide rates in the long-run. Elderly persons are more likely to live alone, be socially isolated during COVID-19 and have physical health problems, which are risk factors for suicide. Young children and health professionals may also be population at risk. Isolation, quarantine and the economic crisis that follows may impact mental health significantly. The International Academy of Suicide Research (IASR) is an organization dedicated to promote high standards of research and scholarship in the field of suicidal behaviour to support efforts to prevent suicide globally. This IASR's board position paper gives recommendations for suicide research during the COVID-10 pandemic. Clinical research has to be modified due to COVID-19 shutdown.

AB  - Background Good reading skills are important for appropriate functioning in everyday life, scholastic performance, and acquiring a higher socioeconomic status. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify possible deficits in specific reading skills in people with a variety of mental illnesses, including personality disorders (PDs). Methods We performed a systematic search of multiple databases from inception until February 2020 and conducted random-effects meta-analyses. Results The search yielded 34 studies with standardized assessments of reading skills in people with one or more mental illnesses. Of these, 19 studies provided data for the meta-analysis. Most studies (k = 27; meta-analysis, k = 17) were in people with schizophrenia and revealed large deficits in phonological processing (Hedge's g = -0.88, p < 0.00001), comprehension (Hedge's g = -0.96, p < 0.00001) and reading rate (Hedge's g = -1.22, p = 0.002), relative to healthy controls; the single-word reading was less affected (Hedge's g = -0.70, p < 0.00001). A few studies in affective disorders and nonforensic PDs suggested weaker deficits (for all, Hedge's g < -0.60). In forensic populations with PDs, there was evidence of marked phonological processing (Hedge's g = -0.85, p < 0.0001) and comprehension deficits (Hedge's g = -0.95, p = 0.0003). Conclusions People with schizophrenia, and possibly forensic PD populations, demonstrate a range of reading skills deficits. Future studies are needed to establish how these deficits directly compare to those seen in developmental or acquired dyslexia and to explore the potential of dyslexia interventions to improve reading skills in these populations.

AB  - Background:
   The economic crisis' effects on suicide rates for countries undergoing or exiting austerity measures have been widely debated. This integrative review aimed to identify, appraise, and synthesize available evidence of employment status effect on suicide mortality rates in Greece during the recent economic recession period.
   Methods:
   A literature review of studies evaluating suicides in the general Greek population, as well as across age and gender groups, in relation to employment during the economic crisis period was performed. PubMed electronic database was searched for relevant articles published in English or Greek language from 2009 up to February 2020. Appraisal was carried out based on the Hierarchy of Evidence Rating System and the GRADE guidelines.
   Results:
   A total of 24 articles met all inclusion criteria with 20 of them at level IV, 2 at level VII, and 2 at level VIII. A total of 18 studies reported increase of suicide rates during the economic recession period. About 12 studies examined the co-relation between unemployment and suicide rate, with ten studies showing a positive correlation. Moreover, thirteen studies reported data on the effect of gender and age variables on suicide rates.
   Conclusion:
   Evidence shows that suicide mortality rates in Greece increased after the eruption of economic recession, particularly after the implementation of radical austerity measures (2011-2014). This increase was positively correlated with unemployment and was more prominent among males of working age. Further in depth epidemiological research of regional variations in terms of profile and contributing or enabling factors of suicidal behavior is needed.

This relationship for vulnerable children and young people has not hitherto been systematically reviewed. This narrative synthesis aims to consolidate research to provide a foundational basis for future health-related social network research and interventions for children and young people. Methods This mixed methods systematic review synthesises research investigating whole, egocentric social networks of 32 vulnerable child groups with a mean age below 18. There were no setting, language or date restrictions. The quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of 6360 search results, 49 were included for narrative synthesis. Results The majority of pertinent research originates from the USA; the most frequently investigated vulnerabilities were minority ethnic status, homelessness and the presence of special educational needs. Research aims and methodologies varied significantly between studies. Key findings included (i) vulnerable (excluding minority ethnic) children and young people have impoverished networks (ii) access to networks is a protective factor against negative outcomes (iii) social ties, primarily immediate family, provide access to personal resources and (iv) network ties are to a degree substitutable. Conclusions Networks are associated with wellbeing and vulnerable children and young people commonly have impoverished networks, excluding cases where vulnerability classification relates to minority ethnic status. Network embeddedness is associated with positive outcomes, particularly for homeless children. Family are typically primary providers of support, but ties are substitutable when networks are restricted. Egocentric social network research is currently limited for vulnerable child populations. Further research could inform interventions that harness networks to improve health, wellbeing and functional outcomes for these child groups.

AB  - Background: A manic state induced by antidepressant withdrawal is a rare clinical occurrence that has been increasingly reported in the last decades and currently represents a nosological entity with specified criteria. Objectives: This paper aims to report a case of mania induced by escitalopram withdrawal in a patient with unipolar depression. Furtherly, we intend to review the published case reports of manic states induced by antidepressant withdrawal, analysing its epidemiology and discussing the current theories concerning its pathophysiology. Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed database in July 2019, without restriction by year of publication, and selected case reports and literature reviews in English, which were fully read. Results: Only 29 reported cases fulfil the most accepted diagnostic criteria. This phenomenon is more frequent in patients with unipolar depression, may occur with any major class of antidepressant and it is still unclear whether it indicates a latent bipolar disorder. Our case report is the third case associated with the use of escitalopram published in the literature. Conclusion: Although a rare phenomenon, mania induced by antidepressant withdrawal poses relevant clinical challenges and its possible pathophysiological processes may shed some light on the mechanisms underlying affective disorders.

AB  - Due to their unique properties, perfluorinated substances (PFAS) are widely used in multiple industrial and commercial applications, but they are toxic for animals, humans included. This review presents some available data on the PFAS environmental distribution in the world, and in particular in Europe and in the Veneto region of Italy, where it has become a serious problem for human health. The consumption of contaminated food and drinking water is considered one of the major source of exposure for humans. Worldwide epidemiological studies report the negative effects that PFAS have on human health, due to environmental pollution, including infertility, steroid hormone perturbation, thyroid, liver and kidney disorders, and metabolic disfunctions. In vitro and in vivo researches correlated PFAS exposure to oxidative stress effects (in mammals as well as in other vertebrates of human interest), produced by a PFAS-induced increase of reactive oxygen species formation. The cellular antioxidant defense system is activated by PFAS, but it is only partially able to avoid the oxidative damage to biomolecules.

AB  - Objective. The process of patient navigation involves system resource experts matching patients to the most appropriate services. Patient navigation within the mental health and/or addictions (MHA) system is only a recent development and has not undergone extensive research. This study examines trends regarding clients of a family navigation service in Toronto, Canada, which supports families of youth ages 13-26 with MHA concerns. Method. A retrospective chart review was conducted using a sample of 200 cases from the first 989 clients of the navigation service. Descriptive statistics were performed to examine the general characteristics and demographics of navigation clients, the MHA profiles of navigation clients, and the characteristics of navigation. To predict the service needs and goals of navigation clients, four forward likelihood ratio multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. Results. Female caregivers were the most frequent point of contact, and families most commonly requested psychiatric assessments, counselling services, and parent support programs. Families who were seeking help for a female youth were less likely to request psychiatric treatment compared to families seeking help for a male youth (p=.04) and families with a youth who already had a formal psychiatric diagnosis were more likely to request a counselling or therapy referral (p=.04) compared to families with a youth who had not received a formal psychiatric diagnosis. Conclusion. The findings contribute to an understanding of family navigation within the MHA field, and may support the development of targeted navigation programs that meet youth and families' needs.

AB  - Antipsychotics are the first-line treatment for people with schizophrenia or psychosis. There is evidence that they can reduce the symptoms of psychosis and risk of relapse. However many people do not respond to these drugs, or experience adverse effects and stop taking them. In the UK, clinical guidelines have stressed the need for research into psychosocial interventions without antipsychotics. This systematic review examines the effects of psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia or psychosis who are on no/minimal antipsychotics. Databases were searched for empirical studies investigating a psychosocial intervention in people with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder who were not taking antipsychotics or had received an antipsychotic minimisation strategy. We identified nine interventions tested in 17 studies (N = 2250), including eight randomised controlled trials. Outcomes were generally equal to or in a small number of cases better than the control group (antipsychotics/treatment as usual) for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Need Adapted Treatment and Soteria. The remaining interventions provided some encouraging, but overall inconsistent findings and were Psychosocial Outpatient Treatment, Open Dialogue, Psychosocial Inpatient Treatment, Psychoanalysis/Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, Major Role Therapy, and Milieu Treatment. Study quality was generally low with little recent research. In conclusion, nine psychosocial interventions have been studied for patients on no/minimal antipsychotics. The majority of studies reported outcomes for the intervention which were the same as the control group, however, study quality was problematic. Given the adverse effects of antipsychotics and that many people do not want to take them, high quality trials of psychosocial treatments for people on minimal/no antipsychotics are needed.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to compare efficacy and acceptability among drug treatments for adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through a systematic review, random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses.
   Methods: Double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions for adults with PTSD were searched from database inception through Aug. 28, 2018, on Cochrane (Central), Embase, LILACS, PILOTS, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. Clinical trial registries and the websites of pharmaceutical companies were also searched. The GRADE system was used to assess the quality of the evidence.
   Results: The systematic review included 58 studies comprising 6766 patients randomized to 26 different interventions. Regarding efficacy, topiramate (SMD = -0.57; 95%CrI: -1.07,-0.10), risperidone (SMD = -0.53; 95% CrI: -0.93,-0.15), quetiapine (SMD = -0.59; 95%CrI: -1.06,-0.11), paroxetine (SMD = -0.35; 95%CrI: -0.48,-0.21), venlafaxine (SMD = -0.25; 95%CrI: -0.44,-0.05), fluoxetine (SMD = -0.28; 95%CrI: -0.46,-0.08), and sertraline (SMD = -0.21; 95%CrI: -0.33,-0.09) outperformed placebo. Moreover, phenelzine (RR = 3.39; 95%CrI: 1.43,11.09), lamotrigine (RR = 4.39; 95%CrI: 1.18,26.38), and fluoxetine (RR = 1.28%CrI: 1.01,1.59) outperformed placebo in terms of acceptability.
   Conclusions: The NMA supports topiramate, risperidone, quetiapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, fluoxetine and sertraline as effective pharmacological choices for the treatment of PTSD. Quetiapine and topiramate have the shortcoming of relying on a few small studies, but the clinically meaningful change in symptoms is noteworthy and merits further investigation. Among the pharmacological treatments with evidence of efficacy compared to placebo, fluoxetine achieved a relatively high rank regarding acceptability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest contemporary NMA on the subject and the addition of new medications is an important extension of previous meta-analyses, enabling a larger number of drug comparisons.

AB  - Mutations in VPS35 (PARK17), a key molecule in the retromer complex, are a rare cause of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. VPS35 exerts crucial functions within the cell in terms of regulating endosomal trafficking. However new data suggest its relevance also in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis. Herein, we review the crosstalk between VPS35 and the mitochondria, highlighting the potential relevance to PD pathogenesis. VPS35 is not only a critical player in pathways connected to a-synuclein accumulation and clearance, but also plays a key role in ensuring mitochondrial stability and function. The genetic links of VPS35 to PD and the involvement of VPS35 in different PD related pathological mechanisms highlight the potential for targeting VPS35 as a neuroprotective strategy for PD.

AB  - Objective: Conflicting results have been reported on the associations between inappropriate gestational weight gain (GWG) and the risk of depression during pregnancy. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between weight gain during pregnancy and the risk of antenatal depressive symptoms.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases from database inception to July 31, 2020, and relevant studies were identified. Observational studies assessing the association between GWG using the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations and maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy were included. We used a random-effects model to estimate risks. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed.
   Results: Of the 1232 studies identified, 19 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled odds ratio for the association between inadequate, excessive and total GWG and antenatal depressive symptoms was 1.09 (95% CI; 0.94-1.25), 0.94 (95% CI; 0.85-1.03), and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.88, 01.13), respectively. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses provided consistent findings.
   Conclusion: The findings showed that neither women who gained weight below IOM recommendations, nor women who gained weight above IOM recommendations were more likely to experience depressive symptoms during pregnancy compared with women whose weight gain was within the recommended range. Studies focus on trimester-specific GWG and antenatal depressive symptoms are needed.

AB  - Background Psychiatric surgery, including deep brain stimulation and stereotactic ablation, is an important treatment option in severe refractory psychiatric illness. Several large trials have demonstrated response rates of approximately 50%, underscoring the need to identify and select responders preoperatively. Recent advances in neuroimaging have brought this possibility into focus. We systematically reviewed the psychiatric surgery neuroimaging literature to assess the current state of evidence for preoperative imaging predictors of response. Methods We performed this study in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) frameworks, and preregistered it using PROSPERO. We systematically searched the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases for studies reporting preoperative neuroimaging analyses correlated with clinical outcomes in patients who underwent psychiatric surgery. We recorded and synthesized the methodological details, imaging results and clinical correlations from these studies. Results After removing duplicates, the search yielded 8388 unique articles, of which 7 met the inclusion criteria. The included articles were published between 2001 and 2018 and reported on the outcomes of 101 unique patients. Of the 6 studies that reported significant findings, all identified clusters of hypermetabolism, hyperconnectivity or increased size in the frontostriatal limbic circuitry. LimitationsThe included studies were few and highly varied, spanning 2 decades.Conclusion Although few studies have analyzed preoperative imaging for predictors of response to psychiatric surgery, we found consistency among the reported results: most studies implicated overactivity in the frontostriatal limbic network as being correlated with clinical response. Larger prospective studies are needed.Registration www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=131151.

AB  - Various accidents and incidents occur daily in schools, which can have a lifelong impact on both school learners and their family's life. These events at schools might lead to physical and psychological symptoms which would affect school learner and educator performance. This critical review searched the peer-reviewed scientific literature that were published (2009 to 2019) to identify contemporary crisis containment management practices in South African schools. We utilised the Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis (SALSA) method to examine crisis containment management in South African schools. We included peer reviewed studies that met the following criteria: Published literature, PhD theses, and Master dissertations focusing on school safety. We excluded conference proceedings and studies published in other languages than English. Our search yielded four published articles for this critical review. Applying a qualitative synthesis approach, we identified the three themes: (i) schools are not safe due to various problems hampering effective teaching and learning; (ii) obstacles to ensuring safety within schools; and (iii) policies and skills necessary for crises containment and management. We conclude that policies on physical safety are needed, in addition to equipping educators and other stakeholders with the necessary skills and training in terms of the psychological and emotional safety of the school community.

TI  - Kratom: A growing substance of abuse in the United States
KW  - WITHDRAWAL
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of kratom is increasing in the United States due to its perceived safety as a botanical product. This review provides salient information about kratom for the practicing clinician.
   METHODS: We conducted a literature search of MedLine, UpToDate, and Google using the terms "kratom" and "Mitragyna speciosa" for articles published within the last 10 years.
   RESULTS: We reviewed >500 articles. Kratom is derived from the Mitragyna speciosa plant of Southeast Asia. It has grown in popularity within the United States due to its dual effects of acting as a stimulant at low doses and acting as an opioid-like substance at higher dosages. The 2 major active ingredients in kratom, mitragynine and 7-OH mitragynine, act as partial agonists at the mu-opioid receptor. While adverse consequences are normally mild, there are several potentially serious adverse effects, including respiratory depression, especially with chronic, high-dose usage. Furthermore, in case reports, concomitant use of kratom with other substances has been linked to seizures. Unfortunately, an increasing number of deaths have been linked to kratom usage. Six states have made it illegal to possess or sell kratom.
   CONCLUSIONS: Kratom is an emerging drug of abuse in the United States. Its use is increasing in individuals who may seek to experience an opioid-like "high" as well as to help reduce withdrawal effects from other opioids.

AB  - Background: The burden of mental illness among the scheduled tribe (ST) population in India is not known clearly.
   Aim: The aim was to identify and appraise mental health research studies on ST population in India and collate such data to inform future research.
   Materials and Methods: Studies published between January 1980 and December 2018 on STs by following exclusion and inclusion criteria were selected for analysis. PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, Sociofile, Cinhal, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Quality of the included studies was assessed using an appraisal tool to assess the quality of cross-sectional studies and Critical Appraisal Checklist developed by Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Studies were summarized and reported descriptively.
   Results: Thirty-two relevant studies were found and included in the review. Studies were categorized into the following three thematic areas: alcohol and substance use disorders, common mental disorders and sociocultural aspects, and access to mental health-care services. Sociocultural factors play a major role in understanding and determining mental disorders.
   Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to review research on mental health among the STs. Mental health research conducted among STs in India is limited and is mostly of low-to-moderate quality. Determinants of poor mental health and interventions for addressing them need to be studied on an urgent basis.

AB  - Nicotine use, which is mostly done through smoking tobacco, is among the most burdensome comorbidities of schizophrenia. However, the ways in which nicotine affects the cognitive and early sensory alterations found in this illness are still debated. After conducting a systematic literature search, 29 studies were selected. These studies involve individuals with schizophrenia who underwent cognitive and/or early sensory function assessments after acute nicotine administration and include 560 schizophrenia subjects and 346 non-schizophrenia controls. The findings highlight that a single dose of nicotine can improve a range of cognitive functions in schizophrenia subjects, such as attention, working memory, and executive functions, with attention being the most responsive domain. In addition, nicotine can modulate early detection of changes in the sensory environment at both the auditory and visual levels. Nevertheless, effects vary strongly depending on the type of neuropsychological assessment and nicotine intake conditions used in each study. The current findings suggest the need to consider a potential decrease of cognitive and early sensory performance when patients with schizophrenia quit smoking.

AB  - Selected neurons of the hypothalamus are equipped with molecules specialized in sensing the energy status of the organism. Upon activation or inhibition by central and systemic factors, such as neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and nutrients, these molecules play important roles in the regulation of neuronal responses that control whole-body energy homeostasis. Dietary fats can control hypothalamic function by acting upon distinct energy sensing systems. They can be metabolized inside neurons, producing signals that control the expression of neurotransmitters involved in energy homeostasis; moreover, excessive amounts of certain fatty acids can activate inflammatory signaling in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, leading to functional abnormalities and, eventually, neuronal apoptosis. In addition, recent studies have identified lipid-sensing G-protein- coupled receptors in the hypothalamus, revealing their involvement in the regulation of caloric intake and energy expenditure, as well as in the hypothalamic inflammatory response that occurs in obesity. Because of advances in the generation of synthetic ligands for this class of receptors, it is expected that pharmacological modulation of selected lipid-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors in the central nervous system could provide therapeutic advances in obesity and other metabolic diseases. Here we review seminal work in this field.

AB  - Chile is currently experiencing a progressive epidemiological transition towards chronic diseases. In this country, >50% of annual deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease and cancer. Moreover, health surveys have shown high prevalence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cardiovascular disease risk. In addition, mental health issues are also frequent among Chilean adults. On the other hand, the agri-food system contributes to 21-37% of greenhouse gases emissions worldwide. Overall, current health and food chain situation calls out for design and implementation of evidence-based feasible and effective nutritional interventions needed to promote physical and mental health along with addressing food sustainability in Chile. Nowadays, the Mediterranean diet is recognized as one of the healthiest dietary patterns based on observational and interventional studies linked to a wide variety of health outcomes. However, a Mediterranean lifestyle goes well beyond food intake: it includes promotion of psychosocial resources, community life as well as cultural traditions. Indeed, Mediterranean lifestyle is a true modus vivendi that integrally promotes physical, mental, and social well-being. In addition, the Mediterranean diet stands out for its environmental sustainability because it is characterized mainly as a plant-based dietary pattern with low carbon and water footprints. Remarkably, Central Chile has a Mediterranean-like setting with plant and animal food production and availability patterns comparable to those present in countries located around the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, this article reviews how promotion of Mediterranean lifestyle adherence in Chile offers great potential for management of the ongoing epidemiological transition to chronic diseases as well to promote psychological well-being within a unique food system and dietary sustainability vision for this Latin American country.

AB  - Background: The concept of Mental Health Literacy (MHL) relies on our capacity to understand and recognize mental illnesses and the ability to maintain and promote a positive mentality for ourselves and others. In our review, we aim to examine the level of MHL among healthcare providers in the Arab Gulf States. Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline were searched till August 2019. Studies were included if at least one of the main components of mental health literacy was reported, including (a) knowledge of mental illnesses, (b) stigma toward mental illnesses, (c) confidence in helping patients, and (d) behavior of helping patients, regardless of study design. The risk of bias was rated according to the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cross-sectional studies. Results: Seven studies were included in the review; all of them were cross-sectional, with a total of 3516 participants from the healthcare system. Overall most of the studies claimed limited knowledge, negative attitudes, behavior and/or confidence among nurses, pharmacists, and physicians, especially juniors. However, the overall quality of all outcomes was relatively very low. Conclusion: More highquality evidence and in-depth qualitative studies are required to bridge the gap between mental health needs and services delivered by healthcare providers in the Gulf Arab region.

AB  - Background. COVID-19 affects several systems in the body, including the central nervous system (CNS), expressed in the form of headaches, hyposmia, cerebrovascular disease, and neuropathy. Older Adults (OA) are vulnerable to this infection, and may also present delirium, which may be the result of the virus directly affecting the CNS or of systemic inflammation during infection. Objective. To determine the clinical characteristics, risk factors, pathophysiology, treatment measures, and prevention of delirium associated with COVID-19 from a review of the literature in times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Method. A search was conducted in PubMed, SciELO, UpToDate, and Medscape using keywords in English and Spanish. Results. Seventy-two articles were reviewed. We analyzed inclusion and exclusion criteria and 43 articles with relevant information for the narrative description of the review were selected. Twenty to thirty per cent of the COVID-19 patients will present or develop delirium, or changes in mental status during their hospitalization, with rates of 60% to 70% in severe illness. The exact mechanisms are likely to be multifactorial. There is a worrying lack of attention to the implications of identifying and managing delirium in the response to this pandemic. Discussion and conclusion. Delirium is a frequent neurological manifestation in OA with COVID-19 and requires early identification, as well as the implementation of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment strategies, which may reduce the associated morbidity and mortality in this age group.

AB  - Turnover of the mitochondrial pool due to coordinated processes of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy is an important process in maintaining mitochondrial stability. An important role in this process is played by the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of the expression of genes responsible for oxidative stress protection, regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitophagy. The p62 protein is a multifunctional cytoplasmic protein that functions as a selective mitophagy receptor for the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates. There is evidence that p62 can positively regulate Nrf2 by binding to its negative regulator, Keap1. However, there is also strong evidence that Nrf2 up-regulates p62 expression. Thereby, a regulatory loop is formed between two important signaling pathways, which may be an important target for drugs aimed at treating neurodegeneration. Constitutive activation of p62 in parallel with Nrf2 would most likely result in the activation of mTORC1-mediated signaling pathways that are associated with the development of malignant neoplasms. The purpose of this review is to describe the p62-Nrf2-p62 regulatory loop and to evaluate its role in the regulation of mitophagy under various physiological conditions.

AB  - Dependence on chemical pesticides has become one of the most pressing challenges to global environmental sustainability and public health. Considerable regulatory efforts have been taken to mitigate pesticide dependence, which however has resulted in a prevalent 'managerial failure'. Massive pesticide application has generated severe genetic resistance from pests, which has in turn further aggravated pesticide dependence and thus induced agrochemical industries to develop new pesticide varieties. This review proposes to look beyond the resistance-dependence nexus and presents a comprehensive discussion about global pesticide dependence in a social science perspective, i.e., revealing the socio-economic and political factors that reinforce pesticide dependence. These factors are classified into five intertwined themes: (1) agricultural regime, (2) social process of pesticide application, (3) economic analysis, (4) politics and governance, and (5) promotional failure of alternatives. It is found that pesticide dependence is not just a technological issue in the sphere of natural sciences, but more a human-made issue, with deep-seated socio-economic and political reasons. Addressing contemporary trap of global pesticide dependence entails a full acknowledgement and comprehension of the complex and intertwined factors. Furthermore, this review identifies two major explanatory approaches underlying the extant social science literature: a structuralist approach that stresses macro-level structures such as institutions, policies and paradigms, and an individualist approach that focuses on the decision-making of farmers at the micro level. This review recognizes the limitations of the two approaches and calls for transcending the duality. This study advocates a policy framework that emphasizes alignment and coordination from multi-dimensions, multi-actors and multi-scales. For future research, collaborations between natural and social scientists, and more integrated and interdisciplinary approaches should be strengthened.

AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of adjunct music therapy on patients with schizophrenia, we conducted a meta-analysis of currently available randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. Eight electronic databases (CNKI, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Psychology and behavioural Sciences Collection, and Medline) were systematically searched from inception to January 2020. Standard mean differ-ence (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) values were used to evaluate the effects of music therapy. Finally, we selected eighteen studies comprising 1,212 participants comparing with control conditions. The meta -analysis demonstrated that adjunct music therapy significantly improved total symptoms (SMD =-0.48, 95%CI:-0.74 to-0.22), negative symptoms (SMD=-0.56, 95%CI:-0.72 to-0.40), depression symptoms (SMD =-0.35, 95% CI:-0.54 to-0.17), and quality of life (SMD = 0.35, 95%CI: 0.07 to 0.62) in people with schizophrenia compared with the control group. In addition, the meta-analysis indicated no publication bias for total symptoms, negative symptoms, and positive symptoms. The sensitivity analysis showed that the result was reliable. But the quality of evidence is still low, more well-designed studies with larger sample size and high quality are needed to confirm the efficiency of adjunct music therapy in treating schizophrenia.

AB  - This study aimed to review qualitative studies on perceptions of home cooking. A systematic search was conducted in Scopus and SciELO databases using English and Portuguese terms related to home cooking, without date or language restrictions. Twenty-six articles, published between 2004 and 2017, investigated, whether as a primary objective or as a secondary finding, the perceptions of individuals on home cooking. More than half of the studies were conducted in English-speaking countries. Study participants included women and men, adults and seniors as well as residents of urban and rural areas, Eastern and Western countries, and developing and developed nations. Thematic analysis showed that home cooking has different interpretations and meanings in diverse contexts and revealed differences in how individuals plan and cook their meals at home. Cognitive, practical, affective, and emotional factors are the major motivators to home meal preparation. Having a cooking role model in the family, cooking confidence and skills, and living alone were reported as facilitators of home cooking. A better understanding of the heterogeneity of perceptions and meanings of home cooking can contribute to the development of effective and culturally appropriate interventions for stimulating healthy cooking habits.

AB  - Background: No review has been attempted, so far, on Indian psychological autopsy (PA) literature. There is also a dearth of interview guides which is at the heart of a PA procedure.
   Materials and Methods: Electronic searches of MEDLINE through PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google scholar databases were carried out from inception till February 2020 to identify relevant English language peer-reviewed articles from India, as well as global literature that provided information on best practice elements in PA. Abstracts generated were systematically screened for eligibility. Relevant data were extracted using a predesigned structured proforma, and a semi-structured interview guide was developed.
   Results: A total of 18 original articles, one case report, and three reviews/expert opinion articles which tried to give a description of PA procedure were found from India. Most Indian studies are of suicide PA (SPA), done to assess risk factors associated with suicide. There was a wide variation in reported rates of psychiatric morbidity among suicide decedents, while the other major risk factor for suicide in the Indian setting was stressful life events. An optimal approach to PA involves systematically collecting information from key informants and other sources using a narrative interviewing method, supplemented with psychological measures, and is probably best carried out within 1-6 months after the death.
   Conclusion: There have been limited attempts to standardize PA. Most Indian studies use SPA. We propose a semi-structured PA interview guide, suitable for both research and investigational purposes.

AB  - The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are linked to poorer functional outcomes and decreases in quality of life, and are often the first to develop in individuals who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. However, the accompanying neurobiological changes are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the studies that have examined the brain metrics associated with negative symptoms in those at CHR.
   Electronic databases were searched from inception to August 2019. Studies were selected if they mentioned negative symptoms in youth at CHR for psychosis, and brain imaging. Of 261 citations, 43 studies with 2144 CHR participants met inclusion criteria. Too few studies were focused on the same brain regions using similar neuroimaging methods to perform a meta-analysis, however, the results of this systematic review suggest a relationship between negative symptom increases and decreases in grey matter. The paucity of studies linking changes in brain structure and function with negative symptoms in those at CHR suggests that future work should focus on examining these relationships.

AB  - Sleep problems and depression are both common and have a high impact on quality of life. They are also strongly associated and commonly occur together. During the reproductive age, both sleep problems and depression are almost twice as common in women than men. Epidemiological studies show that women experience more sleep problems and depressive symptoms around times when sex hormones change, such as puberty and menopause, but it is unclear what effect sex hormones have on sleep problems and depression.
   This systematic review aims to summarize and evaluate studies that investigated the relationship between sex hormones, sleep and depression.
   Systematic search resulted in 2895 articles, of which 13 met inclusion criteria.
   Depressed patients showed worse sleep than controls, but no significant difference in endogenous hormone levels was found. Additionally, higher endogenous estrogen was associated with better sleep in controls, but associations between endogenous sex hormones and depressive symptoms were inconclusive. More research on the effect of sex hormones on sleep and depression is necessary.

AB  - Background and Aims: Screening and assessment of cognitive changes in adults with Intellectual Disabilities (ID), mainly Down Syndrome (DS), is crucial to offer appropriate services to their needs. We present a systematic review of the existing instruments assessing dementia, aiming to support researchers and clinicians' best practice. Methods: Searches were carried out in the databases Web of Science; PubMed; PsycINFO in March 2019 and updated in October 2020. Studies were selected and examined if they: (1) focused on assessing age-related cognitive changes in persons with ID; (2) included adults and/or older adults; (3) included scales and batteries for cognitive assessment. Results: Forty-eight cross-sectional studies and twenty-seven longitudinal studies were selected representing a total sample of 6451 participants (4650 DS and 1801 with other ID). In those studies, we found 39 scales, questionnaires, and inventories, and 13 batteries for assessing cognitive and behavioural changes in adults with DS and other ID. Conclusion: The most used instrument completed by an informant or carer was the Dementia Questionnaire for Learning Disabilities (DLD), and its previous versions. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the instruments and outline recommendations for future use.

AB  - Most patients with chronic pain do not find adequate pain relief with a single treatment, and accumulating evidence points to the added benefits of rational combinations of different treatments. Given that psychological therapies, such as mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), are often delivered in conjunction with concomitant analgesic drug therapies (CADTs), this systematic scoping review examines the evidence for any interactions between MBIs and CADTs. The protocol for this review has been published and registered. MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched until July 2019. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of MBIs for the treatment of chronic pain. A total of 40 randomized controlled trials (2978 participants) were included. Thirty-nine of 40 (97.5%) included mindfulness-based clinical trials allowed the use of CADTs. However, only 6 of these 39 (15.4%) trials provided adequate details of what these CADTs were, and only 4 (10.3%) trials controlled for CADTs. Of great relevance to this review, none of the included trials analyzed the interactions between MBIs and the CADTs to determine whether they have an additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effect on chronic pain. Adverse events were inconsistently reported, and no judgment could be made about safety. Future trials assessing the interactions between MBIs and CADTs, with better harms reporting, are needed to better define the role of MBIs in the management of chronic pain.

AB  - One important lesson from the last decade of studies in the field of systemic energy metabolism is that obesity is first and foremost a brain disease. Hypothalamic neurons dysfunction observed in response to chronic metabolic stress is a key pathogenic node linking consumption of hypercaloric diets with body weight gain and associated metabolic sequelae. A key hypothalamic neuronal population expressing the neuropeptide Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) displays altered electrical activity and dysregulated neuropeptides production capacity after long-term feeding with hypercaloric diets. However, whether such neuronal dysfunction represents a consequence or a mechanism of disease, remains a subject of debate. Here, we will review and highlight emerging pathogenic mechanisms that explain why POMC neurons undergo dysfunctional activity in response to caloric overload, and critically address whether these mechanisms may be causally implicated in the physiopathology of obesity and of its associated co-morbidities.

AB  - Purpose of review Childhood and adolescence are a crucial time window for the early identification of perspectival risk for adult psychopathology. This article reviews current advances in the field. Recent findings Converging developmentally focused and predictive approaches are rapidly expanding in the field of early identification of children and adolescents at risk for psychiatric illness. Although the former emphasizes early phenotypic trajectories emerging in childhood and adolescence, the latter operate in terms of clinical risk staging. Decisive advances in the field include the metaanalytical evidence of the predictive value of clinical high-risk criteria in childhood-adolescence; the systematization of premorbid manifestations of psychotic vulnerability and bipolar prodromes; the corroboration of certain sets of anomalous subjective experiences as transdiagnostic index of familial genetic risk (i.e., basic symptoms) and early developmental expression of schizophrenia spectrum vulnerability (i.e., self-disorders). Childhood phenotypic manifestations of liability to mental disorders are often cooccurrent and undergo a plastic, heterotypic modification along the transition to adolescence. In general, they represent epiphenomenic flags of a broad vulnerability for the subsequent structuration of mental illness. This perspective coheres with the p-factor model of psychopathology and complements the clinical staging model which informs the early detection paradigm of severe mental disorders.

AB  - (1) Background: Review-based studies are required to consider the different designs and data that describe the association between physical activity and mental health for underprivileged children and adolescents. There is a particular need to identify mechanisms which could explain the association, and factors which influence the association in this population group. (2) Methods: An integrative review with a systematic search was conducted in three stages: (i) a systematic literature search on four databases from inception until May 2020. Studies were eligible if they examined underprivileged children, involved moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and had a focus on at least one outcome measure related to mental health. (ii) Two critical appraisal tools were used to assess quality across different study designs. (iii) Synthesis was undertaken in four stages, examining social, internal and physical outcomes and mechanisms. (3) Results: A total of 16 studies were included (2 qualitative; 12 quantitative and 2 mixed methods). Fifteen (15/16; 93.8%) showed an association between MVPA and a significant improvement in at least one mental health outcome. The most studied outcomes included: internal aspects (n = 14), significant effects were identified in 12/14 studies; social aspects (n = 6), significant effects were identified across all studies and finally physical aspects (n = 5), significant effects were found in 3/5 studies. Autonomy support was identified as a mechanism to explain the change, whilst age and gender influenced the strength of the association. (4) Conclusions: The findings provide confirmation of the link between MVPA and the improved mental health and wellbeing of disadvantaged children and adolescents. Future research must consider the long-term effect through longitudinal studies, along with determining whether any specific types of PA are more impactful than others.

AB  - The scope of human learning and development poses a radical challenge for cognitive science. We propose that developmental theories can address this challenge by adopting perspectives from computer science. Many of our best models treat learning as analogous to computer programming because symbolic programs provide the most compelling account of sophisticated mental representations. We specifically propose that children's learning is analogous to a particular style of programming called hacking, making code better along many dimensions through an open-ended set of goals and activities. By contrast to existing theories, which depend primarily on local search and simple metrics, this view highlights the many features of good mental representations and the multiple complementary processes children use to create them.

AB  - Taurine is a conditionally essential amino acid in fish nutrition. The present study addressed the practical application of examining published data on fish nutrition over the past 20 years, emphasizing the topic of taurine by using computational tools and their applications. According to the published articles, an increased linear growth of research occurred, with Japanese flounder being the most examined fish species. Dietary taurine supplementation has several beneficial effects in fish nutrition, such as survival, growth, feed utilization, protein and energy retention, intermediate metabolism, anti-oxidation, anti-stress, disease resistance, muscle texture and reproductive performance. Also, there are negative effects in some species. Dietary taurine exerted effects on several gene expressions and enzyme activities; these are important in taurine metabolism in fish. These genes and enzymes included taurine transporter (TauT), cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO), cysteine sulfonate decarboxylase (CSD) and pretrypsinogen (Ptry). Plant protein-based diets with taurine supplementation are recommended because of the absence of taurine in plant protein.

AB  - Noninvasive neuromodulation, including repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and direct current stimulation (tDCS), provides researchers and health care professionals with the ability to gain unique insights into brain functions and treat several neurological and psychiatric conditions. Undeniably, the number of published research and clinical papers on this topic is increasing exponentially. In parallel, several methodological and scientific caveats have emerged in the transcranial stimulation field; these include less robust and reliable effects as well as contradictory clinical findings. These inconsistencies are maybe due to the fact that research exploring the relationship between the methodological aspects and clinical efficacy of rTMS and tDCS is far from conclusive. Hence, additional work is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of magnetic stimulation and low-intensity transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in order to optimize dosing, methodological designs, and safety aspects.

AB  - Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with autonomic nervous system dysfunction. The understanding of this autonomic dysregulation remains incomplete and treatment recommendations are lacking. By searching literature regarding childhood brain injury, we wanted to see whether understanding autonomic dysregulation following childhood brain injury as a prototype can help us better understand the autonomic dysregulation in RTT. Thirty-one (31) articles were identified and following thematic analysis the three main themes that emerged were (A) Recognition of Autonomic Dysregulation, (B) Possible Mechanisms & Assessment of Autonomic Dysregulation and (C) Treatment of Autonomic Dysregulation. We conclude that in patients with RTT (I) anatomically, thalamic and hypothalamic function should be explored, (II) sensory issues and medication induced side effects that can worsen autonomic function should be considered, and (III) diaphoresis and dystonia ought to be better managed. Our synthesis of data from autonomic dysregulation in paediatric brain injury has led to increased knowledge and a better understanding of its underpinnings, leading to the development of application protocols in children with RTT.

AB  - A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed to: 1) estimate the prevalence of both mental and physical health problems in older offenders; 2) calculate relative risks for the health conditions in relation to non-offender older adults and; 3) explore the potential confounding role of several variables. We searched five databases up to August 2019. Studies involving offenders older than 50 years old were included. Fifty-five publications met criteria. The pooled prevalence for 18 mental and 28 physical health problems was calculated. In comparison with non-offender older adults, older offenders showed significantly higher risk for Hypertension (RR = 1.16, CI = 1.1, 1.2), Cardiovascular Diseases (RR = 1.24, CI = 1.09, 1.41), Respiratory diseases (RR = 1.75, CI = 1.29, 2.35), and Arthritis (RR = 1.19, CI = 1.12, 1.25). Heterogeneity was significant for all metaanalyses and partially explained by the confounding effect of country, the diagnosis assessment method, and the sample characteristics. Future research should include comparison groups of non-offender older adults and use longitudinal study designs to identify risk factors that can be targeted in preventive programmes.

AB  - Background Worldwide, there are more than 13.3 million orphans and vulnerable children affected by Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (HIV OVC), defined as individuals below the age of 18 who have lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS or have been made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS; they are at risk for negative psychosocial and cognitive outcomes.
   Purpose This meta-analysis aimed to examine the scientific literature on available interventions for HIV OVC, with a focus on community-based interventions (CBI).
   Methods Systematic electronic searches were conducted from four databases between October 2016 and April 2017 to identify articles investigating the effectiveness of interventions for HIV OVC. Effect sizes were calculated for each article which provided enough information and data points for analyses.
   Results Seventy-four articles were reviewed, including psychosocial interventions (d = 0.30), cognitive interventions (d = 0.14), social protection interventions (d = 0.36), and community-based interventions (CBI; d = 0.36). Study-specific effect sizes varied widely, ranging from -1.09 to 2.26, that is, from a negative effect to an impressively large positive one, but the majority of studies registered small to medium effects (the overall effect size for all studies was 0.32, SE = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.26-0.37). Social protection interventions had the highest positive outcomes whereas CBI tended to have the fewest significant positive outcomes, with some outcomes worsening instead of improving.
   Conclusions Overall, interventions provided to OVC have potential for improving cognitive, psychosocial, and risk-behavior outcomes. Social protection interventions and CBI had the highest effect sizes, but CBI had positive effects on fewer outcomes and demonstrated some negative effects. CBI warrant scrutiny for improvement, as they represent an important form of culturally embedded services with potentially long-term benefits to OVC, yet appear to be differentially effective. Successful components of other types of intervention were identified, including cash grants, mentorship, and family therapy. In addition, more research is needed that attends to which interventions may be more effective for specific populations, or that studies cost-effectiveness.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to provide insight in inhibitory control (prepotent response inhibition and interference control) in trauma-exposed youth from a developmental perspective and exploring the effects of prolonged stress. A systematic search was conducted, resulting in 1722 abstracts. Of those, 33 studies met inclusion criteria. Twelve studies measured prepotent response inhibition (Go/no-go and Stop-signal task), 20 studies measured interference control (Flanker and Stroop task), and one measured both. Some studies indeed found evidence for prolonged trauma exposure impeding both subcomponents of inhibitory control, although others did not. At a later age, inhibitory control problems on task performance seem to disappear. However, distinct patterns of brain activity may suggest that those individuals employ compensation strategies. Together, the findings may suggest that non-specific inhibitory control problems occur after prolonged trauma exposure, with older youth possibly employing compensation strategies on the tasks. Future studies may provide a clearer picture of the compensation strategies and the circumstances in which they become visible.

AB  - We explore the intergenerational pattern of resource transfer and possible associated factors. A scoping review was conducted of quantitative, peer-reviewed, English-language studies related to intergenerational transfer or interaction. We searched AgeLine, PsycINFO, Social Work Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts for articles published between Jane 2008 and December 2018. Seventy-five studies from 25 countries met the inclusion criteria. The scoping review categorised resource transfers into three types: financial, instrumental, and emotional support. Using an intergenerational solidarity framework, factors associated with intergenerational transfer were placed in four categories: (1) demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, marital status, education, and ethno-cultural background); (2) needs and opportunities factors, including health, financial resources, and employment status; (3) family structures, namely, family composition, family relationship, and earlier family events; and (4) cultural-contextual structures, including state policies and social norms. Those factors were connected to the direction of resource transfer between generations. Downward transfers from senior to junior generations occur more frequently than upward transfers in many developed countries. Women dominate instrumental transfers, perhaps influenced by traditional gender roles. Overall, the pattern of resource transfer between generations is shown, and the impact of social norms and social policy on intergenerational transfers is highlighted. Policymakers should recognise the complicated interplay of each factor with different cultural contexts. The findings could inform policies that strengthen intergenerational solidarity and support.

AB  - Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in North American men. Although medical advances have improved survival rates, men treated for prostate cancer experience side-effects that can reduce their work capacity, increase financial stress, and affect their career and/or retirement plans. Working-age males comprise a significant proportion of new prostate cancer diagnoses. It is important, therefore, to understand the connections between prostate cancer and men's work lives. This scoping review aimed to summarize and disseminate current research evidence about the impact of prostate cancer treatment on men's work lives. Electronic databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2006 and 2020 that reported on the impact of prostate cancer treatment on men's work. Following scoping review guidelines, 21 articles that met inclusion criteria were identified and analyzed. Evidence related to the impact of prostate cancer on work was grouped under three themes: (1) work outcomes after prostate cancer treatment; (2) return to work considerations, and (3) impact of prostate cancer treatment on men's finances. Findings indicate that men's return to work may be more gradual than expected after prostate cancer treatment. Some men may feel pressured by financial stressors and masculine ideals to resume work. Diverse factors including older age and social benefits appear to play a role in shaping men's work-related plans after prostate cancer treatment. The findings provide direction for future research and offer clinicians a synthesis of current knowledge about the challenges men face in resuming work in the aftermath of prostate cancer treatment.

AB  - Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL) is the most prevalent occupational disease in the world. The goal of this study was to review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and preventive measures of ONIHL among workers and provide evidence for the implementation of control measures. Literature studies were identified from the MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using the search terms "noise-induced hearing loss" "prevalence", "pathogenesis", and "preventive measures". The articles reviewed in this report were limited from 2000 to 2020. Articles that were not published in the English language, manuscripts without an abstract, and opinion articles were excluded. After a preliminary screening, all of the articles were reviewed and synthesized to provide an overview of the current status of ONIHL among workers. The mechanism of ONIHL among workers is a complex interaction between environmental and host factors (both genetic and acquired factors). The outcomes of noise exposure are different among individual subjects. Clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the treatment effect of antioxidants on ONIHL. Noise exposure may contribute to temporary or permanent threshold shifts; however, even temporary threshold shifts may predispose an individual to eventual permanent hearing loss. Noise prevention programs are an important preventive measure in reducing the morbidity of ONIHL among workers.

AB  - Purpose of Review This review summarizes emerging evidence for the relationship between food insecurity and eating disorder (ED) pathology, outlines priorities for future research in this area, and comments on considerations for clinical and public health practice. Recent Findings Among adults, food insecurity is cross-sectionally associated with higher levels of overall ED pathology, binge eating, compensatory behaviors, binge-eating disorder, and bulimia nervosa. Evidence for similar relationships among adolescents has been less robust; however, compared to studies of adults, there have been substantially fewer studies conducted in adolescents to date. Emerging evidence consistently indicates that food insecurity is cross-sectionally associated with bulimic-spectrum ED pathology among adults. Findings emphasize the need for ED research to include marginalized populations who have historically been overlooked in the ED field. Much more research is needed to better understand the relationship between food insecurity and ED pathology and to determine effective ways to intervene.

AB  - Internet addiction (IA) has been explored worldwide and involves some features that might harm social, psychological, and functional aspects. The vulnerability of adolescents might result in some addictive behaviors, and the Internet is one of them. The aim of this systematic review was to identify empirical studies that have been done to explore instruments that have been used to assess IA and to verify what variables and comorbidities are related to IA in adolescents, including executive functions, such as attention. To accomplish our aim, a systematic search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. Some inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select the studies and 44 in total were analyzed independently. The results showed that the most used instrument to assess IA is the Young's Internet Addiction Test. A few studies have been developed in the Western world, and most of them have analyzed attention bias in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and non-ADHD groups. Furthermore, other variables have been widely explored in the studies, such as depression, sleeping patterns, body weight, aggressiveness, and other addictive substances.

AB  - Background: Cultural context substantially affects the experience and clinical expression of psychiatric diseases, while cultural factors limit both access to and effectiveness of care, especially for migrant families requiring specific types of services. We conducted a scoping review on psychiatric services adapted to cultural diversity, to compare these models of care to the French Transcultural Psychotherapy model.
   Methods: Systematic electronic search of databases (PubMed and PsycINFO), manual search of archives of journals dealing with transcultural psychiatry, and consultations with international experts, to identify all papers describing clinical models devoted to psychiatric care for migrants, published between January 1990 and October 2018. Narrative synthesis of the included articles.
   Results: The study included 29 papers. The specificities of psychiatric services for migrant families are linked to the host country's migration patterns and citizenship model. In English-speaking countries, specialized services for ethnic minorities offer ethnic matching of the therapist and patient. In Canada, indirect transcultural consultation services have existed since the late 1990s. Australia emphasizes the networking of consultation services and professional training in cultural competence, while the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark) focus management on trauma. In France, psychotherapy services, with flexible numbers of therapists involved according to the situation, have existed since 1990.
   Discussion: Most initiatives place emphasis on training and supervision, in an indirect approach not specifically focused on the patient, or offer cultural matching of patient and therapist. The French transcultural approach, on the contrary, makes the family's culture and its cultural diversity an integral part of the therapy process.

AB  - Objective To perform a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the long-term effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with available strategies for prevention and time to depressive relapse.
   Methods Seven electronic databases were searched up to June 2019. Studies evaluated MBCT for the management of depression-related outcomes and follow-up assessments occurred at 12 months or longer.
   Results Twenty-three publications were included, 17 of which were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data from 14 RCTs including 2077 participants contributed to meta-analysis (MA) and NMA to assess relapse of depression and 13 RCTs with 2017 participants contributed to MA and NMA for time to relapse of depression. NMAs showed statistically significant advantages for MBCT over treatment as usual (TAU) for relapse of depression (RR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98) and for MBCT over TAU and placebo for time to relapse of depression (MBCT vs TAU: HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.88; MBCT vs placebo: HR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.67). Subgroup meta-analysis of relapse of depression by previous number of depressive episodes showed similar results between subgroups. Subgroup meta-analysis by the use or not of booster sessions suggests these may lead to improved effectiveness.
   Conclusions MBCT is more effective than TAU in the long-term in preventing relapse of depression and has statistically significant advantages over TAU and placebo for time to relapse of depression. No statistically significant differences were observed between MBCT and active treatment strategies for rate of relapse or time to relapse of depression.

AB  - In the field of social influences on Theory of Mind (ToM), more research has focused on the role of parents, but less research has examined the impact of siblings on children's social understanding. We review existing research related to what factors might affect sibling-ToM association and how these potential factors affect ToM. Based on the literature review, we propose an integrative model that unites three categories of factors (i.e., sibling structural variables, sibling individual variables, parental intervening variables) that might have effects on the sibling-ToM association and highlights mental-state talks during sibling interactions at the intersection of sibling-related variables and ToM. Furthermore, we propose some issues arising from this review that need to be clarified in future studies. Specifically, we hope to clarify the specific effects of older and younger siblings on children's understanding of human minds, the similarities and differences of sibling-ToM association under different cultural backgrounds, and the impact of family social disadvantage (e.g., lower SES) on the sibling-ToM association. All these works would benefit from the verification, revision, and expansion of our reciprocal influence model for the sibling-ToM association.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for significant global health burden. Effects of TBI can become chronic even following mild injury. There is a need to develop effective therapies to attenuate the damaging effects of TBI and improve recovery outcomes. This literature review using a priori criteria (PROSPERO; CRD42018100623) summarized 43 studies between January 1998 and July 2019 that investigated nutritional interventions (NUT) delivered with the objective of altering neurophysiological (NP) outcomes following TBI. Risk of bias was assessed for included studies, and NP outcomes recorded. The systematic search resulted in 43 of 3,748 identified studies met inclusion criteria. No studies evaluated the effect of a NUT on NP outcomes of TBI in humans. Biomarkers of morphological changes and apoptosis, oxidative stress, and plasticity, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission were the most evaluated NP outcomes across the 43 studies that used 2,897 animals. The risk of bias was unclear in all reviewed studies due to poorly detailed methodology sections. Taking these limitations into account, anti-oxidants, branched chain amino acids, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown the most promising pre-clinical results for altering NP outcomes following TBI. Refinement of pre-clinical methodologies used to evaluate effects of interventions on secondary damage of TBI would improve the likelihood of translation to clinical populations.

AB  - This article provides a systematic review of research articles applying Kansei / Affective Engineering methodologies for the development of Social and Service Robots. We describe relevant concepts and main types of Kansei Engineering methodologies to assist new researchers and practitioners interested in the area. We also summarize the main objectives and findings of eleven peer-reviewed research articles published in relevant conferences and journals. We selected these articles after performing a systematic search in relevant databases for robotics research (Science Direct, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, and Springer Link) and Kansei Engineering (J-STAGE). This search includes studies published in the English language between 1999 and 2019. Findings from observed articles indicate that Kansei Engineering is a suitable paradigm for robot design. Moreover, developers can use Kansei Engineering methodologies to identify and better understand the design aspects enabling social and service robots to be accepted and desired by users. Contributions of articles reviewed include (i) the use of novel approaches for grasping emotional reactions in Human-Robot Interaction experiments and (ii) the proposal of guidelines for designing social and service robots. However, the use of Kansei Engineering methodologies in robotics is still a poorly explored area. Therefore, we describe possible future directions and open challenges.

AB  - In our increasingly service-based world, employees are now, more than ever before, required to manage the emotional demands inherent to client interactions. These emotional demands can be fuelled by emotional display rules that are part of an organisational policy. However, what differentiates client interactions from other circumstances is that not only emotional performance standards should be met but also concurrent cognitive performance standards. In some professions, lives may even depend on the interplay between both kinds of performance. This systematic review is the first to offer a systematic synthesis of the surprisingly limited number of studies on this emotion-cognition relationship (N = 18). This synthesis clearly demonstrates that cognitive performance reduces when individuals are instructed to also modify their emotional expressions (expression focused emotion regulation) concurrently. However, although combinations of emotional and cognitive requirements most likely occur during professional events, only two studies used service simulations and none used real client interactions. Other outcomes of the systematic synthesis make it even more astonishing that the cognitive-emotional performance relationship has escaped the notice of the professional field. The most striking outcome is that emotion regulation is not only getting in the way of parallel but also of subsequent cognitive tasks.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which is caused by the interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors such as second-hand smoke (SHS). The association between postnatal exposure to SHS and ADHD risk in children was still inconclusive. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the definite association. We searched for relevant studies from PubMed, Embase, Ovid, and Web of Science databases up to January 2020. We used random effect models to calculate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses and sensitive analyses were also performed to solve the heterogeneity. According to our inclusion criteria, 9 studies including 6 cross-sectional studies, 2 cohort studies, and 1 case-control study were included in the final analysis. Postnatal exposure to SHS increased the risk of ADHD in children (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.37-1.87). Children who exposed to SHS were found a slight risk for conduct problems (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.00-1.77). Among the studies which used cotinine as a biomarker for SHS exposure, a lower pooled OR (OR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.01, 1.33) was observed between cotinine and ADHD in children. Our meta-analysis results suggested that SHS exposure may be a risk factor for ADHD. We also found that SHS exposure may be associated with some adverse behavioral outcomes. More prospective studies should be conducted to confirm the relationship between SHS exposure and ADHD in children.

AB  - Background: The sudden and drastic changes due to the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic have impacted people's physical and mental health. Clinically-vulnerable older people are more susceptible to severe effects either directly by the COVID-19 infection or indirectly due to stringent social isolation measures. Social isolation and loneliness negatively impact mental health in older adults and may predispose to cognitive decline. People with cognitive impairments may also be at high risk of worsening cognitive and mental health due to the current pandemic. This review provides a summary of the recent literature on the consequences of COVID-19, due to either viral infection or social isolation, on neuropsychiatric symptoms in older adults with and without dementia.
   Methods: A search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science to identify all relevant papers published up to the 7th July 2020. Two independent assessors screened and selected the papers suitable for inclusion. Additional suitable papers not detected by literature search were manually added.
   Results: Fifteen articles were included: 8 focussed on the psychiatric symptoms caused by the COVID-19 infection and 7 investigated the impact of social isolation on older adults' neuropsychiatric symptoms. Four studies included older adults without dementia and 11 included patients with cognitive impairment mainly due to Alzheimer's disease. All studies found that different neuropsychiatric symptoms emerged and/or worsened in older adults with and without dementia. These changes were observed as the consequence of both COVID-19 infection and of the enforced prolonged conditions of social isolation. Cases were reported of viral infection manifesting with delirium at onset in the absence of other symptoms. Delirium, agitation and apathy were the symptoms most commonly detected, especially in people with dementia.
   Conclusion: The available evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has a wide negative impact on the mental well-being of older adults with and without dementia. Viral infection and the consequent social isolation to limit its spreading have a range of neuropsychiatric consequences. Larger and more robustly designed studies are needed to clarify such effects and to assess the long-term implications for the mental health of older adults, and to test possible mitigating strategies.

AB  - Aim The significant increase in international cross-border migrations remains a global public health concern; therefore, the need for migrant-specific evidence-based interventions is critical. We assessed the methodological and reporting quality of systematic reviews (SRs) focused on migrant healthcare interventions. Methods We systematically searched in five electronic databases from 2007 to April 2020 to identify SRs on migrant health. Two independent reviewers assessed risk of bias, methodological and reporting quality in included systematic reviews (SRs) using ROBIS, AMSTAR-2 and PRISMA checklist, respectively. Results We included 57 systematic reviews. The quality in 30 SRs (52.6%) was either low or critically low due to limitations in AMSTAR-2 items 4, 7, 8 and 10-16. The overall risk of bias was high in 23 SRs (40.4%), particularly in domains-data collection and study quality-20 SRs (35.1%), synthesis and findings-19 SRs (33.3%), and study identification and selection 13 SRs (22.8%). The quality of reporting in 36 SRs (63.2%) was moderate, with 19.74 +/- 4.67 items fulfilled. While 19 SRs (33.3%) had 10-18 PRISMA items satisfied. Sixteen SRs (28.1%) reported a research protocol and registration. Conclusions The overall quality of migrant SRs is suboptimal, with critical gaps linked to low protocol registrations, assessment of risk of bias and publication bias, additional analysis of synthesized evidence and available funding. These findings reflect current deficiencies in the development of SR on migrant healthcare.

AB  - Identification of intrinsic brain activity differences and similarities between major depression (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) is necessary. However, results have not yet yielded consistent conclusions. A meta-analysis of whole-brain resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies that explored differences in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) between patients (including MDD and BD) and healthy controls (HCs) was conducted using seed-based d mapping software. Systematic literature search identified 50 studies comparing 1399 MDD patients and 1332 HCs, and 15 studies comparing 494 BD patients and 593 HCs. MDD patients displayed increased ALFF in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC], anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]), bilateral insula extending into the striatum and left supramarginal gyrus and decreased ALFF in the bilateral cerebellum, bilateral precuneus, and left occipital cortex compared with HCs. BD showed increased ALFF in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula extending into the striatum, right SFG, and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and decreased ALFF in the bilateral precuneus, left cerebellum (extending to the occipital cortex), left ACC, and left STG. In addition, MDD displayed increased ALFF in the left lingual gyrus, left ACC, bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate gyrus, and left STG and decreased ALFF in the right insula, right mPFC, right fusiform gyrus, and bilateral striatum relative to BD patients. Conjunction analysis showed increased ALFF in the bilateral insula, mPFC, and decreased ALFF in the left cerebellum in both disorders. Our comprehensive meta-analysis suggests that MDD and BD show a common pattern of aberrant regional intrinsic brain activity which predominantly includes the insula, mPFC, and cerebellum, while the limbic system and occipital cortex may be associated with spatially distinct patterns of brain function, which provide useful insights for understanding the underlying pathophysiology of brain dysfunction in affective disorders, and developing more targeted and efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor dysfunctions including bradykinesia, tremor at rest and motor instability. These symptoms are associated with the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons originating in the substantia nigra pars compacta and projecting to the corpus striatum, and by accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions mainly consisting of aggregated alpha-synuclein, called Lewy bodies. PD is a complex, multifactorial disorder and its pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms such as alpha-synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport, and neuroinflammation. Motor symptoms manifest when there is already an extensive dopamine denervation. There is therefore an urgent need for early biomarkers to apply disease-modifying therapeutic strategies. Visual defects and retinal abnormalities, including decreased visual acuity, abnormal spatial contrast sensitivity, color vision defects, or deficits in more complex visual tasks are present in the majority of PD patients. They are being considered for early diagnosis together with retinal imaging techniques are being considered as non-invasive biomarkers for PD. Dopaminergic cells can be found in the retina in a subpopulation of amacrine cells; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to visual deficits observed in PD patients are still largely unknown. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the retinal abnormalities observed in PD patients and animal models and of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in parkinsonian eyes. We will review the role of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the retina pathology and/or in the onset of visual symptoms in PD suggesting that alpha-synuclein aggregates are harmful for the retina as well as for the brain. Moreover, we will summarize experimental evidence suggesting that the optic nerve pathology observed in PD resembles that seen in mitochondrial optic neuropathies highlighting the possible involvement of mitochondrial abnormalities in the development of PD visual defects. We finally propose that the eye may be considered as a complementary experimental model to identify possible novel disease' pathways or to test novel therapeutic approaches for PD.

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Clinical Key. The annual prevalence of back pain ranged from 30% to 66%, and back injuries and contusions from 4% to 43%. Falls, slips, trips, and overexertion while lifting or carrying patients or instruments ranged from 10% to 56%, with overexertion being the most common injury. Risk factors were predominantly lifting, working in awkward postures, loading patients into the ambulance, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures. Lack of job satisfaction and social support was associated with WRMDs and injuries. EMTs-Ps had the highest rate of worker compensation claim rates compared to other healthcare professionals. Positive ergonomic intervention results included electrically powered stretchers, backboard wheeler, descent control system, and the transfer sling.

KW  - ABUSE
KW  - SYMPTOMS
AB  - Objective:
   Withdrawal from psychoactive medication such as quetiapine is a well-documented phenomenon. Despite the extensive use of quetiapine, there have been few studies into the presence of discontinuation symptoms. We therefore performed a systematic review of published literature for evidence of quetiapine withdrawal or symptoms associated with discontinuation.
   Methods:
   We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Medline, Web of Science, PsycINFO for articles containing the terms 'Quetiapine' AND 'withdraw($)' OR 'discontinue($)'. We included all study types that reported on somatic withdrawal symptoms and had no language restrictions. We excluded studies where there was withdrawal from multiple medications or any other psychoactive substance, or where the only symptoms were psychological such as rebound psychosis or craving.
   Results:
   We included 13 papers, all of which were individual case reports. The quality of the individual case reports was sub-optimal, as assessed by the CARE Case Report Guidelines. There was an association between rapid cessation of quetiapine and onset of somatic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis, irritability, anxiety, dysphoria, sleep disturbance, insomnia, tachycardia, hypertension and dizziness. Three studies also reported the onset of a withdrawal dyskinesia characterised by abnormal choreiform movements as well as confusion and speech disturbance in some cases. However, these findings were limited by the number and quality of case reports identified.
   Conclusion:
   Discontinuation symptoms are an uncommon side effect of quetiapine cessation, which may have clinical implications. Clinicians should therefore be alert to the possibility of quetiapine withdrawal in individuals who present with somatic symptoms or choreiform movements. However, large prospective studies are required to clarify this association.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this systematic review was to address two questions: what is the qualitative evidence for the effects of the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) training, as perceived by adults with mental health difficulties using it? What is the quality of qualitative literature evaluating WRAP? Design/methodology/approach Five electronic reference databases and the EThOS database for unpublished research were systematically searched, as well as two pertinent journals. Study quality was assessed using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria and results analysed using thematic synthesis. Findings Of 73 studies, 12 qualitative papers met inclusion criteria and were generally good quality. Analyses demonstrated expected findings, such as increased understanding and active management of mental health in the context of group processes. Results also highlighted that WRAP training promoted acceptance and improved communication with professionals. Peer delivery of WRAP was highly valued, with contrasting perceptions of peers and professionals evident. Some cultural considerations were raised by participants from ethnic minorities. Research limitations/implications WRAP training participation has positive self-perceived effects beyond those captured by measures of recovery. Broader implications are suggested regarding earlier access to WRAP, professional support and communication between professionals and service users. Recommendations for further research include the relationship between social support and illness self-management and peer-delivered acceptance-based approaches. Multiple time-point qualitative studies could offer insights into WRAP training processes and whether changes are sustained. Originality/value As the first review of qualitative evidence regarding WRAP training, value is offered both through increased understanding of outcomes and also guidance for future research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whole-genome transcription has been measured in peripheral blood samples as a candidate biomarker of inflammation associated with major depressive disorder.
   METHODS: We searched for all case-control studies on major depressive disorder that reported microarray or RNA sequencing measurements on whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Primary datasets were reanalyzed, when openly accessible, to estimate case-control differences and to evaluate the functional roles of differentially expressed gene lists by technically harmonized methods.
   RESULTS: We found 10 eligible studies (N = 1754 depressed cases and N = 1145 healthy controls). Fifty-two genes were called significant by 2 of the primary studies (published overlap list). After harmonization of analysis across 8 accessible datasets (n = 1706 cases, n = 1098 controls), 272 genes were coincidentally listed in the top 3% most differentially expressed genes in 2 or more studies of whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells with concordant direction of effect (harmonized overlap list). By meta-analysis of standardized mean difference across 4 studies of whole-blood samples (n = 1567 cases, n = 954 controls), 343 genes were found with false discovery rate <5% (standardized mean difference meta-analysis list). These 3 lists intersected significantly. Genes abnormally expressed in major depressive disorder were enriched for innate immune-related functions, coded for nonrandom protein-protein interaction networks, and coexpressed in the normative transcriptome module specialized for innate immune and neutrophil functions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative review of existing case-control data provided robust evidence for abnormal expression of gene networks important for the regulation and implementation of innate immune response. Further development of white blood cell transcriptional biomarkers for inflamed depression seems warranted.

AB  - Question Which psychosocial interventions are associated with an improved course and medium-term outcomes of bipolar disorder? Findings In a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 39 randomized clinical trials of adjunctive psychotherapy, there was evidence that family, cognitive behavioral, and psychoeducational therapies were associated with reduced episode recurrence vs treatment as usual in individuals with bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy was associated with greater stabilization of residual symptoms of depression compared with treatment as usual. Meaning This study suggests that outpatients with bipolar disorder receiving pharmacotherapy should also be offered psychosocial treatments that emphasize illness management strategies and enhance coping skills; delivering these components in family or group format may be especially advantageous.
   This systematic review and component network meta-analysis compares the association of manualized psychotherapies and therapy components with the reduction of recurrences and stabilizing symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder.
   Importance Several psychotherapy protocols have been evaluated as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy for patients with bipolar disorder, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness. Objective To use systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare the association of using manualized psychotherapies and therapy components with reducing recurrences and stabilizing symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder. Data Sources Major bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews) and trial registries were searched from inception to June 1, 2019, for randomized clinical trials of psychotherapy for bipolar disorder. Study Selection Of 3255 abstracts, 39 randomized clinical trials were identified that compared pharmacotherapy plus manualized psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, family or conjoint therapy, interpersonal therapy, or psychoeducational therapy) with pharmacotherapy plus a control intervention (eg, supportive therapy or treatment as usual) for patients with bipolar disorder. Data Extraction and Synthesis Binary outcomes (recurrence and study retention) were compared across treatments using odds ratios (ORs). For depression or mania severity scores, data were pooled and compared across treatments using standardized mean differences (SMDs) (Hedges-adjustedgusing weighted pooled SDs). In component network meta-analyses, the incremental effectiveness of 13 specific therapy components was examined. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was illness recurrence. Secondary outcomes were depressive and manic symptoms at 12 months and acceptability of treatment (study retention). Results A total of 39 randomized clinical trials with 3863 participants (2247 of 3693 [60.8%] with data on sex were female; mean [SD] age, 36.5 [8.2] years) were identified. Across 20 two-group trials that provided usable information, manualized treatments were associated with lower recurrence rates than control treatments (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43-0.74). Psychoeducation with guided practice of illness management skills in a family or group format was associated with reducing recurrences vs the same strategies in an individual format (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.94). Cognitive behavioral therapy (SMD, -0.32; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.01) and, with less certainty, family or conjoint therapy (SMD, -0.46; 95% CI, -1.01 to 0.08) and interpersonal therapy (SMD, -0.46; 95% CI, -1.07 to 0.15) were associated with stabilizing depressive symptoms compared with treatment as usual. Higher study retention was associated with family or conjoint therapy (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.82) and brief psychoeducation (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23-0.85) compared with standard psychoeducation. Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that outpatients with bipolar disorder may benefit from skills-based psychosocial interventions combined with pharmacotherapy. Conclusions are tempered by heterogeneity in populations, treatment duration, and follow-up.

AB  - The actions of neuromodulation are thought to mediate the ability of the mammalian brain to dynamically adjust its functional state in response to changes in the environment. Altered neurotransmitter (NT) and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is central to the pathogenesis or treatment of many human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. To reveal the precise mechanisms by which these neurochemicals regulate healthy and diseased neural circuitry, one needs to measure their spatiotemporal dynamics in the living brain with great precision. Here, we discuss recent development, optimization, and applications of optical approaches to measure the spatial and temporal profiles of NT and NM release in the brain using genetically encoded sensors for in vivo studies.

AB  - The brain extracellular space (ECS) is a continuous reticular compartment that lies between the cells of the brain. It is vast in extent relative to its resident cells, yet, at the same time the nano- to micrometer dimensions of its channels and reservoirs are commonly finer than the smallest cellular structures. Our conventional view of this compartment as largely static and of secondary importance for brain function is rapidly changing, and its active dynamic roles in signaling and metabolite clearance have come to the fore. It is further emerging that ECS microarchitecture is highly heterogeneous and dynamic and that ECS geometry and diffusional properties directly modulate local diffusional transport, down to the nanoscale around individual synapses. The ECS can therefore be considered an extremely complex and diverse compartment, where numerous physiological events are unfolding in parallel on spatial and temporal scales that span orders of magnitude, from milliseconds to hours, and from nanometers to centimeters. To further understand the physiological roles of the ECS and identify new ones, researchers can choose from a wide array of experimental techniques, which differ greatly in their applicability to a given sample and the type of data they produce. Here, we aim to provide a basic introduction to the available experimental techniques that have been applied to address the brain ECS, highlighting their main characteristics. We include current gold-standard techniques, as well as emerging cutting-edge modalities based on recent super-resolution microscopy. It is clear that each technique comes with unique strengths and limitations and that no single experimental method can unravel the unknown physiological roles of the brain ECS on its own.

AB  - Aim The evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early intervention for psychosis (EIP) services has motivated their implementation worldwide. However, complex interventions of such EIP services require local adaptations to successfully match population needs and cultural differences. Latin America is a heterogenous region where EIP services are progressively being adopted. Our aim is to map such initiatives in the region with a focus on implementation outcomes. Methods A scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines was conducted. International and regional databases were searched for publications describing EIP programmes in the region. Besides mapping the services, we described implementation outcomes based on the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies Checklist. Results Ten articles describing seven EIP initiatives from the region were found. Four countries were represented: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. The implementation outcomes reporting was heterogenous, although it was possible to ascertain EIP services are feasible and adequate for the region's context. Also, there is some evidence of effectiveness in terms of reducing hospitalizations and improving symptoms. Information about fidelity measures was scarce and there was no information about costs or cost-effectiveness. Conclusions Only a small proportion of Latin American countries have adopted EIP services. Although these programmes seem to be feasible and effective, data on other implementation outcomes, such as fidelity, cultural appropriateness, cost-effectiveness and affordability are not available. This might in part explain why this effective approach has not been yet scaled-up at nationwide levels.

AB  - Objective Recent meta-analyses on dose-response relationships of SSRIs are largely based on indirect evidence. We analyzed RCTs directly comparing different SSRI doses.
   Method Systematic literature search for RCTs. Two raters independently screened articles and extracted data. Across SSRIs, doses defined as low, medium, and high doses, based on drug manufacturers' product monographs, were analyzed in pairwise random-effects meta-analyses and in a sensitivity network meta-analysis with regard to differences in antidepressive efficacy (primary outcome). We also analyzed all direct comparisons of different dosages of specific SSRIs. (Prospero CRD42018081031).
   Results Out of 5333 articles screened, we included 33. Comparisons of dosage groups (low, medium, and high) resulted in only small and clinically non-significant differences for SSRIs as a group, the strongest relating to medium vs low doses (SMD: -0.15 [95%-CI: -0.28; -0.01) and not sustained in a sensitivity analysis. Among different doses of specific SSRIs, no statistically significant trend emerged for efficacy at higher doses, but 60 mg/day fluoxetine are statistically significantly inferior to 20 mg/day. Paroxetine results are inconclusive: 10 mg/day are inferior to higher doses, but 30 and 40 mg/day are inferior to 20 mg/day. Meaningful effects cannot be ruled out for certain drugs and dosages, often investigated in only one trial. Dropout rates increase with dose-particularly due to side effects. Network meta-analyses supported our findings.
   Conclusions There is no conclusive level I or level II evidence of a clinically meaningful dose-response relationship of SSRIs as a group or of single substances. High SSRI doses are not recommended as routine treatment.

AB  - Objectives Bright light therapy (BLT) was reported as an effective adjunctive treatment option for bipolar disorder. Previous meta-analytic study showed that augmentation treatment with light therapy significantly decreased the severity of bipolar depression. However, most of included studies were case-control studies and several of them focused on BLT that was provided in combination with sleep deprivation therapy. Methods In this meta-analysis, we used several electronic databases to search the studies and included only randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies to compare BLT with control experimental groups for treating bipolar depression with pharmacological treatment to clarify the adjunctive efficacy of BLT. We searched the databases of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Clinicaltrials.gov for studies published in English until September 19, 2019. Two researchers conducted the literature screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment independently. The main outcome was the response rate and remission rate. We used the Review Manager 5.3 Software for the meta-analysis. Results Four trials with a total of 190 participants (intervention: 94, control: 96) with bipolar depression were evaluated to gauge the effects of light therapy. The meta-analysis showed risk ratios of 1.78 (95% CI 1.24-2.56,p = .002;I-2 = 17%) demonstrating a significant effect of light therapy in the response rate of bipolar disorder. The meta-analysis shows risk ratios of 2.03 (95% CI 0.48-8.59,p = .34;I-2 = 67%) demonstrating no significant effect of light therapy in the remission rate of patients with bipolar disorder. None of the articles reported any serious adverse effects. Manic switch rate was 1.1% in the light therapy group and 1.2% in the control group. Conclusions Bright light therapy is an effective treatment for reducing depression symptoms among patients with bipolar depression.

AB  - Background Mental health and substance use disorders (SUDs) are the world's leading cause of years lived with disability; in low-and-middle income countries (LIMCs), the treatment gap for SUDs is at least 75%. LMICs face significant structural, resource, political, and sociocultural barriers to scale-up SUD services in community settings. Aim This article aims to identify and describe the different types and characteristics of psychosocial community-based SUD interventions in LMICs, and describe what context-specific factors (policy, resource, sociocultural) may influence such interventions in their design, implementation, and/or outcomes. Methods A narrative literature review was conducted to identify and discuss community-based SUD intervention studies from LMICs. Articles were identified via a search for abstracts on the MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, and PsycINFO databases. A preliminary synthesis of findings was developed, which included a description of the study characteristics (such as setting, intervention, population, target SUD, etc.); thereafter, a thematic analysis was conducted to describe the themes related to the aims of this review. Results Fifteen intervention studies were included out of 908 abstracts screened. The characteristics of the included interventions varied considerably. Most of the psychosocial interventions were brief interventions. Approximately two thirds of the interventions were delivered by trained lay healthcare workers. Nearly half of the interventions targeted SUDs in addition to other health priorities (HIV, tuberculosis, intimate partner violence). All of the interventions were implemented in middle income countries (i.e. none in low-income countries). The political, resource, and/or sociocultural factors that influenced the interventions are discussed, although findings were significantly limited across studies. Conclusion Despite this review's limitations, its findings present relevant considerations for future SUD intervention developers, researchers, and decision-makers with regards to planning, implementing and adapting community-based SUD interventions.

AB  - This article reflects concerns about what may emerge from the United Nations human rights treaty body (TB) review process that began in April 2020. The fear specifically is what the outcome of that review may be and whether the goal of strengthening and/or streamlining TBs will actually result in a less robust state oversight and human rights compliance methodology in the future. Already TBs have been weakened by being granted fewer resources, which causes strains on the system, and by steps to make the procedures easier, less cumbersome, less duplicative, less time-consuming, and less resource-intensive for states. This article maintains, however, that more emphasis ought in fact to be placed on enhancing the resources available to these institutions, and on strengthening their roles in a variety of ways, including by increasing their independence as a means to improve their performance. It claims that if streamlining TBs means reducing what impact these bodies can have, this ought to be avoided. The article also stresses that if the domestic component of the state reporting process is enhanced, and the national follow-up procedures and processes further developed, the TB process will see improvements, both in its functioning and in its role in promoting and protecting human rights in states. It is thus reasoned that the global push to create and promote national reporting mechanisms ought to be supported.

AB  - Background The hospitality industry employs millions of workers and is a key contributor to the US economy. Despite being essential drivers in the industry's success, hotel workers, particularly hotel housekeepers, are exposed to occupational hazards and experience disproportionate rates of injuries and chronic health conditions. Thus there is a significant need for health promotion efforts directed toward these workers. However, little is known about existing interventions targeting their health. Methods We conducted a scoping review to identify and appraise workplace health promotion interventions targeting hotel employees. We performed a scoping review following the framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley (2005). Our literature search process was recorded using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Basic study information was compiled into a matrix table. Study quality was assessed using the template for intervention description and replication. Results Eight unique interventions were identified, occurring at over 30 hotels with participants ranging between 16 and 1207 employees. Though many of the reported health outcomes were not statistically significant, studies reported results with clinical implications, including decreased numbers of injury claims, reduced anxiety, improvements in cardiovascular disease risk indicators, such as body mass index, and increased knowledge among participants. Conclusions This is the first review to interrogate the literature on existing workplace interventions targeting the health of hotel workers. While some studies found significant improvements in health outcomes, few conducted rigorous program evaluation. The results highlight the need for more and effective interventions targeting these at-risk workers.

AB  - Introduction Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a type of central nervous system antibody-mediated disease which affects mainly optic nerves and spinal cord, but may also present with acute brainstem syndrome, acute diencephalic syndrome, and cerebral syndrome with typical brain lesions. One of the most disabling symptoms, diagnosed in 29%-67% of cases, is cognitive dysfunction, with such processes as memory, processing speed, executive function, attention, and verbal fluency being predominantly affected. However, description of cognition in NMOSD patients is still a relatively new area of research. Methods A systematic MEDLINE search was performed to retrieve all studies that investigated cognitive impairment and its clinical correlates in patients with NMOSD. Results We summarize the current knowledge on cognitive impairment profile, neuropsychological tests used to examine NMOSD patients, clinical and demographical variables affecting cognition, and magnetic resonance imaging correlates. We provide a comparison of cognitive profile of patients with multiple sclerosis and NMOSD. Conclusion Patients with NMOSD are at significant risk of cognitive deficits. However, the knowledge of cognitive symptoms in NMOSD and potential modifying interventions is still scarce. Further accumulation of clinical data may facilitate effective therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Exposure assessment is an important factor in all epidemiological research seeking to identify, evaluate, and control health risks. In the military and veteran context, population health research to explore exposure-response links is complicated by the wide variety of environments and hazards encountered during active service, long latency periods, and a lack of information on exposures in potentially vulnerable subgroups. This paper summarizes some key considerations for exposure assessment in long-term health studies of military populations, including the identification of hazards related to military service, characterization of potentially exposed groups, exposure data collection, and assignment of exposures to estimate health risks. Opportunities and future directions for exposure assessment in this field are also discussed.

AB  - Over the past 20 years there has been a great deal of research into those considered to be at risk for developing psychosis. Much has been learned and studies have been encouraging. The aim of this paper is to offer an update of the current status of research on risk for psychosis, and what the next steps might be in examining the progression from CHR to psychosis. Advances have been made in accurate prediction, yet there are some methodological issues in ascertainment, diagnosis, the use of data-driven selection methods and lack of external validation. Although there have been several high-quality treatment trials the heterogeneity of this clinical high-risk population has to be addressed so that their treatment needs can be properly met. Recommendations for the future include more collaborative research programmes, and ensuring they are accessible and harmonized with respect to criteria and outcomes so that the field can continue to move forward with the development of large collaborative consortiums as well as increased funding for multisite projects.

AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have long been seen as control interfaces that translate changes in brain activity, produced either by means of a volitional modulation or in response to an external stimulation. However, recent trends in the BCI and neurofeedback research highlight passive monitoring of a user's brain activity in order to estimate cognitive load, attention level, perceived errors and emotions. Extraction of such higher order information from brain signals is seen as a gateway for facilitation of interaction between humans and intelligent systems. Particularly in the field of robotics, passive BCIs provide a promising channel for prediction of user's cognitive and affective state for development of a user-adaptive interaction. In this paper, we first illustrate the state of the art in passive BCI technology and then provide examples of BCI employment in human-robot interaction (HRI). We finally discuss the prospects and challenges in integration of passive BCIs in socially demanding HRI settings. This work intends to inform HRI community of the opportunities offered by passive BCI systems for enhancement of human-robot interaction while recognizing potential pitfalls.

AB  - Background Environmental contamination by mercury is and will continue to be a serious risk for human health. Pollution of the terrestrial environment is particularly important as it is a place of human life and food production. This publication presents a review of the literature on issues related to mercury pollution of the terrestrial environment: soil and plants and their transformations. Results Different forms of atmospheric Hg may be deposited on surfaces by way of wet and dry processes. These forms may be sequestered within terrestrial compartments or emitted back into the atmosphere, and the relative importance of these processes is dependent on the form of Hg, the surface chemistry, and the environmental conditions. On the land surface, Hg deposition mainly occurs in the oxidized form (Hg2+), and its transformations are associated primarily with the oxidation-reduction potential of the environment and the biological and chemical processes of methylation. The deposition of Hg pollutants on the ground with low vegetation is as 3-5 times lower than that in forests. The estimation of Hg emissions from soil and plants, which occur mainly in the Hg(0)form, is very difficult. Generally, the largest amounts of Hg are emitted from tropical regions, followed by the temperate zone, and the lowest levels are from the polar regions. Areas with vegetation can be ranked according to the size of the emissions as follows: forests > other areas (tundra, savannas, and chaparral) > agricultural areas > grassland ecosystems; areas of land devoid of vegetation emit more Hg than those with plants. In areas with high pollution, such as areas near Hg mines, the Hg content in soil and plants is much higher than in other areas. Conclusions Mercury is recognized as a toxic, persistent, and mobile contaminant; it does not degrade in the environment and becomes mobile because of the volatility of the element and several of its compounds. Atmospheric contamination by mercury continues to be one of the most important environmental problems in the modern world. The general conclusions were drawn from a review of the literature and presented in this paper.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and acceptability of cannabinoids for the treatment of anxiety disorders.
   Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched for randomized trials utilizing cannabinoids for the treatment of adults with anxiety disorders. Primary outcomes were reduction in anxiety disorder symptoms, and study discontinuation due to adverse events. Evidence was synthesized as rate ratios (RRs) and as standardized mean differences (SMDs) using random-effects meta-analyses.
   Results: A total of 14 eligible trials representing 1548 individuals (median age: 33 years; range: 28-44; 66% male) were identified. Cannabinoids reduced anxiety symptoms (SMD = -1.85, 95% CI: -2.61 to -1.09) without causing significant adverse events. Greater efficacy was observed among younger patients (p < 0.01) and with longer treatment (p < 0.01). However, publication bias was substantial, and after correction, the overall anxiolytic effect was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: While cannabinoids may be of potential value in the treatment of anxiety disorders, the routine use of these treatments is not supported by the available evidence after correction for publication bias.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Nanotechnology is a dynamically developing field producing large amounts of nanocompounds that are applied in industry, daily life, and health care. During production, use, and waste these materials could end up in water or soil. Large scale contaminations of our environment are a threat to public health. Pollution can have harmful effects on the immune system, as revealed by numerous studies in humans and other vertebrates. The relative simplicity of invertebrate immune functions offers potentially sensitive and accessible means of monitoring the effects and complex interactions of nanoparticles which ultimately affect host resistance. Among terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates, earthworms and leeches are the "keystone" species to evaluate the health of our ecosystems. In this review we compare the conserved stress and immune responses of these invertebrate model organisms toward nanoparticles. The obtained knowledge provides exciting insights into the conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms of nanomaterial-related toxicity in invertebrates and vertebrates. Understanding the unique characteristics of engineered nanoproducts and their interactions with biological systems in our environment is essential to the safe realization of these materials in novel biomedical applications.
   Earthworms and leeches are sentinel animals that represent the annelid phylum within terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, respectively. One early stress signal in these organisms is related to innate immunity, but how nanomaterials affect it is poorly characterized. In this survey, we compare the latest literature on earthworm and leeches with examples of their molecular/cellular responses to inorganic (silver nanoparticles) and organic (carbon nanotubes) nanomaterials. A special focus is placed on the role of annelid immunocytes in the evolutionarily conserved antioxidant and immune mechanisms and protein corona formation and probable endocytosis pathways involved in nanomaterial uptake. Our summary helps to realize why these environmental sentinels are beneficial to study the potential detrimental effects of nanomaterials.

AB  - Objective We used the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework to conduct a systematic review of external validity reporting in integrated primary care (IPC) interventions for mental health concerns. Methods We searched Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials, and relevant literature to identify publications from 1998 to 2018 reporting on open, randomized, or quasi-randomized trials of IPC interventions that targeted child (ages 0-18years) psychological symptoms. For each publication, we extracted the information reported in each RE-AIM domain and calculated the proportion of the total studies reviewed. Results Thirty-nine publications describing 25 studies were included in the review. Publications rarely reported some indicators of external validity, including the representativeness of participants (12%), rate of adoption clinics or providers (16%), cost of implementation (8%), or evidence of maintenance (16%). Few studies reported on key pragmatic factors such as cost or organizational change processes related to implementation and maintenance. Strengths of some studies included comparisons of multiple active treatments, use of tailorable interventions, and implementation in "real world" settings. Conclusions Although IPC interventions appear efficacious under research conditions, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the degree to which they reach and engage target recipients, what factors impact adoption and implementation of IPC interventions by clinicians, how fidelity can be maintained over time, and cost-effectiveness. Pediatric IPC researchers should embrace dissemination and implementation science methods to balance internal and external validity concerns moving forward.

AB  - Chemical modifications of RNA molecules have gained increasing attention since evidence emerged for their substantive roles in a range of biological processes, such as the stability and translation of mRNA transcripts. More than 150 modifications have been identified in different organisms to date, collectively known as the 'epitranscriptome', with 6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), 5-methylcytidine (m(5)C), pseudouridine and N1-methyladenosine (m(1)A) the most extensively investigated. Although we are just beginning to elucidate the roles of these modifications in cellular functions, there is already evidence for their dysregulation in diseases such as cancer and neumdevelopmental disorders. There is currently more limited knowledge regarding how environmental exposures affect the epitranscriptome and how this may mediate disease risk, but evidence is beginning to emerge. Here, we review the current evidence for the impact of environmental exposures such as benzo[a]pyrene, bisphenol A, pesticides, metals and nanoparticles upon RNA modifications and the expression of their 'writers' (methyl transferases), 'erasers' (demethylases) and `readers'. We discuss future directions of the field and identify areas of particular promise and consider the technical challenges that are faced.

AB  - Several epidemiological studies have evaluated the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) of ambient air pollution but the results were controversial. We therefore conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis to investigate the associations between short-term exposure to air pollutants and FeNO level. We searched PubMed and Web of Science and included a total of 27 articles which focused on associations between ambient air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O-3)) exposure and the change of FeNO. Random effect model was used to calculate the percent change of FeNO in association with a 10 or 1 mu g/m(3) increase in air pollutants exposure concentrations. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in short-term PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 exposure was associated with a 3.20% (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.11%, 5.29%), 2.25% (95%CI: 1.51%, 2.99%),4.90% (95%CI: 1.98%, 7.81%), and 8.28% (95%CI: 3.61%, 12.59%) change in FeNO, respectively. A 1 mu g/m(3) increase in shortterm exposure to BC was associated with 3.42% (95%CI: 1.34%, 5.50%) change in FeNO. The association between short-term exposure to O-3 and FeNO level was insignificant (P>0.05). Future studies are warranted to investigate the effect of multiple pollutants, different sources and composition of air pollutants on airway inflammation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The key elements of this phenomenon are chronic stress, neuroinflammation triggering microglial polarization, microglial memory and their connection to neurodegeneration. We review the mediating mechanisms which may function as early biomarkers of increased susceptibility for neurodegeneration. Can we devise novel early life modifying interventions to steer developmental trajectories to their optimum?

AB  - Women in low- and middle-income countries have high rates of perinatal depression. As smartphones become increasingly accessible around the world, there is an opportunity to explore innovative mHealth tools for the prevention, screening, and management of perinatal depression. We completed a scoping review of the literature pertaining to the use of mobile phone technologies for perinatal depression in low-and middle-income countries. PubMed CINHAL, and Google Scholar databases were searched, generating 423 results. 12 articles met our inclusion criteria. Two of the 12 articles reviewed mobile phone applications. The remaining 9 articles were study protocols or descriptive/intervention studies. Our results reveal that minimal literature is currently available on the use of mobile health for perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries. We found four articles that present the results of an intervention that were delivered through mobile phones for the treatment of perinatal depressive symptoms and an additional qualitative study describing the perceptions of mothers receiving cognitive behavioral therapy via telephones. These studies demonstrated that depressive symptoms improved after the interventions. There is potential to improve the quality of mHealth interventions, specifically mobile phone applications for perinatal depressive symptoms and depression, through meaningful collaborative work between healthcare professionals and application developers.

AB  - Marine noise pollution (MNP) can cause a multitude of impacts on many organisms, but information is often scattered and general outcomes difficult to assess. We have reviewed the literature on MNP impacts on Mediterranean fish and invertebrates. Both chronic and acute MNP produced by various human activities e.g. maritime traffic, pile driving, air guns were found to cause detectable effects on intra-specific communication, vital processes, physiology, behavioral patterns, health status and survival. These effects on individuals can extend to inducing populationand ecosystem-wide alterations, especially when MNP impacts functionally important species, such as keystone predators and habitat forming species. Curbing the threats of MNP in the Mediterranean Sea is a challenging task, but a variety of measures could be adopted to mitigate MNP impacts. Successful measures will require more accurate information on impacts and that effective management of MNP really becomes a priority in the policy makers' agenda.

AB  - The association between schizophrenia (SZ) and uric acid (UA) levels has been suggested for many years, but without solid evidence. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all case-control studies examining the serum and plasma UA levels in SZ subjects in comparison to those in healthy controls. Relevant studies published before October 29, 2018, were searched in the main electronic databases, and 17 studies were finally included into the meta-analysis after screening with the criteria. Our results revealed that there were no statistically significant differences of the UA levels between SZ subjects and healthy controls. Further subgroup analyses of the antipsychotic status reported the same finding. Subgroup analyses of clinical status showed that UA levels were decreased in subjects with first episode psychosis (FEP). The subgroup analyses of gender and ethnicity demonstrated that UA levels were decreased in male subjects and in Americans with SZ. Overall, these findings strengthen the clinical evidence that FEP is accompanied by increased oxidative stress response. Reduced UA levels may be a potential risk factor for SZ in male and in the Americans. However, whether there is a causal relationship between the reduced UA levels and the development of SZ deserves further investigation.

AB  - Overweight and obesity have become a global epidemic and concern, and contributed to at least 4.0 million deaths each year worldwide. However, current evidence regarding the impact of air pollution on body weight status remains inconsistent. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants on body weight status in adults. Three databases were searched up to Dec 31, 2019 for articles investigating the association of gaseous (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) and particulate (diameter <= 10 mu m or <= 2.5 mu m) air pollutants with body weight status. Random effect models were used to estimate the pooled odds ratios (ORs), regression coefficients (beta) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) associated with air pollution. Among twelve studies that were eligible in the systematic review, ten were used to estimate the pooled effect size, and most of them were cross-sectional studies. We identified that ambient air pollution had adverse effects on body weight status. For example, elevated PM2.5 and O-3 were associated with higher level of body mass index, with the pooled b (95% CIs) of 0.34 (0.30-0.38) and 0.21 (0.17-0.24) per 10 mg/m(3) increment, respectively. In addition, increased NO2, SO2 and O-3 were associated with higher risk of having overweight/obesity, with the corresponding pooled OR (95% CI) of 1.13 (1.01-1.26), 1.04 (1.01-1.06) and 1.07 (1.02-1.13) per 10 mg/m(3) increment. Overall, air pollution is a potential risk factor for body weight status in adults, and more high-quality studies, especially prospective studies from severely polluted regions, are warranted for comprehensive understanding of its health effects.

AB  - Background: Children and adolescents with obesity experience social discrimination which can contribute to increased depression, reduced self-esteem and poor body image. Physical activity improves these psychological outcomes but its ability to affect such changes in the context of pediatric obesity treatment is unknown. The primary aim of this systematic review was to determine how structured physical activity interventions, in the context of pediatric obesity treatment, affect changes in depression, self-esteem and body image.
   Methods: A systematic search of published literature up to June 2019 was undertaken using electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and PsychINFO. Eligible studies included a supervised moderate-to-vigorous physical activity intervention conducted at least weekly in free-living children or adolescents (<= 18 years) with overweight or obesity, reporting depression, self-esteem and/or body image pre- and post-intervention using validated tools. Meta-analysis, using random effects, was used to combine outcome data and moderator analysis conducted to identify intervention characteristics that may influence outcomes.
   Results: Of 3078 articles screened, 29 studies were included in the review. Overall, structured physical activity interventions were associated with reduced depression (SMD [SE] -0.34 [0.06], p < 0.001, I-2 = 77%), increased self-esteem (0.34 [0.04], p < 0.001, I-2 = 78%) and improved body image (0.47 [0.05], p < 0.001, I-2 = 56%). Age, weight-related changes and inclusion of a nutrition or behavioural component did not significantly influence findings, while school settings and longer interventions produced the greatest self-esteem improvements.
   Conclusions: Structured physical activity interventions, in the context of pediatric obesity treatment, improve depression, self-esteem and body image.

AB  - Evidence suggests that excessive screen time in early childhood is related to children's physical and mental health. This study aimed to review the relationships between screen media use and several health indicators in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. A systematic search was conducted by two independent reviewers on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library to identify the eligible studies, with an end date of 13 August 2019. Included studies (published in English) were peer-reviewed and met the determinate population (children aged 0-7 years with screen media exposure and related health outcomes). The AHRQ, NOS, and the Cochrane Handbook were used to evaluate the cross-sectional study, cohort study, and RCT, respectively. A meta-analysis and narrative syntheses were employed separately. Eighty studies (23 studies for meta-analysis) met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Strong evidence of the meta-analysis suggested that excessive screen time was associated with overweight/obesity and shorter sleep duration among toddlers and preschoolers. Excessive screen use was associated with various health indicators in physical, behavioral, and psychosocial aspects. Better-quality research on newer media devices, on various kinds of contents in young children, and on dose-response relationships between excessive screen use and health indicators are needed to update recommendations of screen use.

AB  - Objective: The physical activity (PA) sector has an important role to play within the treatment of mental illness (MI). This review aims to summarize the literature examining healthcare professionals' (HCPs) perceptions related to the PA sector to: 1) develop an understanding of the potential factors influencing collaboration with the PA sector in the promotion of PA for MI; and 2) identify gaps and areas for further research.
   Methods: A structured search of PsycInfo, PubMed, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus using terms related to key concepts such as 'mental illness', 'health professional', and 'physical activity' was performed up until February 24, 2020. Studies were included if they contained empirical findings describing HCPs' perceptions related to the PA sector within the context of PA promotion for MI. Documents were coded by six reviewers for study characteristics, design, professional, mental health condition, and findings.
   Results: Fifty-one documents were included. Attitudes and beliefs were mainly positive with respect to PA sector involvement in the treatment of MI. Other HCPs have expressed an interest in collaboration with PA professionals and existing collaborative efforts have generally been viewed as benefitting other HCPs and individuals with MI; however, limitations in the findings preclude definitive claims. Some doubts about the value of collaborative efforts and tensions in role delineation were noted. Some HCPs were unclear about the role and scope of practice of PA professionals, lacked knowledge about existing referral options, expressed confusion about referral criteria and processes, and described uncertainty or limitations regarding PA professionals' training and experience with MI. Findings were limited and equivocal on the point of PA professionals' competencies to promote PA for MI and sparse research has considered views regarding PA professionals' curriculum. Collaborative practices were uncommon, and few studies examined correlates or determinants of collaboration.
   Conclusion: The literature examining health professionals' views of collaboration with the PA sector in mental health contexts is limited. While this review identified several issues consistent with the broader literature examining collaborative practice, there remains a need for focused inquiry into barriers, correlates, and de terminants using established behavioural theories and models of collaboration. The development of future curriculum targeting PA professionals' mental health competencies could benefit from a multidisciplinary perspective.

AB  - This systematic review evaluates the existing literature about medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) in novice and recreational runners. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and CINAHL databases were searched until July 2020. Studies covering risk factors, diagnostic procedures, treatment methods and time to recovery of MTSS in novice and recreational runners were selected. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included. The risk factors of MTSS are mainly intrinsic and include higher pelvic tilt in the frontal plane, peak internal rotation of the hip, navicular drop and foot pronation, among others. Computed tomography (CT) and pressure algometry may be valid instruments to corroborate the presence of this injury and confirm the diagnosis. Regarding treatment procedures, arch-support foot orthoses are able to increase contact time, normalize foot pressure distribution and similarly to shockwave therapy, reduce pain. However, it is important to take into account the biases and poor methodological quality of the included studies, more research is needed to confirm these results.

Previous systematic reviews provided support for the efficacy and effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) but it's unknown of reviews that comprehensively assess values interventions with a focus on examining the specific effects of working with values or meaning in life in a wide variety of settings, populations and methodological designs. The goal of this study is to investigate empirical interventions that utilizes values as conceptualized by ACT. Systematic searches in 5 databases were performed up to April 2020. For inclusion, the intervention study must have targeted values process as conceptualized by ACT. Systematic reviews, theoretical or conceptual papers were excluded. Analyzed data were publication year, language, country, number and description of participants, mean age, sample origin, outcome variables, study design and quality and overall results. Seventeen studies were identified. Results show a broad scope of research methods, in a variety of settings and populations. According to reported results, values interventions had the desired effect on the outcome variable.

AB  - Background and objectives: Suicidal behaviour has been a persistent concern in medical as well as general settings. Many psychotherapeutic approaches have tried to address suicidal behaviour in different ways. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have garnered much attention in the last decade because of their treatment efficacy. This systematic review aimed to examine evidence-based research regarding the effectiveness of MBIs as a psychotherapy intervention on suicidality and to deliver suggestions that might help future research. Method: The identification of literature was made through an extensive search of the electronic databases, to extract studies relating to the efficacy of MBIs on addressing suicidal behaviour. Additional researches based on library sources were searched manually. The studies' selection was based on a pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as the quality of the studies. Results: The present review helped us identify 13 studies, including six randomised controlled trials, two controlled studies and five pre-post observational studies. The findings reported in the studies were mostly favourable to MBIs as an effective intervention strategy for suicidal behaviour. Conclusion: MBIs show promising effects as an intervention for suicidal behaviour. However, large scale, high-quality trials with active control, and long term intervention efficacy studies are needed to understand the mechanisms through which MBIs reduce suicidal behaviour.

AB  - Question How consistently are psychosocial interventions associated with changes in immune system function, and which immunologic, demographic, or clinical factors moderate these associations? Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 56 unique randomized clinical trials and 4060 participants, psychosocial interventions were associated with positive changes in immunity over time, including improvements in beneficial immune system function and decreases in harmful immune function that persisted for at least 6 months following treatment for participants randomly assigned to a psychosocial intervention vs a control group. These associations were most reliable for cognitive behavior therapy and multiple or combined interventions and for studies that assessed proinflammatory cytokines or markers. Meaning These findings suggest that psychosocial interventions may enhance immune system function and may thus represent a viable strategy for improving immune-related health.
   Importance Recent estimates suggest that more than 50% of all deaths worldwide are currently attributable to inflammation-related diseases. Psychosocial interventions may represent a potentially useful strategy for addressing this global public health problem, but which types of interventions reliably improve immune system function, under what conditions, and for whom are unknown. Objective To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in which we estimated associations between 8 different psychosocial interventions and 7 markers of immune system function, and examined 9 potential moderating factors. Data Sources PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were systematically searched from February 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, for all relevant RCTs published through December 31, 2018. Study Selection Eligible RCTs included a psychosocial intervention, immune outcome, and preintervention and postintervention immunologic assessments. Studies were independently examined by 2 investigators. Of 4621 studies identified, 62 were eligible and 56 included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were extracted and analyzed from January 1, 2019, to July 29, 2019. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed. Data were extracted by 2 investigators who were blind to study hypotheses and analyses, and were then analyzed using robust variance estimation. Analysis included 8 psychosocial interventions (behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, cognitive behavior therapy [CBT], CBT plus additive treatment or mode of delivery that augmented the CBT, bereavement or supportive therapy, multiple or combined interventions, other psychotherapy, and psychoeducation), 7 immune outcomes (proinflammatory cytokine or marker levels, anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, antibody levels, immune cell counts, natural killer cell activity, viral load, and other immune outcomes), and 9 moderating factors (intervention type, intervention format, intervention length, immune marker type, basal vs stimulated markers, immune marker measurement timing, disease state or reason for treatment, age, and sex). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary a priori outcomes were pretest-posttest-control (ppc) group effect sizes (ppc g) for the 7 immunologic outcomes investigated. Results Across 56 RCTs and 4060 participants, psychosocial interventions were associated with enhanced immune system function (ppc g = 0.30, 95% CI, 0.21-0.40; t(50.9) = 6.22; P < .001). Overall, being randomly assigned to a psychosocial intervention condition vs a control condition was associated with a 14.7% (95% CI, 5.7%-23.8%) improvement in beneficial immune system function and an 18.0% (95% CI, 7.2%-28.8%) decrease in harmful immune system function over time. These associations persisted for at least 6 months following treatment and were robust across age, sex, and intervention duration. These associations were most reliable for CBT (ppc g = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.19-0.47; t(27.2) = 4.82; P < .001) and multiple or combined interventions (ppc g = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.17-0.88; t(5.7) = 3.63; P = .01), and for studies that assessed proinflammatory cytokines or markers (ppc g = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.19-0.48; t(25.6) = 4.70; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that psychosocial interventions are reliably associated with enhanced immune system function and may therefore represent a viable strategy for improving immune-related health.
   This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials estimates the association between psychosocial interventions and immune system function and identifies factors moderating this association.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) pollution has become a global environmental concern. MPs alone and in combination with pollutants can potentially cause significant harm to organisms and human beings. Weathering of MPs under various environmental stresses increases the uncertainty of their environmental fates. Compared with field surveys, laboratory simulation experiments are appropriate to simplify the research procedures and investigate the mechanisms. In this review, the effects of abrasion, solar radiation, chemical and thermal oxidation, microbial adhesion and colonization, and other environmental factors on the MPs and the relative laboratory simulation methods were summarized and discussed. Photo-oxidation and abrasion are the most appliable methods due to easy operation and adjustable weathering degree. Furthermore, the structural and components changes in weathering process and the applied characterization methods were generalized. In addition, one of important environmental behaviors, adsorption of the weathered MPs towards two typical pollutants was analyzed. Finally, three priorities for research were proposed. This paper conducts systematic summarized of the MPs weathering process and provides a reference for future studies to accurately determine the environmental risks of weathering MPs.

AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) is a halogen-containing organophosphorus chemical that is widely employed in various consumer products with a high production volume. As an additive flame retardant (FR), TDCPP tends to be released into the environment through multiple routes. It is ubiquitous in environmental media, biotic matrixes, and humans, and thus is deemed to be an emerging environmental contaminant. To date, significant levels of TDCPP and its primary diester metabolite, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, have been detected in human samples of seminal plasma, breast milk, blood plasma, placenta, and urine, thereby causing wide concern about the potential human health effects resulting from exposure to this chemical. Despite the progress in research on TDCPP over the past few years, we are still far from fully understanding the environmental behavior and health risks of this emerging contaminant. Thus, this paper critically reviews the environmental occurrence, exposure, and risks posed by TDCPP to organisms and human health among the literature published in the last decade. It has been demonstrated that TDCPP induces acute-, nerve-, developmental-, reproductive-, hepatic-, nephron-, and endocrine-disrupting toxicity in animals, which has caused increasing concern worldwide. Simultaneously, TDCPP induces cytotoxicity by increasing the formation of reactive oxygen species and inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress in multiple human cell lines in vitro, and also causes endocrine-disrupting effects, including reproductive dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes, according to human epidemiology studies. This review not only provides a better understanding of the behavior of this emerging contaminant in the environment, but also enhances the comprehension of the health risks posed by TDCPP exposure to ecosystems and humans.

AB  - BackgroundBehavioural science can play a critical role in combatting the effects of an infectious disease outbreak or public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The current paper presents a synthesis of review literature discussing the application of behaviour change theories within an infectious disease and emergency response context, with a view to informing infectious disease modelling, research and public health practice.MethodsA scoping review procedure was adopted for the searches. Searches were run on PubMed, PsychInfo and Medline with search terms covering four major categories: behaviour, emergency response (e.g., infectious disease, preparedness, mass emergency), theoretical models, and reviews. Three further top-up reviews was also conducted using Google Scholar. Papers were included if they presented a review of theoretical models as applied to understanding preventative health behaviours in the context of emergency preparedness and response, and/or infectious disease outbreaks.ResultsThirteen papers were included in the final synthesis. Across the reviews, several theories of behaviour change were identified as more commonly cited within this context, specifically, Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behaviour, and Protection Motivation Theory, with support (although not universal) for their effectiveness in this context. Furthermore, the application of these theories in previous primary research within this context was found to be patchy, and so further work is required to systematically incorporate and test behaviour change models within public health emergency research and interventions.ConclusionOverall, this review identifies a range of more commonly applied theories with broad support for their use within an infectious disease and emergency response context. The Discussion section details several key recommendations to help researchers, practitioners, and infectious disease modellers to incorporate these theories into their work. Specifically, researchers and practitioners should base future research and practice on a systematic application of theories, beginning with those reported herein. Furthermore, infectious disease modellers should consult the theories reported herein to ensure that the full range of relevant constructs (cognitive, emotional and social) are incorporated into their models. In all cases, consultation with behavioural scientists throughout these processes is strongly recommended to ensure the appropriate application of theory.

AB  - Objective: To perform an updated and comprehensive meta-analysis on the risks of adverse perinatal outcomes in children whose mothers received antidepressants during pregnancy.
   Methods: A systematic literature search of several databases was conducted through December 2018 to identify relevant studies. Risk estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the source of heterogeneity and test the robustness.
   Results: Forty-eight cohort and 6 case-control studies were included. In cohort studies, children whose mothers received antidepressants during pregnancy had higher risks of preterm birth (RR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.37, 1.90), low birth weight (RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.80), and admissions to neonatal intensive care unit (RR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.38, 1.85) when compared with children born by depressed but untreated pregnant women. The risks of spontaneous abortions (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.29, 1.73), large for gestational age (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.20), stillbirths (RR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.32), low Apgar score at 5 min (RR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.42, 2.56), and neonatal convulsions (RR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.56, 2.48) increased in children whose mothers received antidepressants during pregnancy when compared with children born by healthy pregnant women.
   Conclusion: Compared with children whose mothers did not receive antidepressants during pregnancy, children whose mothers received antidepressants during pregnancy had increased risks of adverse perinatal outcomes. Further research on the dose of antidepressants is needed.

AB  - Chronic pain (pain lasting for >3 months) decreases patient quality of life and even occupational abilities. It can be controlled by treatment, but often persists even after management. To properly control pain, its underlying mechanisms must be determined. This review outlines the role of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in chronic pain. The mesolimbic system, a neural circuit, delivers dopamine from the ventral tegmental area to neural structures such as the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala. It controls executive, affective, and motivational functions. Chronic pain patients suffer from low dopamine production and delivery in this system. The volumes of structures constituting the mesolimbic system are known to be decreased in such patients. Studies on administration of dopaminergic drugs to control chronic pain, with a focus on increasing low dopamine levels in the mesolimbic system, show that it is effective in patients with Parkinson's disease, restless legs syndrome, fibromyalgia, dry mouth syndrome, lumbar radicular pain, and chronic back pain. However, very few studies have confirmed these effects, and dopaminergic drugs are not commonly used to treat the various diseases causing chronic pain. Thus, further studies are required to determine the effectiveness of such treatment for chronic pain.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between parental diabetes mellitus and the risk of ADHD in offspring. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to May 31, 2019. Thirteen observational studies containing 5,052,736 participants were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of the studies using predefined standard procedures. Random-effects model were used. We found that maternal pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring (odds ratio [OR]: 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.31-1.50) in adjusted analyses. Increased risks of ADHD in offspring were also observed among those with maternal preexisting type 1 diabetes (T1D) (OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.27-1.52) and paternal T1D (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) in adjusted analyses. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings. Future studies should use robust designs to address whether the association with parental diabetes mellitus is causal.

AB  - Exposure to Plant Protection Products, PPPs, (fungicides, herbicides and insecticides) is a significant stressor for bees and other pollinators, and has recently been the focus of intensive debate and research. Specifically, exposure through contaminated pollen and nectar is considered pivotal, as it presents the highest risk of PPP exposure across all bee species. However, the actual risk that multiple PPP residues might pose to non-target species is difficult to assess due to the lack of clear evidence of their actual concentrations. To consolidate the existing knowledge of field-realistic residues detected in pollen and nectar directly collected from plants, we performed a systematic literature review of studies over the past 50 years (1968-2018). We found that pollen was the matrix most frequently evaluated and, of the compounds investigated, the majority were detected in pollen samples. Although the overall most studied category of PPPs were the neonicotinoid insecticides, the compounds with the highest median concentrations of residues in pollen were: the broad spectrum carbamate carbofuran (1400 ng/g), the fungicide and nematicide iprodione (524 ng/g), and the organophosphate insecticide dimethoate (500 ng/g). In nectar, the highest median concentration of PPP residues detected were dimethoate (1595 ng/g), chlorothalonil (76 ng/g), and the insecticide phorate (53.5 ng/g). Strong positive correlation was observed between neonicotinoid residues in pollen and nectar of cultivated plant species. The maximum concentrations of several compounds detected in nectar and pollen were estimated to exceed the LD50 , for honey bees, bumble bees and four solitary bee species, by several orders of magnitude. However, there is a paucity of information for the biggest part of the world and there is an urgent need to expand the range of compounds evaluated in PPP studies.

AB  - The world is currently struggling to face the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), and many countries have imposed lockdowns and recommended quarantine to limit both the spread of the virus and overwhelming demands for medical care. Direct implications include the disruption of work routines, boredom, depression, increased calorie consumption, and other similar harmful effects. The present narrative review article briefly analyzes the preliminary effects of the quarantine lifestyle from the standpoint of dietary habits. In six different databases, we searched for original articles up to 10 August 2020, assessing eating habits among populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and recorded any change in the intake of major food categories, as well as changes in body weight. The research strategy yielded 364 articles, from which we selected 12 articles that fitted our goal. Our preliminary findings revealed a sharp rise of carbohydrates sources consumption, especially those with a high glycemic index (i.e., homemade pizza, bread, cake, and pastries), as well as more frequent snacks. A high consumption of fruits and vegetables, and protein sources, particularly pulses, was also recorded, although there was no clear peak of increase in the latter. Data concerning the consumption of junk foods lacked consistency, while there was a decreased alcohol intake and fresh fish/seafood consumption. As a possible connection, people gained body weight. Therefore, in the realistic perspective of a continuing global health emergency situation, timely preventive measures are needed to counteract obesity-related behaviors in the long-term, so as to prevent further health complications.

AB  - This systematic review examined the associations of personality traits with cognitive failures and cognitive complaints across the adult lifespan. We first present three conceptual models (cognitive abilities, mental processes, and reporting bias) that could explain why personality is related to such behaviors. We then conducted five separate meta-analyses with 10-17 cross-sectional samples (N= 7,642 - 10,564) that were identified through a systematic literature search following the MOOSE guidelines. Higher neuroticism (r= .39, 95% CI [0.32, 0.45]) and lower conscientiousness (r= -.36, 95% CI [-.42, -.29]) were related to more cognitive failures and complaints. Lower scores on the remaining traits were also associated with more cognitive failures and complaints, yet to a weaker extent (extraversion:r= -.14, 95% CI [-.20, -.08]; openness:r= -.07, 95% CI [-.11, -.03]; agreeableness:r= -.13, 95% CI [-.21, -.05]). With the current empirical evidence, it is not possible to tell which of the three conceptual models explains how much of the associations. For neuroticism, there is more support for the mental processes than the reporting bias model, but more research is needed to fully test mechanistic models. We provide several suggestions for future research to address existing limitations of the literature on personality and cognitive failures and complaints.

AB  - The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was initially considered to be part of the endocrine system regulating water and electrolyte balance, systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, and cardiovascular homeostasis. It was later discovered that intracrine and local forms of RAS exist in the brain apart from the endocrine RAS. This brain-specific RAS plays essential roles in brain homeostasis by acting mainly through four angiotensin receptor subtypes; AT(1)R, AT(2)R, MasR, and AT(4)R. These receptors have opposing effects; AT(1)R promotes vasoconstriction, proliferation, inflammation, and oxidative stress while AT(2)R and MasR counteract the effects of AT(1)R. AT(4)R is critical for dopamine and acetylcholine release and mediates learning and memory consolidation. Consequently, aging-associated dysregulation of the angiotensin receptor subtypes may lead to adverse clinical outcomes such as Alzheimer's disease and frailty via excessive oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, microglial polarization, and alterations in neurotransmitter secretion. In this article, we review the brain RAS from this standpoint. After discussing the functions of individual brain RAS components and their intracellular and intracranial locations, we focus on the relationships among brain RAS, aging, frailty, and specific neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment, through oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and vascular dysfunction. Finally, we discuss the effects of RAS-modulating drugs on the brain RAS and their use in novel treatment approaches.

AB  - We first provide a critical review of the existing findings on bilingualism as a contributor to cognitive reserve from moderator-mediator warranting cause-effect research conclusions. We next address the question of direct or indirect effects between bilingualism and neurocognitive protective factors influencing the associated age-related mental deficits. The existing findings support bilingualism as a predictor and as a moderator. Third, we propose cognitive reserve models of bilingualism describing analytical approaches that allow testing of these models and hypotheses related to path strength and causal relationships between predictors, moderators, and mediators. Lastly and most importantly, we suggest using large datasets availableviaopen repositories. This can aid in the testing of theoretical models, clarifying the roles of moderators and mediators, and assessing the research viability of multi-causal paths that can influence cognitive reserve. Creating collaborative datasets to test these models would greatly advance our field and identify critical variables in the study of the bilingual aging brain.

AB  - Social engineering cyberattacks are a major threat because they often prelude sophisticated and devastating cyberattacks. Social engineering cyberattacks are a kind of psychological attack that exploits weaknesses in human cognitive functions. Adequate defense against social engineering cyberattacks requires a deeper understanding of what aspects of human cognition are exploited by these cyberattacks, why humans are susceptible to these cyberattacks, and how we can minimize or at least mitigate their damage. These questions have received some amount of attention, but the state-of-the-art understanding is superficial and scattered in the literature. In this paper, we review human cognition through the lens of social engineering cyberattacks. Then, we propose an extended framework of human cognitive functions to accommodate social engineering cyberattacks. We cast existing studies on various aspects of social engineering cyberattacks into the extended framework, while drawing a number of insights that represent the current understanding and shed light on future research directions. The extended framework might inspire future research endeavor toward a new sub-field that can be calledCybersecurity Cognitive Psychology, which tailors or adapts principles of Cognitive Psychology to the cybersecurity domain while embracing new notions and concepts that are unique to the cybersecurity domain.

AB  - Biogenic reefs are known worldwide to play a key role in benthic ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning at every level, from shallow to deeper waters. Unfortunately, several stressors threaten these vulnerable systems. The widespread presence of marine litter represents one of these. The harmful effects of marine litter on several organisms are known so far. However, only in the last decade, there was increasingly scientific and public attention on the impacts on reef organisms and habitats caused by litter accumulating on the seafloor. This review aims to synthesize literature and discuss the state of current knowledge on the interactions between marine litter and reef organisms in a strongly polluted basin, the Mediterranean Sea. The multiple impacts (e.g., entanglement, ghost-fishing, coverage, etc.) of litter on reef systems, the list of species impacted, and the main litter categories were identified, and a map of the knowledge available so far on this topic was provided. Seventy-eight taxa resulted impacted by marine litter on Mediterranean reefs, and the majority belonged to the phylum Cnidaria (41%), including endangered species like the red coral (CoraNum rubrum) and the madrepora coral (Madrepora oculata). Entanglement, caused mainly by abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG), was the most frequent impact, playing a detrimental effect mainly on coralligenous arborescent species and cold-water corals (CWCs). The information was spatially heterogeneous, with some areas almost uncovered by scientific studies (e.g., the Aegean-Levantine Sea and the Southern Mediterranean Sea). Although many legal and policy frameworks have been established to tackle this issue [e.g., marine strategy framework directive (MSFD) and the Barcelona Convention], several gaps still exist concerning the assessment of the impact of marine litter on marine organisms, and in particular on reefs. There is a need for harmonized and standardized monitoring protocols for the collection of quantitative data to assess the impact of litter on reefs and animal forests. At the same time, urgent management measures limiting, for instance, the impact of ALDFG and other marine litter are needed to preserve these valuable and vulnerable marine ecosystems.

AB  - In the last few years, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have attracted attention due to their high prevalence worldwide. Environmental factors may be one of the biggest reasons for these diseases related to neuronal dysfunctions. Most of neuronal disorders are strongly associated with pre- and postnatal exposure to environmental toxins released from industries. Some of the neurotoxic metals such as lead, aluminum, mercury, manganese, cadmium, and arsenic as well as some pesticides and metal-based nanoparticles have been involved in AD and PD due to their ability to produce senile/amyloid plaques and NFTs which are the main feature of these neuronal dysfunctions. Exposure to solvents is also majorly responsible for neurodegenerative disorders. The present review highlights the impact of omnipresent heavy metals with some other neurotoxins on human health and how they give rise to neuronal dysfunctions which in turn causes socio-economic consequences due to increasing pollution worldwide.

AB  - This review explores how microbial symbioses may have influenced and continue to influence the evolution of reef-building corals (Cnidaria; Scleractinia). The coral holobiont comprises a diverse microbiome including dinoflagellate algae (Dinophyceae; Symbiodiniaceae), bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses, but here we focus on the Symbiodiniaceae as knowledge of the impact of other microbial symbionts on coral evolution is scant. Symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae has extended the coral's metabolic capacity through metabolic handoffs and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and has contributed to the ecological success of these iconic organisms. It necessitated the prior existence or the evolution of a series of adaptations of the host to attract and select the right symbionts, to provide them with a suitable environment and to remove disfunctional symbionts. Signatures of microbial symbiosis in the coral genome include HGT from Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria, gene family expansions, and a broad repertoire of oxidative stress response and innate immunity genes. Symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae has permitted corals to occupy oligotrophic waters as the algae provide most corals with the majority of their nutrition. However, the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis is sensitive to climate warming, which disrupts this intimate relationship, causing coral bleaching, mortality and a worldwide decline of coral reefs. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of the microbiome in host evolution'.

AB  - This review aims to identify, summarise and critically evaluate studies that examined moderators or mediators of the relationship between social constraints and cancer adjustment. A database search was conducted to identify eligible studies published between inception and November 2019. A narrative synthesis of the included studies was conducted. We identified 18 papers, comprising 6933 participants (Mage = 55.70) with different types of cancer (mainly breast cancer). All of the studies used the Social Constraints Scale. Our synthesis shows that the association between social constraints and cancer adjustment is likely to be moderated or mediated by different cognitive (e.g. avoidant coping, intrusive thoughts) and emotional (e.g. emotionality, negative affect) variables. The importance of the moderators and mediators found in this study should be further examined by employing more sophisticated data analytic strategies to assess mediation and by collecting longitudinal data in order to better disentangle the complex associations among variables. However, some important variables were identified as potential targets of interventions for patients facing cancer.

AB  - Climate change and the consequential unpredictable environmental stress conditions negatively impact crop productivity. It has thus become a challenge to develop solutions for food security and sustainable agriculture in the backdrop of increasing population pressure and dwindling land and water resources. This further necessitates that focus of international research should be on curtailing yield losses through improved crop breeding practices and genetic manipulation for the development of resistant crop varieties. Plants being sessile, have developed a complex regulatory network of genetic machinery which includes transcription factors, small RNAs, signalling pathways, stress sensors and defense pathways. Needless to say, research efforts have exploited this genetic reservoir for manipulating crop plants for tolerance or resistance against different stresses. In the past few decades, significant achievement has been made for developing transgenic plants for a wide variety of single or multiple stress tolerance associated traits. Several regulatory mechanisms have been identified to fine tune and tailor the tolerance response in target sensitive crops. The advent of metabolic engineering has added new dimensions to manipulate stress tolerance pathways. Novel strategies are needed to develop stable, superior performing lines under challenging field environment without yield penalty and significant success has to be achieved to translate the research outcome from lab-to-land to reach farmer's fields.

This article also investigates the outcomes of these risks such as compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma, and burnout. As each of these terms is dissected, insight into the correctional health care advanced practice nurse's daily experience emerges. Very little literature exists on the topic of correctional nursing and the pitfalls of this field; however, all literature that examines these phenomena indicate that innate qualities such as resilience, along with efforts of education and awareness, will empower any advanced practice nurse to endure and overcome the high-risk field of correctional nursing.

AB  - As the global population ages, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases has risen. Furthermore, it has been suggested that depression, especially in elderly people, may also be an indication of latent neurodegeneration. Stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are usually accompanied by depression. The urgent challenge is further enforced by psychiatric comorbid conditions, particularly the feeling of despair in these patients. Fortunately, as our understanding of the neurobiological substrates of maladies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) has increased, more therapeutic options and novel potential biological mechanisms have been presented: (1) Neurodegenerative diseases share some similarities in their pathological characteristics, including changes in neuron structure or function and neuronal plasticity. (2) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that contribute to the pathogenesis of diverse neurological disease. (3) One ubiquitous neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is crucial for the development of the nervous system. Accumulating data have indicated that miRNAs not only are related to BDNF regulation but also can directly bind with the 3 '-UTR of BDNF to regulate BDNF and participate in neuroplasticity. In this short review, we present evidence of shared biological substrates among stroke, AD, PD, and depression and summarize the possible influencing mechanisms of acupuncture on the neuroplasticity of these diseases. We discuss neuroplasticity underscored by the roles of miRNAs and BDNF, which might further reveal the potential biological mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases and depression by acupuncture.

AB  - Background Neurological disorders have been continuously contributing to the global disease burden and affect millions of people worldwide. Researchers strive hard to extract out the ultimate cure and serve for the betterment of the society, and yet the treatments available provide only symptomatic relief. Aging and abnormal mutations seem to be the major culprits responsible for neurotoxicity and neuronal death. One of the major causes of these neurological disorders that has been paid utmost attention recently, is Autophagic Dysfunction. Aim The aim of the study was to understand the autophagic process, its impairment in neurological disorders and targeting the impairments as a therapeutic option for the said disorders. Methods For the purpose of review, we carried out an extensive literature study to excerpt the series of steps involved in autophagy and to understand the mechanism of autophagic impairment occurring in a range of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders like Parkinson, Alzheimer, Depression, Schizophrenia, Autism etc. The review also involved the exploration of certain molecules that can help in triggering the compromised autophagic members. Results We found that, a number of genes, proteins, receptors and transcription factors interplay to bring about autophagy and plethora of neurological disorders are associated with the diminished expression of one or more autophagic member leading to inhibition of autophagy. Conclusion Autophagy is a significant process for the removal of misfolded, abnormal, damaged protein aggregates and nonfunctional cell organelles in order to suppress neurodegeneration. Therefore, triggering autophagy could serve as an important therapeutic target to treat neurological disorders.

AB  - Toxicity due to heavy metals (HM), specifically mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) remains a challenge to scientists till date. This review gives insights into natural antidotes for the management and prevention of HM toxicity. Various databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Science Direct were searched for available facts on natural antidotes and their commercial products against HM toxicity till date. Toxicity owing to such metals needs prevention rather than therapy. Natural antidotes, fruits and vegetables, rich in antioxidant are the answers to such toxicities. Synthetic chelators impart a major drawback of removing essential metals required for normal body function, along with the toxic one. Natural antioxidants are bestowed with scavenging and chelation properties and can be alternative for synthetic chelating agents. Natural compounds are abundantly available, economic, and have minimal side effects when compared with classical chelators. Prevention is better than cure and thus adding plentiful vegetables and fruits to our diet can combat HM toxicity-related illness.

AB  - Introduction In schizophrenia, patients can experience delusions or hallucinations regarding their food or health status, leading to diminished intake. Fasting or not eating a balanced diet can cause neurological complications after severe vitamin B1 malnourishment. The precise signs and symptoms of Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE) in schizophrenia are not clear. Our aim, therefore, was to conduct a systematic review of the characteristics of WE in patients with schizophrenia. Methods We conducted our search from inception using Mesh terms schizophrenia, Wernicke Encephalopathy, Korsakoff's syndrome. We searched Pubmed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus. We defined WE as mental, oculomotor, and motoric alterations and thiamine deficiency; schizophrenia was defined as psychosis, hallucinations and/or delusions; adequate WE treatment as >500 mg/day intramuscular or intravenous. Our search yielded 15 WE cases. Results WE is characterised by a triad of mental status change, ocular signs and ataxia. In alcohol use disorder, this triad is present in 16% of the cases, but 12 out of the 15 published schizophrenia cases presented themselves with a full triad. Importantly, as an additional characteristic, patients often lost weight within a short period of time. Conclusions The development of a full triad and additional symptomatology suggests a late recognition of signs and symptoms of WE in schizophrenia. Prophylactic thiamine checks and treatment in patients with schizophrenia are relevant, and if WE is suspected adequate parenteral thiamine supplementation is necessary.

AB  - Background. COVID-19 has been declared the pandemic of the 21st century, causing more than 45,000 deaths worldwide. The abrupt release of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated the potential infection, morbidity, and lethality of zoonotic viruses and human-to-human transmission. Fever, cough, and fatigue are reported as the most common symptoms of the disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, and also signs of severe illness, such as shock, acute cardiac injury, and renal lesions, are described. Considering the previous works related to human coronavirus and other zoonotic infections, it has been demonstrated that the neuroinvasive propensity is a common characteristic of coronaviruses, especially in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Objective. In the present review, we analyzed the potential neurological components involved in coronavirus infections and detailed the neurological syndromes related to COVID-19. We also examined the mechanism of transmission and CNS pathology related to other viruses with similar structures such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Methods. A comprehensive search of different original articles and clinical, experimental, and review studies was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We selected 92 articles that have been published in journals or preprints according to the search words and the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results. COVID-19 patients may experience neurological symptoms such as headache, impaired mental status, confusion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, anosmia/hyposmia, and dysgeusia/hypogeusia as initial symptoms, with more severe manifestations such as seizures or coma later on. The neurological signs shown are clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Given that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have similar structures, these viruses may share comparable neurological symptoms and similar progression. Coronaviruses are linked to central nervous system dysfunction, and they are also reported as the probable cause of multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, and meningitis.

AB  - Objective Benzodiazepines (BZD) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide. However, the cognitive effects of benzodiazepines in the elderly are highly debated. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the following two questions in the elderly population: (i) Do BZD lead to any impairments in cognitive functions in elderly users? and (ii) Which specific cognitive domains are most affected by BZD use and abuse? Methods First, we performed a literature search following the PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched until May 14(th), 2020. After selecting the relevant articles, we integrated the results of the selected studies with a standardized cognitive classification method. Next, we performed meta-analyses with the random-effects model on the cognitive results. Finally, we specifically examined the cognitive impairments of BZD in the abuse subgroup. Results Of the included studies, eight of the thirteen had meta-analyzable data. Compared to the controls, elderly BZD users had significantly lower digital symbol test scores (n=253; SMD: -0.61, 95% CI: -0.91 to 0.31, I-2 = 0%, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in Mini-Mental State Examination, Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Stroop Color and Word Test scores between BZD users and controls. According to the subgroup analyses, BZD abusers performed significantly worse than controls in Mini-Mental State Examination (n=7726; SMD: -0.23, 95% CI: -0.44 to -0.03, I-2 = 86%, p = 0.02), while there was no significant difference between the regular BZD users and the controls (n=1536; SMD: -0.05, 95% CI: -0.59 to 0.48, I-2 = 92%, p =0.85). Conclusion In the elderly population, the processing speed (digital symbol test scores) was significantly impaired in BZD users; global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination scores) was significantly impaired in BZD abusers but not in BZD regular users. This study provides insight into the factors that interact with BZD cognitive effects, such as aging, testing tools, and abuse. Clinicians should be cautious when prescribing BZD for the elderly.

KW  - Cognitive load

KW  - Motivation
KW  - Learner's resources
AB  - Building bridges between two of the most influential research fields in educational psychology, self-regulation and cognitive load theory, is highly relevant but also challenging. The collection of papers in this special issue reflects this interplay by reviewing the still scarce base of empirical data in an impressively elaborated and profound way. The papers offer different perspectives on how to improve learning by stimulating both activities for self-regulation as well as for reflecting the mental effort which can be used in return for monitoring and regulation. They provide arguments for the two sidedness of the relationship of self-regulation and cognitive load: that cognitive load can cause self-regulation and that self-regulation can cause cognitive load. The common understanding of self-regulation in this issue is very much focused on monitoring and could benefit from a broader view by including the whole cycle of self-regulation and moderating motivational factors like self-efficacy, as proposed in many self-regulation models. The conceptualization of effort, as it is referred to in most of the papers, could also profit from a more differentiated view, which takes into account the origin of required or invested mental effort. Overall, what learners actually decide to do when dealing with self-regulation as well as with cognitive load highly depends on their resources. In an integrative model, the role of potential resources is discussed as a starting point for future research. This discussion invites for an even broader, more individualized, and differentiated view to add to the bridge-building attempts of this impressive collection of research.

Second, do mindfulness exercise-based interventions (exercise-MBIs) and mindfulness meditation-based interventions (meditation-MBIs) affect peripheral BDNF differently? Third, does the age of participants and the accumulative hours of MBI practice affect peripheral BDNF? Methods:We included randomized controlled trials comparing MBI and no intervention in adults (age >18 years) who reported peripheral BDNF. Database searches included PubMed, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PsyInfo, and Scopus. Two reviewers independently selected the studies and assessed the trial quality. We used the standardized mean difference (SMD) as the effect size index and conducted moderator analyses. Results:Eleven studies are included in this systematic review. Five studies applying exercise-MBI and three studies applying meditation-MBI are included in the meta-analysis (N= 479). The pooled effect size shows a significantly greater increase of peripheral BDNF in MBI groups compared to the control groups (k = 8, N = 479, SMD = 0.72, 95% CI 0.31-1.14,I-2= 78%). Significantly more increases of BDNF in the MBI groups are found in both subgroups of exercise-MBI and meditation-MBI. The effect sizes of both subgroups are not significantly different between subgroups (chi(2)= 0.02,p= 0.88). We find no significant correlation between the effect sizes and the age of participants (r= -0.0095,p= 0.45) or accumulative hours of MBI practice (r= 0.0021,p= 0.57). Conclusion:The heterogeneous data of this small sample-size meta-analysis suggests that MBI can increase peripheral BDNF. Either exercise-MBI or meditation-MBI can increase peripheral BDNF.

AB  - Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders experience severe difficulties in interpersonal communication, as described by traditional psychopathology and current research on social cognition. From a linguistic perspective, pragmatic abilities are crucial for successful communication. Empirical studies have shown that these abilities are significantly impaired in this group of patients. Prosody, the tone of voice with which words and sentences are pronounced, is one of the most important carriers of pragmatic meaning and can serve a range of functions from linguistic to emotional ones. Most of the existing literature on prosody of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders focuses on the expression of emotion, generally showing significant impairments. By contrast, the use of non-emotional prosody in these patients is scarcely investigated. In this paper, we first present a linguistic model to classify prosodic functions. Second, we discuss existing studies on the use of non-emotional prosody in these patients, providing an overview of the state of the art. Third, we delineate possible future lines of research in this field, also taking into account some classical psychopathological assumptions, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Plant phenomics is a high-throughput path-breaking area that meets all the requirements for the collection of accurate, rapid and multi-faceted phenotypic data. Plant phenomics is an approach to envisage complex traits that are appropriate for selection, and provides relevant information as to why particular genotype can stand out in particular environmental conditions. The technique of plant phenotyping can be operated in various dimensions, from the gene to the whole-plant level under a specific environment, and management practices. Through this review, we discuss the recent advances in plant phenomics, highlighting different field and confined high-throughput technologies for utilization in forward and reverse genetics. These plant phenomics technique are very relevant in stress identification, study physiological processes, rapid and efficient screening, dissection and confirmation for understanding the genetic basis of different traits, genes and aspects. High-throughput phenomics technologies are essential to avoid human error and to reduce time consumption while phenotyping large germplasm populations, or for confirmation of gene or trait functional analysis.

AB  - Background Cervical cancer screening has been effective in reducing incidence and mortality of cervical cancer, leading European countries to implement screening programs. However, migrant women show lower screening participation compared to nationals. This scoping review aims to provide a synthesis of the growing evidence on factors associated with participation in cervical cancer screening among migrant women in Europe. Methods Electronic peer-reviewed databases were searched in November 2019 for studies on factors related to the participation of migrants in cervical cancer screening conducted in EU/EFTA countries, using comprehensive search expressions. Retrieved articles were screened and those eligible were selected for data extraction. Quantitative and qualitative studies were included. Factors were classified in barriers and facilitators and were divided into further categories. Results Twenty out of 96 articles were selected and analyzed. Factors associated with participation in cervical cancer screening were classified in categories related to sociodemographic, healthcare-system, psychological, migration, knowledge, language, and cultural factors. Lack of information, lack of female healthcare providers, poor language skills, and emotional responses to the test (especially fear, embarrassment and discomfort) were the most reported barriers to cervical cancer screening. Encouragement from healthcare providers and information available in migrants' languages were frequently stated as facilitators. Results on the role of sociodemographic factors, such as age, education, employment and marital status, are the most conflicting, highlighting the complexity of the issue and the possibility of interactions between factors, resulting in different effects on cervical cancer screening participation among migrant women. Several identified barriers to screening are like those to access to healthcare services in general. Conclusions Efforts to increase migrant women's participation in CCS must target barriers to access to healthcare services in general but also specific barriers, including cultural differences about sexuality and gender, past traumatic personal experiences, and the gender and competences of healthcare professionals performing CCS. Healthcare services should strengthen resources to meet migrants' needs, including having CCS information translated and culturally adapted, as well as healthcare providers with skills to deal with cultural background. These findings can contribute to improve CCS programs among migrant women, reducing health disparities and enhancing their overall health and well-being.

AB  - Objectives The associations of PM with the risk and prognosis of breast cancer have not been determined. This systematic review aimed to provide an updated understanding of the relationship between PM exposure level and breast cancer incidence and mortality. Methods Articles from Web of Science and PubMed databases were methodically inspected until March 8, 2020. In final, 15 studies were kept for analysis, which provided necessary information to estimate the impact of PM on breast cancer risk and prognosis. These studies were combined for quantitative analyses to evaluate the effect of per 10 mu g /m(3)increment exposure of PM2.5(< 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) and PM10(< 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) using random-effects model. Results PM(2.5)exposure was associated with increased breast cancer mortality (relative risk [RR] = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02, 1.16; PQ-test = 0.158). No association of PM2.5(1.02; 0.97, 1.18; 0.308) and PM10(1.03; 0.98, 1.09; 0.009) with the increase incidence of breast cancer was observed. Stratified analysis suggested that PM(2.5)was associated with the increase mortality of breast cancer (1.10; 1.03, 1.17; 0.529) in subgroup of developed country. PM(10)was associated with breast cancer incidence based on studies published after 2017 (1.08; 1.00, 1.15; 0.157) and European studies (1.15; 1.06, 1.25; 0.502). Conclusions Our study indicated that PM(2.5)exposure was related to breast cancer mortality. Further researches in this field are needed to validate the conclusion.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a brain-gut axis disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. IBS is a multifactorial, stress-sensitive disorder with evidence for familial clustering attributed to genetic or shared environmental factors. However, there are weak genetic associations reported with IBS and a lack of evidence to suggest that major genetic factor(s) contribute to IBS pathophysiology. Studies on animal models of stress, including early life stress, suggest a role for environmental factors, specifically, stress associated with dysregulation of corticotropin releasing factor and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis pathways in the pathophysiology of IBS. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, which constitute molecular changes not driven by a change in gene sequence, can mediate environmental effects on central and peripheral function. Epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation changes, histone modifications, and differential expression of non-coding RNAs (microRNA [miRNA] and long non-coding RNA) have been associated with several diseases. The objective of this review is to elucidate the molecular factors in the pathophysiology of IBS with an emphasis on epigenetic mechanisms. Emerging evidence for epigenetic changes in IBS includes changes in DNA methylation in animal models of IBS and patients with IBS, and various miRNAs that have been associated with IBS and endophenotypes, such as increased visceral sensitivity and intestinal permeability. DNA methylation, in particular, is an emerging field in the realm of complex diseases and a promising mechanism which can provide important insights into IBS pathogenesis and identify potential targets for treatment.

AB  - Orientation: Work-related research from the perspective of psychology journal publications is reviewed, indicating research topic trends and research method use.
   Research purpose: What psychology journals are publishing about work-related topics as well as how these topics are being investigated was indicated. The specific objectives of this study were to analyse what research methods are being used, how these methods are being used and for what topics in work-related research.
   Motivation for the study: The lack of studies that investigate the use of research methods and work-related study themes from the perspective of miscellaneous psychology journals prompted this study.
   Research approach/design and method: A systematised review design was followed based on data collected by a previous study. Work-related research articles (n = 73) from five top-tier international miscellaneous or general psychology journals (published between 2013 and 2017) were collected and categorised.
   Main findings: Quantitative methods, convenience samples, cross-sectional designs and questionnaires for data collection as well as analysis of variance were the most frequently used methodologies. Workplace relationships, job search quality and re-employment and work stress were the most frequently investigated topics.
   Practical/managerial implications: Researchers should pay attention to the areas that lack methodological transparency in their studies to address the replication crisis in psychology. Method use should be expanded beyond quantitative methods where applicable. Industrial and organisational psychologists are reminded of their identity as applied psychologists.
   Contribution/value-add: The use of research methods in work-related research published by psychology journals is presented. Trends for this sample as well as areas for improving the replication crisis in psychology were identified.

This paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art review and summary of the scattered and disperse research on dog positive-emotion assessment. The review notably details the current advancement in dog positive-emotion research, what approaches, measures, methods, and techniques have been implemented so far in emotion perception, processing, and response assessment. Moreover, we propose possible future research directions for short-term emotion as well as longer-term emotional states assessment in dogs. The review ends by identifying and addressing some methodological limitations and by pointing out further methodological research needs.

AB  - Objective: The primary indication for electroconvulsive therapy is medication-resistant major depression. There is some evidence that combining electroconvulsive therapy with an antidepressant, instead of electroconvulsive therapy monotherapy, might improve remission rates. However, data on this topic have not been systematically studied. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of an adjuvant antidepressant during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression.
   Methods: Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, PsychINFO Ovid and Google Scholar were searched up to January 2019. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies reporting on the influence of an adjuvant antidepressant on the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy for major depression were included. Authors independently screened records, extracted data and assessed study quality. We reported this systematic review and meta-analysis following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
   Results: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed a significant advantage of adjuvant antidepressants versus placebo. The overall effect size per category of antidepressant was as follows: tricyclic antidepressants: Hedges'g 0.32 (95% confidence interval: [0.14, 0.51]) (k = 6) with low heterogeneity (I-2: 4%, p = 0.39); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors: Hedges'g 0.27 (95% confidence interval: [0.03, 0.52]) (k = 2) with a lack of heterogeneity (I-2: 0%,p = 0.89); and monoamine oxidase inhibitors: Hedges'g 0.35 (95% confidence interval: [-0.07, 0.77]) with moderate heterogeneity (I-2: 43%, p = 0.17) (k = 3).
   Conclusion: An adjuvant antidepressant enhances the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy for major depression. Tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors showed the same effect size. However, the effect sizes of tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are most likely underestimated, due to insufficient doses in most of the included studies. We recommend the routine use of an adequately dosed antidepressant during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression.

AB  - BackgroundIntimate Partner Violence is a "global pandemic". Meanwhile, information and communication technologies (ICT), such as the internet, mobile phones, and smartphones, are spreading worldwide, including in low- and middle-income countries. We reviewed the available evidence on the use of ICT-based interventions to address intimate partner violence (IPV), evaluating the effectiveness, acceptability, and suitability of ICT for addressing different aspects of the problem (e.g., awareness, screening, prevention, treatment, mental health).MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines, using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Key search terms included women, violence, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, information, communication technology, ICT, technology, email, mobile, phone, digital, ehealth, web, computer, online, and computerized. Only articles written in English were included.ResultsTwenty-five studies addressing screening and disclosure, IPV prevention, ICT suitability, support and women's mental health were identified. The evidence reviewed suggests that ICT-based interventions were effective mainly in screening, disclosure, and prevention. However, there is a lack of homogeneity among the studies' outcome measurements and the sample sizes, the control groups used (if any), the type of interventions, and the study recruitment space. Questions addressing safety, equity, and the unintended consequences of the use of ICT in IPV programming are virtually non-existent.ConclusionsThere is a clear need to develop women-centered ICT design when programming for IPV. Our study showed only one study that formally addressed software usability. The need for more research to address safety, equity, and the unintended consequences of the use of ICT in IPV programming is paramount. Studies addressing long term effects are also needed.

AB  - Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a recurrent illness with high rates of chronicity, treatment-resistance, and significant economic impact.S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a molecule that is formed naturally in the human body, has shown antidepressant effects and may expand the available options for treating MDD. This systematic review examines the evidence concerning the efficacy of SAMe as monotherapy or in combination with antidepressants. Methods A systematic search in Medline, Psychinfo, AMED, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was conducted for any reference recorded up to March 2020. Double-blind, randomised controlled trials, comparing the antidepressant efficacy of SAMe to placebo or/and to other antidepressants, were selected. Two authors evaluated each study independently and then, reconciled findings. Results Eight trials, with a total of 11 arms and 1011 subjects, evaluating the efficacy of SAMe used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy (512 individuals), were included in this review. The study duration ranged between 2 and 12 weeks and the daily dose of SAMe varied from 200 to 3200 mg. Five comparisons evaluated the differences between SAMe and placebo and SAMe resulted significantly better than placebo in three of these studies. Four comparisons evaluated the differences between SAMe and other antidepressants (imipramine or escitalopram) and showed no significant difference. One study showed that SAMe was significantly better than placebo in accelerating the response to imipramine from day 4 to day 12, but the mean scores were not statistically different at the day 14 endpoint. One study showed that SAMe combined with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) was better than PBO combined with SSRI. The studies reported only mild, transient or non-clinically relevant side effects. Conclusions The existing trials of SAMe, used as monotherapy or add on to another antidepressants, have shown encouraging and generally positive results. However, more evidence is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Larger, double-blind randomised controlled studies are warranted to confirm the antidepressant effectiveness of SAMe.

Methods We searched CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO for original studies of undergraduate students where an obesity trait was associated with a risk factor. Results Two-hundred sixty-eight articles were included comprising of 251 studies: 186 cross-sectional, 50 cohort, 11 interventional, and 4 qualitative. We extracted data on risk/protective factors, obesity traits, and the direction of effect between them. We identified a variety of factors including age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, diet, eating habits, physical activity, sedentary activity, sleep, stress, university campus life, alcohol use, smoking, psychiatric disorders, body image, eating attitude, eating regulation, personality, sociocultural influences, and genetics. The majority of associations were cross-sectional. For longitudinal findings, usually only one study investigated each trait. Conclusions This review identifies a need for higher quality evidence to support results from cross-sectional studies and replication of findings of longitudinal studies. This review identifies gaps in the literature, generates hypotheses, guides researchers to plan future studies, and helps decision-makers design obesity-prevention programs in universities.

AB  - Background The purpose of this systematic review is to examine cooling intervention research in outdoor occupations, evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions, and offer recommendations for future studies. This review focuses on outdoor occupational studies conducted at worksites or simulated occupational tasks in climatic chambers. Methods This systematic review was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched to identify original research on intervention studies published in peer-reviewed journals that aimed at reducing heat stress or heat-related illness from January 2000 to August 2020. Results A systematic search yielded a total of 1042 articles, of which 21 met the inclusion criteria. Occupations with cooling intervention studies included agriculture (n = 5), construction (n = 5), industrial workers (n = 4), and firefighters (n = 7). The studies focused on multiple types of cooling interventions cooling gear (vest, bandanas, cooling shirts, or head-cooling gel pack), enhanced heat dissipation clothing, forearm or lower body immersion in cold water, water dousing, ingestion of a crushed ice slush drink, electrolyte liquid hydration, and modified Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommendations of drinking water and resting in the shade. Conclusion Current evidence indicates that using multiple cooling gears along with rest cycles may be the most effective method to reduce heat-related illness. Occupational heat-related illnesses and death may be mitigated by targeted cooling intervention and workplace controls among workers of vulnerable occupational groups and industries.

AB  - Background Climate change is set to exacerbate occupational heat strain, the combined effect of environmental and internal heat stress on the body, threatening human health and wellbeing. Therefore, identifying effective, affordable, feasible and sustainable solutions to mitigate the negative effects on worker health and productivity, is an increasingly urgent need. Objectives To systematically identify and evaluate methods that mitigate occupational heat strain in order to provide scientific-based guidance for practitioners. Methods An umbrella review was conducted in biomedical databases employing the following eligibility criteria: 1) ambient temperatures > 28 degrees C or hypohydrated participants, 2) healthy adults, 3) reported psychophysiological (thermal comfort, heart rate or core temperature) and/or performance (physical or cognitive) outcomes, 4) written in English, and 5) published before November 6, 2019. A second search for original research articles was performed to identify interventions of relevance but lacking systematic reviews. All identified interventions were independently evaluated by all co-authors on four point scales for effectiveness, cost, feasibility and environmental impact. Results Following screening, 36 systematic reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The most effective solutions at mitigating occupational heat strain were wearing specialized cooling garments, (physiological) heat acclimation, improving aerobic fitness, cold water immersion, and applying ventilation. Although air-conditioning and cooling garments in ideal settings provide best scores for effectiveness, the limited applicability in certain industrial settings, high economic cost and high environmental impact are drawbacks for these solutions. However, (physiological) acclimatization, planned breaks, shading and optimized clothing properties are attractive alternative solutions when economic and ecological sustainability aspects are included in the overall evaluation. Discussion Choosing the most effective solution or combinations of methods to mitigate occupational heat strain will be scenario-specific. However, this paper provides a framework for integrating effectiveness, cost, feasibility (indoors and outdoor) and ecologic sustainability to provide occupational health and safety professionals with evidence-based guidelines.

AB  - Over 85% of the world's oyster reefs have been lost in the past two centuries, triggering a global effort to restore shellfish reef ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. While there has been considerable success in re-establishing oyster reefs, many challenges remain. These include: high incidence of failed restoration, high cost of restoration per unit area, and increasing stress from climate change. In order to leverage our past successes and progress the field, we must increase restoration efficiencies that not only reduce cost per unit area, but also increase the resilience of restored ecosystems. To help address this need, we qualitatively review the literature associated with the structure and function of oyster reef ecosystems to identify key positive species interactions (i.e., those species interactions where at least one partner benefits and no partners are harmed). We classified positive interand intraspecific interactions between oysters and organisms associated with oyster ecosystems into the following seven functional categories: (1) physical reef creation, (2) positive density dependence, (3) refugia from physical stress, (4) refugia from biological stress, (5) biodiversity enhancement, (6) settlement improvement, and (7) long-distance facilitation. We discuss each category of positive interaction and how restoration practitioners can use knowledge of such processes to enhance restoration success. We propose that systematic incorporation of positive species interactions into restoration practice will both enhance ecological services provided by restored reefs and increase restoration success.

AB  - BackgroundSelf-rated health (SRH) is an indicator that captures a person's perception of their overall health status. The relationship between physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB) and SRH has been investigated in systematic reviews among adult and elderly populations. No systematic review to date has synthesized the relationship between PA, SB and SRH among children and adolescents. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the associations between PA, SB and SRH in the general population of children and adolescents and to investigate the dose-response relationship between PA, SB and SRH.MethodsWe conducted a computer search for English language studies in the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCINFO that were published between 1946 and 2019. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and the references of the identified publications for additional studies. A meta-analysis was employed to synthesize the associations between PA, SB respectively and SRH. The dose-response association was tested using a random effects meta-regression model. The review was reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.ResultsSixty-eight published articles were included in the final review, including 59 cross-sectional and nine longitudinal studies. We found evidence that PA was associated with better SRH, and SB was associated with lower SRH among children and adolescents. A dose-response relationship between PA and SRH was observed, where a higher level of PA was associated with better SRH than a lower level of PA. The relationship between PA, SB and SRH was observed in both boys and girls, and did not show a significant gender difference.ConclusionsThe findings in the systematic review suggest that health intervention programmes targeting promoting PA and reducing SB among children and adolescents may enhance their overall health status. Future research is needed to expand prospective cohort and intervention studies to address directionality and causality in the relationships between PA, SB and SRH among children and youth.Trial registrationPROSPERO - CRD42019142244.

AB  - Abacus, which represents numbers via a visuospatial format, is a traditional device to facilitate arithmetic operations. Skilled abacus users, who have acquired the ability of abacus-based mental calculation (AMC), can perform fast and accurate calculations by manipulating an imaginary abacus in mind. Due to this extraordinary calculation ability in AMC users, there is an expanding literature investigating the effects of AMC training on cognition and brain systems. This review study aims to provide an updated overview of important findings in this fast-growing research field. Here, findings from previous behavioral and neuroimaging studies about AMC experts as well as children and adults receiving AMC training are reviewed and discussed. Taken together, our review of the existing literature suggests that AMC training has the potential to enhance various cognitive skills including mathematics, working memory and numerical magnitude processing. Besides, the training can result in functional and anatomical neural changes that are largely located within the frontal-parietal and occipital-temporal brain regions. Some of the neural changes can explain the training-induced cognitive enhancements. Still, caution is needed when extend the conclusions to a more general situation. Implications for future research are provided.

AB  - Introduction: As COVID-19 develops around the world, numerous publications have described the psychiatric consequences of this pandemic. Although clinicians and healthcare systems are mainly focused on managing critically ill patients in an attempt to limit the number of casualties, psychiatric disease burden is increasing significantly. In this scenario, increased domestic violence and substance abuse have been recently reported. Objective: The objective of this study is to perform a systematic review of the literature regarding the consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 infection in terms of domestic violence and substance abuse, and compare incidences found. Materials and Methods: We conducted a literature search using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. The keywords included "domestic violence," "substance abuse" AND "COVID-19," including multiple variants from December 2019 through June 2020. An extensive bibliographic search was carried out in different medical databases: Pubmed, EMBASE, LILACS, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Titles and abstracts were reviewed according to the eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in the retrieved articles was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical assessment instrument. Results: A total of 1505 papers were initially retrieved after consulting the selected databases. After browsing through titles and abstracts, 94 articles were initially included considering the predefined eligibility criteria. After a more detailed analysis, only six scientific articles remained in our selection. Of these, three were evaluating domestic violence against children, while the other three were about substance abuse. Conclusion: There is not enough evidence to support the concept that COVID-19 has led to an increase in the rates of domestic violence and substance abuse. The initial decrease in violence reports might not translate into a real reduction in incidence but in accessibility. Apparently, there has been a slight increase in alcohol and tobacco abuse, especially by regular users, which also requires confirmatory studies. The inconsistency between expert opinon articles and the actual published data could be a result of the limited time since the beginnging of the crisis, the fact that psychitaric patients have been chronically exposed to stressful situatons, and a possible stimulated increase in demand for psychatric consultations.

AB  - Body size acts as a proxy for many fitness-related traits. Body size is also subject to directional selection from various anthropogenic stressors such as increasing water temperature, decreasing dissolved oxygen, fisheries, as well as natural predators. Changes in individual body size correlate with changes in fecundity, behaviour, and survival and can propagate through populations and ecosystems by truncating age and size structures and changing predator-prey dynamics. In this review, we will explore the causes and consequences of changing body size in fish in the light of recent literature and relevant theories. We will investigate the central role of body size in ecology by first discussing the main selective agents that influence body size: fishing, increasing water temperature, decreasing dissolved oxygen, and predation. We will then explore the impacts of these changes at the individual, population, and ecosystem levels. Considering the relatively high heritability of body size, we will discuss how a change in body size can leave a genetic signature in the population and translate to a change in the evolutionary potential of the species.

AB  - Air pollution is an important cause of non-communicable diseases globally with particulate matter (PM) as one of the main air pollutants. PM is composed of microscopic particles that contain a mixture of chemicals and biological elements that can be harmful to human health. The aerodynamic diameter of PM facilitates their deposition when inhaled. For instance, coarse PM having a diameter of < 10 mu m is deposited mainly in the large conducting airways, but PM of < 2.5 mu m can cross the alveolar-capillary barrier, traveling to other organs within the body. Epidemiological studies have shown the association between PM exposure and risk of disease, namely those of the respiratory system such as lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, cardiovascular and neurological diseases have also been reported, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, loss of cognitive function, anxiety, and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Inflammation is a common hallmark in the pathogenesis of many of these diseases associated with exposure to a variety of air pollutants, including PM. This review focuses on the main effects of PM on human health, with an emphasis on the role of inflammation.

AB  - Purpose of review The aim of this scoping review was to identify and map the available evidence on recent innovations in community mental healthcare across the globe. Recent findings This review highlights the different innovative approaches and strategies being currently used in the field of community mental health. Key approaches found in the reviewed studies include collaborative care with the inclusion of peer workers, growing use of e-health and telepsychiatry, improved reforms on national mental health policies and de-institutionalization, modification of outreach models and mental health promotion in the community. The studies reviewed here suggest that continued innovation and implementation of new models and strategies have the potential to reduce the burden of disease and increase the quality of life for patients with mental health issues. Growing body of evidence shows that integrative care is the new standard of care for people with mental illnesses, with necessity of continuity of care from emergency department to community mental health services. Social determinants of rehabilitation and recovery, and peers support remain a new main topic of research in area of treatment of people with severe mental illnesses. E-health tools are becoming prevalent in the processes of promotion, prevention and treatment in mental healthcare.

AB  - Diminished volumes of habitual physical activity and increased sedentary levels have been observed as a result of COVID-19 home-confinement. Consequences of inactivity, including a higher mortality rate and poorer general health and fitness, have been reported. This systematic review aimed to provide practical recommendations for maintaining active lifestyles during pandemics. In May 2020, two electronic databases (PubMed; Web of Science) were used to search for relevant studies. A total of 1206 records were screened by two researchers. Thirty-one relevant studies were included in this systematic review, in which the methodological quality was assessed. With regard to six studies, which explicitly dealt with physical activity during COVID-19, the evidence level is classified by three articles to level II, and in the other three to level VI. Regarding the physical activity recommendations in these papers, three of them were classified to a medium, and the same number to a weak evidence base. Of the 25 papers which refer to other pandemics and/or isolation situations, one was classified to evidence level I, four were ranged to level II, three to level III, one to level V, and the others to level VI. This systematic review revealed that reduced physical activity levels are of serious concern during home confinement in pandemic times. The recommendations provided by many international organizations to maintain active lifestyles during these times mainly target the general population, with less consideration for vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults, people with health issues). Therefore, personalized and supervised physical activity programs are urgently needed, with the option to group-play physical activity programs (e.g., exergames). These can be assisted, delivered, and disseminated worldwide through information and communication technology solutions. If it is permitted and safe, being active outside in daylight is advised, with an effort level of mild to moderate using the rating of perceived exertion scale. Relaxation techniques should be integrated into the daily routine to reduce stress levels. On the evidence base and levels of the included articles in this review, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Given that policies are different across regions and countries, further research is needed to categorize recommendations according to different social-distancing scenarios.

AB  - (1)Background: Virtual Reality (VR) is a fully immersive computer simulated experience consisting of a three-dimensional interactive virtual environment, through a head-mounted display (HMD) and controller. The use of virtual reality has recently been proposed for the treatment of various psychiatric conditions, including the spectrum of schizophrenia. Our review aims to investigate the current available evidence regarding the use of immersive virtual reality in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. (2)Methods: From April 2019 to June 2020, we conducted a systematic review aimed at identifying therapeutic applications in immersive virtual reality for the spectrum of schizophrenia, searching for relevant studies on Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINHAL. (3)Results: We identified a total of 2601 unique records. Of these, 64 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and six out of these met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final systematic review. (4)Conclusions: The available data on immersive virtual reality are currently limited due to the few studies carried out on the topic; however, it has demonstrated its effectiveness and versatility in successfully treating various psychotic symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, or cognitive and social skills. Existing literature agrees on safe, tolerable, and long-term persistence of the therapeutic effects obtained by immersive VR. No serious side effects have been reported. In some specific cases, VR therapy was found to be very effective compared to usual treatment, allowing effective drug free interventions, and therefore without side effects for patients, even in those resistant to normal drug therapies.

AB  - A number of epidemiological studies report an association between occupational noise exposure and arterial hypertension. Existing systematic reviews report conflicting results, so we conducted an updated systematic review with meta-analysis. We registered the review protocol with PROSPERO (registration no.: CRD 42019147923) and searched for observational epidemiological studies in literature databases (Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science). Two independent reviewers screened the titles/abstracts and full texts of the studies. Two reviewers also did the quality assessment and data extraction. Studies without adequate information on recruitment, response, or without a comparison group that was exposed to occupational noise under 80 dB(A) were excluded. The literature search yielded 4583 studies, and 58 studies were found through hand searching. Twenty-four studies were included in the review. The meta-analysis found a pooled effect size (ES) for hypertension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure >= 140/90 mmHg) due to noise exposures >= 80 dB(A) of 1.81 (95% CI 1.51-2.18). There is no substantial risk difference between men and women, but data concerning this question are limited. We found a positive dose-response-relationship: ES = 1.21 (95% CI 0.78-1.87) <= 80 dB(A), ES = 1.77 (95% CI 1.36-2.29) > 80-<= 85 dB(A), and ES = 3.50 (95% CI 1.56-7.86) > 85-<= 90 dB(A). We found high quality of evidence that occupational noise exposure increases the risk of hypertension.

AB  - Background: Long-term use of more than one concurrent antipsychotic [antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP)] is widely believed to contribute to excess mortality in people with serious mental illness (SMI) compared to those taking only one antipsychotic (monotherapy). However, no conclusive evidence is available.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search in 6 major electronic databases from inception until December 2019, identifying observational studies examining the association between mortality and exposure to long-term APP vs monotherapy. Studies were eligible if they adopted a follow-up design and antipsychotic exposure was >3 months among adults with SMI. We determined the pooled mortality risk using random-effects meta-analyses. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019148044).
   Results: A total of 12 studies fulfilled all eligibility criteria reporting quantitative data for 834, 534 person years. No difference was found in the association between all-cause mortality and APP vs monotherapy use, in both crude (rate ratio = 0.94, 95% CI 0.81-1.10, p = 0.446; I-2 = 83.2%, p < 0.001; 10 studies) and adjusted models (adjusted HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.80-1.19, p = 0.802; I-2 = 58.3%, p < 0.05; 5 studies). Meta-regression did not identify any moderators influencing all-cause mortality risk. For natural causes of death, risk estimates followed the same pattern: (i) crude rate ratio = 0.88, 95% CI 0.67-1.14, p = 0.324; I-2 = 77.7%, p = 0.01 (5 studies); (ii) adjusted HR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.90-1.99, p = 0.590; I-2 = 0.0%, p = 0.744 (5 studies).
   Conclusion: Mortality risk of APP use in people with SMI appears to be comparable to that of monotherapy use, although work to date remains heterogeneous, precluding firm conclusions from made. Complex real-world clinical scenarios may be contributing to this lack of variation between these two types of antipsychotic use. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exosomes are extracellular microvesicles implicated in intercellular communication with ability to transfer cargo molecules, including protein, lipids, and nucleic acids, at both close and distant target sites. It has been shown that exosomes are implicated in physiological and pathological processes. In recent years, the interest on exosomes' role in many pain states has increased. Their involvements in pain processes have been demonstrated by studies on different chronic pain diseases, both inflammatory and neuropathic, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, neurodegenerative pathologies, complex regional pain syndrome, and peripheral nerve injury. Animal and clinical studies investigated exosomes-based treatments, showing their ability to improve painful symptoms with fewer side effects, with potential immunoprotective and anti-inflammatory effect. Specific molecular patterns characterize exosomes' cargo according to the cellular origin, epigenetic modifications, environmental state, and stressor factors. Therefore, the identification of specific cargo's profile associated to pain states may lead to recognize specific pathological states and to consider the use of exosomes as biomarkers of diseases. Furthermore, exosomes' ability to transfer information and their presence in many accessible biological fluids suggest a potential use as novel non-invasive therapeutic tools in pain field.

AB  - Background: Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others. Individuals with a brain lesion following a stroke exhibit a compromised ability to perform ToM tasks. Objective: To analyze studies that evaluated ToM in stroke survivors considering the lesion localization and performance on ToM tests. Methods: The searches were carried out until November 28, 2018, using the following search terms: "social cognition" or "Theory of Mind" and "stroke". Searches were conducted in the PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Scopus data bases. The initial search led to the retrieval of 425 articles. After the exclusion of duplicates and the analysis of the titles, abstracts and full texts, 20 articles were selected for the present review. Results: The studies showed that patients with lesion in the right hemisphere present lower performance on ToM tasks compared to those with lesion in the left hemisphere. In addition, patients with lesion in the right hemisphere presented significant impairment in the performance on ToM tasks compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, the studies that evaluated lesions in specific regions such as temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and temporo-parietal junction, indicated a significant deficit in ToM performance of these patients compared to healthy individuals. Discussion: This review showed that stroke survivors have a poor performance on ToM tasks. The right hemisphere and prefrontal cortex seem to be associated with the deficit of this ability.

AB  - Background
   Previous systematic reviews showed no significant association between epilepsy and challenging behaviours in adults with intellectual disabilities.
   Aims
   To identify whether there is an association between epilepsy and challenging behaviour in adults with intellectual disabilities by carrying out a systematic review of published data. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020178092.
   Method
   We searched five databases and hand-searched six journals. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full articles using a standardised eligibility checklist. Several meta-analyses were carried out.
   Results
   The narrative analysis of data from 34 included articles (14 168 adults with intellectual disabilities, 4781 of whom also had epilepsy) showed no significant association between epilepsy and challenging behaviour. Meta-analysis was possible on data from 16 controlled studies. This showed no significant intergroup difference but after sensitivity analysis meta-analysis of 10 studies showed a significantly higher rate of overall challenging behaviour in the epilepsy group (effect size: 0.16) compared with the non-epilepsy group. Aggression and self-injurious behaviour both showed a statistically significant higher rate in the epilepsy group, with very small effect sizes (0.16 and 0.28 respectively). No significant intergroup difference was observed in the rate of stereotypy.
   Conclusions The findings are contradictory and must be interpreted with caution because of the difficulty in pooling data from varied studies, which is likely to introduce confounding. Where significant differences were found, effect sizes are small and may not be clinically significant, and there are major methodological flaws in the included studies, which should be addressed in future large-scale properly controlled studies.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing joint estimates of the work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates), with contributions from a large network of individual experts. Evidence from mechanistic data and prior studies suggests that exposure to long working hours may cause stroke. In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from stroke that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. Objectives: We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and >= 55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on stroke (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence, and mortality). Data sources: A protocol was developed and published, applying the Navigation Guide to systematic reviews as an organizing framework where feasible. We searched electronic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, CISDOC, PsycINFO, and WHO ICTRP. We also searched grey literature databases, Internet search engines, and organizational websites; hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews; and consulted additional experts. Study eligibility and criteria: We included working-age (>= 15 years) individuals in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged < 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and >= 55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on stroke (prevalence, incidence or mortality). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first review stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined relative risks using random-effects meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using the Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project. Results: Twenty-two studies (20 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 839,680 participants (364,616 females) in eight countries from three WHO regions (Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with administrative health records (13 studies), self-reported physician diagnosis (7 studies), direct diagnosis by a physician (1 study) or during a medical interview (1 study). The outcome was defined as an incident non-fatal stroke event in nine studies (7 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies), incident fatal stroke event in one cohort study and incident non-fatal or fatal ("mixed") event in 12 studies (all cohort studies).
   Cohort studies were judged to have a relatively low risk of bias; therefore, we prioritized evidence from these studies, but synthesised evidence from case-control studies as supporting evidence. For the bodies of evidence for both outcomes with any eligible studies (i.e. stroke incidence and mortality), we did not have serious concerns for risk of bias (at least for the cohort studies). Eligible studies were found on the effects of long working hours on stroke incidence and mortality, but not prevalence. Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were uncertain about the effect on incidence of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (relative risk (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.14, 18 studies, 277,202 participants, I-2 0%, low quality of evidence). There may have been an increased risk for acquiring stroke when working 49-54 h/week compared with 35-40 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.28, 17 studies, 275,181participants, I-2 0%, p 0.04, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, working >= 55 h/week may have led to a moderate, clinically meaningful increase in the risk of acquiring stroke, when followed up between one year and 20 years (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.61, 7 studies, 162,644 participants, I-2 3%, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were very uncertain about the effect on dying (mortality) of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91-1.12, 12 studies, 265,937 participants, I-2 0%, low quality of evidence), 49-54 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99-1.29, 11 studies, 256,129 participants, I-2 0%, low quality of evidence) and 55 h/week (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89-1.31, 10 studies, 664,647 participants, I-2 20%, low quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for differences by WHO region, age, sex, socioeconomic status and type of stroke. Sensitivity analyses found no differences by outcome definition (exclusively non-fatal or fatal versus "mixed") except for the comparison working >= 55 h/week versus 35-40 h/week for stroke incidence (p for subgroup differences: 0.05), risk of bias ("high"/"probably high" ratings in any domain versus "low"/"probably low" in all domains), effect estimate measures (risk versus hazard versus odds ratios) and comparator (exact versus approximate definition). Conclusions: We judged the existing bodies of evidence for human evidence as "inadequate evidence for harmfulness" for all exposure categories for stroke prevalence and mortality and for exposure to 41-48 h/week for stroke incidence. Evidence on exposure to 48-54 h/week and >= 55 h/week was judged as "limited evidence for harmfulness" and "sufficient evidence for harmfulness" for stroke incidence, respectively. Producing estimates for the burden of stroke attributable to exposures to working 48-54 and >= 55 h/week appears evidencebased, and the pooled effect estimates presented in this systematic review could be used as input data for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.

AB  - The pioneer works of Marc Dax and Paul Broca on the association between left hemisphere injuries and speech impairments, revealed one of the most intriguing properties of the brain - asymmetry. Since then, lateralized features have been observed in virtually all phylogenetic branches, suggesting evolutionary conservation, although its adaptive role is still not clear. In humans, the field remains greatly shaped by early observations on language, but the advent of brain imaging revealed that functional and structural laterality is not only widespread, extending to memory, decision-making and emotion, but also that it is plastic. In this review, we systematize information regarding structural and functional hemispheric asymmetries of the healthy brain and their associations with cognition and behavior. We briefly explore evolutionary theories and the pathways for asymmetry development, but mostly we focus on central nervous system asymmetries of the adult human, bridging towards the laboratory rodent for mechanistic explanations.

AB  - This review presents recent knowledge on the neuroprotective effects of vitamin D and their usefulness as oral supplementation when combined with other molecules, such as curcumin. A critical look at the effectiveness of vitamin D in this field is also provided. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in neuroprotection and in the cognitive decline associated with aging, where vitamin D's levels are related to the levels of several neurotrophic factors. An important role of vitamin D has also been observed in the mechanism of neuroinflammation, which is the basis of several aging conditions, including cognitive decline and neurodegeration; furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of vitamin D in the cognitive decline of aging has recently been reported. For this reason, many food supplements created for humans contain vitamin D alone or combined with other molecules with antioxidant properties. However, recent studies also explored negative consequences of the use at a high dosage of vitamin D. Vitamin D in tissues or brain cells can also modulate calbindin-D28K, parvalbumin, and calretinin, and is involved in immune function, thanks also to the combination with curcumin. Curcumin acts as a free radical scavenger and antioxidant, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage. In particular, curcumin is a potent immune-regulatory agent and its administration has been reported to attenuate cognitive impairments. These effects could be exploited in the future to control the mechanisms that lead to the brain decay typical of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Clinical practice guidelines direct mental health services to provide preventive care to address client chronic disease risk behaviours, however, this care is not routinely provided. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to increase provision of preventive care by mental health services; by care element (ask, assess, advice, assist, arrange) and risk behaviour (tobacco smoking, poor nutrition, harmful alcohol consumption, physical inactivity). Electronic bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, relevant journals, and included study reference lists were searched. Eligible studies were of any design with a comparison group that reported the effectiveness of an intervention to increase the provision of at least one element of preventive care for at least one risk behaviour in a mental health setting. Twenty studies were included, most commonly examining smoking (n = 20) and 'ask' (n = 12). Meta-analysis found interventions involving task shifting were effective in increasing smoking 'advice' (n = 2 RCTs; p = 0.009) and physical activity 'advice' (n = 2 RCTs; p = 0.002). Overall, meta-analysis and narrative synthesis indicated that effective intervention strategies (categorised according to the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care taxonomy) were: task shifting, educational meetings, health information systems, local consensus processes, authority and accountability, and reminders. The most consistent findings across studies were with regard to preventive care for smoking, while conflicting or limited evidence was found regarding other risk behaviours. While further rigorous research examining key risk behaviours is recommended, the findings may inform the selection of strategies for future interventions and service delivery initiatives.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no effective curative treatment available and minimal palliative care. Mutations in the gene encoding the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are a well-recognized genetic cause of ALS, and an imbalance in energy homeostasis correlates closely to disease susceptibility and progression. Considering previous research supporting a plethora of downstream cellular impairments originating in the histopathological signature of TDP-43, and the solid evidence around metabolic dysfunction in ALS, a causal association between TDP-43 pathology and metabolic dysfunction cannot be ruled out. Here we discuss how TDP-43 contributes on a molecular level to these impairments in energy homeostasis, and whether the protein's pathological effects on cellular metabolism differ from those of other genetic risk factors associated with ALS such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) and fused in sarcoma (FUS).

AB  - The etiopathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains largely unclear. Among other biological hypotheses, researchers have evidenced an imbalance in the endocannabinoid (eCB) system, which regulates some functions typically impaired in ASD, such as emotional responses and social interaction. Additionally, cannabidiol (CBD), the non-intoxicating component of Cannabis sativa, was recently approved for treatment-resistant epilepsy. Epilepsy represents a common medical condition in people with ASD. Additionally, the two conditions share some neuropathological mechanisms, particularly GABAergic dysfunctions. Hence, it was hypothesized that cannabinoids could be useful in improving ASD symptoms. Our systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and aimed to summarize the literature regarding the use of cannabinoids in ASD. After searching in Web of Knowledge (TM), PsycINFO, and Embase, we included ten studies (eight papers and two abstracts). Four ongoing trials were retrieved in ClinicalTrials.gov. The findings were promising, as cannabinoids appeared to improve some ASD-associated symptoms, such as problem behaviors, sleep problems, and hyperactivity, with limited cardiac and metabolic side effects. Conversely, the knowledge of their effects on ASD core symptoms is scarce. Interestingly, cannabinoids generally allowed to reduce the number of prescribed medications and decreased the frequency of seizures in patients with comorbid epilepsy. Mechanisms of action could be linked to the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance found in people with ASD. However, further trials with better characterization and homogenization of samples, and well-defined outcomes should be implemented.

TI  - Metoclopramide-Induced Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A Review Study
KW  - Metoclopramide
KW  - Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)
KW  - Prognosis
KW  - Treatment
KW  - RISK
AB  - Context: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been introduced as a rare but lethal and idiosyncratic reaction to neuroleptics/antipsychotics. The most obvious risk of this syndrome is the use of neuroleptics, especially high-potency ones. Metoclopramide is also known as an anti-nausea medication administered before surgery to manage digestive problems.
   Evidence Acquisition: Formerly, it had been assumed that metoclopramide was a type of chlorobenzamide that was not in the phenothiazine group but free of extrapyramidal side effects (EPSs). The sequential reports of complications indicate that metoclopramide can cause EPSs and drug-induced motor side effects. A total number of 5044 articles were obtained after the initial search. Then, two researchers independently screened out their titles, and abstracts and 20 articles were finally selected based on the inclusion criteria.
   Results: Of the 20 articles reporting metoclopramide-induced NMS, treatments had been successful in 16 (80%) cases, but it had led to death in four (20%) patients. There were 11 and 8 male and female patients, respectively, and gender was not mentioned for a patient in one article. The age range of the patients was from six months to 84 years, and the mean age was 50.92 years.
   Conclusions: Although NMS following metoclopramide intake is reported very rarely, it should be considered for any psychiatric symptoms with unexpected mental changes, muscle rigidity, and fever after being treated with metoclopramide. The neuroleptic malignant syndrome can occur following multiple doses or just one dose of metoclopramide. Also, metoclopramide use in patients affected with kidney failure is accompanied by a higher risk of NMS. A previous history of NMS, a recent episode of catatonia, and severe agitation are all taken into account as risk factors in this domain.

AB  - In the last decades, given the necessity of assisting fragile citizens, of which elderly represent a significant portion, a considerable research effort has been devoted to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in daily living to promote activity, social connections, and independence. With similar purposes, in recent years psychologists proposed the novel paradigm of Positive Psychology (PP), the scientific study of positive human functioning and flourishing on multiple levels. The joint effort between ICT and PP has led to the definition of the emerging field of Positive Technology (PT), with the aim of developing technology consciously designed to foster well-being in individuals and groups. In this paper we review PT focusing on frameworks involving computer vision and machine learning for promoting cognitive, physical, emotional and social elderly well-being. Our discussion highlights a significant gap between theoretical needs and technological systems availability, suggesting future lines of research. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Results of studies on peripheral blood levels of homocysteine (Hcy) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are inconsistent, and conclusions from two previous meta-analyses on this subject published in 2012 are already outdated. Therefore, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively summarize the peripheral blood Hcy data in children with ASD compared with healthy controls (HC). We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to September 2019 for eligible studies, with no language restriction. Using random-effects model, we computed summary statistics. Thirty-one studies (3304 participants including 1641 cases) were included. The pooled results showed that the peripheral blood Hcy levels were significantly elevated in children with ASD when compared to HC (Hedges's g = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.76, P < 0.001). By sensitivity analyses, we confirmed that our results were quite robust. Additionally, no publication bias was observed in this meta -analysis. In conclusion, our study support the association of increased circulating Hcy levels with ASD in children, and the involvement of Hcy in the occurrence of ASD. However, in view of the significant between-study heterogeneity, the conclusions should be interpreted cautiously and more investigation is required.

AB  - As a type of stress, maternal separation (MS) has been one of the most widely used models in neuropsychiatric research. An increasing number of studies has found that MS not only affects the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine system, but also causes dysfunction of the central dopamine (DA) system and increases the susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons to pathogenic factors of Parkinson's disease (PD), for instance, 6-hydroxydopamine, thus impairing motor function. We reviewed the impact of MS on the DA system and its correlation with PD and found the following: (1) discrepant effects of MS on the DA system have been reported; (2) MS is a good model to study the impact of stress on the occurrence and development of PD, however, unified modeling criteria of MS are required; (3) correlation between MS and PD may involve the impact of MS on the DA system, which however is not the only connection; (4) intervening measures can block pathways between MS and PD, which provides reference for the prevention of PD in specific populations such as left-behind children.

While the field, and thus the collected publications, are dominated by Western approaches, particular attention is paid in this analysis to publications from geographies that are not from the United States or Western Europe, especially these world regions: Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Similarly, while the study of religiosity is considerably centered around Christianity, this analysis extends beyond Christianity, to the extent possible in extant studies, to include publications investigating other world religious traditions, such as African spirituality, African witchcraft, Afro-Caribbean religious traditions, Buddhism, Confucianism, folk religions, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Neo-paganism, New Religious Movements (NRMs), Shamanism, Sikhism, Spiritism, Taoism, and spirituality generally. A total of 530 publications were reviewed, and the studies are categorized by unit of analysis into: Macro, micro, and meso-level. Measurement constructs include religious demography, culture, belonging, behaving, believing, bonding, religious salience, spiritual identities, religious networks, occupations, congregations, denominations, and faith-based organizations. Non-Western sources and approaches are analyzed toward furthering future research in under-studied world regions. Implications are drawn for the field, such as the need to geo-code publications at the country level.

AB  - Background For managing nonmotor symptoms (NMS) in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion is of interest as it shows lesser plasma fluctuations of both drugs as compared to oral levodopa-carbidopa (LC). Objectives To highlight LCIG effect in NMS among advanced PD patients and appraise the currently available literature. Methods PubMed screening (till 2020) of 184 articles was done, of which 51 were selected. Among them, 23 original articles relevant to the research question were included, of which 6 were then excluded after careful reading of full articles. The 17 relevant studies of the review provide Grade C level of evidence of efficacy. Results LCIG is beneficial in improving or relieving various NMS especially (mood, cognition/memory, sleep, gastrointestinal symptoms, urinary symptoms, and quality of life questionnaires) in patients with advanced PD. Amelioration of motor functions or direct relations may lead to improvement in NMS PD patients using LCIG. Adverse events noted in patients treated with LCIG include pneumoperitoneum, abdominal pain, stoma infection, reversible peripheral neuropathy, local tube problems, impulse control disorder, and weight loss. Serious adverse events were mostly found to be unrelated to LCIG. Conclusions LCIG provides an uninterrupted intestinal levodopa infusion by percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J). It effectively decreases plasma fluctuations of levodopa and reduces motor instability and NMS burden in advanced PD. However, adequate dose modification and individualization of therapy are essential for optimal effect.

AB  - This integrative review analyzed the research on consumer involvement in mental health nursing education in the last decade. We aimed to derive the main contents, methods, and outcomes of education using consumer involvement for mental health nursing students. We searched six electronic databases using English and Korean search terms; two authors independently reviewed the 14 studies that met the selection criteria. Studies on the topic were concentrated in Australia and some European countries; most of them used a qualitative design. The main education subject was recovery, and consumers tended to actively participate in education planning. Moreover, students' perceptions about education using consumer involvement and people with mental health problems changed positively, as well as their experiences of participating in mental health nursing education. There is a lack of interest in the topic in Asian countries, including Korea. Thus, future studies in Asian countries are needed to conduct qualitative and in-depth explorations of students' experiences regarding an educational intervention that uses consumer involvement as a tool rigorously designed for mental health nursing education. Consumer involvement can be an innovative strategy to produce high-quality mental health nurses by minimizing the gap between theory and practice in the undergraduate program.

AB  - Neurotheology is an emerging academic discipline that examines mind-brain relationships in terms of the inter-relatedness of neuroscience, spirituality, and religion. Neurotheology originated from brain-scan studies that revealed specific correlations between certain religious thoughts and localized activated brain areas known as "God Spots." This relatively young scholarly discipline lacks clear consensus on its definition, ideology, purpose, or prospects for future research. Of special interest is the consideration of the next steps using brain scans to develop this field of research. This review proposes nine categories of future research that could build on the foundation laid by the prior discoveries of God Spots. Specifically, this analysis identifies some sparsely addressed issues that could be usefully explored with new kinds of brain-scan studies: neural network operations, the cognitive neuroscience of prayer, biology of belief, measures of religiosity, role of the self, learning and memory, religious and secular cognitive commonalities, static and functional anatomy, and recruitment of neural processing circuitry. God Spot research is poised to move beyond observation to robust hypothesis generation and testing.

AB  - Objective: In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) included the diagnostic criteria of Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Then, in 2019, the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) categorized gaming disorder (GD) as an addictive disorder. This review aimed to review the raised concerns, debate, and research of IGD or GD criteria and provide suggestions to resolve them. Methods: A narrative review was conducted, and PubMed was searched for articles mentioning concerns and research on the DSM-5 criteria for IGD, ICD-11 criteria for GD, or criteria for other synonyms, such as problematic gaming or gaming addiction. A total of 107 articles were identified. Results: Concerns were organized into three categories: conceptual framework, moral panic, and diagnostic validity. Most argumentations supported the proposition that GD and other substance use disorders have similar presentations. A clear definition of GD and adequate public education could prevent rather than exacerbate moral panic. Several researchers reported concerns regarding the nosology, diagnostic validity, and wording of each criterion. However, the threshold, five of the nine criteria with impaired function, demonstrated adequate validity in interview studies. Conclusion: The current findings support the addiction framework, functional impairment, and validity of the GD criteria. However, further prospective, experimental, and clinical studies validating these findings are warranted. Moreover, an integrative review or debate conference could contribute to the organization of the available results and concept development. Aggregating adequate scientific information could allay or resolve concerns related to the diagnosis of GD.

AB  - Authoritative classification systems for psychopathology such as the DSM and ICD are shifting toward more dimensional approaches in the field of personality disorders (PDs). In this paper, we provide a brief overview of the dimensionally oriented DSM-5 alternative model of PDs (AMPD). Since its publication in 2013, the AMPD has inspired a substantial number of studies, underlining its generative influence on the field. Generally speaking, this literature illustrates both the reliability and validity of the constructs delineated in the AMPD. The literature also illustrates empirical challenges to the conceptual clarity of the AMPD, such as evidence of substantial correlations between indices of personality functioning (criterion A in the AMPD) and maladaptive personality traits (criterion B in the AMPD). Key future directions pertain to linking the AMPD literature with applied efforts to improve the lives of persons who suffer from PDs, and surmounting challenges germane to the evolution of the DSM itself.

AB  - Background Several neuroablative procedures are available for severe and treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but limited knowledge about their relative clinical advantages and disadvantages poses obstacles for treatment decision-making. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane Library for reports up to February 2019. We reviewed the literature on the effectiveness (assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [Y-BOCS]) and safety of various neuroablative interventions for severe and treatment-resistant OCD. Results We included 23 studies involving 487 patients in the systematic review; 21 studies with 459 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, neuroablation achieved a response rate (proportion of patients with >= 35% reduction in Y-BOCS) of 55%. Most of the adverse events (88.4%) were mild and transient. The top 3 adverse events were headache (14.9%), cognitive deficits (9.1%) and behaviour problems (8.1%). Severe or permanent adverse events included personality changes (2.3%) and brain edema or brain cyst (1.5%). The response rates associated with capsulotomy, limbic leucotomy and cingulotomy were 59% (95% confidence interval [CI] 54-65), 47% (95% CI 23-72) and 36% (95% CI 23-50), respectively. Interventions with different coverages of the dorsal part of the internal capsule were associated with different adverse-event profiles but were unlikely to modify clinical effectiveness. Limitations The level of evidence of most included studies was relatively low. Conclusion Ablative surgeries are safe and effective for a large proportion of patients with severe and treatment-resistant OCD. Among the available procedures, capsulotomy seemed to be the most effective. Further research is needed to improve clinical effectiveness and minimize risks.

AB  - In recent years, many studies have investigated the correlations between Parkinson's disease (PD) and vitamin D status, but the conclusion remains elusive. The present review focuses on the associations between PD and serum vitamin D levels by reviewing studies on the associations of PD with serum vitamin D levels and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. We found that PD patients have lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls and that the vitamin D concentrations are negatively correlated with PD risk and severity. Furthermore, higher vitamin D concentrations are linked to better cognitive function and mood in PD patients. Findings on the relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and the risk of PD are inconsistent, but theFokI(C/T) polymorphism is significantly linked with PD. The occurrence ofFokI(C/T) gene polymorphism may influence the risk, severity, and cognitive ability of PD patients, while also possibly influencing the effect of Vitamin D(3)supplementation in PD patients. In view of the neuroprotective effects of vitamin D and the close association between vitamin D and dopaminergic neurotransmission, interventional prospective studies on vitamin D supplementation in PD patients should be conducted in the future.

AB  - Overweight and obesity are defined as an unnecessary accumulation of fat, which poses a risk to health. It is a well-identified risk factor for increased mortality due to heightened rates of heart disease, certain cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, and bacterial, protozoan and viral infections. The increasing prevalence of obesity is of concern, as conventional pathogenesis may indeed be increased in obese hosts rather than healthy hosts, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a new disease and we do not have the luxury of cumulative data. Obesity activates the development of gene induced hypoxia and adipogenesis in obese animals. Several factors can influence obesity, for example, stress can increase the body weight by allowing people to consume high amounts of food with a higher propensity to consume palatable food. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of immune-mediated and some inflammatory-mediated diseases, including atherosclerosis and psoriasis, leading to a dampened immune response to infectious agents, leading to weaker post-infection impacts. Moreover, the obese host creates a special microenvironment for disease pathogenesis, marked by persistent low-grade inflammation. Therefore, it is advisable to sustain healthy eating habits by increasing the consumption of various plant-based and low-fat foods to protect our bodies and decrease the risk of infectious diseases, especially COVID-19.

AB  - In the experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), a well-known neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine or MPTP, pesticides like benomyl, paraquat,etc. are successfully used to induce a Parkinson's disease in human and nonhuman primates, which can be reversed by the drugs such as L-DOPA. A review on the alternative methods and alternative models in Parkinson's disease is documented here to understand their advantages and importance. Earlier researchers proved MPTP is effective in the goldfish, which reliably mirrors the neurochemical and behavioral changes caused by MPTP in the higher vertebrates. Gold fish brain has the "nucleus pars medialis," similar to the substanitia nigra of the human brain can be destructed by chemicals like MPTP, 6-hydroxydopamine and has selective protection by L-Dopa (Levodopa) and MAO-B (Monoamine oxidase B) inhibitors. In addition, zebrafish along with mice was successfully employed in the study of pesticides leading to neurodegeneration in PD. As the current animal models often couldn't replicate the true pathophysiology of idiopathic PD, alternative models have gained importance in the research. Upon having a glance at different models utilized in Parkinson's disease studies, one can get an idea on preferring alternative models, especially the zebra fish model in the study of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Background: Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in schizophrenia are common, but incompletely characterized. We aimed to describe and compare the magnitude and heterogeneity of sleep-circadian alterations in remitted schizophrenia and compare them with those in interepisode bipolar disorder. Methods: EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched for case-control studies reporting actigraphic parameters in remitted schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Standardized and absolute mean differences between patients and controls were quantified using Hedges' g, and patient-control differences in variability were quantified using the mean-scaled coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). A wald-type test compared effect sizes between disorders. Results: Thirty studies reporting on 967 patients and 803 controls were included. Compared with controls, both schizophrenia and bipolar groups had significantly longer total sleep time (mean difference [minutes] [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 99.9 [66.8, 133.1] and 31.1 [19.3, 42.9], respectively), time in bed (mean difference = 77.8 [13.7, 142.0] and 50.3 [20.3, 80.3]), but also greater sleep latency (16.5 [6.1, 27.0] and 2.6 [0.5, 4.6]) and reduced motor activity ( standardized mean difference [95% CI] = - 0.86 [-1.22, -0.51] and -0.75 [-1.20, -0.29]). Effect sizes were significantly greater in schizophrenia compared with the bipolar disorder group for total sleep time, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset. CVR was significantly elevated in both diagnoses for total sleep time, time in bed, and relative amplitude. Conclusions: In both disorders, longer overall sleep duration, but also disturbed initiation, continuity, and reduced motor activity were found. Common, modifiable factors may be associated with these sleep-circadian phenotypes and advocate for further development of transdiagnostic interventions that target them.

AB  - Nursing skill mix in inpatient mental health wards varies considerably between countries. Some countries have an all-registered mental health nurse workforce; others have a mix of registered mental health and registered nurses. Understanding the optimal nursing skill mix in mental health inpatient units would inform service planning. This report aims to examine the association between the registered mental health nurse-to-registered nurse ratio and psychiatric readmission (or referral to community crisis services) in adult mental health inpatients. A systematic review was performed. We searched key databases for observational and experimental studies. Two researchers completed title-and-abstract and full-text screening. Our search identified 7956 citations. A full-text review of four papers was undertaken. No studies met our inclusion criteria. We report an empty review. Despite the obvious importance of the research question for the safe staffing of inpatient mental health services, there are no studies that have tested this association.

AB  - Issue addressed Lifestyle interventions use nutrition and physical activity behaviour modification techniques to decrease obesity and cardio-metabolic risk in people with psychosis. Evidence on the specific behaviour modification strategies applied to decrease obesity is weakened by inadequate methodology reporting of lifestyle interventions. A systematic review that we conducted earlier highlighted a possible deficiency in reporting; hence we aim to critically appraise lifestyle intervention studies that target weight outcomes for people with psychosis against the methods component of the CONSORT statement for randomised trials of nonpharmacologic treatments. Methods component We considered randomised controlled studies which delivered lifestyle interventions to community-dwelling adults with psychotic disorders, and included those with the following outcomes of interest: weight, body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE/PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched for English publications between 1985 and 2018. Methodology and reporting of studies were evaluated using the CONSORT statement for randomised trials of nonpharmacologic treatments. Results Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Critical appraisals revealed that reporting of lifestyle intervention studies was generally incomplete. Fewer than 50% provided the recommended information on trial design, participant characteristics, detail of interventions, outcomes, sample size, randomisation, blinding and statistical methods. Conclusions Application of guidelines, like the CONSORT statement, in future publications of lifestyle interventions for people with psychosis will improve accuracy of reporting. So what? Enhanced reporting in lifestyle intervention studies for people with psychosis will promote guideline creation and translation of research, which is likely to positively impact physical health outcomes.

AB  - Headache is a common side effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), but reports on its incidence vary widely. A broad array of treatment regimens have been proposed in the literature. The pathophysiology of post-ECT headache is unclear but a vascular origin has been suggested. A systematic literature search was executed in PubMed and Embase to identify relevant articles. Articles were screened on title, abstract, and full text according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study characteristics and results concerning the incidence of post-ECT headache were extracted, and a weighted mean incidence was calculated. Forty-seven relevant articles were found, of which 36 reported on the incidence of post-ECT headache in patients and 9 on the incidence in sessions. The incidence of post-ECT headache varied greatly in the literature. The weighted mean incidence in patients was 32.8%, as 786 of a total population of 2399 patients experienced headache. The weighted mean incidence in sessions was between 9.4% (246 of 2604 sessions) and 12.1% (236/1958 sessions). The variation in incidences of post-ECT headache found might be due to different methods of measuring headache, different study designs, and different drugs used for anesthesia. The mean-weighted incidence of post-ECT headache in patients was 32.8% and in sessions between 9.4% and 12.1%.

AB  - Introduction: Dental anxiety refers to a set of complex psychological issues bearing a significant impact in individual's lives reflecting in the form of dental visit avoidance, poor dental health status and decreases oral health related quality of life. Hence, it is imperative to consider those factors associated with dental anxiety so as to treat and promote better oral health. The review aimed to assess various factors associated with dental fear and anxiety. Materials and Methods: Literature search was done from Pubmed and Google scholar search engines to identify publications which explored factors associated with dental fear and anxiety. Results: Research evidence pointed a significant relationship of age, gender, maternal anxiety, previous dental experience, and number of siblings with dental fear and anxiety (DFA). Conclusion: Findings of the review clearly suggest that a better understanding of factors causing dental anxiety and phobia will help preventing dental avoidance and providing better care.

AB  - Anthozoa is the most specious class of the phylum Cnidaria that is phylogenetically basal within the Metazoa. It is an interesting group for studying the evolution of mutualisms and immunity, for despite their morphological simplicity, Anthozoans are unexpectedly immunologically complex, with large genomes and gene families similar to those of the Bilateria. Evidence indicates that the Anthozoan innate immune system is not only involved in the disruption of harmful microorganisms, but is also crucial in structuring tissue-associated microbial communities that are essential components of the cnidarian holobiont and useful to the animal's health for several functions including metabolism, immune defense, development, and behavior. Here, we report on the current state of the art of Anthozoan immunity. Like other invertebrates, Anthozoans possess immune mechanisms based on self/non-self-recognition. Although lacking adaptive immunity, they use a diverse repertoire of immune receptor signaling pathways (PRRs) to recognize a broad array of conserved microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMP). The intracellular signaling cascades lead to gene transcription up to endpoints of release of molecules that kill the pathogens, defend the self by maintaining homeostasis, and modulate the wound repair process. The cells play a fundamental role in immunity, as they display phagocytic activities and secrete mucus, which acts as a physicochemical barrier preventing or slowing down the proliferation of potential invaders. Finally, we describe the current state of knowledge of some immune effectors in Anthozoan species, including the potential role of toxins and the inflammatory response in the Mediterranean AnthozoanAnemonia viridisfollowing injection of various foreign particles differing in type and dimensions, including pathogenetic bacteria.

AB  - Workplace violence (WPV) has been extensively studied in hospitals, yet little is known about WPV in outpatient physician clinics. These settings and work tasks may present different risk factors for WPV compared to hospitals, including the handling/exchange of cash, and being remotely located without security presence. We conducted a systematic literature review to describe what is currently known about WPV in outpatient physician clinics. Six literature databases were searched and reference lists from included articles published from 2000-2019. Thirteen quantitative and five qualitative manuscripts were included which all focused on patient/family-perpetrated violence in outpatient physician clinics. No studies examined other violence types (e.g., worker-on-worker; burglary). The overall prevalence of Type II violence ranged from 9.5% to 74.6%, with the most common form being verbal abuse (42.1-94.3%), followed by threat of assault (14.0-57.4%), bullying (2.5-5.7%), physical assault, (0.5-15.9%) and sexual harassment/assault (0.2-9.3%). Worker consequences included reduced work performance, anger, and depression. Most workers did not receive training on how to manage a violent patient. More work is needed to examine the prevalence and risk factors of WPV in outpatient physician clinics for purposes of informing prevention efforts in these settings.

AB  - This review examines longitudinal studies of changes in components of attention following mindfulness training. A total of 57 retreat studies, non-randomized trials, and randomized controlled trials were identified. Employing the classical taxonomy proposed by Posner and Petersen (Annual Review of Neuroscience, 13(1), 25-42, 1990), outcome measures were broadly categorized based on whether they involved maintenance of an aroused state (alerting), selective prioritization of attention to target items (orienting), or assessed conflict monitoring (executive attention). Although many non-randomized and retreat studies provide promising evidence of gains in both alerting and conflict monitoring following mindfulness training, evidence from randomized controlled trials, especially those involving active control comparison groups, is more mixed. This review calls attention to the urgent need in our field of contemplative sciences to adopt the methodological rigor necessary for establishing mindfulness meditation as an effective cognitive rehabilitation tool. Although studies including wait-listed control comparisons were fruitful in providing initial feasibility data and pre-post effect sizes, there is a pressing need to employ standards that have been heavily advocated for in the broader cognitive and physical training literatures. Critically, inclusion of active comparison groups and explicit attention to the reduction of demand characteristics are needed to disentangle the effects of placebo from treatment. Further, detailed protocols for mindfulness and control groups and examination of theoretically guided outcome variables with established metrics for reliability and validity are key ingredients in the systematic study of mindfulness meditation. Adoption of such methodological rigor will allow for causal claims supporting mindfulness training as an efficacious treatment modality for cognitive rehabilitation and enhancement.

AB  - Background and aims: Behavioral addictions such as gambling and gaming disorder are significant public health issues that are of increasing importance to policy makers and health care providers. Problem gambling and gaming behaviors have been identified as being associated with externalizing and internalizing problems, with theoretical models suggesting that both conduct problems and depressive symptoms may be significant risk factors in the development of problem gambling and gaming. As such, the purpose of this systematic review is to provide an overview of research identifying the relationship between conduct problems, depressive symptoms and problem gambling and gaming among adolescents and young adults. Methods: Systematic literature searches in accordance with PRISMA guidelines found 71 eligible studies that met the inclusion criteria, 47 for problem gambling, 23 for problem gaming and one for both problem behaviors. Results: Based on cross-sectional evidence, both problem gambling and gaming are consistently concurrently associated with conduct problems and depressive symptoms. Longitudinal evidence appears to be clearer for conduct problems as a risk factor for problem gambling, and depressive symptoms as a risk factor for problem gaming. However, both risk factors appear to increase the risk for these problem behaviors. Discussion and Conclusions: Results from the literature review suggest that problem gambling and gaming are associated with the presence of conduct problems and depressive symptoms, with the potential of sharing common etiological factors. Additional research is necessary to confirm these longitudinal relationships with an emphasis on investigating the interaction of both early conduct problems and depressive symptoms.

AB  - Integrated care approaches have been recommended to remove barriers to healthcare and improve the physical health outcomes of people living with serious mental illness (SMI) and/or substance use disorders (SUDs). The aim of this systematic scoping review was to describe empirical investigations of interventions designed to integrate physical, mental, and addiction healthcare for this population. An iterative and systematic search of five electronic databases (Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase (Ovid) and Scopus) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and April 2019. Two reviewers independently screened publications in two successive stages of title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening of eligible publications. Data from each included publication were extracted independently by two reviewers using a standardised spreadsheet. A total of 28 eligible publications were identified, representing 25 unique studies. Over half of the included studies investigated the use of case managers to provide self-management skills or to coordinate mental and physical healthcare (n = 14). Other interventions examined the co-location of services (n = 9) and the implementation of screening and referral pathways to specialist treatment (n = 2). Less than half of the included studies described a framework, theory or model that was underpinning the intervention tested. While some aspects of integrated care have been identified and addressed by interventions, other key dimensions have not been considered, such as shared decision-making. Identification of a comprehensive model of integrated care is recommended to inform the development and evaluation of future interventions for people with SMI/SUDs.

AB  - Indicators of ecosystem health are effective tools to assess freshwater ecosystem impairment. However, they are scarcely used as a monitoring tool by local environmental agencies in Argentina. Here, we review the literature to analyze the use of ecosystem health indicators in freshwaters from Argentina. We found 91 scientific articles relating to the use of ecological indices to assess the impact of different environmental stressors in aquatic environments published between 1996 and 2019. We generated Google Earth map where we deployed the sampling sites and type of indices reported by each article. As biological indices were the most used, we also surveyed bioindication experts to gather information on their application. We found that most studies were concentrated mainly in Pampas (34%), Dry Chaco (20%), Espinal (12%), and Patagonian Steppe (10%) ecoregions. Biological indices (mainly with invertebrates) were more used than geomorphological or physico-chemical indices. Indices resulted useful to evaluate the impact of stressors in 63% of cases, being land use the most studied stressor. However, sampling design varied greatly among studies, making their comparison difficult. The information compiled here could help to the design of monitoring protocols, the adoption of regional indices, and the creation of a national inventory of ecosystem health status, which are mandatory to propose well-grounded conservation and management policies for freshwaters in Argentina.

AB  - A set of common-acting iron-responsive 5'untranslated region (5'UTR) motifs can fold into RNA stem loops that appear significant to the biology of cognitive declines of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), Lewy body dementia (LDD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neurodegenerative diseases exhibit perturbations of iron homeostasis in defined brain subregions over characteristic time intervals of progression. While misfolding of A beta from the amyloid-precursor-protein (APP), alpha-synuclein, prion protein (PrP) each cause neuropathic protein inclusions in the brain subregions, iron-responsive-like element (IRE-like) RNA stem-loops reside in their transcripts. APP and alpha syn have a role in iron transport while gene duplications elevate the expression of their products to cause rare familial cases of AD and PDD. Of note, IRE-like sequences are responsive to excesses of brain iron in a potential feedback loop to accelerate neuronal ferroptosis and cognitive declines as well as amyloidosis. This pathogenic feedback is consistent with the translational control of the iron storage protein ferritin. We discuss how the IRE-like RNA motifs in the FUTRs of APP, alpha-synuclein and PrP mRNAs represent uniquely folded drug targets for therapies to prevent perturbed iron homeostasis that accelerates AD, PD, PD dementia (PDD) and Lewy body dementia, thus preventing cognitive deficits. Inhibition of alpha-synuclein translation is an option to block manganese toxicity associated with early childhood cognitive problems and manganism while Pb toxicity is epige-netically associated with attention deficit and later-stage AD. Pathologies of heavy metal toxicity centered on an embargo of iron export may be treated with activators of APP and ferritin and inhibitors of alpha-synuclein translation.

AB  - Theory of Mind, empathy, and action observation are central themes in social neuroscience research. Meta-analyses of functional neuroimaging studies show substantial heterogeneity in brain activation for these cognitive abilities, depending on the type of experimental task used. We followed up on these findings by a comparison to basic connectivity networks of the brain. In particular, we evaluated to what extent brain activation for social cognition tasks draws on areas of different fMRI resting-state networks (e.g., Default Mode, Ventral Attention Network) in parallel. Our review illustrates high prevalence of such network co-recruitments across Theory of Mind, empathy, and action observation tasks. To characterize these observations in more detail, we additionally conducted a literature review of fMRI effective connectivity studies. Findings reveal two main types of cross-network interactions in social cognition tasks: Negative coupling (segregation) between Default Mode and Control Networks (Ventral Attention, Frontoparietal, and Dorsal Attention Network), and positive coupling (integration) between these networks. The two patterns reflect different types of brain network organization taking place in the context of social cognition tasks-segregation for specialized, versus integration for flexible processing. We discuss evidence from connectivity research in other research fields, suggesting that increased network integration indicates more effortful and controlled processing. Based on that, we consider how findings of network segregation versus integration can provide new perspectives on dual-system accounts of social cognition, which differentiate between automatic and controlled processes. Moreover, we discuss how the reviewed evidence relates to neural processes which are assumed to take place during naturalistic social cognition. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose of review This review of the literature examines the most recent advances in the battle to improve the physical health of people with severe mental illness. Covering the 2018/2019 time period, the article offers a glance of future healthcare models and research directions. Recent findings A systematic search of the PubMed and Cochrane databases, along with additional journal articles available online but not yet allocated to a journal edition, produced a total of 24 journal articles suitable for review. The review period was from January 2018 to December 2019. The four main themes of investigation, intervention, integration and training emerged. The uptake and integration of primary care into mental health services for people with SMI is still facing many barriers. Healthy lifestyle and physical activity interventions need to run alongside medical treatment for both mental and physical health in order to provide holistic care. To do this, clarification of professional roles and responsibility need to be defined and adhered to, along with additional training for staff and coordination of services.

AB  - The effect of light therapy in treating seasonal affective disorder has been demonstrated amongst previous studies. However, the effect of light therapy in treating non-seasonal depression remains unclear. This meta analysis aimed to determine the efficacy of light therapy in non-seasonal depression. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical Database up to February 2020. The pooled post-trial standardized mean difference in depression scores with corresponding 95% confidence intervals was calculated to evaluate the efficacy of light therapy in non-seasonal depression. A total of 23 RCTs with 1120 participants were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated the light therapy was significantly more effective than comparative treatments. Subgroup analyses revealed that none of the factors explained the significantly heterogeneity. Light therapy has a statistically significant mild to moderate treatment effect in reducing depressive symptoms, can be used as a clinical therapy in treating non-seasonal depression. But the quality of evidence is still low, more well-designed studies with larger sample size and high quality are needed to confirm the efficiency of light therapy in treating non-seasonal depression.

AB  - Background
   Research in schizophrenia and pregnancy has traditionally been conducted in small samples. More recently, secondary analysis of routine healthcare data has facilitated access to data on large numbers of women with schizophrenia.
   Aims
   To discuss four scientific advances using data from Canada, Denmark and the UK from population-level health registers and clinical data sources.
   Method
   Narrative review of research from these three countries to illustrate key advances in the area of schizophrenia and pregnancy.
   Results
   Health administrative and clinical data from electronic medical records have been used to identify population-level and clinical cohorts of women with schizophrenia, and follow them longitudinally along with their children. These data have demonstrated that fertility rates in women with schizophrenia have increased over time and have enabled documentation of the course of illness in relation with pregnancy, showing the early postpartum as the time of highest risk. As a result of large sample sizes, we have been able to understand the prevalence of and risk factors for rare outcomes that would be difficult to study in clinical research. Advanced pharmaco-epidemiological methods have been used to address confounding in studies of antipsychotic medications in pregnancy, to provide data about the benefits and risks of treatment for women and their care providers.
   Conclusions
   Use of these data has advanced the field of research in schizophrenia and pregnancy. Future developments in use of electronic health records include access to richer data sources and use of modern technical advances such as machine learning and supporting team science.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has a profound impact on people with existing mental disorders, augmenting the prevailing inequalities in mental health.
   Methods: In order to understand the status of telepsychiatry in India and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health and its potential applications, a scoping review was done between March 2020 and May 2020. The literature review revealed 253 papers, which were used to derive the primary framework for analysis. The information was then reviewed for ideas and concepts, which were integrated with evidence from gray literature and categorized under broader themes based on the insights derived. Finally, a thematic framework was developed for discussion to tailor scientific information for decision-makers' needs.
   Results: Review findings are summarized under the following headings: changing patterns of health-seeking behavior, origin and evolution of telepsychiatry, possible applications of telepsychiatry and AI, technological features, and AI models in mental health.
   Conclusions: Though there are several potential opportunities, the time is not yet ripe for telepsychiatry and AI to be adopted fully in the field of mental health care. But it is time that we develop indigenous proprietary technology and test and validate it. With many solutions offered by telepsychiatry and AI, psychiatrists must choose an appropriate tool based on their requirements, availability of resources, and feasibility of deployment. Harmony between conventional care and technology-based care must be reached gradually.

AB  - Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can become biologically embedded leaving a lasting signature on multiple body systems. ACE scores have been used to associate childhood adversity to a wide range of adverse health conditions over the life course, most notably substance-related disorders. Multiple studies have shown that the presence of elevated ACE scores predicts obesity in adulthood. However, a gap exists in the literature elucidating the pathways from childhood adversity to increased BMI in adulthood. We systematically reviewed these mechanisms as well as discuss novel plausible pathways. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science and after applying exclusion criteria identified 18 articles for qualitative analysis. The most commonly cited mechanisms linking ACEs to obesity are social disruption, health behaviors, and chronic stress response. Ten observational studies (n =118,691) were quantitatively summarized and demonstrated a positive association between ACE and adult obesity with a pooled odds ratio of 1.46 (CI = 1.28, 1.64) with moderate heterogeneity (I-2 = 70.8%). Our results found a 46% increase in the odds of adult obesity following exposure to multiple ACEs. Based on our qualitative synthesis and review of the most recent relevant literature, we propose biologically plausible explanations for the significant positive relationship between ACEs and adult obesity. Reducing exposure to ACEs, improved screening and detection of trauma, better access to trauma-informed care, and improvements to the food environment are likely to improve downstream health outcomes related to eating behavior.

AB  - Crowd simulation has emerged in the last decade as a widely used method of visual effects, computer games, and urban planning, etc. The improvement of hardware performance and the urgent need of special effect lead to an unprecedented wave of crowd simulation studies. This paper reports a review of crowd simulation models from traditional methods to recent methods (e.g. group simulation, emotion contagion). Traditional models can simulate general crowd dynamics which have the advantages of both microscopic and macroscopic models. The recent studies of crowd simulation from group simulation to social psychology crowds are possible to simulate realistic crowds. The purpose of this review is to introduce commonly used crowd simulation methods for newcomers to this field by making a systematic literature review, discussions and analysis of different models. The results reveal the traditional models can simulate most of the normal crowds, but lack expressiveness for special groups which needs to be solved urgently in the current applications, particularly on visual effects and urban planning. Group simulation and emotion contagion could improve the simulation realism, but it also needs to be improved in computation cost and model optimization. Also, future research directions are suggested aiming to develop new applications focused on more realistic, natural and efficient crowd simulation.

AB  - Cancer is one of the most common diseases and suicide is one of the causes of cancer patients' mortality. However, the suicide mortality rate in cancer patients has not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and a meta-analysis of suicide mortality risk in cancer patients. The authors systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, psycInfo, and Google Scholar databases using MESH keywords until July 2018; searching was limited to English. Random effects model was used for meta-analyzing the studies. Forest plot was calculated for the whole of the 22 studies and the subgroups. Publication bias was examined, and qualitative evaluation of the articles entered into the meta-analysis was also carried out. 22 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) for suicide mortality (SMR = 1.55; 95% and confidence interval (CI) CI = 1.37-1.74) in cancer patients were achieved. It has been shown (SMR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.48-1.89 and p<0.001) that cancer has increased suicidal rates in men and also in women (SMR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.20-1.50 and p<0.001). The following results were reported based on the subtypes of cancer; pooled SMR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.32-3.23, and p<0.001 in esophagus, stomach, pancreas and liver cancers; SMR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.26-1.97, and p<0.001 in colon and rectum cancers; SMR = 3.07; 95% CI = 2.20-4.28, and p<0.001 in bronchus, trachea and lung cancers; SMR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.03-1.48, and p=0.020 in breast cancer; SMR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.38-2.12, and p<0.001 in prostate cancer. Overall, there is an evaluated suicide mortality rate in cancer patients. There was some evidence of publication bias. Our findings indicate that cancer increases the risk of suicide. Given the results and co-morbidities between suicide-induced cancer and other psychological disorders, the development of psychological interventions can be useful in reducing the risk of suicide in these patients.

AB  - Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Prolonged excessive alcohol intake contributes to increased production of reactive oxygen species that triggers neuroimmune response and cellular apoptosis and necrosis via lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial, protein or DNA damage. Long term binge alcohol consumption also upregulates glutamate receptors, glucocorticoids and reduces reuptake of glutamate in the central nervous system, resulting in glutamate excitotoxicity, and eventually mitochondrial injury and cell death. In this review, we delineate the following principles in alcohol-induced neurodegeneration: (1) alcohol-induced oxidative stress, (2) neuroimmune response toward increased oxidants and lipopolysaccharide, (3) glutamate excitotoxicity and cell injury, and (4) interplay between oxidative stress, neuroimmune response and excitotoxicity leading to neurodegeneration and (5) potential chronic alcohol intake-induced development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

AB  - No reviews to date have summarized the views of parents on the functional challenges and/or strengths of their children with autism spectrum disorder. We set out to perform a scoping review aiming (a) to identify and collate global results to provide a broad description of parental perspective of functioning research and (b) to summarize these using the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health-Child and Youth version framework. The International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health provides a language to describe the functional skills of an individual with a health condition in terms of their body structures, body functions, activities and participation, their environmental and personal factors. Given the influence that context has on functioning, and the potential impact of economic status on availability of resources, we were specifically interested to compare perspectives from high-income countries and low-/middle-income countries. Two researchers conducted a comprehensive search of English peer-reviewed studies published between 1990 and June 2016. Articles were accessed and summarized using thematic analysis. Meaningful phrases were extracted from key findings and linked to second-level International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health-Child and Youth categories following international linking rules. Thirty-three studies were identified of which only six originated from low/middle-income countries (n = 6/33, 18%). Two studies compared perspectives from low-/middle-income countries and high-income countries (n = 2/33, 6%). Functional themes from high-income countries included a range across the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health-Child and Youth bio-psychosocial framework while functional themes from low-/middle-income countries were predominantly focused on environmental factors. We propose further research should consider a systematic comparison of high-income and low/middle-income countries across functional categories to get a more accurate impression of the impact of context on functioning. Lay abstract No paper to date has summarized parents' views on the functional challenges and/or strengths of their children with autism spectrum disorder. In this review we set out to perform a scoping review aiming to (a) find and compare existing research from around the globe on parental perception of functioning and (b) summarize results from these papers using the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health-Child and Youth version framework. Since we know that the place and circumstances we live in can have a significant influence on our functioning in daily life, we were specifically interested in comparing perceptions from high-income countries and low-/middle-income countries. Two researchers conducted a comprehensive search of English studies published between 1990 and June 2016. Papers were summarized and key findings were linked to International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health-Child and Youth categories. Thirty-three studies were identified, of which most were conducted in high-income countries (n = 25/33, 76%) with only six studies in low/middle-income countries (n = 6/33, 18%). Two studies compared views from low/middle-income and high-income countries (n = 2/33, 6%).
   Functional themes from high-income countries included a range across the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health-Child and Youth framework while functional themes from low-/middle-income countries were mostly focused on environmental factors. It was difficult to directly compare studies from low/middle-income and high-income countries because they investigated and discussed such different parts of functioning. We suggest that future research should use an approach that will allow researchers to directly compare functional categories in order to get a more accurate impression of the impact of context on functioning.

AB  - Background:Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in treating unipolar depression. However, the efficacy of rTMS in bipolar disorder (BD) is unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the efficacy and tolerability of rTMS for both depressive and manic phases in BD.Methods:MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL databases were searched for controlled trials on treatment of BD with rTMS. Primary outcomes included changes in depression or mania scores, response and remission rates. Secondary outcomes included quality of life and functioning assessment. We used random-effects model, Hedge's g, risk differences (RDs) and the number needed to treat (NNT).Results:Eleven randomized sham-controlled studies were included, with a total of 345 patients with BD (bipolar depression = 257, mania = 86, mixed affective = 2). Trials of rTMS in bipolar depression (N = 8) demonstrated small but significant improvement in depression scores [standardized mean difference = 0.302,p < 0.05], compared to control group. Furthermore, rTMS brought a higher remission rate than sham-controls [RD = 0.104 +/- 0.044,p < 0.05, NNT = 10; and a trend of greater response rate [RD = 0.074 +/- 0.039,p = 0.06]. Results were inconclusive for effect of rTMS in mania. In both depressive and manic groups, no serious adverse events were reported. Risk of treatment-emergent mania appeared low.Limitations:There was limited number of eligible primary studies, with variable randomization procedures.Conclusion:rTMS appears safe and effective in treating bipolar depression. More stringent RCTs are necessary for concrete conclusion about efficacy in mania.

AB  - Obesity is a multifactorial disease in which environmental conditions and several genes play an important role in the development of this disease. Obesity is associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases) and with neurodevelopmental diseases (autism disorder, schizophrenia, and fragile X syndrome). Some of the environmental conditions that lead to obesity are physical activity, alcohol consumption, socioeconomic status, parent feeding behavior, and diet. Interestingly, some of these environmental conditions are shared with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. Obesity impairs neurodevelopment abilities as memory and fine-motor skills. Moreover, maternal obesity affects the cognitive function and mental health of the offspring. The common biological mechanisms involved in obesity and neurodegenerative/neurodevelopmental diseases are insulin resistance, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative damage, among others, leading to impaired brain development or cell death. Obesogenic environmental conditions are not the only factors that influence neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. In fact, several genes implicated in the leptin-melanocortin pathway (LEP,LEPR,POMC,BDNF,MC4R,PCSK1,SIM1,BDNF,TrkB, etc.) are associated with obesity and neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. Moreover, in the last decades, the discovery of new genes associated with obesity (FTO, NRXN3, NPC1, NEGR1, MTCH2, GNPDA2, among others) and with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental diseases (APOE, CD38, SIRT1, TNF alpha,PAI-1, TREM2, SYT4, FMR1, TET3, among others) had opened new pathways to comprehend the common mechanisms involved in these diseases. In conclusion, the obesogenic environmental conditions, the genes, and the interaction gene-environment would lead to a better understanding of the etiology of these diseases.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder with major implications for healthcare system and socioeconomic burden. For chronic and treatment-resistant depression, Ketamine has emerged as a possible treatment option. This systematic review explores the evidence for the effectiveness and tolerability of Ketamine in patients with MDD. This systematic review was conducted following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. Eight electronic databases were searched by using search terms: (ketamine) AND (trial OR RCT OR clinical-trial) AND (depressive OR depression OR "depressive-disorder"). After a rigorous screening process against the predetermined eligibility criteria, 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Quality assessment of included studies was done by using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs. Thirty-five RCTs are included in this review article with majority of studies from United States, Iran, and China. Intravenous (IV) Ketamine was effective in 70% (21/30) of the included studies whereas oral and Intranasal (IN) Ketamine were effective in two and three studies, respectively. The majority of studies (6/8) using Ketamine as anesthetic agent during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) failed to show an improvement compared to the participants receiving ECT and placebo. The most common reported side effects were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diplopia, drowsiness, dysphoria, hallucinations, and confusion. Ketamine is an effective treatment option for patients with MDD with undesirable effects when administered via oral, IV and IN routes. Ketamine agumentation of ECT requires further exploration in well-designed studies with adequate sample size. The short-lived antidepressant effect of Ketamine is a potential limitation, therefore, further studies administering multiple infusions for acute treatment and maintenance are necessary.

AB  - Purpose of Review The construct of cyberchondria was introduced relatively recently. This article aims to review the conceptualization, theoretical basis and correlates of cyberchondria, as well as its prevention and management. Recent Findings Although there is no consensus, most definitions of cyberchondria emphasize online health research associated with heightened distress or anxiety. The two theoretical models of cyberchondria involve reassurance seeking and specific metacognitive beliefs. Cyberchondria has relationships with health anxiety, problematic Internet use and symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with public health implications pertaining to functional impairment and altered healthcare utilization. Suggestions about prevention and management of cyberchondria have been put forward, but not tested yet. Research interest in cyberchondria has steadily increased. It is uncertain whether cyberchondria can be considered a distinct entity. Future research should aim to clarify the conceptual status of cyberchondria, quantify its impact and develop evidence-based approaches for a better control of cyberchondria.

AB  - Anxiety is a widely studied phenomenon in behavioral neuroscience, but the recent literature lacks an overview of the major conceptual framework underlying anxiety research to introduce young researchers to the field. In this mini-review article, which is aimed toward new undergraduate and graduate students, we discuss how researchers exploit the approach-avoidance conflict, an internal conflict rodents face between exploration of novel environments and avoidance of danger, to inform rodent assays that allow for the measurement of anxiety-related behavior in the laboratory. We review five widely-used rodent anxiety assays, consider the pharmacological validity of these assays, and discuss neural circuits that have recently been shown to modulate anxiety using the assays described. Finally, we offer related lines of inquiry and comment on potential future directions.

AB  - BackgroundIn the face of climate change, the protection of vulnerable patients from extreme climatic conditions is of growing interest to the healthcare sector and governments. Inpatients are especially susceptible to heat due to acute illness and/or chronic diseases. Their condition can be aggravated by adverse environmental factors. Installing air conditioning can be seen as an element of public health adaptation because it was shown to improve mortality rates of hospital patients experiencing hot temperatures. Still, the mediating factors and resulting health effects are largely unknown.MethodThe PRISMA-ScR guideline was followed for this scoping review. Available evidence on the health effects of Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC) and fans was searched in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. The focus of the search strategy was on inpatients of the hospital. Grey literature was screened on 14 relevant websites. English and German publications were eligible without restrictions on publication date. Results were charted according to the categories population, intervention, control and outcome together with a qualitative description.ResultsThe review process yielded eleven publications of which seven were issued after 2003. Seven were clinical trials, three cross-sectional studies and one was a case report. The publications described the installation of HVAC on general wards and in intensive care units. Main topics were heat stress protection and support of thermoregulation, but also the rewarming of hypothermic patients. HVAC use resulted in a recovery effect shown by improved vital signs, reduced cardiac stress, accelerated recuperation and greater physical activity. This protective effect was demonstrated by a shorter hospital stay for patients with respiratory disease and a reduction of mortality for heat illness patients.ConclusionThis scoping review summarises the fragmented evidence on health effects of HVAC and fan utilisation for inpatients. Installing HVAC has the potential to improve patients' outcomes and to make hospital treatment more efficient during heat waves. The application of HVAC could be a promising adaptation measure to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on health and healthcare systems.

AB  - Oxidative stress has been suggested to play a key role in multiple sclerosis (MS), but clinical data on oxidative stress markers in MS patients were inconsistent. This study sought to quantitatively summarize the data of oxidative stress markers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS in the literature. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science and included studies if they provided data on the concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the peripheral blood and CSF of MS patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. The systematic search resulted in the inclusion of 31 studies with 2,001 MS patients and 2,212 HC subjects for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with MS had significantly increased concentrations of blood oxidative stress markers compared with HC subjects for malondialdehyde (MDA; Hedges' g, 2.252; 95% CI, 1.080 to 3.424;p< 0.001) and lipid hydroperoxide by tert-butyl hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence (CL-LOOH; Hedges' g, 0.383; 95% CI, 0.065 to 0.702;p= 0.018). In contrast, concentrations of albumin (Hedges' g, -1.036; CI, -1.679 to -0.394;p= 0.002) were significantly decreased in MS patients when compared with those in HC subjects. However, the other analyzed blood oxidative stress markers did not show significant differences between cases and controls. Furthermore, this meta-analysis showed significant association between CSF MDA and MS (Hedges' g, 3.275; 95% CI, 0.859 to 5.691;p= 0.008). Taken together, our results revealed increased blood and CSF MDA and decreased blood albumin levels in patients with MS, strengthening the clinical evidence of increased oxidative stress in MS.

AB  - The development of biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes is of major importance to meet the sustainable development challenges of our time. The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e. drones, has opened a new set of research and management opportunities to achieve this goal. On the one hand, this review summarizes UAV applications in agricultural landscapes, focusing on biodiversity conservation and agricultural land monitoring, based on a systematic review of the literature that resulted in 550 studies. Additionally, the review proposes how to integrate UAV research in these fields and point to new potential applications that may contribute to biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes. UAV-based imagery can be used to identify and monitor plants, floral resources and animals, facilitating the detection of quality habitats with high prediction power. Through vegetation indices derived from their sensors, UAVs can estimate biomass, monitor crop plant health and stress, detect pest or pathogen infestations, monitor soil fertility and target patches of high weed or invasive plant pressure, allowing precise management practices and reduced agrochemical input. Thereby, UAVs are helping to design biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes and to mitigate yield-biodiversity trade-offs. In conclusion, UAV applications have become a major means of biodiversity conservation and biodiversity-friendly management in agriculture, while latest developments, such as the miniaturization and decreasing costs of hyperspectral sensors, promise many new applications for the future.

AB  - Objective Racial/ethnic disparities in obesity may be due, in part, to minority groups consuming more energy-rich diets in response to greater stress exposure. The present study systematically reviewed the literature describing the effects of stress on food consumption among various racial/ethnic groups in the US. Methods PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies reporting associations between stress and food consumption by different racial/ethnic groups, conducted between January 1, 1999 to November 25, 2019. The search included terms related to food consumption, stress, and race/ethnicity. After screening 3660 records, 30 studies were included for review. Results The selected studies assessed diverse stressors and eating constructs; African-American and Hispanic/Latinx were the most commonly studied minority groups. Studies generally supported that diverse forms of stress exposure are associated with reduced healthy eating patterns and increased obesogenic eating patterns across racial/ethnic groups. However, studies that directly compared stress-eating associations among multiple racial/ethnic groups showed mixed results. Conclusion Members of diverse racial/ethnic groups are susceptible to stress-induced unhealthy eating patterns, though evidence is insufficient to conclude whether the degree of susceptibility differs among groups. Additional studies utilizing observational measures of food intake and culturally sensitive measures of stress are needed to identify the most influential stressors on dietary behaviors, to assess whether some stressors are more salient for given racial/ethnic groups, and to examine the extent to which stress-induced eating contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related diseases.

AB  - Background Family interventions in schizophrenia are evidence based and have been adapted to different cultural settings to improve their effectiveness and acceptability. The Arab world has a unique set of socio-cultural norms and values that cannot be ignored when developing or implementing such interventions. There is a lack of research on the feasibility of delivering family interventions for schizophrenia in the Arab region. The aim of this review is to synthesise the available evidence about culturally-adapted psychosocial family interventions in the Arab world. The review identifies the content and characteristics of these interventions, determines the strategies used to adapt them to Arab culture successfully, assesses the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions, and evaluates the effectiveness of these interventions for service users and their families. Method Five electronic databases were searched including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and EMBASE for articles written in Arabic and English from inception to August 2019. Data were extracted and synthesised narratively. Results Six studies were retrieved from the search: three randomised control studies, two non-randomised studies and one qualitative study. There is limited evidence about culturally-adapted family interventions in the Arab region. However, the cultural adaptation process was comprehensive, and the implementation was reported to be feasible and acceptable. The methodological quality of the included studies was generally poor, so there is a risk of underestimating the effect size of the interventions due to lack of rigour and the presence of bias. Conclusion The present review provides the foundation for future work regarding family interventions in the Arab world, and confirms the feasibility of implementing such interventions with some modifications. Furthermore, the data suggests that any family-oriented intervention for schizophrenia is likely to be better than standard care in improving the outcome for patients and their families.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Schizophrenia spectrum disorders impact functioning, reduce quality of life and increase the risk of physical illness and premature mortality. Nutritional intervention studies aimed at decreasing body weight have demonstrated efficacy in improving metabolic outcomes; however, few studies have explored the impact of interventions designed to modify diet on mental health outcomes.
   AIM
   To synthesize the existing experimental studies of adjunctive diet modification as an intervention in the treatment of psychotic disorders, analyze findings related to effectiveness and safety, highlight knowledge gaps and limitations, and set forward recommendations for future research studies.
   METHODS
   An extensive a priori search strategy was developed and the databases Embase, Embase Classic, Ovid MEDLINE were searched. Screening and data extraction were completed in duplicate. Studies included in this analysis were experimental studies of an adjunctive dietary intervention (overall dietary pattern or education on dietary change) for treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. No restrictions were placed on control groups or blinding. The studies were required to report a mental health outcome.
   RESULTS
   Twenty-five clinical trials were identified, along with two additional protocols and two meta-analyses. Nineteen of the clinical trials reported improvement in one or more mental health domain including psychosis symptoms, cognition, and quality of life. A high level of heterogeneity was found with respect to patient population, intervention, and study design. All of the studies included lifestyle or psychosocial components in addition to dietary modification. The nutrition advice provided to participants was poorly described overall and compliance was not assessed. The studies that showed benefit tended to have a smaller sample size and were less likely to be randomized but were more likely to use a group delivery intervention.
   CONCLUSION
   Further research assessing effectiveness and efficacy of clearly reported dietary interventions is warranted, especially those using rigorous methodology, modifying diet in isolation and assessing participant compliance.

AB  - The concept of implementation of environmental health protection and sustainment in aerospace environments by definition implies a One Health systems approach. One Health indicates an inherently complex, contextually interrelated system with consideration of human, animal, plant, systems engineering, and environmental health, their interrelationships, and networks. One Health implies seamless integration of subsystem co-dependencies to achieve an outcome of overall health protection for the individual. One of the most challenging aspects of space travel involves prevention, mitigation and protection from radiation injuries. While avoidance altogether is the best approach, these authors will focus on minimized exposure through limiting time in the space radiation environment in the transit to Mars and back. Implementation of the pillars of time, distance and shielding comprise ALARA, "As Low as Reasonably Achievable" (www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/alara.html) and is stressed in this strategy. This general overview will briefly describe the critical components of space environmental health in anticipation of increasing duration and interaction of human, animal, and plant habitation of aerospace and extreme environments into the future. Of the many considerations that could be addressed, precision medicine, and bioinformatics are the most rapidly evolving. Complex interdependencies will emerge from macro- and micro-environmental ecosystems data analysis, not yet fully comprehended or understood in the context of space health. We will conclude this contribution with suggested new countermeasure strategies gleaned through big data analytics that may protect space crew through mitigation of radiation exposure in flight.

AB  - The question of what explains individual differences in expertise within complex domains such as music, games, sports, science, and medicine is currently a major topic of interest in a diverse range of fields, including psychology, education, and sports science, to name just a few. Ericsson and colleagues'deliberate practice viewis a highly influential perspective in the literature on expertise and expert performance-but is it viable as a testable scientific theory? Here, reviewing more than 25 years of Ericsson and colleagues' writings, we document critical inconsistencies in the definition of deliberate practice, along with apparent shifts in the standard for evidence concerning deliberate practice. We also consider the impact of these issues on progress in the field of expertise, focusing on the empirical testability and falsifiability of the deliberate practice view. We then discuss a multifactorial perspective on expertise, and how open science practices can accelerate progress in research guided by this perspective.

AB  - BackgroundObesity is considered a top public health concern, and its prevalence is growing every day. Thus, interventions to address this problem should be encouraged and further studied. In this regard, the aim of this review was to summarize the evidence of martial arts interventions to evaluate their effectiveness on the anthropometric and body composition parameters of overweight and obese subjects.MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted on January 26, 2020 using the PubMed, Medline, Lilacs, Cochrane, and Scielo databases. Reference lists of eligible articles and relevant reviews have also been examined. All randomized clinical trials on martial arts that evaluated the anthropometric and body composition parameters of overweight and obese subjects were included, and a narrative synthesis of eligible studies was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The Downs & Black checklist was used to assess the quality of the studies. This review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (identifier CRD42018086116).ResultsA total of 82 articles were identified from the initial search strategy. A further 2 articles were identified from the review of relevant bibliographies. Six studies encompassing 258 participants who were overweight or obese were included. Four studies reported Tai Chi practice, one study reported Kung Fu exercise, and another study reported martial arts exercise. The examined meta-analyses did not reveal significant benefits from martial arts practice over control groups after the experiment period for body mass index (-1.34kg/m(2); 95% CI: -2.72, 0.05), waist circumference (1.41cm; 95% CI: -0.72, 3.54) and percentage of body fat (-0.75%; 95% CI: -5.58, 4.08).ConclusionThe scarcity, heterogeneity, short intervention time, small sample size, and significant methodological limitations of the available studies do not allow to conclude whether martial arts are effective in the anthropometric and body composition parameters of overweight and obese individuals. This study highlights the need for more research to assess the benefits of martial arts for overweight and obese individuals.

AB  - Individual mental health has become a primary global concern. In Pakistan, the prevalence of mental health issues is still unclear, as not many studies have assessed the level of mental health literacy (MHL) in the country. This systematic review aims to bridge this gap by encouraging the early detection of mental disorders, lessening stigma, and improving help-seeking behavior. Nine electronic databases were searched to identify empirical literature in this area. Only studies that evaluated MHL efficacy and those published in English were selected. Non-peer reviewed articles and gray literature were excluded. From 613 studies retrieved, 59 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Forty-three of the included studies mentioned mental health outcome measures (of which only four mentioned reliability indices), 13 discussed stigma, 18 examined help-seeking approaches to mental illness treatments, and 47 discussed mental health knowledge. Additionally, the outcome of the MHL measures had considerable heterogeneity and limited validity. Meta-analysis was not conducted due to a lack of MHL operationalization. Besides, the measurement tools in the studies lacked consistency and standardization. This review compiled the available studies on MHL to assist researchers currently studying the various dimensions of MHL, as well as those designing new studies or investigating effective methods to increase MHL. This review highlights the need for well-designed controlled intervention studies. Further implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers are mentioned.

AB  - Recent years have seen an advent in population-based studies in children, adolescents, and adults that examine the prevalence, etiology, and developmental trajectories of diverse subclinical psychopathological symptoms that pose a risk for the later development of severe mental illnesses. It is increasingly recognized that most categorically defined psychiatric disorders occur on a spectrum or continuum, show high heterogeneity and symptom overlap, and share genetic and environmental risk factors. We discuss neurodevelopmental underpinnings of psychosis spectrum symptoms and review brain morphometric and functional alterations as well as genetic liability for psychosis in individuals experiencing psychotic symptoms (PSs) in the general population. With regard to brain structure and function, findings of qualitatively similar alterations in individuals experiencing subthreshold PSs and individuals with overt psychotic disorders support the notion of a psychosis continuum. However, genetic and epidemiological studies have emphasized the overlap of PSs and other psychiatric illnesses. In particular, PSs during adolescence appear to be a nonspecific precursor of different psychopathological outcomes. Given the evidence presented in this review, we argue that findings from population-based studies are appropriate to guide policy-making to further emphasize public health efforts. Broadly accessible mental health programs are promising to make a difference in the field of adolescent mental health. However, the specific efficacy of these programs warrants further study, and caution is advised to not overpathologize potentially transient occurrence of mental health problems.

AB  - Seagrasses are important marine ecosystems situated throughout the world's coastlines. They are facing declines around the world due to global and local threats such as rising ocean temperatures, coastal development and pollution from sewage outfalls and agriculture. Efforts have been made to reduce seagrass loss through reducing local and regional stressors, and through active restoration. Seagrass restoration is a rapidly maturing discipline, but improved restoration practices are needed to enhance the success of future programs. Major gaps in knowledge remain, however, prior research efforts have provided valuable insights into factors influencing the outcomes of restoration and there are now several examples of successful large-scale restoration programs. A variety of tools and techniques have recently been developed that will improve the efficiency, cost effectiveness, and scalability of restoration programs. This review describes several restoration successes in Australia and New Zealand, with a focus on emerging techniques for restoration, key considerations for future programs, and highlights the benefits of increased collaboration, Traditional Owner (First Nation) and stakeholder engagement. Combined, these lessons and emerging approaches show that seagrass restoration is possible, and efforts should be directed at upscaling seagrass restoration into the future. This is critical for the future conservation of this important ecosystem and the ecological and coastal communities they support.

KW  - Scoping review
KW  - RECOVERY
AB  - Background Peer-led support models have gained increasing popularity in suicide prevention. While previous reviews show positive effects of peer-led support for people with mental health problems and those bereaved by suicide, little is known about the types of lived experience peer support programs in suicide prevention and whether these are effective in improving the health and wellbeing of people at risk of suicide. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of peer support programs that aim to reduce suicidality and are led by people with lived experience of suicide. Method We conducted a systematic scoping review, involving a search of three academic (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) and selected grey literature databases (Google Scholar, WHO Clinical Trials Registry) for publications between 2000 and 2019. We also contacted suicide prevention experts and relevant internet sites to identify peer support programs that exist but have not been evaluated. The screening of records followed a systematic two-stage process in alignment with PRISMA guidelines. Results We identified 8 records accounting for 7 programs focussed on peer-led support programs in suicide prevention. These programs employed a range of different designs and included a variety of settings (schools, communities, rural and online). Only 3 of the 7 programs contained data on effectiveness. With the small number of eligible programs the findings from this review are limited and must be interpreted with caution. Conclusions Despite the increased focus of policymakers on the importance of peer support programs in suicide prevention, our scoping review confirms an evidence gap in research knowledge regarding program design, implementation, and effectiveness. More rigour is required in reporting peer-led support initiatives to clarify the underlying definition of peer support and lived experience and to enhance our understanding of the types of current peer support programs available to those experiencing suicidality. Further, we need formal and high-quality evaluations of peer support suicide prevention programs led by people with lived experience to better understand their effectiveness on participant health across different settings and delivery modalities and to allow for comprehensive systematic reviews and meta-analysis in future.

AB  - When people talk, they gesture. Gesture is a fundamental component of language that contributes meaningful and unique information to a spoken message and reflects the speaker's underlying knowledge and experiences. Theoretical perspectives of speech and gesture propose that they share a common conceptual origin and have a tightly integrated relationship, overlapping in time, meaning, and function to enrich the communicative context. We review a robust literature from the field of psychology documenting the benefits of gesture for communication for both speakers and listeners, as well as its important cognitive functions for organizing spoken language, and facilitating problem-solving, learning, and memory. Despite this evidence, gesture has been relatively understudied in populations with neurogenic communication disorders. While few studies have examined the rehabilitative potential of gesture in these populations, others have ignored gesture entirely or even discouraged its use. We review the literature characterizing gesture production and its role in intervention for people with aphasia, as well as describe the much sparser literature on gesture in cognitive communication disorders including right hemisphere damage, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. The neuroanatomical and behavioral profiles of these patient populations provide a unique opportunity to test theories of the relationship of speech and gesture and advance our understanding of their neural correlates. This review highlights several gaps in the field of communication disorders which may serve as a bridge for applying the psychological literature of gesture to the study of language disorders. Such future work would benefit from considering theoretical perspectives of gesture and using more rigorous and quantitative empirical methods in its approaches. We discuss implications for leveraging gesture to explore its untapped potential in understanding and rehabilitating neurogenic communication disorders.

AB  - Plastics have become strong environmental stressors of coastal marine ecosystems. Their introduction into the marine ecosystem is subjected to different mechanisms, including the inadequate disposal of solid waste and dumping of wastewater. In addition, their chemical composition makes them resistant to variables such as temperature and salinity of water. These polymers are degraded and fragmented mainly due to the action of the waves, which results in the formation of smaller particles called microplastics. Microplastics are characterized by being persistent in the environment due to their low biodegradation, and although they have a maximum size of 5 mm, there is a wide range of sizes suggested by different authors. According to their use, microplastics can be classified as primary when they are recognized at first sight, and as secondary, when they are gradually divided. Microplastics have become a potential risk to the health of marine species due to their small size, and the risk to human health due to their persistence through trophic chains is alarming. Given the potential impact these materials would have in the biota, and the need to assist the different regulatory agencies to develop political acts on the proper management and disposal of microplastics, the aim of this work was to identify different research carried out at international level on established methodologies for studies of identification and quantification of microplastics, bacterial communities, and contaminants adhered to microparticles. Given the above, some methodologies have been identified and used in various studies for the identification and quantification of these materials on beaches. It should be noted that in different countries, there has been an increase in research related to contamination by microplastics on beaches, in which bacterial communities attached to these plastic particles have been also identified. Likewise, not only the risks and threats have been determined for marine species but also for the health of people who frequent tourist places such as beaches.

AB  - Adolescents have high rates of self-injurious behavior (SIB), with suicide being the second leading cause of death. A consistent relationship between individual attachment and SIB was previously found in adult population; however, no such review has been undertaken for the child and adolescent population. A systematic search of PubMED, OVID, and PsychINFO up to March 31, 2020 was performed. Twenty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. Of the 22 articles, 21 found a positive association between attachment insecurity and SIB. Our results show a consistent relationship between attachment insecurity and SIB in children and adolescents, complementing the results found in the adult literature. These findings make a case for preventive strategies aimed at reducing self-injurious behaviors in youth by targeting attachment security.

AB  - Role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in the pathophysiology of stroke and protective effects of PPAR ligands have been widely investigated in the last 20 years. Activation of all three PPAR isoforms, but especially PPAR-gamma, was documented to limit postischemic injury in the numerousin vivo, as well as inin vitrostudies. PPARs have been demonstrated to act on multiple mechanisms and were shown to activate multiple protective pathways related to inflammation, apoptosis, BBB protection, neurogenesis, and oxidative stress. The aim of this review was to summarize two decades of PPAR research in stroke with emphasis onin vivoanimal studies. We focus on each PPAR receptor separately and detail their implication in stroke. This review also discusses recent clinical efforts in the field and the epidemiological data with regard to role of PPAR polymorphisms in susceptibility to stroke, and tries to draw conclusions and describe future perspectives.

AB  - Background: Local management action to address coral-reef stressors can improve reef health and mitigate the effects of global climate change. Coastal development and runoff lead to sedimentation, which directly impacts coral recruitment, growth, mortality, and the ecosystem services that coral reefs provide. Decision making for reef resilience in the face of global and local stressors requires information on thresholds for management action. In response to needs identified by reef managers, we plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis that will explore the effects of both deposited and suspended sediment on corals to identify single and interacting stressor thresholds. We will identify levels of sediment exposure (i.e., concentration, duration, and frequency) that cause adverse physical, physiological, behavioral, developmental, and ecological responses in coral and describe geographic and taxonomic patterns in these responses. Our ultimate goal is to provide managers with sediment exposure thresholds that can be expected to cause these responses.
   Methods: Our systematic review will synthesize available evidence on the effects of suspended and deposited sediment on corals. The research questions were formulated with an advisory team to support management decisions concerning local reef stressors in waters under U.S. federal jurisdiction. While the advisory team is most concerned with reefs adjacent to U.S. Pacific Islands, our review will include studies that examine reef-building coral species around the world. We will search online databases and grey literature to obtain a list of potential studies, assess their relevance, and critically appraise them for validity and risk of bias. Provided enough data can be extracted from relevant experimental studies, we will conduct meta-analyses that examine changes in coral health and survival in response to suspended and/or deposited sediment, with the goal to define sediment thresholds for reef managers. If enough data are available from within the U.S. Pacific Islands, we will construct region-, site-, and/or species-specific thresholds to improve local management.

AB  - Meditation practices, originated from ancient traditions, have increasingly received attention due to their potential benefits to mental and physical health. The scientific community invests efforts into scrutinizing and quantifying the effects of these practices, especially on the brain. There are methodological challenges in describing the neural correlates of the subjective experience of meditation. We noticed, however, that technical considerations on signal processing also don't follow standardized approaches, which may hinder generalizations. Therefore, in this article, we discuss the usage of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a tool to study meditation experiences in healthy individuals. We describe the main EEG signal processing techniques and how they have been translated to the meditation field until April 2020. Moreover, we examine in detail the limitations/assumptions of these techniques and highlight some good practices, further discussing how technical specifications may impact the interpretation of the outcomes. By shedding light on technical features, this article contributes to more rigorous approaches to evaluate the construct of meditation.

AB  - Global warming is considered as the main environmental stress affecting ecosystems as well as physiological and biochemical characteristics, and survivability of living organisms. High temperature induces various stresses and causes reduction of fertility through reducing the oocyte developmental competence and alteration in surrounding cells' functions. This causes major economic loss to livestock creating a selective pressure on animals to the advantage of better adapted genotypes and to the detriment of others. In this review, a search in Science Direct, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and SID databases until 2020 was conducted. Keywords which include heat stress, shock, high temperature, oocyte, cumulus, and animals were investigated. Studies have exhibited that heat stress can disturb the development and function of oocyte and cumulus cells (CCs) concerning reproductive efficiency. Heat stress has deleterious consequences on oocyte maturation and development via reduced number of polar body extrusion, adenosine monophosphate, and guanosine monophosphate synthesis. Heat stress caused the alteration of cytoplasmic and nuclear features as well as trans-zonal projections and gap junctions. In addition, heat stress is accompanied with reduced mitochondrial activity (copy mDNA number, distribution, and membrane potential) in cumulus-oocyte complexes. This review targets the description of results in the most recent studies that aimed to call attention to the influences of heat stress on molecular, functional, and cellular changes in oocytes and CCs in animals to design evidence on the acting mechanisms as the core of this problem from a comparative review.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for humans and animals and can have beneficial effects on plants. A low concentration of Se can improve plant growth; however, high concentrations can be toxic for plants. In addition, Se can counteract stresses from toxic trace elements in plants. Hence, improved knowledge of the mechanisms involved may contribute to more effective management of Se for reducing trace element stress in plants. Here, the mechanisms of Se-mediated reduction of trace element toxicity in plants are reviewed. Upon uptake by plants, Se may protect plants against toxic trace elements by enhancing plant growth and photosynthesis by regulating the uptake and translocation of trace elements, and by mitigating oxidative stress through regulation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, within the plant, Se-induced tolerance of toxic trace elements involves modification of gene expression, chelation, compartmentalization within plants, and changes in the trace element species. In the rhizosphere, complexation of Se with toxic trace elements may contribute to a reduced uptake of these elements by plants. There is a need to explore the mechanisms of Se-induced trace element tolerance in plants at the molecular and genetic levels. Furthermore, field studies are needed to determine the optimal levels of Se.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders have been shown to exhibit substantial interconnectedness with circadian rhythmicity. Alzheimer's patients exhibit high degradation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central endogenous circadian timekeeper, and Parkinson's patients have highly disrupted peripheral clock gene expression. Disrupted sleep patterns are highly evident in patients with neurodegenerative diseases; fragmented sleep has been shown to affect tau-protein accumulation in Alzheimer's patients, and rapid eye movement (REM) behavioral disorder is observed in a significant amount of Parkinson's patients. Although numerous studies exist analyzing the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and circadian rhythm function independently, molecular mechanisms establishing specific links between the two must be explored further. Thus, in this review, we explore the possible intersecting molecular mechanisms between circadian rhythm and neurodegeneration, with a particular focus on Parkinson's disease. We provide evidence for potential influences of E3 ligase and poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) activity on neurodegenerative pathology. The cellular stress and subsequent DNA damage signaling imposed by hyperactivity of these multiple molecular systems in addition to aberrant circadian rhythmicity lead to extensive protein aggregation such as alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (alpha-Syn PFFs), suggesting a specific molecular pathway linking circadian rhythmicity, PARP1/E3 ligase activity, and Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are characterized by generalized difficulty controlling emotions and behaviors. ICDs are a broad group of the central nervous system (CNS) disorders including conduct disorder, intermittent explosive, oppositional-defiant disorder, antisocial personality disorder, kleptomania, pyromania and other illnesses. Although they all share a common feature (aberrant impulsivity), their pathobiology is complex and poorly understood. There are also currently no ICD-specific therapies to treat these illnesses. Animal models are a valuable tool for studying ICD pathobiology and potential therapies. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a useful model organism to study CNS disorders due to high genetic and physiological homology to mammals, and sensitivity to various pharmacological and genetic manipulations. Here, we summarize experimental models of impulsivity and ICD in zebrafish and highlight their growing translational significance. We also emphasize the need for further development of zebrafish ICD models to improve our understanding of their pathogenesis and to search for novel therapeutic treatments.

AB  - Transient receptor potential (TRP) are cation channels expressed in both non-excitable and excitable cells from diverse tissues, including heart, lung, and brain. The TRP channel family includes 28 isoforms activated by physical and chemical stimuli, such as temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, and noxious stimuli. Recently, it has been shown that TRP channels are also directly or indirectly activated by reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress plays an essential role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and TRP channels are involved in the progression of those diseases by mechanisms involving changes in the crosstalk between Ca(2+)regulation, oxidative stress, and production of inflammatory mediators. TRP channels involved in nociception include members of the TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPC subfamilies that transduce physical and chemical noxious stimuli. It has also been reported that pain is a complex issue in patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and adequate management of pain in those conditions is still in discussion. TRPV1 has a role in neuroinflammation, a critical mechanism involved in neurodegeneration. Therefore, some studies have considered TRPV1 as a target for both pain treatment and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, this review aimed to describe the TRP-dependent mechanism that can mediate pain sensation in neurodegenerative diseases and the therapeutic approach available to palliate pain and neurodegenerative symptoms throughout the regulation of these channels.

AB  - Objective The period following discharge from inpatient psychiatric care is recognised as an especially high-risk time for patient suicide. Astonishingly, there is a dearth of comprehensive studies examining risk and protective factors in this specific population. The aim of this study was to establish the protective and risk factors for suicide in the first year post-discharge (PD) from psychiatric facilities and their utility in categorising patients as high or low risk in a meaningful way to benefit clinical care and improve patient outcomes. Methods A methodical search of three databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and PsychINFO) was used to identify reports describing risk factors for suicide after psychiatric discharge. Results Predominantly, male sex, a history of self-harm, a history of suicide attempts, admission with suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour, and hopelessness were identified as being associated with death by suicide after discharge. Lithium appeared to be protective against suicide in the studies reviewed. Other variables examined showed mixed results. Conclusions The findings of this review suggest that significant suicide predictors both common and unique to those established for suicide in the general population exist and can be utilised in a clinically meaningful way, despite the difficulties inherent in studying this population.

AB  - Malathion has been widely used worldwide in arbovirus control programs. In 2015, it was classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a probable carcinogen to humans. This work aimed to systematize the evidence of the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects associated with the exposure of malathion and its analogs, malaoxon and isomalathion. The search was carried out in Toxline, PubMed and Scopus databases for original papers published from 1983 to 2015. In all, 73 papers were selected from a total of 273 eligible papers. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies showed mainly genetic and chromosomal damages caused by malathion. The epidemiological studies evidenced significant positive associations for thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers in menopausal women. This evidence of the carcinogenic effect of malathion should be considered before its use in arbovirus control programs.

AB  - Suicide is a leading cause of death that defies prediction and challenges prevention efforts worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as a means of investigating large datasets to enhance risk detection. A systematic review of ML investigations evaluating suicidal behaviors was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Web-of-Science, and EMBASE, employing search strings and MeSH terms relevant to suicide and AI. Databases were supplemented by hand-search techniques and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria: (1) journal article, available in English, (2) original investigation, (3) employment of AI/ML, (4) evaluation of a suicide risk outcome. N = 594 records were identified based on abstract search, and 25 hand-searched reports. N = 461 reports remained after duplicates were removed, n = 316 were excluded after abstract screening. Of n = 149 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, n = 87 were included for quantitative synthesis, grouped according to suicide behavior outcome. Reports varied widely in methodology and outcomes. Results suggest high levels of risk classification accuracy (>90%) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the prediction of suicidal behaviors. We report key findings and central limitations in the use of AI/ML frameworks to guide additional research, which hold the potential to impact suicide on broad scale.

AB  - Occupational stress is an emerging problem among physician and nurses, and those working in intensive care settings are particularly exposed to the risk of developing burnout. To verify what types of interventions to manage occupational stress and burn out within neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have been introduced so far and to verify their efficacy among caregivers. PsycINFO (PsycINFO 1967-July week 3 2019), Embase (Embase 1996-2019 week 29) e Medline (Ovid MEDLINE(R) without revisions 1996-July week 2 2019) were systematically searched combining MeSH and free text terms for "burn out" AND "healthcare provider" AND "NICU". Inclusion criteria were interventions directed to healthcare providers settled in NICUs. Only English language papers were included. Six articles were included in the final analysis. All the studies reported an overall efficacy of the interventions in reducing work-related stress, both when individual focused and organisation directed. The analysis revealed low quality of the studies and high heterogeneity in terms of study design, included populations, interventions and their evaluation assessment. There is currently very limited evidence regarding the management of occupational stress and burn out within NICUs. The quality of available studies was suboptimal. The peculiarities of the NICUs should be considered when developing strategies for occupational stress management. Training self-awareness of workers regarding their reactions to the NICU environment, also from the pre-employment stage, could be an additional approach to prevent and manage stress.

AB  - In this study, a scoping review method is used to review the distribution and trends in health promotion research and explore the use and contribution of eHealth technologies in health promotion in the elderly. The study includes six search databases: PubMed, CINAHL, the CochraneLibrary, EMBASE, PubPsych, and ERIC (EBSCOhost), and studies published from January 2015 to October 2019, written in English, were included and analyzed. The findings of the study reveal that the amount of literature on promoting health for the elderly has increased, and some specific types of interventions are still favored in current health promotion efforts for older adults. The most commonly used methods were found to be health promotion (n= 322), followed by screening (n= 264), primary prevention (n= 114), and finally social support (n= 72). Beyond the above interventions, eHealth technology is also used in health promotion activities to prevent the elderly from falling and to improve home safety, etc. However, although the application of eHealth technology has been applied in areas such as fall prevention, mental health promotion, and home security monitoring, it is still immature, and thus more rigorous research is needed in different areas, especially in older populations, various professions, women, and people with dementia.

AB  - Background: Continuity of care (COC) is essential for high-quality patient care in the perinatal period. Insights in the effects of COC models on patient outcomes are important to direct perinatal healthcare organization. To our knowledge, no previous review has listed the effects of COC on the physical and mental health of mother and child in the postnatal period. Methods: A search was conducted in four databases (PubMed, Web of Knowledge, CENTRAL and CINAHL), from 2000 to 2018. Studies were included if: participants were healthy mothers or newborns with a gestational age between 37-42 weeks; they covered the perinatal period and aimed to measure breastfeeding or any outcome related to the maternal/newborn physical or mental health. At least one of the three COC types (management, informational and relationship) was identified in the intervention. The methodological quality was assessed. Results: Ten articles were included. COC is mostly present in the identified care models. The effects of COC on the outcomes of mother and child in the postnatal period seem mostly to be positive, although not always significant. The relation between COC and the outcomes can be influenced by confounding factors, like the socio-economic status of the included population. Interventions with COC during pregnancy appear to be more effective for all the studied outcome factors. Conclusion: COC as management, relational and informational continuity starting antenatal has the most impact on the postnatal outcomes of mother and child.

AB  - The oceans are taking up over one million tons of fossil CO2 per hour, resulting in increased pCO(2) and declining pH, leading to ocean acidification (OA). At the same time, accumulation of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is causing ocean warming, which enhances stratification with thinned upper mixed layers, exposing planktonic organisms to increasing levels of daytime integrated UV radiation. Ocean warming also reduces dissolved oxygen in seawater, resulting in ocean deoxygenation. All these ocean global changes are impacting marine ecosystems and effects are well documented for each individual driver (pH, oxygen, temperature, UV). However, combined effects are still poorly understood, strongly limiting our ability to project impacts at regional or local levels. Different regions are often exposed (and often adapted) to contrastingly different physical and chemical environmental conditions and organisms, and ecosystems from different parts of the world will be exposed to unique combinations of stressors in the future. Understanding the modulating role of adaptation, species niche and stressors' interaction is key. This review, being a non-exhaustively explored one, aims to provide an overview on understandings of ecophysiological effects of OA and its combination with covarying drivers, mainly warming, deoxygenation and solar UV radiation. We propose a testable hypothetical model as well as future research perspectives.

AB  - To provide an overview of the impact of maternal eating disorders (ED) on child development in a number of domains including feeding and eating behaviour, neuropsychological profile and cognitive development, psychopathology and temperament. PubMed, Embase and PsychInfo were searched for studies exploring the impact of maternal ED on children between January 1980 and September 2018. Initial search yielded 569 studies. After exclusion, 32 studies were reviewed. Overall, available evidence shows that children of mothers with ED are at increased risk of disturbances in several domains. They exhibit more difficulties in feeding and eating behaviours, display more psychopathological and socio-emotional difficulties, and they are more likely to be described as having a difficult temperament. Maternal ED have an impact on child psychological, cognitive and eating behaviours, and might affect the development of ED in the offspring. Future research should focus on resilience and on which protective factors might lead to positive outcomes. These factors can be then used as therapeutic and preventative targets.

AB  - Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern. Telehealth is an effective option to fight the outbreak of COVID-19. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the role of telehealth services in preventing, diagnosing, treating, and controlling diseases during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods This systematic review was conducted through searching five databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Inclusion criteria included studies clearly defining any use of telehealth services in all aspects of health care during COVID-19 outbreak, published from December 31, 2019, written in English language and published in peer reviewed journals. Two reviewers independently assessed search results, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. Quality assessment was based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarize and report the findings. Results Eight studies met the inclusion out of the 142 search results. Currently, healthcare providers and patients who are self-isolating, telehealth is certainly appropriate in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This solution has the potential to prevent any sort of direct physical contact, provide continuous care to the community, and finally reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions The use of telehealth improves the provision of health services. Therefore, telehealth should be an important tool in caring services while keeping patients and health providers safe during COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the many syndromes in the psychiatric nosology for which etiological signal and clinical prediction are weak. Reducing phenotypic and mechanistic heterogeneity should be useful to arrive at stronger etiological and clinical prediction signals. We discuss key conceptual and methodological issues, highlighting the role of dimensional features aligned with Research Domain Criteria and cognitive, personality, and temperament theory as well as neurobiology. We describe several avenues of work in this area, utilizing different statistical, computational, and machine learning approaches to resolve heterogeneity in ADHD. We offer methodo-logical and conceptual recommendations. Methodologically, we propose that an integrated approach utilizing theory and advanced computational logic to address targeted questions, with consideration of developmental context, can render the heterogeneity problem tractable for ADHD. Conceptually, we conclude that the field is on the cusp of justifying an emotionally dysregulated subprofile in ADHD that may be useful for clinical prediction and treatment testing. Cognitive profiles, while more nascent, may be useful for clinical prediction and treatment assignment in different ways depending on developmental stage. Targeting these psychological profiles for neurobiological and etiological study to capture different pathophysiological routes remains a near-term opportunity. Subtypes are likely to be multifactorial, cut across multiple dimensions, and depend on the research or clinical outcomes of interest for their ultimate selection. In this context parallel profiles based on cognition, emotion, and specific neural signatures appear to be on the horizon, each with somewhat different utilities. Efforts to integrate such cross-cutting profiles within a conceptual dysregulation framework are well underway.

AB  - Background. - Food Craving (FC) is a construct influenced by cognitive, emotional, physiological and external components, severely altered in Eating Disorders (EDs).
   Objectives. - To investigate how FC was measured in EDs.
   Methods. - A search was conducted (PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO databases) for studies that have investigated FC in EDs published in the last thirty years.
   Results. - The studies found (n= 37) demonstrated that FC is a predictor of binge eating in individuals with Bulimia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorder, which are more sensitive to the environment and emotional factors, whereas, in individuals with Anorexia Nervosa, FC levels are lower.
   Discussion. - FC is a physiological component of eating behavior, as well as the craving/urge that arises associated with thirst during dehydration, and food restriction is a crucial mechanism for the restriction-binge cycle to hold. Further studies are needed to see if FC increases in response to treatment for Anorexia Nervosa, recognizing that individuals without Anorexia Nervosa have higher FC levels and greater motivational orientation towards food.
   Conclusions. - It is necessary to understand the physiological role of FC and also consider the significance of each food in an individual eating context (eating attitudes) and whether it is treated like a "drug" or just as a desired tasty food and future studies should verify possible neural changes involved in FC after nutritional treatment.

AB  - Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the most dreaded pandemic of our times, which lead to a state of chaos among the mightiest nations of the world. The immune system plays a great role in response to any foreign organisms be it bacteria or viruses. Virus-based pandemics like SARS, MERS, COVID-19 have time and again been surfacing leading to mortality and morbidity worldwide. These pandemics have also resurfaced the role of public health and its modes which have been fading in the presence of lucrative hi-tech medical industry. Although Chinese system of medicine has been explored, there is still more to be done in exploring solutions from time tested Indian systems of medicine like Ayurved and Yog. Its time to rethink and explore ways to harness our immune system and look for evidence-based solutions providing the best of both medical systems to the patients, i.e., modern medicine as well as Ayurved and Yog. The present review is a narrative review wherein studies were searched from databases like PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and web pages. Given a paucity of studies hereby we explored existing pieces of evidence, thereby concluding that more randomized controlled trials need to be done for assessing the role of Ayurved, Yog, and other Indian systems of medicine to enrich the armamentarium in the fight against such viruses in future. Family physicians can play a vital role in not only suggesting treatment but also changes in lifestyle of the patients as well as their family. Evidence based knowledge of ancient Indian system will open a new door of integration for overall well being of patient with a scientific outlook.

AB  - Growing evidence highlights the relevance of microbiota-gut-brain axis in the maintenance of brain homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of major neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In particular, changes in gut microbiota can promote enteric and peripheral neurogenic/inflammatory responses, which, in turn, could contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Of note, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome acts as a key player in both coordinating the host physiology and shaping the peripheral and central immune/inflammatory responses in CNS diseases. In this context, there is pioneering evidence supporting the existence of a microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis, in which enteric bacteria modulate, via NLRP3 signaling, inflammatory pathways that, in turn, contribute to influence brain homeostasis.
   The present review provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis in the major CNS diseases, including PD, AD, MS, ASD and MDD. In particular, though no direct and causal correlation among altered gut microbiota, NLRP3 activation and brain pathology has been demonstrated and in-depth studies are needed in this setting, our purpose was to pave the way to a novel and pioneering perspective on the pathophysiology of CNS disorders. Our intent was also to highlight and discuss whether alterations of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis support a holistic view of the pathophysiology of CNS diseases, even though each disorder displays a different clinical picture.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to treat postpartum depression (PPD), but its effectiveness is still uncertain. To evaluate the effect of rTMS on depression symptoms and recognition function in patients with PPD, we systematically searched CNKI, WanFang, VIP, EMbase, PubMed, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Physiotherapy Evidence Database from inception to June 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCT) in English or Chinese concerning PPD in women treated with rTMS. Reference lists were also searched. RCT were included if they compared rTMS with no intervention or sham in patients with PPD. Related data was extracted and risk of bias was assessed by two investigators independently. Of 81 identified studies, 14 met our inclusion criteria (n=884 participants). Compared with control group, rTMS treatment yielded a reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score, and improved the cognitive function of patients with PPD. Current evidence of RCT showed that rTMS could improve depression symptoms and cognitive function in patients with PPD.

AB  - Background Internally displaced children are those who have been forced to flee their homes due to severe unfavourable conditions (war, violence or disasters) but have not crossed international borders. Emerging research shows these children face multiple health challenges. However, we found no review focused solely on the health of such internally displaced children. Thus, this review sought to examine what is known about their health and their health concerns. Methods A scoping review of the literature was conducted. A total of 10 databases were searched in January 2019, yielding 6602 articles after duplicates were eliminated. Two research assistants independently selected articles that met inclusion criteria. A numerical summary and thematic analysis were conducted to facilitate data extraction and data analysis. Results A total of 25 articles met the inclusion criteria, including 16 quantitative, 6 qualitative and 3 mixed methods studies. The findings reveal elevated mental health problems and infectious diseases in this population. Findings on the nutritional status of internally displaced children as a broad group are mixed, with some studies showing poorer nutritional status among the children in this group and others showing poorer nutritional health status among host society children. Internally displaced children also experience challenges with access to health services. Premigration factors (trauma) and postmigration factors (humanitarian assistance on displacement) all contribute to the health of internally displaced children. Conclusion Findings provide insight into the complex array of factors influencing the health of internally displaced children. More intervention studies are required to address the needs of this population.

AB  - The aim of this scoping review was to: (i) determine rates and types of sexual risk behaviours and sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) in those with severe mental illness (SMI); and (ii) delineate correlates of poor sexual health outcome. The online databases OVID MedLine and PsycINFO were searched from databases inception to February 2018 for any literature with a focus on sexual risk behaviours (inconsistent condom use, multiple sexual partners, substance use and transactional sexual acts) or STIs in SMI populations. Fourteen studies were identified; the quality of these studies ranged from poor to moderate. Outcome definitions were heterogeneous, precluding meta-analysis. We found rates of sexual risk behaviours and STIs to be more common among those with SMI than the rates in the general Australian population. Current studies do not acknowledge the relationship of sexual risk behaviours and STI risk and hence do not provide a full model of sexual health outcomes in those with SMI. In order to improve sexual health outcomes in SMI populations, further research is required of greater methodological rigor, with consensus in the definition of sexual risk behaviours, clarifying causal relationships and where in the course of SMI that these outcomes emerge.

AB  - Studies attempting to deconstruct the heterogeneity of schizophrenia and the attenuated psychosis syndrome consistently find that negative symptoms are a core dimension that is distinct from other aspects of the illness (e.g., positive and disorganized symptoms). Negative symptoms are also highly predictive of poor community-based functional outcomes, suggesting they are a critical treatment target. Unfortunately, pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for negative symptoms have demonstrated limited effectiveness. To address this critical unmet therapeutic need, the NIMH sponsored a consensus development conference to delineate research priorities for the field and stimulate treatment development. A primary conclusion of this meeting was that next-generation negative symptom rating scales should be developed to address methodological and conceptual limitations of existing instruments. Although second-generation rating scales were developed for adults with schizophrenia, progress in this area has lagged behind for youth at clinical-high risk (CHR) for developing psychosis (i.e. those meeting criteria for a prodromal syndrome). Given that negative symptoms are highly predictive of the transition to diagnosable psychotic illness, enhancing our ability to detect negative symptoms in CHR youth is paramount. The current paper discusses conceptual and methodological limitations inherent to existing scales that assess negative symptoms in CHR youth. The theoretical and clinical implications of these limitations are evaluated. It is concluded that new scales specifically designed to assess negative symptoms in CHR youth are needed to accurately chart mental illness trajectories and determine when, where, and how to intervene. Recent efforts to develop next-generation measures designed specifically for CHR youth to meet this urgent need in the field are discussed. These new approaches offer significant progress for addressing issues inherent to earlier scales. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: This review examined the efficacy of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
   Methods: PubMed was searched for reports between 01 January 1996 and 31 December 2019 by using combinations of key words bipolar disorder, pregnancy, postpartum period, puerperium, prophylaxis, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine.
   Results: The present reports included a total of 256 patients using lithium (n = 143), lamotrigine (n = 73), valproate (n = 17), olanzapine (n = 17), quetiapine (n = 4) and haloperidol (n = 1) during pregnancy or the postpartum period. Recurrence rates in pregnant patients using lithium (n = 79) and lamotrigine (n = 17) were 22.7 % and 41.2 %, respectively. According to very limited data, none of the patients using valproate (n = 2), quetiapine (n = 3) or olanzapine (n = 6) experienced a new episode during pregnancy. A recurrence was reported in 12 (70.6 %) of 17 patients using valproate during the postpartum period. The same recurrence rates in patients using lithium (n = 123), lamotrigine (n = 63), olanzapine (n = 17) and quetiapine (n = 3) were 20.3 %, 7.9 %, 11.7 %, and 33.3 %, respectively.
   Conclusions: This review suggests that lithium, lamotrigine and olanzapine seem to be effective in preventing new mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder during the perinatal period.

AB  - Background: : The consequences of schizophrenia stigma are numerous and highly damaging to individuals, their families, the health care system and society. Mental health professionals (MHP) are considered to be one of the main sources of stigmatization.
   Objectives: : To identify the characteristics of MHP stigma in schizophrenia in comparison with other psychiatric disorders, the specificities of MHP compared with other social groups, and associated factors.
   Methods: : Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched multiple electronic databases for articles: (i) reporting original data published in English in peer-reviewed journals, (ii) reporting quantitative data with statistical analysis, (iii) assessing stigma in a broad sense, and (iv) including samples composed only of MHP.
   Results: : A total of 38 articles published from 1999 to 2019 and involving 10,926 MHP fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Studies showed that schizophrenia is the most stigmatized mental illnesses in MHP, despite recent results suggesting that borderline personality disorder and substance abuse may be more stigmatized. In comparison with other social groups, MHP reported less dangerousness beliefs and more positive beliefs regarding pharmacological treatment. Nevertheless, results were less consistent regarding prognosis and desire for social distance. Age, education level, type of mental health profession, or length of practice were associated factors that showed inconsistent relations with stigma. Work setting and biological causal beliefs were more clearly associated with MHP stigma.
   Conclusion: : These findings provide strong support for the need to conduct specific research on schizophrenia stigma in MHP and the importance of controlling for several variables to identify predictors of stigma.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a worldwide public health problem. Here, a bibliometric analysis is performed to evaluate the publications in the Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) field from 2000 to 2019 based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases. This work presents a detailed overview of IPV from aspects of types of articles, citations, h-indices, languages, years, journals, institutions, countries, and author keywords. The results show that the USA takes the leading position in this research field, followed by Canada and the U.K. The University of North Carolina has the most publications and Harvard University has the first place in terms of h-index. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine leads the list of average citations per paper. TheJournal of Interpersonal Violence,Journal of Family ViolenceandViolence Against Womenare the top three most productive journals in this field, and Psychology is the most frequently used subject category. Keywords analysis indicates that, in recent years, most research focuses on the research fields of "child abuse", "pregnancy", "HIV", "dating violence", "gender-based violence" and "adolescents".

AB  - With recent advances in surgery and immunosuppressive drugs, organ transplantation has become a major treatment for irreversible organ failure. However, organ transplant recipients returning home after operation may face ongoing physiological, psychological, and social difficulties. To increase recipients' quality of life, postoperative care at home is critical. Thus, the aim of this systematic literature review was to explore recipients' difficulties and needs during postoperative care at home. Our search conformed to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and returned 23 relevant articles published from 1997-2020 in PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, Cochrane, ProQuest, and CEPS, which were assessed using the Modified Jadad Scale or the 32 Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) appraisal indices and then synthesized through narration. The most common difficulties faced were psychological difficulties, followed by physiological, social, and other difficulties; the most common needs were psychological needs, followed by education and information training, social, and other needs. These results demonstrated that healthcare professionals can do more to provide patients with comprehensive care and promote successful self-management and quality of life at home. They also confirmed that collaboration between transplant teams, caregivers, and patients is necessary to optimize postoperative outcomes. We suggest that customized care may promote postoperative patients' self-management and quality of life at home.

AB  - The existence of discrete time windows has triggered the search for permanence and continuity for artists (including poets) in multiple cultures throughout history. In this article, we argue that there exists a 3-s window in the temporal structure of poems as well as in the aesthetic appreciation of poetry by reviewing previous literature on the temporal aspects of poems. This 3-s window can also be considered to be a general temporal machinery underlying human behavior, including language production and perception in general. The reafference principle has provided us a unique frame for understanding cognitive processes. However, "time" was absent in the original two-stage reafference principle. Therefore, we propose a three-stage cycling model of language perception, taking into account time and time windows. We also inspect the possible neural implementations of the three stages: the generation, maintenance, and comparison of predictions (as well as the integration of predictions into the representational context). These three stages are embedded in a temporal window of similar to 3 s and are repeated in a cycling mode, resulting in the representational context being continuously updated. Thus, it is possible that "semantics" could be carried forward across different time windows, being a "glue" linking the discrete time windows and thus achieving the subjective feeling of temporal continuity. Candidates of such "semantic glue" could include semantic and syntactic structures as well as identity and emotion.

AB  - Background: The evidence evaluating environmental chemical exposures (ECE) and breast cancer (BC) risk is heterogeneous which may stem in part as few studies measure ECE during key BC windows of susceptibility (WOS). Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE.
   Objectives: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3).
   Methods:We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019.
   Results: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes.
   Discussion: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk.

AB  - Introduction:Neuroimaging studies on neural processes associated with mirror-induced visual illusion (MVI) are growing in number. Previous systematic reviews on these studies used qualitative approaches. Objective:The present study conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to locate the brain areas for unfolding the neural processes associated with the MVI. Method:We searched the CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed databases and identified eight studies (with 14 experiments) that met the inclusion criteria. Results:Contrasting with a rest condition, strong convergence in the bilateral primary and premotor areas and the inferior parietal lobule suggested top-down motor planning and execution. In addition, convergence was identified in the ipsilateral precuneus, cerebellum, superior frontal gyrus, and superior parietal lobule, clusters corresponding to the static hidden hand indicating self-processing operations, somatosensory processing, and motor control. When contrasting with an active movement condition, additional substantial convergence was revealed in visual-related areas, such as the ipsilateral cuneus, fusiform gyrus, middle occipital gyrus (visual area V2) and lingual gyrus, which mediate basic visual processing. Conclusions:To the best of our knowledge, the current meta-analysis is the first to reveal the visualization, mental rehearsal and motor-related processes underpinning the MVI and offers theoretical support on using MVI as a clinical intervention for post-stroke patients.

AB  - Background Over the last two decades an increasing number of countries have legalized euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) leading to considerable debate over the inherent ethical dilemmas. Increasing numbers of people with personality disorders, faced with unbearable suffering, have requested and received assistance in terminating their lives. EAS in people with personality disorders has, however, received very sparse attention from clinicians and researchers. In this paper, we examine the literature on the practice and prevalence of EAS in people with personality disorders to date and discuss the associated challenges for research and practice. Methods Narrative review of the literature combined with the authors' collective experience and knowledge of personality disorders. Results In six of the eight countries where EAS is currently legal, mental disorders are accepted as disorders for which EAS may be granted. In four of these countries, EAS in minors with mental disorders is also accepted. Our literature search resulted in 9 papers on the subject of EAS in people with personality disorders. These studies suggest that most clinicians who grant EAS have indeed perceived their patients' suffering as chronic, unbearable and untreatable without prospect of improvement. The majority of patients with personality disorders had tried some form of psychotherapy, but very few had received any of the relevant evidence-based treatments. The decision to grant EAS based on a perception of the patient's illness as being untreatable with no prospect of improvement, could, thus, in many cases fail to meet the due care criteria listed in EAS laws. People with personality disorders more often wish for death for extended periods of time than people without these disorders. However, there is ample empirical data to show that suicidal tendencies and behaviour can be treated and that they fluctuate rapidly over time. Conclusions In light of our findings, we believe that the current legislation and practice of EAS for people with personality disorders is based on an inadequate understanding of underlying psychopathology and a lack of awareness about the contemporary treatment literature. Moreover, we assert that this practice neglects the individual's potential for having a life worth living.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to detail developments in UK alcohol policy for older people over the past 20 years, based on evidence for a growing public health problem with alcohol misuse in older people. Design/methodology/approach A literature search was carried out using health and social care databases, including grey literature. Findings There has been considerable progress in areas such as screening and brief intervention, low-risk drinking and service provision for integrated care in older people with dual diagnosis. Research limitations/implications There remains a dearth of research and policy for older people with alcohol misuse and dual diagnosis prior to 2011. Although there remains limited empirical evidence for public health interventions to improve health outcomes from alcohol-related harm, improvements in population health from implementation of recent policy changes and intervention programmes remains to be seen. Practical implications This review has implications for best practice in the provision of integrated care to reduce harm and improve health and social outcomes in older people with alcohol misuse and dual diagnosis. Originality/value This review draws together a large area of research and policy on alcohol misuse in older people that has the potential to improve public mental health for older people who are at risk of alcohol-related harm.

AB  - Objective: To summarise publications reporting on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in a narrative review. Methods: ProQuest, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for articles published in 2020. This search used two terms: 'alcohol' and 'COVID'. Reference lists of articles were reviewed to identify additional articles. Results: There is growing concern around an increase in alcohol intake and alcohol-related harms. These concerns are related to the impact of excessive alcohol consumption in a person with COVID-19 and/or with alcohol use disorder, as well as with a potential increase in the prevalence of harmful drinking, alcohol use disorder, withdrawal symptoms, intimate partner violence, harm to children, suicide, mental health problems and non-communicable diseases. The need for assessing alcohol use and providing adequate advice during the pandemic have been highlighted. Conclusion: The time for action is now, and all necessary measures to prevent an increase in alcohol-related problems should be adopted. At the same time, healthcare services should also prepare for such potential increase, while adapting to the exceptional circumstances presented by the pandemic, such as physical distancing.

AB  - Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) are a group of clinically heterogeneous genetic disorders that arise as the result of dysfunctional mitochondria. Only few medical articles deal with neuropsychological or psychiatric aspects of MDs. Aim The present article aims to provide a systematic review of neuropsychological and psychiatric aspects of MDs. Methods In order to identify all studies dealing with psychiatric and neuropsychological aspects of MDs in children and adolescents, we performed a search in the medical literature between April 2009 and April 2019 using PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science and we defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results We found only seven studies that satisfy the inclusion requirements and criteria. The main psychiatric aspects reported in MDs were depressive and behavioral disorders. With regard to the neuropsychological aspects of MDs, developmental analyses showed an overall deterioration and developmental delay. Interpretation Children and adolescents with MDs may present psychiatric symptoms and neuropsychological impairment. A more systematic investigation of psychiatric and neuropsychological features of MDs is needed to foster a better understanding of the phenotype of these diseases and their links with the genotype, which may have significant implications for the developmental trajectories of patients.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are commonly erratic influenced by various factors including lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors. In recent observations, it has been hypothesized that exposure to various environmental factors enhances the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The exact etiology of Alzheimer's disease is still unclear; however, the contribution of environmental factors in the pathology of AD is widely acknowledged. Based on the available literature, the review aims to culminate in the prospective correlation between the various environmental factors and AD. The prolonged exposure to the various well-known environmental factors including heavy metals, air pollutants (particulate matter), pesticides, nanoparticles containing metals, industrial chemicals results in accelerating the progression of AD. Common mechanisms have been documented in the field of environmental contaminants for enhancing amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide along with tau phosphorylation, resulting in the initiation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which results in the death of neurons. This review offers a compilation of available data to support the long-suspected correlation between environmental risk factors and AD pathology.

AB  - Background Diabetes self-management education programmes are effective in improving health outcomes in the general population with diabetes. However, it is not known if these programmes include people who also have a severe mental illness (SMI) and, if so, what their outcomes are. The aim of this review was to examine if evaluations of diabetes self-management education programmes included people with SMI, and if so, whether the interventions were beneficial for this population. Methods The inclusion criteria for this systematic review, defined by PICOS criteria, were: Population - Adults with type 2 diabetes; Intervention - self-management education programme; Comparator - another active intervention or usual care; Outcomes of interest - inclusion of people with SMI and the clinical, behavioural and psychosocial outcomes in this population; Study design - randomised controlled trials. The following bibliographic databases were searched from January 2004 to April 2018: Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database, Health Technology Assessment, NHS Economic Evaluations Database and CINAHL. Data were extracted on study characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, participant and intervention characteristics, number of participants with SMI, and outcomes for people with SMI, if reported. Authors were contacted by email for missing data. Results A total of 410 trials were included. At least 42% of trials did not recruit any participants with SMI. Only nine confirmed inclusion of participants with SMI, of which six provided data on the number recruited. These six trials recruited a total of 1009 participants, of whom 31 (3.1%) had SMI. It was not possible to assess intervention effectiveness for people with SMI as none of the trials reported outcomes for these participants. Conclusions This systematic review confirms that people with SMI are often excluded from trials of diabetes self-management education, resulting in a lack of an evidence base on which to base treatment paths for this vulnerable population. It cannot be assumed that programmes developed for the general diabetes population meet the needs of people with SMI. Future research needs to examine if and how these programmes could be adapted for people with SMI or if new programmes are required.

AB  - Self-harm, defined for the purpose of this review as any act of self-injury without explicit suicidal intent, is an increasing public health concern, with potential long-term implications for those who engage in it. Previous research has identified a correlational relationship between self-harm and alexithymia, an emotion processing deficit characterized by difficulties identifying and describing feelings, and an externally orientated thinking style. Through a systematic search of the literature, the current review examines the association between alexithymia and self-harm. A meta-analysis based on 23 studies found a significant, positive relationship between self-harm and alexithymia, with a medium effect size (g = 0.57, 95% CI 0.46-0.69). All 23 studies used the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS20) to measure alexithymia. The alexithymia subcomponents difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings were significantly associated with self-harm, but there was no significant association between self-harm and externally orientated thinking. The effect size of the relationship was significantly larger in adolescent samples compared with adult samples and in female compared with male samples. The definition of self-harm did not affect the effect size of the relationship between alexithymia and self-harm and the results are consistent with previous meta-analyses focused more narrowly on non-suicidal self-injury and, separately, suicidal behaviors. Heterogeneity between the included studies was high. The results support an affect regulation model of self-harm, in which self-harm is used to regulate an emotional experience that is poorly understood.

AB  - In studies of habitat-forming species, those that are not spatially dominant are often considered "non-primary" habitat and may be overlooked. This is despite the fact that minority habitat formers can provide critical complexity, food, and other services that underpin ecosystem biodiversity. Octocorals and anemones are found in marine and estuarine habitats across all climate zones. Despite their potentially important ecological roles, to date there have been few studies of their specific threats and stressors or attempts at their restoration. Here we review studies of the ecology of octocorals and anemones with a focus on threats and restoration. We identify many threats including habitat damage, collection and trade, disease, predation, pollution, and the most widespread - climate change. While evidence suggests that some octocorals and anemone populations may be more resilient to disturbances than stony corals because they often recruit and grow quickly, resilience is not guaranteed. Instead, resilience or susceptibility within this large group is likely to be site and species specific. We find that the loss of octocorals and anemones has been difficult to quantify as most species have no hard structures that remain following a mortality event. Only through long-term monitoring efforts have researchers been able to document change in these populations. Due to the increasing extent and severity of human impacts in marine ecosystems, restoration of habitat forming species is becoming increasingly necessary after disturbance events. To illustrate the challenges ahead for octocoral and anemone restoration, we present two examples of ongoing restoration efforts assessed against the International Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration. Restoration planning and implementation progress are documented for the Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum and the temperate Australian cauliflower soft coral, Dendronephthya australis. This review and the detailed case studies demonstrate that while some octocorals and anemones can provide resilient habitat within reef systems, a greater research focus on their ecology, threats, and restoration potential is urgently required.

AB  - Background:The effects of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-neurofeedback on brain activation and behaviors have been studied extensively in the past. More recently, researchers have begun to investigate the effects of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based neurofeedback (fNIRS-neurofeedback). FNIRS is a functional neuroimaging technique based on brain hemodynamics, which is easy to use, portable, inexpensive, and has reduced sensitivity to movement artifacts. Method:We provide the first systematic review and database of fNIRS-neurofeedback studies, synthesizing findings from 22 peer-reviewed studies (including a total ofN= 441 participants; 337 healthy, 104 patients). We (1) give a comprehensive overview of how fNIRS-neurofeedback training protocols were implemented, (2) review the online signal-processing methods used, (3) evaluate the quality of studies using pre-set methodological and reporting quality criteria and also present statistical sensitivity/power analyses, (4) investigate the effectiveness of fNIRS-neurofeedback in modulating brain activation, and (5) review its effectiveness in changing behavior in healthy and pathological populations. Results and discussion:(1-2) Published studies are heterogeneous (e.g., neurofeedback targets, investigated populations, applied training protocols, and methods). (3) Large randomized controlled trials are still lacking. In view of the novelty of the field, the quality of the published studies is moderate. We identified room for improvement in reporting important information and statistical power to detect realistic effects. (4) Several studies show that people can regulate hemodynamic signals from cortical brain regions with fNIRS-neurofeedback and (5) these studies indicate the feasibility of modulating motor control and prefrontal brain functioning in healthy participants and ameliorating symptoms in clinical populations (stroke, ADHD, autism, and social anxiety). However, valid conclusions about specificity or potential clinical utility are premature. Conclusion:Due to the advantages of practicability and relatively low cost, fNIRS-neurofeedback might provide a suitable and powerful alternative to EEG and fMRI neurofeedback and has great potential for clinical translation of neurofeedback. Together with more rigorous research and reporting practices, further methodological improvements may lead to a more solid understanding of fNIRS-neurofeedback. Future research will benefit from exploiting the advantages of fNIRS, which offers unique opportunities for neurofeedback research.

AB  - Currently, there is an important debate on how social networks have affected relations between organizations and their audiences: originally complementary -since organizations had full control over the messages that they sent to users, who were mere consumers of information-, they are now symmetric -since users produce and disseminate information about organizations on a global scale through social media-. Therefore, one of the main concerns of organizations when investing in social networks is to connect with their target audience, to have virality, greater visibility and scope. Likewise, neuromarketing is gaining significant importance when it comes to predicting user behavior through biometric measurements, so it can be an essential tool for developing content that engages organizations and their audiences. The main objective of this work is to conduct a theoretical review of the main scientific research on the effectiveness of neuromarketing as a tool to improve the emotional connection between organizations and users in social networks. Thus, the scientific literature on the object under study available on the Web Of Science has been extensively reviewed. The results of the analysis of the main researches in this field reveal the importance of neuromarketing: some of them agree that the communicative effectiveness between organizations and audiences in social networks depends more on sociology and psychology than on technology itself. Neuromarketing has also allowed to demonstrate the relevance of the so-called social influence in social networks: users tend to imitate the behaviors of others, under the premise that these actions reflect the appropriate procedure. That is, when a user sees that others in their environment comment or share a post, they tend to replicate that action in order to avoid the fear of being the only one who behaves differently.

AB  - Necroptosis is a regulated cell death that is governed by mixed lineage kinase domain-like, receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 and commonly displays with necrosis morphological characteristics. This study examined the molecular mechanisms involved in the chemical-induced necroptosis where a systematic evaluation of experimental studies addressing this issue is missing. We strictly reviewed all scientific reports related to our search terms including "necroptosis" or "programmed necrosis", "environmental chemicals" or "air pollutants" or "pesticides" or "nanoparticles" and "Medicines" from 2009 to 2019. Manuscripts that met the objective of this study were included for further evaluations. Studies showed that several pathological contexts like cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory diseases were related to necroptosis. Furthermore, multiple chemical-induced cytotoxic effects, such as DNA damage, mitochondrial dysregulation, oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation, endoplasmic reticulum disruption, and inflammation are also associated with necroptosis. The main environmental exposures that are related to necroptosis are air pollutants (airborne particulate matter, cadmium, and hydrogen sulfide), nanoparticles (gold, silver, and silica), pesticides (endosulfan, cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, and paraquat), and tobacco smoke. To sum up, air pollutants, pesticides, and nanoparticles could potentially affect human health via disruption of cell growth and induction of necroptosis. Understanding the exact molecular pathogenesis of these environmental chemicals needs further comprehensive research to provide innovative concepts for the prevention approaches and introduce novel targets for the amelioration of a range of human health problems.

KW  - arts and health
KW  - primary care
KW  - GP training
KW  - mental health
KW  - long-term conditions
AB  - Background: General practitioners (GPs) and other health professionals have a key role in signposting their patients to appropriate opportunities for engaging in arts and creative activities for the health and wellbeing benefits they may bring. Training is needed to ensure that GPs are aware of the evidence supporting the role of the arts, and the local availability of 'creative arts for health' activities for their patients. Aim: This article describes the content and evaluation of three arts and health training events for trainee GPs conducted over the period 2016-2019. They took place in association with Guy's and St Thomas, Hillingdon and York and Scarborough General Practice Vocational Training Schemes (GPVTS). Methods: Evaluation was undertaken for the London events using a specially constructed questionnaire, with rating scales, completed before and after the training events. For the York event, a simple bespoke evaluation questionnaire was employed at the end of the training day. All participants gave consent for photography and filming during the events. Results: Feedback from GPs on the training events revealed increased awareness of the evidence for arts and health interventions, and more positive attitudes towards the role of creative arts in primary care in promoting the health and wellbeing of patients. An additional finding was a recognition by GP trainees that creative activities can enhance a holistic approach to patient care and play a positive part in supporting their own wellbeing. Conclusion: Training events of the kind described, with opportunities for creative participation for GP trainees, can enhance awareness of the benefits of creative activity for patient health and wellbeing, and may motivate future GPs to signpost patients towards opportunities for engaging in creative activities. This training model is applicable for any health worker who can refer patients to arts for health activities and has potential to be scaled up nationally.

AB  - Background Previous studies have shown that an intellectually stimulating lifestyle is associated with a lower risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). It is unclear so far whether higher intelligence may protect against this. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the association between intelligence and cognitive decline and ADRD risk. Methods We searched the PubMed, web of science, and Scopus databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) criteria. Quality of evidence was assessed using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklists. Results From an initial n=8,371 search hits, n= 14 studies met the inclusion criteria and had sufficient quality. Evidence indicates that cognitive decline in old age is not significantly associated with childhood intelligence (n=9). Evidence with regard to ADRD risk is inconclusive (n=5) with some studies showing no effects and other studies with significant effects having limitations in their design. Conclusions Even though the majority of the studies show no significant association, we cannot exclude a possible effect that might be moderated by other, so far unknown factors. Further studies are necessary to systematically assess the influence of intelligence on ADRD risk and what factors moderate this association.

AB  - Background:Chronic pain is a significant global health issue. For most individuals with chronic pain, biomedical treatments do not provide adequate relief. Given the evidence that neurophysiological abnormalities are associated with pain, it is reasonable to consider treatments that target these factors, such as neurofeedback (NF). The primary objectives of this review were to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding: (1) the different types of NF and NF protocols that have been evaluated for pain management; (2) the evidence supporting each NF type and protocol; (3) if targeted brain activity changes occur with NF training; and (4) if such brain activity change is associated with improvements on treatment outcomes. Methods:Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad to encompass every empirical study using NF in relation to pain. We considered all kinds of NF, including both electroencephalogram- (EEG-) and functional magnetic resonance imagining- (fMRI-) based. We searched the following databases from inception through September 2019: Pubmed, Ovid, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO. The search strategy consisted of a combination of key terms referring to all NF types and pain conditions (e.g., neurofeedback, rt-fMRI-NF, BOLD, pain, migraine). Results:A total of 6,552 citations were retrieved; 24 of these that were included in the review. Most of the studies were of moderate quality, included a control condition and but did not include a follow-up. They focused on studying pain intensity (83%), pain frequency, and other variables (fatigue, sleep, depression) in samples of adults (n= 7-71) with headaches, fibromyalgia and other pain conditions. Most studies (79%) used EEG-based NF. A wide variety of NF types and protocols have been used for pain management aiming to either increase, decrease or regulate brain activity in certain areas theoretically associated with pain. Conclusions:Given the generally positive results in the studies reviewed, the findings indicate that NF procedures have the potential for reducing pain and improving other related outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. However, the current evidence does not provide definitive conclusions or allow for reliable recommendations on which protocols or methods of administration may be the most effective. These findings support the need for continued - but higher quality - research in this area.

AB  - Background: Persons with schizophrenia are vulnerable regarding human rights violations. Aims: The aim of this research is to systematically analyse judgements by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) involving persons with schizophrenia. Methods: A systematic search of judgements by the ECtHR, using the search term 'schizophrenia'. Descriptive statistics and a qualitative thematic analysis were performed. Results: A total ofn = 105 judgements were included, originating inn = 29 countries. Article 5 (Right to liberty and security) of the European Convention on Human Rights was ruled by the ECtHR to have been violated in 45.7% of judgements, Article 3 (Prohibition of torture) in 20.0% and Article 8 (Right to respect for private and family life) in 19.0%. Relevant themes were inadequate access to mental health care, especially in prisons and during police operations, involuntary confinement, detention and ill-treatment as a risk factor for psychosis, the right to family life versus the rights of others, extradition/expulsion and protection of other persons' human rights against violent behaviour by persons with schizophrenia. Discussion: Persons with schizophrenia often do not receive adequate treatment and are especially vulnerable in prisons, where ill-treatment can be an additional risk factor. They can have both offender and victim status. The judgements suggest that the ECtHR has a balanced view on involuntary confinement. National legislation and internal hospital guidelines should be written in a manner to help minimise human rights violations against persons with schizophrenia.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to describe factors that support and prevent managers' work wellbeing by reviewing international studies and interviewing Finnish social- and healthcare managers. Design/methodology/approach Twenty-two studies were identified in the systematic literature search. Seven social care and healthcare managers were recruited to participate in thematic interviews. Data were analyzed by using content analysis. Findings Supportive and preventive factors for managers' work wellbeing were identified in the literature review, including managerial position, decision latitude, job control, social support and ethical culture at the workplace. The interviews further suggested that the supportive and preventive factors affecting social and healthcare managers' work wellbeing could be divided into five broad categories: (1) Individual factors, (2) Social factors, (3) Professional support from one's own manager, (4) Work-related factors and (5) Organizational factors. Originality/value We conducted a systematic literature search together with expert interviews to find the factors most crucial to managers' work wellbeing. These findings can assist social and healthcare organizations and policymakers to pay attention to these factors as well as in policies guiding them.

AB  - Telomere attrition is increased in various disorders and is therefore a potential biomarker for diagnosis and/or prognosis of these disorders. The contribution of telomere attrition in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders is yet to be fully elucidated. We are reviewing the current knowledge regarding the telomere biology in two common neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, we are discussing future prospective of telomere research in these disorders. The majority of studies reported consistent evidence of the accelerated telomere attrition in AD patients, possibly in association with elevated oxidative stress levels. On the other hand in PD, various studies reported contradictory evidence regarding telomere attrition. Consequently, due to the low specificity and sensitivity, the clinical benefit of telomere length as a biomarker of neurodegenerative disease development and progression is not yet recognized. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies in large carefully selected cohorts might provide further elucidation of the complex involvement of the telomeres in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Telomere length maintenance is a complex process characterized by environmental, genetic, and epigenetic determinants. Thus, in addition to the selection of the study cohort, also the selection of analytical methods and types of biological samples for evaluation of the telomere attrition is of utmost importance.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to determine whether criminal justice (CJ) stigma affects health outcomes and health care utilization. Design/methodology/approach The authors reviewed medical and public health literature through May 2020. Structured terms were used to search four databases identifying articles that related to CJ stigma. Included articles were in English, examined CJ stigma and had people with CJ involvement as subjects. The studies without health outcomes were excluded. Quantitative and qualitative studies were reviewed and assessed for bias. Results were synthesized into a systematic review. Findings The search yielded 25 studies relating to CJ stigma and health. Three stigma domains were described in the literature: perceived or enacted, internalized and anticipated stigma. Tenuous evidence linked CJ stigma to health directly (psychological symptoms) and indirectly (social isolation, health care utilization, high-risk behaviors and housing or employment). Multiple stigmatized identities may interact to affect health and health care utilization. Research limitations/implications Few studies examined CJ stigma and health. Articles used various measures of CJ stigma, but psychometric properties for instruments were not presented. Prospective studies with standard validated measures are needed. Practical implications Understanding whether and how CJ stigma affects health and health care utilization will be critical for developing health-promoting interventions for people with CJ involvement. Practical interventions could target stigma-related psychological distress or reduce health care providers' stigmatizing behaviors. Originality/value This was the first systematic review of CJ stigma and health. By providing a summary of the current evidence and identifying consistent findings and gaps in the literature, this review provides direction for future research and highlights implications for policy and practice.

AB  - Background Nurturing care, in which children are raised in engaging and safe environments, may reduce child stress and shape hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning. Hence, parent-training programs may impact child cortisol levels, as well as behavioral, social and health outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of the impact of parent-training interventions on children's and caregivers' cortisol levels, and meta-analyzed the results. Methods In January 2020, searches in PubMed, LILACS, ERIC, Web of Science, Scielo, Scopus, PsycNET and POPLINE databases were conducted, and two independent researchers screened the results for eligible studies - randomized trials that assessed the impact of parent-training interventions on child or caregiver cortisol levels. Random effects were used to pool the estimates, separately for children and caregivers, and for children's morning and evening cortisol levels, as well as change across the day. Results A total of 27 eligible studies were found. Data from 19 studies were extracted and included in the meta-analyses, with 18 estimates of child cortisol levels and 5 estimates for caregiver cortisol levels. The pooled effect size (standardized mean difference) for the effects of parent training programs on morning child cortisol was 0.01 (95%CI: - 0.14 to 0.16; I-2: 47.5%), and for caregivers it was 0.04 (95%CI: - 0.22 to 0.30; I-2: 0.0%). Similar null results were observed for child evening cortisol and for the slope between morning and evening child cortisol. No evidence of publication bias was found. Conclusion Existing evidence shows no effect of parent-training interventions on child or caregiver post-intervention cortisol. Researchers are encouraged to adopt standardized protocols to improve evaluation standards, to test for intervention effects on psychosocial outcomes that are theorized to mediate the effects on biomarkers, and to use additional biomarkers for chronic stress.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) paradigms have been used to induce lasting changes in brain activity and excitability. Previous methods of stimulation were long, often ineffective and produced short-lived and variable results. A new non-invasive brain stimulation technique was developed in John Rothwell's laboratory in the early 2000s, which was named 'theta burst stimulation' (TBS). This used rTMS applied in burst patterns of newly acquired 50 Hz rTMS machines, which emulated long-term potentiation/depression-like effects in brain slices. This stimulation paradigm created long-lasting changes in brain excitability, using efficient, very rapid stimulation, which would affect behaviour, with the aim to influence neurological diseases in humans. We describe the development of this technique, including findings and limitations identified since then. We discuss how pitfalls facing TBS reflect those involving both older and newer, non-invasive stimulation techniques, with suggestions of how to overcome these, using personalised, 'closed loop' stimulation methods. The challenge in most non-invasive stimulation techniques remains in identifying their exact mechanisms of action in the context of neurological disease models. The development of TBS provides the backdrop for describing John's contribution to the field, inspiring our own scientific endeavour thanks to his unconditional support, and unfailing kindness.

AB  - Background The treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a very disabling disease. Objective The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the therapeutic activity of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy system in TRD. We summarised the progress made during the last decade in this area. Methods We conducted a non-systematic review on the efficacy and safety of the VNS therapy for this disease. We analysed the results from acute and long-term studies that utilised this technique. Major electronic databases were searched. Results The patients with TRD may show acute and long-term benefit when treated with this technique. There are promising results for VNS therapy for these patients. The level of evidence as an acute treatment option is only 3, but as chronic treatment is 2. This therapy should be offered as an added long-term treatment option for patients with chronic and recurrent difficult to treat depression. Conclusions The antidepressant effects of this procedure remain controversial. The clinical trials have produced mixed results, but VNS therapy for TRD has two distinct features that differentiate it from other antidepressant treatments: a sustained therapeutic response obtained in highly resistant depressive disorders, a favourable safety profile and guaranteed compliance.

AB  - The presence of intraneuronal Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) in the substantia nigra (SN) composed of aggregated alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) has been recognized as a hallmark of pathological changes in Parkinson's disease (PD). Numerous studies have shown that aggregated alpha-syn is necessary for neurotoxicity. Meanwhile, the mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunctions are associated with alpha-syn pathogenicity The hypothesis that alpha-syn transmission in the human brain contributes to the instigation and progression of PD has provided insights into PD pathology. This review will provide a brief overview of increasing researches that shed light on the relationship of alpha-syn aggregation with mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunctions, and highlight recent understanding of alpha-syn transmission in PD pathology.

Recent findings suggest that increased IU and high levels of parental accommodation are associated with a poorer response to CBT. Several adaptations of CBT and new interventions targeting either IU or parental accommodation have been developed and found to be efficacious in preliminary studies.SummaryIU and parental accommodation are promising constructs for personalizing intervention, both in the identification of who will respond to treatment and in the development of targeted intervention. We recommend that future work test if individuals high in IU and/or parental accommodation will respond more optimally to treatments that specifically target these constructs. The results of this future work may help to move the field closer to personalized intervention.

AB  - Researching the relationship between physical activity and academic performance is becoming an important research topic due to increasing evidence about the positive effect of physical activity on cognitive functioning. The present systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number: CDR132118) is a unique contribution to the recently published reviews since it only includes interventions longer than 6 weeks and acknowledges the influence of the qualifications of practitioners who deliver interventions. After identifying 14,245 records in five databases and selecting 247 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 44 interventions passed all eligibility criteria. This meta-analysis uses validity generalization in a random effects model, which shows that academic performance itself is not solely caused by increased physical activity. The weighted mean population effect of all included interventions was r(w)= 0.181. Most of the studies had serious limitations since they did not report physical activity intensity, which is an essential component to achieving positive exercise effects on cognition. In addition, the qualifications of the staff who administer the interventions were largely ignored in existing literature. It was found that 13 out of 20 physical activity interventions with significant positive effects on academic performance were performed by practitioners who held higher qualifications in the field of physical education and exercise science, who could mediate higher physical activity intensities of the given interventions. The population effect in studies where interventions were administered by practitioners with lower qualifications in the field (r(w)= 0.14) was lower compared to interventions performed by staff with higher qualifications (r(w)= 0.22). There was also a significant difference in academic performance with regard to staff qualification level (chi = 4.464;p= 0.035). In addition to activity duration, future physical activity intervention studies including those investigating academic performance should focus on the importance of physical activity intensity and include measures of physical fitness as objective indicators to enable more reliable analyses to establish physical activity influence on academic performance.

AB  - Suicide reduction is recognized as a vital focus for mental health clinicians. Clinician confidence to undertake suicide risk assessment, though poorly understood, appears related to job performance, though overconfidence has also been evident in clinical practice. A systematic literature search was undertaken on PSYCinfo and MEDLINE using the terms:suicide risk assessment, confidence, clinician.Of 192 papers identified, 10 articles were deemed pertinent. These for the most part suggested clinician confidence above the 50% chance level though statistical evidence was lacking for all but two. The literature fails to provide sufficient and objective evidence of the impact of clinician confidence in practice. Recommendations are provided for future research.

Subject and methods A systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, MEDLINE, PubMed and Embase. A manual search was conducted in the WHO Global Index Medicus and Google Scholar. Peer-reviewed English-language publications that reported results on care delivery in CEs were included for review. There was no limitation on the year or the geographical location of the studies. The content of the publications was qualitatively analysed, and the results are thematically presented in tabular form. Results Thirty publications were identified. Information regarding coverage, accessibility, quality, continuity and comprehensiveness of care service delivery was extracted and synthesized. Findings showed that constant insecurity, funding, language barriers and gender differences were factors impeding access to and coverage and comprehensiveness of care delivery in CEs. The review also showed a preference for traditional treatment among some refugees and IDPs. Conclusion Evidence from this systematic review revealed a high level of unmet healthcare need among refugees and IDPs and the need for a paradigm shift in the approach to care delivery in CEs. We recommend further research aimed at a more critical evaluation of care delivery in CEs with a view to providing a more innovative and context-specific care service delivery in these settings.

AB  - Background: Public health concern is increasing with recent rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Nepal. To curb this pandemic, Nepal is facing some forms of lockdown, encouraging people to implement social distancing so as to reduce interactions between people which could eventually reduce the possibilities of new infection; however, it has affected the overall physical, mental, social and spiritual health of the people. Methods: Published articles related to psychosocial effects due to COVID-19 and other outbreaks were searched and reviewed. Conclusion: While many countries are supporting their citizens with sophisticated health safety-nets and various relief funds, some developing countries have unique challenges with vulnerable populations and limited resources to respond to the pandemic. This review presents the consequences of pandemic and lockdown on socioeconomic, mental health and other aspects in Nepalese society.

AB  - Neurodegeneration is the progressive loss of neuronal structures and functions that lead to copious disorders like Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), Huntington's (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and other less recurring diseases. Aging is the primeculprit for most neurodegenerative events. Moreover, the shared pathogenic factors of many neurodegenerative processes are inflammatory responses and oxidative stress (OS). Unfortunately, it is very complicated to treat neurodegeneration and there is no effective remedy. The rapid progression of the neurodegenerative diseases that exacerbate the burden and the concurrent absence of effective treatment strategies force the researchers to investigate more therapeutic approaches that ultimately target the causative factors of the neurodegeneration. Phytochemicals have great potential to exert their neuroprotective effects by targeting various mechanisms, such as OS, neuroinflammation, abnormal protein aggregation, neurotrophic factor deficiency, disruption inmitochondrial function, and apoptosis. Therefore, this review represents the molecular mechanisms of neuroprotection by multifunctional phytochemicals to combat age-linked neurodegenerative disorders. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Similar to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) detects the changes of hemoglobin species inside the brain, but via differences in optical absorption. Within the near-infrared spectrum, light can penetrate biological tissues and be absorbed by chromophores, such as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. What makes fNIRS more advantageous is its portability and potential for long-term monitoring. This paper reviews the basic mechanisms of fNIRS and its current clinical applications, the limitations toward more widespread clinical usage of fNIRS, and current efforts to improve the temporal and spatial resolution of fNIRS toward robust clinical usage within subjects. Oligochannel fNIRS is adequate for estimating global cerebral function and it has become an important tool in the critical care setting for evaluating cerebral oxygenation and autoregulation in patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury. When it comes to a more sophisticated utilization, spatial and temporal resolution becomes critical. Multichannel NIRS has improved the spatial resolution of fNIRS for brain mapping in certain task modalities, such as language mapping. However, averaging and group analysis are currently required, limiting its clinical use for monitoring and real-time event detection in individual subjects. Advances in signal processing have moved fNIRS toward individual clinical use for detecting certain types of seizures, assessing autonomic function and cortical spreading depression. However, its lack of accuracy and precision has been the major obstacle toward more sophisticated clinical use of fNIRS. The use of high-density whole head optode arrays, precise sensor locations relative to the head, anatomical co-registration, short-distance channels, and multi-dimensional signal processing can be combined to improve the sensitivity of fNIRS and increase its use as a wide-spread clinical tool for the robust assessment of brain function.

AB  - Background Depressive symptoms are common in empty-nest elderly in China, but the reported prevalence rates across studies are mixed. This is a meta-analysis of the pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) in empty-nest elderly in China. Methods Two investigators independently conducted a systematic literature search in both English (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) and Chinese (CNKI and Wan Fang) databases. Data were analyzed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program. Results A total of 46 studies with 36,791 subjects were included. The pooled prevalence of depression was 38.6% (95%CI: 31.5-46.3%). Compared with non-empty-nest elderly, empty-nest elderly were more likely to suffer from depression (OR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.4 to 2.8,P<0.001). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that mild depression were more common in empty-nest elderly than moderate or severe depression (P<0.001). In addition, living alone (P=0.002), higher male proportion (beta=0.04,P<0.001), later year of publication (beta=0.09,P<0.001) and higher study quality score (beta=0.62,P<0.001) were significantly associated with higher prevalence of depression. Conclusion In this meta-analysis, the prevalence of depression in empty-nest elderly was high in China. Considering the negative impact of depression on health outcomes and well-being, regular screening and appropriate interventions need to be delivered for this vulnerable segment of the population.

AB  - The termprocess modelis widely used, but rarely agreed upon. This paper proposes a framework for characterizing and building cognitive process models. Process models model not only inputs and outputs but also model the ongoing information transformations at a given level of abstraction. We argue that the following dimensions characterize process models: They have a scope that includes different levels of abstraction. They specify a hypothesized mental information transformation. They make predictions not only for the behavior of interest but also for processes. The models' predictions for the processes can be derived from the input, without reverse inference from the output data. Moreover, the presumed information transformation steps are not contradicting current knowledge of human cognitive capacities. Lastly, process models require a conceptual scope specifying levels of abstraction for the information entering the mind, the proposed mental events, and the behavior of interest. This framework can be used for refining models before testing them or after testing them empirically, and it does not rely on specific modeling paradigms. It can be a guideline for developing cognitive process models. Moreover, the framework can advance currently unresolved debates about which models belong to the category of process models.

AB  - Introduction Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are facing increasing global health challenges with a reduced ability to manage them. Global Health Capacity Building (GHCB) initiatives have the potential to improve health workforce performance and health outcomes, however little is known about the GHCB topics and approaches implemented in this region. This is the first systematic review of GHCB initiatives among LMICs in the MENA region. Methods An academic database search of Medline (OVID), PubMed, Scopus,, and Open Grey was conducted for articles published between January 2009 and September 2019 in English. Next, a grey literature search following a recommended search framework was conducted. Reviewed records addressed a global health topic, had a capacity building component, looked at specific learning outcomes, and reflected an LMIC in the MENA. Primary outcomes included country, topic, modality, pedagogy, and population. Results Reports of GHCB initiatives were retrieved from grey sources (73.2%) and academic sources (26.8%). Most GHCB initiatives were mainly conducted face-to-face (94.4%) to professional personnel (57.5%) through a theoretical pedagogical approach (44.3%). Dominant global health themes were non-communicable diseases (29.2%), sexual and reproductive health (18.4%), and mental health (14.5%). When matched against the Global Burden of Disease data, important gaps were found regarding the topics of GHCB initiatives in relation to the region's health needs. There were limited reports of GHCB initiatives addressing conflict and emergency topics, and those addressing non-communicable disease topics were primarily reported from Egypt and Iran. Conclusion Innovative and practicum-based approaches are needed for GHCB initiatives among LMICs in the MENA region, with a focus on training community workers. Regional and country-specific analyses of GHCB initiatives relative to their health needs are discussed in the manuscript based on the results of this review.

Methods This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses protocol. PubMed, PsycINFO, SciELO, Web of Science, and LILACS were searched using two keywords: personality AND DSM-5. Studies published from 2015 to 2018 were included. Results Sixty-four new studies were evaluated. The PID-5-self-report form (SRF) was concluded to have a factorial structure consisting of five factors and 25 facets, as well as excellent indicators of internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity with different personality instruments and with other clinical constructs. The form also has predictive and discriminative potential, warranting further exploration in studies with samples of personality disorders in relation to different parameters and not only the diagnostic algorithm of DSM-5 Section III. The brief and informant versions, although less studied, also showed good psychometric indicators, comparable to the original version. Conclusions The PID-5 showed psychometric suitability for use in different cultures and contexts. The form's use in clinical practice and as a means of operationalizing the diagnostic evaluation of the DSM-5 dimensional model is promising and should be encouraged.

AB  - Within the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience, there is an increasing interest in studying individual differences in human brain development in order to predict mental health outcomes. So far, however, most longitudinal neuroimaging studies focus on group-level estimates. In this review, we highlight longitudinal neuroimaging studies that have moved beyond group-level estimates to illustrate the heterogeneity in patterns of brain development. We provide practical methodological recommendations on how longitudinal neuroimaging datasets can be used to understand heterogeneity in human brain development. Finally, we address how taking an individual-differences approach in developmental neuroimaging studies could advance our understanding of why some individuals develop mental health disorders.

AB  - Objective: Decades of research suggest that there may be important ethnic differences in the hemodynamic mechanisms that co-determine arterial blood pressure, the primary diagnostic index of hypertension. In general, studies have observed that, compared with European Americans (EAs), African Americans (AAs) exhibit higher total peripheral resistance (TPR), an important summative index of peripheral vascular constriction. In contrast, EAs have been reliably shown to exhibit greater cardiac output (CO), which is directly linked to left ventricle and overall cardiac blood flow. We have previously proposed that elevated basal TPR, in particular, represents one component of the cardiovascular conundrum, characterized, paradoxically, by elevated resting heart rate variability among AAs relative to EAs. The present meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature sought to extend this previous work by establishing the magnitude of the empirically implied ethnic differences in resting TPR and CO.
   Methods: A search of the literature yielded 140 abstracts on differences in TPR between AAs and EAs; 40 were included. Sample sizes, means, and standard deviations for baseline TPR with samples that included EAs and AAs were collected, and Hedges g was computed.
   Results: Findings indicated that AAs had higher baseline TPR than did EAs (Hedges g = 0.307, SE = 0.043, confidence interval= 0.224 to 0.391, p < .001). In addition, EAs had higher resting CO than did AAs (Hedges g = -0.214, SE = 0.056, confidence interval = -0.324 to -0.104, p < .001). C
   onclusions: We discuss the present findings in the context of the role of elevated TPR in the deleterious effects of high blood pressure specifically for AAs.

AB  - The broad intelligences include a group of mental abilities such as comprehension knowledge, quantitative reasoning, and visuospatial processing that are relatively specific in their focus and fall at the second stratum of the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence. In recent years, the field has seen a proliferation of mental abilities being considered for inclusion among the broad intelligences, which poses challenges in terms of their effective and efficient assessment. We conducted a meta-analysis of 61 articles that reported correlations among the broad intelligences. Results indicated that the average correlation among broad intelligences fell between r = 0.58, 95% CI [0.53, 0.64], and r = 0.65, 95% CI [0.62, 0.68], depending upon the model employed to estimate the relations. Applying factor analysis to a composite correlation matrix drawn from the studies, we obtained dimensions of broad intelligence that may be useful to organizing the group. Finally, we discuss the implications of the correlations among broad intelligences as an evaluative tool for candidate intelligences.

AB  - Introduction: Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with impaired social competencies, due in part to an inability to determine emotional states through facial expressions. Social interactions are a critical component of adolescence, which raises the question of how do adolescents with ADHD cope with this impairment. Yet, previous reviews do not distinguish between children and adolescents. This review focuses on the ability of adolescents (defined by the World Health Organization as 10-19 years old) with ADHD to recognize emotional facial expressions, when compared to their typically-developing peers.
   Methods: Comprehensive database search and analysis yielded 9 relevant studies published between 2008 and 2018.
   Results: The studies reviewed here examined recognition of emotional facial expressions in adolescents with ADHD. Behavioral measures (reaction time, reaction time variance and recognition accuracy) show no statistically significant differences between adolescents with ADHD and their typically-developing peers. However, neural responses as recorded using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or Event Related Potentials (ERP) find differences in brain activity and the temporal evolution of the reaction between the two groups.
   Conclusions: Studies of children and of adults with ADHD find deficiencies in the recognition of emotional facial expressions. However, this review shows that adolescents with ADHD perform comparably to their peers on accuracy and rate, although their neural processing is different. This suggests that the methodologies employed by the ADHD and typically-developing adolescents to asses facial expressions are different. Further study is needed to determine what these may be.

AB  - In this review, we approach Parkinson's disease (PD) in the context of an evolutionary mismatch of central nervous system functions. The neurons at risk have hyperbranched axons, extensive transmitter release sites, display spontaneous spiking, and elevated mitochondrial stress. They function in networks largely unchanged throughout vertebrate evolution, but now connecting to the expanded human cortex. Their breakdown is favoured by longevity. At the cellular level, mitochondrial dysfunction starts at the synapses, then involves axons and cell bodies. At the behavioural level, network dysfunctions provoke the core motor syndrome of parkinsonism including freezing and failed gait automatization, and non-motor deficits including inactive blindsight and autonomic dysregulation. The proposed evolutionary reinterpretation of PD-prone cellular phenotypes and of prototypical clinical symptoms allows a new conceptual framework for future research.

AB  - Purpose of review
   To provide an overview of the update of the evidence-based and consensus-based German S3 guideline on psychosocial therapies for severe mental illnesses (SMI), with particular attention to current developments and future research tasks.
   Recent findings
   There has been a significant increase in studies on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in treatment of people with SMI. In the guideline a distinction is made between system-level interventions (e.g. multidisciplinary team-based psychiatric community care) and single-handed (nonteam-based) interventions (e.g. psychoeducation). Furthermore, principles of treatment (e.g. recovery-orientation) and self-help interventions (e.g. peer support) are addressed. The update of the guideline includes 33 recommendations and 12 statements. Compared with the first edition, there were upgrades in the recommendation of Supported Employment (A) and Supported Housing (A). Interventions such as peer support (B) and lifestyle interventions (A) were included for the first time. Developments are discussed in the context of most recent literature. Areas for further research are highlighted and fields for next updates such as antistigma interventions and supported parenting were identified.
   Summary
   The present guideline offers an important opportunity to further improve health services for people with SMI. However, guideline implementation is challenging.

AB  - Oscillations of neural excitability shape sensory, motor or cognitive processes. Furthermore, a large body of research demonstrates that intrinsic oscillations are entrained by external rhythms, allowing a simple and efficient way to enhance human brain functions. As an external stimulation source, repeating acoustic stimuli have been shown to provide a possible pacing signal for modulating the electrical activity recorded by the electroencephalogram (EEG). In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding how rhythmic auditory stimulation can selectively modulate EEG oscillations. Despite growing evidence, recent evidence suggests that standard methods of data analysis are often insufficient for a definite proof of entrainment in some instances. In particular, we stressed that the complexity of the elicited modulations, often varying in phase and frequency on a short timescale, requires time-frequency measures that are better appropriate to analyze driven brain phenomena. Once entrainment is clearly established, one can assess the specificity of its expression, thus providing a better understanding of the physiology underlying brain modulation and a faster translation to treatment programs in various psychopathologic conditions.

AB  - Few if any experts believe that existing psychiatric diagnostic categories included in DSM and ICD are actually discrete disease entities. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is emblematic of the problems in the existing psychiatric classification system. ADHD symptoms reliably cluster into two correlated dimensions in factor analysis. However, children with ADHD vary considerably in their symptom profiles, symptom trajectories, clinical outcomes, and biological and psychological correlates. Thus, the field has sought alternative approaches that harness the dimensions of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning that underlie ADHD and other existing psychiatric categories to create informative phenotypes that improve clinical prediction and clarify etiology. Within ADHD, cognitive (neuropsychological) and temperament/personality features have received considerable attention. In some cases, subphenotypes based on these features appear to improve on existing classifications and could eventually be translated into clinical practice. This review summarizes findings from subphenotyping efforts in ADHD that use cognitive, emotion-related, and other features to highlight major considerations for research applying person-oriented approaches to inform an improved psychiatric nosology. Considerations related to feature selection, validation of newly proposed divisions, defining populations of interest, and incorporating a developmental perspective are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: The experience of stressful events can alter brain structures involved in memory encoding, storage and retrieval. Here we review experimental research assessing the impact of the stress-related hormone cortisol on long-term memory retrieval.
   Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science and PsycNet databases with the following terms: "stress," "long-term memory," and "retrieval." Studies were included in the review if they tested samples of healthy human participants, with at least one control group, and with the onset of the stress intervention occurring after the encoding phase and shortly (up to one hour) before the final memory test.
   Results: Thirteen studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (N = 962) and were classified according to the time elapsed between stress induction and memory retrieval (stress-retrieval delay), the stress-inducing protocol (stressor), the time of day in which stress induction took place, sex, and age of participants. Most studies induced stress with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) between 15 and 25 minutes before the final memory (mostly recall) test and showed significant increases in cortisol levels and memory impairment.
   Discussion: The reviewed studies indicate that stress does impair retrieval, particularly when induced with the TSST, in the afternoon, up to 45 minutes before the onset of the final memory test, in healthy young men. These results may inform future research on the impact of stress-induced cortisol surges on memory retrieval.

AB  - Digitalization of knowledge work is essential for today's organizations, responding to diversified employee needs. Many organizations are already implementing some form of flexibility to help workers perform work and non-work duties, while maintaining high productivity. While these changes in workplaces, "New Ways of Working (NWW)", have been discussed in the literature, a systematic appraisal of evidence of NWW has not been conducted. Relating to poor work-related mental health worldwide, this systematic review analyzed the psychological impacts of NWW, and the quality and quantity of NWW research. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, NWW studies targeting psychological outcomes were evaluated. Initial literature search on ProQuest, PsycINFO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar retrieved 308 titles, from which seven articles fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Our appraisal revealed that NWW research evaluated diverse psychological outcomes. While NWW can help workers' engagement, work-related flow, and connectivity among staff, NWW can also increase blurred work-home boundary, fatigue, and mental demands. The quality of NWW research was overall medium, needing more rigorous studies. Our findings can inform decision-makers in the workplace to effectively implement NWW, and researchers to improve the quality and the usefulness of future NWW studies.

AB  - Many parents still hesitate to encourage their children to participate in resistance training programs. This is unfortunate since recent research shows that resistance training can positively affect children's health. This narrative review aims to present an overview of the health-associated effects resistance training can provide particularly in children and adolescents with disabilities by describing its effects on muscle strength, physical function, mental health, self-concept, obesity, and injury prevention. To illustrate the variety of possible fields of application, the effects of resistance training in children and adolescents suffering from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, joint hypermobility, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, obesity, and spina bifida are discussed. Although randomized controlled trials with a sufficiently large sample size are rare, the research presented in this review indicates that this mode of training might be a potent tool to improve mental and physical health by improving muscle strength, body composition, self-concept or functionality, reducing pain or injury risk, and strengthening bone or tendons even in the most vulnerable groups of children with physical or mental disability. Furthermore, it has to be emphasized that compared with other types of treatment resistance training is considered to be without adverse effects.

AB  - Objective: A systematic review of research assessing factors associated with inpatient psychiatric readmission of children and adolescents. Methods: In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA), we searched 8 databases (1994 -2018) to identify relevant articles on factors associated with youth psychiatric readmission. Selected articles addressed one or more factors associated with psychiatric readmission for children and adolescents ( ?21 years of age) admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the United States for a primary mental health diagnosis. Two authors independently reviewed article abstracts, titles, and text. Results: Of 7903 retrieved articles, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Analyzed variables were categorized ac- cording to child demographic and clinical characteristics; family, provider, and community characteristics; and treatment and aftercare characteristics. Available studies were markedly heterogeneous in methodology and outcomes. Factors associated with an increased risk of readmission included greater symptom severity, clinical diagnoses such as psychosis and a ffective disorders, suicidal behavior and self -injury, poor family functioning, and longer lengths of index hospital stay. Conclusions: Controlled trials of interventions to improve care and reduce recidivism for psychiatrically hospi- talized youth are needed. Future research will bene fit from a guiding theoretical framework, more representative samples, and standardized exposure/outcome measures.

AB  - Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) is a slowly progressive myopathy characterized by extraocular muscles involvement, leading to frozen eyes without diplopia. The pattern of inheritance may be mitochondrial, autosomal dominant or, rarely, autosomal recessive. Sporadic forms were also reported. Muscular involvement other than extraocular muscles may occur with varying degrees of weakness, but this mostly happens many years after the disease begins. There are also scattered data about systemic signs besides ophthalmoplegia. This article aims to review non-ophthalmic findings of PEO from a clinicogenetical point of view.

   In recent years there has been interest in the use of machine learning in suicide research in reaction to the failure of traditional statistical methods to produce clinically useful models of future suicide. The current review summarizes recent prediction studies in the suicide literature including those using machine learning approaches to understand what value these novel approaches add.
   Recent findings
   Studies using machine learning to predict suicide deaths report area under the curve that are only modestly greater than, and sensitivities that are equal to, those reported in studies using more conventional predictive methods. Positive predictive value remains around 1% among the cohort studies with a base rate that was not inflated by case-control methodology.
   Summary
   Machine learning or artificial intelligence may afford opportunities in mental health research and in the clinical care of suicidal patients. However, application of such techniques should be carefully considered to avoid repeating the mistakes of existing methodologies. Prediction studies using machine-learning methods have yet to make a major contribution to our understanding of the field and are unproven as clinically useful tools.

AB  - There is a need for effective interventions that improve the health and wellbeing of school and childcare staff. This review examined the efficacy of workplace interventions to improve the dietary, physical activity and/or sleep behaviours of school and childcare staff. A secondary aim of the review was to assess changes in staff physical/mental health, productivity, and students' health behaviours. Nine databases were searched for controlled trials including randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials published in English up to October 2019. PRISMA guidelines informed screening and study selection procedures. Data were not suitable for quantitative pooling. Of 12,396 records screened, seven articles (based on six studies) were included. Most studies used multi-component interventions including educational resources, work-based wellness committees and planned group practice (e.g., walking groups). Multiple outcomes were assessed, findings were mixed and on average, there was moderate risk of bias. Between-group differences in dietary and physical activity behaviours (i.e., fruit/vegetable intake, leisure-time physical activity) favoured intervention groups, but were statistically non-significant for most outcomes. Some of the studies also showed differences favouring controls (i.e., nutrient intake, fatty food consumption). Additional robust studies testing the efficacy of workplace interventions to improve the health of educational staff are needed.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this commentary is to summarize the few findings from the scientific literature pertaining to humane mental health transfer practices in the province of Ontario as well as the broader Canadian and international context. These findings are juxtaposed with a policing policy scan concerning the Ontario and Canadian contexts. The practice of default restraint use during transfers is surprisingly widespread practice, despite advocacy to the contrary, and is presented as the consequence of stigma and the lack of codified restriction of restraint use by police in their policy guidelines.
   Methods: (1) Literature search to discover relevant articles which were summarized using narrative review due to the lack of high-quality studies available in this area, and (2) Scan of publicly available policy documents in use by Ontario police agencies in March and April of 2018, as well as contacting several police agencies and community resources to review policies and procedures.
   Results: We review the available evidence on the use and impact of restraints in patient transfer to emergency departments from police settings, highlight police practices in four Ontario jurisdictions, and summarize recommendations from police and mental health advocates regarding mental health transfers.
   Discussion: Synthesizing the available evidence, policies, and procedures, we illustrate that the Ontario-wide variability in both who transfers PMI on a Form 1 to hospital and whether restraints are utilized reflect systemic failures to utilize least restrictive means of transfer. We offer a look at future areas of research and advocacy to improve practices in Canada.
