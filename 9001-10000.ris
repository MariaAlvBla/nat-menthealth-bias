TI  - Predicting treatment response using EEG in major depressive disorder: A machine-learning meta-analysis
KW  - NEURAL-NETWORK
KW  - TREATMENT OUTCOMES
KW  - RTMS
AB  - Selecting a course of treatment in psychiatry remains a trial-and-error process, and this long-standing clinical challenge has prompted an increased focus on predictive models of treatment response using machine learning techniques. Electroencephalography (EEG) represents a cost-effective and scalable potential measure to predict treatment response to major depressive disorder. We performed separate meta-analyses to determine the ability of models to distinguish between responders and non-responders using EEG across treatments, as well as a performed subgroup analysis of response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and antidepressants (Registration Number: CRD42021257477) in Major Depressive Disorder by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1960 and February 2022. We included 15 studies that predicted treatment responses among patients with major depressive disorder using machine-learning techniques. Within a random-effects model with a restricted maximum likelihood estimator comprising 758 patients, the pooled accuracy across studies was 83.93% (95% CI: 78.90-89.29), with an Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) of 0.850 (95% CI: 0.747-0.890), and partial AUC of 0.779. The average sensitivity and specificity across models were 77.96% (95% CI: 60.05-88.70), and 84.60% (95% CI: 67.89-92.39), respectively. In a subgroup analysis, greater performance was observed in predicting response to rTMS (Pooled accuracy: 85.70% (95% CI: 77.45-94.83), Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC): 0.928, partial AUC: 0.844), relative to antidepressants (Pooled accuracy: 81.41% (95% CI: 77.45-94.83, AUC: 0.895, pAUC: 0.821). Furthermore, across all meta-analyses, the specificity (true negatives) of EEG models was greater than the sensitivity (true positives), suggesting that EEG models thus far better identify non-responders than responders to treatment in MDD. Studies varied widely in important features across models, although relevant features included absolute and relative power in frontal and temporal electrodes, measures of connectivity, and asymmetry across hemispheres. Predictive models of treatment response using EEG hold promise in major depressive disorder, although there is a need for prospective model validation in independent datasets, and a greater emphasis on replicating physiological markers. Crucially, standardization in cut-off values and clinical scales for defining clinical response and non-response will aid in the reproducibility of findings and the clinical utility of predictive models. Furthermore, several models thus far have used data from open-label trials with small sample sizes and evaluated performance in the absence of training and testing sets, which increases the risk of statistical overfitting. Large consortium studies are required to establish predictive signatures of treatment response using EEG, and better elucidate the replicability of specific markers. Additionally, it is speculated that greater performance was observed in rTMS models, since EEG is assessing neural networks more likely to be directly targeted by rTMS, comprising electrical activity primarily near the surface of the cortex. Prospectively, there is a need for models that examine the comparative effectiveness of multiple treatments across the same patients. However, this will require a thoughtful consideration towards cumulative treatment effects, and whether washout periods between treatments should be utilised.
   Regardless, longitudinal cross-over trials comparing multiple treatments across the same group of patients will be an important prerequisite step to both facilitate precision psychiatry and identify generalizable physiological predictors of response between and across treatment options.

AB  - Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempt (SA) are risk behaviors that lead to physical injury and even death in individuals, and are a very powerful risk factor when both occur together, with individuals presenting with more severe psychological and behavioral problems. Due to the different demographic characteristics of different study subjects, an overall understanding of the incidence and occurrence of this co-occurrence is lacking to clarify the focus of clinical interventions and future research directions. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for relevant studies in English and Chinese that reported data on co-occurring non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempts as of May 2022. The incidence of co-occurrence of non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempt (NSSI + SA) was calculated using Stata version 16.0 software based on a random-effects model, and the differences in incidence in different populations were compared by subgroups of age group, comorbidity, and time of occurrence. The study was written in strict accordance with PRISMA norms and registration was completed on the PROSPERO platform (CRD42022329095). Results: A total of 37 studies (139,573 individuals) were included for meta-analysis, and the combined incidence of non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempt co-occurrence was 9.6%. Among different groups, the prevalence of NSSI + SA was 10, 11, 6, and 26% in adolescents and young adults, adults, the general population, and people with mental illness, respectively, and the co-occurrence of NSSI + SA within 12 months was 17%. Conclusion: There is a significant group with a history of both non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempts and presenting with more severe symptoms clinically. Targeted prevention and intervention are urgently needed, but the direction of intervention needs further research on the occurrence trajectory of this co-occurrence.Systematic Review Registration, identifier: CRD42022329095.

AB  - Background Suicide in children is a pressing public health concern. The increasing number of deaths by suicide and emergency visits for suicidal ideation and self-harm in children might not be fully representative; it is likely that many more children are in distress but do not seek out help. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing studies to quantify the prevalence of suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviours among children in the community aged 12 years and younger.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Web of Science via OVID from database inception to Feb 28, 2022, for articles published in French or English that reported estimates of prevalence of suicidal ideation (including suicide planning) and self-harm behaviours (namely, self-harm, suicide attempts, and non-suicidal self-injury) in children aged 12 years and younger. Reference lists were also searched; case studies, qualitative studies, and health-care visit studies were excluded. The outcomes were suicidal ideation, suicide plan or attempts, and self-harm. We used a random-effects model to calculate the overall pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviours for all timeframes combined and for ever versus the past 12 months for suicidal ideation. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool to evaluate the risk of bias in each study. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020179041.
   Findings 28 articles, encompassing 30 studies overall, met the inclusion criteria, aggregating findings from 98 044 children ( of whom 46 980 [50.5%] were girls and 46 136 [49. 5%] were boys; six articles did not report sex or gender) aged 6-12 years. The pooled prevalence estimate was 7. 5% ( 95% CI 5. 9-9.6) for suicidal ideation from 28 studies and 2 .2% (2.0-2.5) for suicide planning from three studies. The pooled prevalence was 1.4% (0. 4-4.7) for self-harm from four studies, 1.3% (1.0- 1.9) for suicide attempt from six studies, and 21.9% (6 .2-54.5) for non-suicidal self-injury from two studies. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was higher in studies that included child-reported outcomes (10.9% [95% CI 8.1-14.5] for child only and 10.4% [6.8-15. 5] for child and parent combined) than for parent- only reported outcomes (4.7% [3.4-6.6]; p=0.0004). The prevalence of suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviours was similar in boys and girls (suicidal ideation, 7.9% [95% CI 5.2-12.0] for boys vs 6.4% [3.7-10.7] for girls; self-harm behaviours, 3 .5% [ 1.6-7.2] for boys vs 3.0% [1 .4-6.4%] for girls). Detailed ethnicity data were not available. High heterogeneity was identified across estimates (I-2>90%), which was not well explained by the characteristics of the studies.
   Interpretation A high number of children in the general population can experience suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviours, thus underlining the need for more research on childhood suicide, including developmentally appropriate preventive strategies, such as youth-nominated support teams or dialectical behavioural therapy.

AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition that frequently persists into adulthood, although research and diagnostic criteria are focused on how the condition presents in children. We aimed to review qualitative research on lived experiences of adults with ADHD to characterize potential ADHD symptomatology in adulthood and provide perspectives on how needs might be better met. We searched three databases for qualitative studies on ADHD. Studies (n = 35) in English that included data on the lived experiences of adults with ADHD were included. These studies covered experiences of receiving a diagnosis as an adult, symptomatology of adult ADHD, skills used to adapt to these symptoms, relationships between ADHD and substance use, patients' self-perceptions, and participants' experiences interacting with society. Many of the ADHD symptoms reported in these studies had overlap with other psychiatric conditions and may contribute to misdiagnosis and delays in diagnosis. Understanding symptomatology of ADHD in adults may inform future diagnostic criteria and guide interventions to improve quality of life.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized, in part, by the loss of dopaminergic neurons within the nigral-striatal pathway. Multiple lines of evidence support a role for reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in degeneration of this pathway, specifically nitric oxide (NO). This review will focus on how RNS leads to loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD and whether RNS accumulation represents a central signal in the degenerative cascade. Herein, we provide an overview of how RNS accumulates in PD by considering the various cellular sources of RNS including nNOS, iNOS, nitrate, and nitrite reduction and describe evidence that these sources are upregulating RNS in PD. We document that over 1/3 of the proteins that deposit in Lewy Bodies, are post-translationally modified (S-nitrosylated) by RNS and provide a broad description of how this elicits deleterious effects in neurons. In doing so, we identify specific proteins that are modified by RNS in neurons which are implicated in PD pathogenesis, with an emphasis on exacerbation of synucleinopathy. How nitration of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) leads to aSyn misfolding and toxicity in PD models is outlined. Furthermore, we delineate how RNS modulates known PD-related phenotypes including axo-dendritic-, mitochondrial-, and dopamine-dysfunctions. Finally, we discuss successful outcomes of therapeutics that target S-nitrosylation of proteins in Parkinson's Disease related clinical trials. In conclusion, we argue that targeting RNS may be of therapeutic benefit for people in early clinical stages of PD.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with few treatment options. Metformin, a classical antidiabetic and antioxidant, has extended its application to experimental SCI treatment. Here, we performed a systematic review to evaluate the neurobiological roles of metformin for treating SCI in rats, and to assess the potential for clinical translation. PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang data, SinoMed, and Vip Journal Integration Platform databases were searched from their inception dates to October 2021. Two reviewers independently selected controlled studies evaluating the neurobiological roles of metformin in rats following SCI, extracted data, and assessed the quality of methodology and evidence. Pairwise meta-analyses, subgroup analyses and network analysis were performed to assess the roles of metformin in neurological function and tissue damage in SCI rats. Twelve articles were included in this systematic review. Most of them were of moderate-to-high methodological quality, while the quality of evidence from those studies was not high. Generally, Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were increased in rats treated with metformin compared with controls, and the weighted mean differences (WMDs) between metformin and control groups exhibited a gradual upward trend from the 3rd (nine studies, n = 164, WMD = 0.42, 95% CI = -0.01 to 0.85, P = 0.06) to the 28th day after treatment (nine studies, n = 136, WMD = 3.48, 95% CI = 2.04 to 4.92, P < 0.00001). Metformin intervention was associated with improved inclined plane scores, tissue preservation ratio and number of anterior horn motor neurons. Subgroup analyses indicated an association between neuroprotection and metformin dose. Network meta-analysis showed that 50 mg/kg metformin exhibited greater protection than 10 and 100 mg/kg metformin. The action mechanisms behind metformin were associated with activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling, regulating mitochondrial function and relieving endoplasmic reticulum stress. Collectively, this review indicates that metformin has a protective effect on SCI with satisfactory safety and we demonstrate a rational mechanism of action; therefore, metformin is a promising candidate for future clinical trials. However, given the limitations of animal experimental methodological and evidence quality, the findings of this pre-clinical review should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Poor sleep has significant impacts on both mental and physical well-being. This is especially the case for shift workers who rely on good sleep practices to manage the disruption caused by their working conditions. In recent years there has been a proliferation of sleep-focused mobile phone applications, some of which may be suitable for use by shift workers. There is limited evidence however, on whether these applications are sufficient in managing the sleep needs of the early start shift working population (i.e., those whose work schedules begin pre-dawn). This scoping review aims to identify and discuss peer-reviewed literature on mobile sleep applications used by early start shift workers for sleep-self management. Four databases (Scopus, EBSCOhost, CINAHL and PsycInfo) were searched for relevant literature using a pre-determined search string. The initial search using the term early start shift work returned no papers, however a broadened search on shift work in general found 945 papers for title and abstract screening, of which 21 were deemed eligible for full text screening. Two of these papers met the inclusion criteria for this review. The results highlight, firstly, the paucity of research on the use of mobile phone applications for sleep self-management amongst early start shift workers, and secondly, the need for further research on the effectiveness of mobile applications for sleep self-management amongst shift workers in general. A working definition of early start shift work that can be used to stimulate research in this understudied population of shift workers is also proposed.

AB  - ObjectsHealth Behaviours in School-aged Children (HBSC) is an international survey programme aiming to investigate adolescents' health behaviours, subjective perception of health status, wellbeing, and the related contextual information. Our scoping review aimed to synthesise the evidence from HBSC about the relationship between family environmental contributors and adolescents' health-related outcomes. MethodsWe searched previous studies from six electronic databases. Two researchers identified the qualified publications independently by abstract and full-text screening with the assistance of an NLP-based AI instrument, ASReview. Publications were included if they were based on HBSC data and investigated the effects of family environment on adolescents' health outcomes. Researches addressed family-related factors as mediators or moderators were also included. ResultsA total of 241 articles were included. Family environmental contributors could be mapped into six categories: (1) Demographic backgrounds (N = 177); (2) General family's psycho-socio functions (N = 44); (3) Parenting behaviours (N = 100); (4) Parental health behaviours (N = 7); (5) Family activities (N = 24); and (6) Siblings (N = 7). Except for 75 papers that assessed family variables as moderators (N = 70) and mediators (N = 7), the others suggested family environment was an independent variable. Only five studies employed the data-driven approach. ConclusionOur results suggest most research studies focussed on the influences of family demographic backgrounds on adolescents' health. The researches related to parental health behaviours and siblings are most inadequate. Besides, we recommend further research studies to focus on the mediator/moderator roles of the family, for exploring the deep mechanism of the family's impacts. Also, it would be valuable to consider data-driven analysis more in the future, as HBSC has mass variables and data.

AB  - Background: Armed conflicts and natural disasters can cause significant psychological and social challenges for affected populations. Displaced populations are extremely heterogeneous in terms of culture, language, and experiences of crises. Current diagnostic criteria is insufficient when evaluating the symptoms and treatment of mental health issues across contexts. Aim: This scoping review presents information about cultural idioms of distress across displaced populations. The review includes aspects of etiology, symptomology, and proposed intervention methods. Methods: I conducted a Boolean search of academic and grey literature for studies that described cultural idioms of distress among displaced populations. Results were analyzed using thematic analysis and grounded theory. Results: A shared sense of injustice, spirit possession, and karma are common etiologies for mental distress among displaced populations. Symptoms include somatic complaints, 'thinking a lot', and interpersonal challenges such as social isolation and a fear of others. Potential interventions are likely on a community-level, including the generation of community mechanisms for conflict-resolution, reconciliation, and culturally grounded healing rituals. Conclusions: It is vital to understand the ways displaced communities conceptualize their mental health in order to develop appropriate culturally grounded interventions. Understanding the etiology, symptoms, and proposed interventions can inform and improve humanitarian aid delivery of mental health and psychosocial support services.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic required mental health services around the world to adapt quickly to the new restrictions and regulations put in place to reduce the risk of transmission. As face-to-face contact became difficult, virtual methods were implemented to continue to safely provide mental health care. However, it is unclear to what extent service provision transitioned to telemental health worldwide.Objective: We aimed to systematically review the global research literature on how mental health service provision adapted during the first year of the pandemic.Methods: We searched systematically for quantitative papers focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health services published until April 13, 2021, in the PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, and bioXriv electronic bibliographic databases, using the COVID-19 Open Access Project online platform. The screening process and data extraction were independently completed by at least two authors, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion with a senior member of the team. The findings were summarized narratively in the context of each country's COVID-19 Stringency Index, which reflects the stringency of a government's response to COVID-19 restrictions at a specific time.Results: Of the identified 24,339 records, 101 papers were included after the screening process. Reports on general services (n=72) showed that several countries' face-to-face services reduced their activities at the start of the pandemic, with reductions in the total number of delivered visits and with some services forced to close. In contrast, telemental health use rapidly increased in many countries across the world at the beginning of the pandemic (n=55), with almost complete virtualization of general and specialistic care services by the end of the first year. Considering the reported COVID-19 Stringency Index values, the increased use of virtual means seems to correspond to periods when the Stringency Index values were at their highest in several countries. However, due to specific care requirements, telemental health could not be used in certain subgroups of patients, such as those on clozapine or depot treatments and those who continued to need face-to-face visits.Conclusions: During the pandemic, mental health services had to adapt quickly in the short term, implementing or increasing the use of telemental health services across the globe. Limited access to digital means, poor digital skills, and patients' preferences and individual needs may have contributed to differences in implementing and accessing telemental health services during the pandemic. In the long term, a blended approach, combining in-person and virtual modalities, that takes into consideration the needs, preferences, and digital skills of patients may better support the future development of mental health services. It will be required to improve confidence with digital device use, training, and experience in all modalities for both clinicians and service users.

AB  - Objective Globally, suicide represents the second leading cause of death in young people aged 15-29 years for both sexes, after traffic accidents. Suicide occurs not only in high-income countries, in high-income countries but it is a global phenomenon in all regions of the world and it represents a serious public health problem. Method This review was conducted on studies focused on white matter alterations in people who have attempted or thought about suicide. We searched PubMed and Scopus databases and screened references of included studies and reviewed articles for additional citations. From the initial 21 publications, we included only 12 studies that met search criteria and described the association between white matter alterations and suicide. Results White matter alterations in suicidal behaviors were found in the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, internal capsule, corpus callosum, and default mode networks, which are critical cerebral areas involved in emotion processing and regulation, decision-making, executive functions, and empathy. Conclusions White matter alteration in cerebral areas involving high cognitive process and emotional regulation to confer a heightened vulnerability for suicidal behavior. Suicide is a complex process ranging from suicidal ideation to planning, attempting, or committing suicide. The identification of abnormalities in underlying neural circuitry may help delineate the neurobiological basis for suicide risk.

AB  - Background: Pediatric headaches have been linked to adverse life events or psychological factors in children and their families, with a complex and bidirectional association. Moreover, it is well-known that psychological stress can trigger headaches.
   Methods: We searched three databases for studies focusing on headaches and adverse events or psychological factors in children up to 12 years old or in their caregivers.
   Results: We included 28 studies. Child psychological factors, including internal and external symptoms, were commonly associated with all types of headaches. Sleep disturbances showed a positive association with headaches in 3 out of 5 studies. Family conflict and unhappiness were frequently found in children suffering with headaches, while single-parent families and divorce were not associated. Stressful environments and adverse life events, particularly bullying, were also found to be linked with headaches.
   Conclusions: Childhood headaches represent an alarm bell for clinicians to investigate and treat psychological or psychiatric disorders in children and their family. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of early-life adverse events in children and their families.

AB  - Transportation is among the key aspects that influence active ageing. This realist review intends to understand the mechanisms of urban mobility infrastructure interventions and policies in low- and middle-income countries for older adults and to identify factors, which influenced the success or failure of interventions. We followed the steps suggested by Pawson and colleagues for a realist review. Electronic databases were searched from inception until August 2020. Studies were screened based on titles, abstracts and full text. The quality of included studies was assessed based on rigour and relevance. The evidence was obtained from 36 articles with diverse study designs conducted in 36 low- and middle-income countries. Findings were validated through stakeholder consultations from three low- and middle-income countries. Of the various individual factors identified, behaviour change communication interventions were low-cost, had a long-term impact and were efficient in increasing awareness among users to improve safety, social inclusion and about transport schemes for older adults. Improved transport infrastructure resulted in a shift from private to public transportation. For a sustainable urban transport infrastructure, good governance and involvement of stakeholders for planning and implementing transport interventions were considered necessary. Lack of evaluation, experience of transport planners, and inter-sectoral coordination were key challenges to successful interventions. The review highlighted a lack of older adult-specific transportation policies, and gender-targeted interventions for older women, suggesting a need for interventions and policies based on the contextual factors existing in a region.

AB  - Background Technology and its use within mental health services has advanced dramatically over recent years. Opportunities for mental health services to utilise technology to introduce novel, effective, and more efficient means of delivering assessment, and treatment are increasing. Objective The current rapid-evidence paper reviews evidence regarding the introduction of novel technology to support young people's mental health and psychological well-being. Methods A rapid evidence review was conducted. PSYCHINFO and CINAHL were searched for research articles between 2016 and 2021 that were specific to young people, mental health, and technology developments within this domain. N = 27 studies which explored the introduction, feasibility, and value of technology for mental health purposes were included in a narrative synthesis. Quality or risk of bias analyses were not completed. Results Overall, technological advancements in young people's care were considered positive and engaging for young people. Factors including resources, efficiency of care, engagement, therapeutic effectiveness, ethical considerations, therapeutic alliance, and flexibility were considered within this review. Nevertheless, potential barriers include clinician concerns, socioeconomic factors, and motivation. Conclusion Effective and sustained use of technology within young people's mental health services will depend on the technology's usability, efficiency, and ability to engage young people. This paper expands on existing research by reviewing a broader range of technology proposed to support young people's mental health and well-being. This will assist in the application of novel technological advancements by indicating effectiveness, preferences, potential barriers, and recommendations for the feasibility and efficacy of introducing technology into young people's services.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and a distressing diagnosis for individuals and caregivers. Researchers and clinical trials have mainly focused on beta-amyloid plaques, which are hypothesized to be one of the most important factors for neurodegeneration in AD. Meanwhile, recent clinicopathological and radiological studies have shown closer associations of tau pathology rather than beta-amyloid pathology with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's symptoms. Toward a biological definition of biomarker-based research framework for AD, the 2018 National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association working group has updated the ATN classification system for stratifying disease status in accordance with relevant pathological biomarker profiles, such as cerebral beta-amyloid deposition, hyperphosphorylated tau, and neurodegeneration. In addition, altered iron metabolism has been considered to interact with abnormal proteins related to AD pathology thorough generating oxidative stress, as some prior histochemical and histopathological studies supported this iron-mediated pathomechanism. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has recently become more popular as a non-invasive magnetic resonance technique to quantify local tissue susceptibility with high spatial resolution, which is sensitive to the presence of iron. The association of cerebral susceptibility values with other pathological biomarkers for AD has been investigated using various QSM techniques; however, direct evidence of these associations remains elusive. In this review, we first briefly describe the principles of QSM. Second, we focus on a large variety of QSM applications, ranging from common applications, such as cerebral iron deposition, to more recent applications, such as the assessment of impaired myelination, quantification of venous oxygen saturation, and measurement of blood- brain barrier function in clinical settings for AD. Third, we mention the relationships among QSM, established biomarkers, and cognitive performance in AD. Finally, we discuss the role of QSM as an imaging biomarker as well as the expectations and limitations of clinically useful diagnostic and therapeutic implications for AD.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by social disorder and stereotypical behaviors with an increasing incidence. ASD patients are suffering from varying degrees of mental retardation and language development abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technology to detect brain structural and functional dysfunction in vivo, playing an important role in the early diagnosisbasic research of ASD. High-field, small-animal MRI in basic research of autism model mice has provided a new approach to research the pathogenesis, characteristics, and intervention efficacy in autism. This article reviews MRI studies of mouse models of autism over the past 20 years. Reduced gray matter, abnormal connections of brain networks, and abnormal development of white matter fibers have been demonstrated in these studies, which are present in different proportions in the various mouse models. This provides a more macroscopic view for subsequent research on autism model mice.

AB  - Introduction: Suicide by charcoal burning has accounted for more than 100,000 deaths. It has become an increasingly common suicide method in Hong Kong since first reported in 1998, and it has spread into South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and other countries. This systematic scoping review aimed to explore current evidence on trends, risk factors, impact of media and prevention strategies for this suicide method, and to identify research gaps. Methods: A search for articles published from January 1998 to June 2021 was conducted through electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and PsycINFO) with the keywords (suicide*) AND (charcoal). Articles describing prevalence, trends, characteristics, risk factors and prevention strategies of charcoal burning suicide deaths were included. Non-peer-reviewed articles, non-English articles, commentaries/editorials/letters, poster abstracts, reviews, meta-analyses and studies that documented only charcoal burning suicide attempters/survivors were excluded. Results: Eighty-eight studies were identified, most from East Asia. Charcoal burning suicide rates in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan has passed the peak, while continuing to increase in South Korea. Risk factors are changing and not static. Media appears to play an important role in triggering and spreading information. Restricting access to charcoal, and raising public awareness have been effective in the short term in preventing charcoal burning suicide, but there is little information on their long-term effectiveness or sustainability. Discussion: More research is required to update the development and dynamic changes of charcoal burning suicide and the contributing factors. The evidence from this review may assist in detecting and intervening early for future novel suicide methods.

AB  - Background Patients with substance use disorder (SUD) usually report lower quality of life (QoL) than other patients and as much as patients with other mental disorders. The present study investigated variables associated with QoL domains among patients with SUD. Methods Studies in English published before December 1(st) 2021, were searched for on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science to identify primary studies on factors associated with QoL domains among patients with SUD. After reviewing for study duplicates, the full-texts of selected papers were assessed for eligibility using PECO (Participants, Exposures, Comparison and Outcome) criteria: (a) participants: patients with SUD; (b) exposures: sociodemographic factors, clinical, and service use variables; (c) comparison: patient groups without SUD; and (d) outcomes: four domains of QoL (physical, mental, social, and environmental domains). Three researchers recorded the data independently using predefined Excel spreadsheets. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for assessing risk of bias and rated each study in terms of exposure, outcome, and comparability. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and beta coefficient were utilized at a 95% confidence level, and because sampling methods differed between studies' pooled estimates, a random effects model was utilized. Results After the assessment of over 10,230 papers, a total of 17 studies met the eligibility criteria. Five studies (1260 participants) found that patients with SUD who were older were less likely to have a good physical Qol (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.78, 0.95). Two studies (1171 participants) indicated that patients with SUD who were homeless were less likely to have a good environmental Qol (beta = -0.47, p = 0.003). However, a better mental QoL was observed in four studies (1126 participants) among those receiving support from their family or friends (social networks) (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.07). Two studies (588 participants) showed that those using cocaine were less likely to have a good mental QoL (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.75, 0.93). Two studies (22,534 participants) showed that those using alcohol were less likely to have a good physical QoL (beta = -2.21, p = 0.001). Two studies (956 participants) showed that those having severe substance use disorders were less likely to have a good mental (beta = -5.44, p = 0.002) and environmental (beta = -0.59, p = 0.006) QoL respectively. Four studies (3515 participants) showed that those having mental disorders were less likely to have a good physical QoL (beta = -1.05, p = 0.001), and another three studies (1211 participants) that those having mental disorders were less likely to have a good mental QoL (beta = -0.33, p = 0.001). Finally, two studies (609 and 682 participants) showed that individuals who experienced trauma symptoms or mental disorders were less likely to have good social and environmental QoL, respectively (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.61, 1.00) and (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.9, 0.94). Conclusions The findings suggest the need for mental health services to improve the QOL among patients with SUD but further study is needed. Cocaine may cause behavioral changes which can increase the possibility of reckless and suicidal behaviors. Therefore, identifying cocaine user access, adherence, and satisfaction with treatment is recommended as an important component of adaptive functioning. Interventions that help patients with SUD get support from people within their social networks who support their recovery are also essential to their QoL.

AB  - Those making suicide attempts with highly lethal medical consequences are arguably the best proxy for those who die by suicide and represent a qualitatively different population from those making lower lethality attempts. Different factors influence the likelihood of a suicide attempt occurring and the lethality of that attempt. Both are important dimensions of risk. Older adults represent a distinct group in suicide research with unique risk factors that influence the lethality of their suicide attempts. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarises factors distinguishing those making high and low-lethality suicide attempts in older adulthood. Databases PsycINFO, PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase and CINAHL were systematically searched with seven of 1182 unique records included. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on 18 variables in addition to a narrative synthesis regarding executive function. Only increased suicidal intent and planning meaningfully distinguished high from low-lethality attempters in meta-analyses. A large effect size was additionally observed for white ethnicity. Diminished alcohol use disorder prevalence and depression severity, and greater cognitive impairment, may be associated with high lethality attempters but further research is needed. Age and gender were not associated with lethality, contrary to adult populations. A narrative synthesis of studies exploring differences in executive functioning suggested high-lethality attempters were less likely to impulsively act on suicidal urges, allowing them to better plan suicide attempts that are more lethal, and are less likely to alter suicidal plans. Key limitations were that meta-analyses were underpowered to detect small effect sizes, and samples were largely white and limited to the USA.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a progressive and multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder whose primary causes are mostly unknown. Due to the increase in life expectancy of world population, including developing countries, AD, whose incidence rises dramatically with age, is at the forefront among neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, a definitive cure is not yet within reach, imposing substantial medical and public health burdens at every latitude. Therefore, the effort to devise novel and effective therapeutic strategies is still of paramount importance. Genetic, functional, structural and biochemical studies all indicate that new and efficacious drug delivery strategies interfere at different levels with various cellular and molecular targets. Over the last few decades, therapeutic development of nanomedicine at preclinical stage has shown to progress at a fast pace, thus paving the way for its potential impact on human health in improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. Clinical translation of nano-based therapeutics, despite current limitations, may present important advantages and innovation to be exploited in the neuroscience field as well. In this state-of-the-art review article, we present the most promising applications of polymeric nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery for bypassing the blood-brain barrier of AD preclinical models and boost pharmacological safety and efficacy. In particular, novel strategic chemical functionalization of polymeric nanocarriers that could be successfully employed for treating AD are thoroughly described. Emphasis is also placed on nanotheranostics as both potential therapeutic and diagnostic tool for targeted treatments. Our review highlights the emerging role of nanomedicine in the management of AD, providing the readers with an overview of the nanostrategies currently available to develop future therapeutic applications against this chronic neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Soil salinization caused by sea level rise threatens coastal agricultural soils and geochemically important wetlands worldwide. The aim of this review is to outline expected changes in soil biological activity by discussing the combined effects of salt stress and flooding on plants productivity and soil microbial communities, which determine consequences on fluxes of C, N and P. Finally, it outlines the expected repercussions on greenhouse gases emissions. The prediction of outcomes is made difficult by the concomitant and sometimes contrasting actions of flooding and seawater intrusion on partly acclimated and non-acclimated environments. Non-salt acclimated plants suffer from osmotic stress, but also from reduced O-2 solubility. Microbial biomass declines with increasing salinity and microbial communities shift in composition. Large concentrations of Cl- inhibit nitrification, but salinity stimulates N2O fluxes. Impacts on C mineralisation rates is variable but enhanced by the larger availability of terminal electron acceptors. The reduction of Fe combined with that of SO4 (2-) could enhance P mobility. Salinization affects methanogenesis which is constrained in favour of SO4 (2-) reduction. Consequences are largely site specific and difficult to predict because of the complex network of processes occurring simultaneously in different compartments (i.e., soil, microbiome, vegetation). The distinction between short and long term effects is also important. A reliable prediction of outcomes at a planetary scale will only result from more precise inventories and monitoring of areas displaying specific similarities and from the implementation from these well-defined data sets of specifically devised models whose results can be finally combined on a weighted basis.

AB  - Background: There is a multitude of systematic reviews of interventions for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, most reviews seem to be based on research conducted in High-Income Countries (HIC). Thus, summary findings may not directly apply to Lower Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). Therefore, we conducted a Meta-Review analyzing systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions for target outcomes in children and adolescents with ASD to find out whether there are differences in effectiveness between HIC and LMIC and which interventions can be considered evidence-based in LMIC.
   Methods: Electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane database of systematic reviews) were searched for reviews on interventions for ASD in children and adolescents from January 2011 through December 2021, which included studies not coming from HIC. Systematic reviews with qualitative and quantitative syntheses of findings were included. Two investigators independently assessed studies against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria and extracted relevant data including quality and evidence assessments. Evidence for diffierent types of interventions in HIC vs. LMIC was planned to be compared, but none of the reviews assessed potential di erences. Therefore, a narrative review of the studies from LMIC was conducted including an assessment of quality and evidence.
   Results: Thirty-five reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Eleven considered findings from HIC and LMIC. Sixty-nine percent included studies with various research designs; 63% provided a qualitative synthesis of findings; 77% percent assessed the quality of studies; 43% systematically assessed the level of evidence across studies. No review compared evidence from HIC and LMIC. A review of the studies from LMIC found some promising results, but the evidence was not sufficient due to a small number of studies, sometimes poor quality, and small sample sizes.
   Conclusion: Systematic reviews on interventions for children and adolescents with ASD did not look for potential differences in the effectiveness of interventions in HIC and LMIC. Overall, there is very little evidence from LMIC. None of the interventions can be considered evidence-based in LMIC. Hence, additional research andmutually agreedmethodological standards are needed to provide a more secure basis for evidence-based treatments in LMIC trying to establish evidence-based practices.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method to identify markers of treatment response in major depressive disorder (MDD). In this review, existing literature was assessed to determine how EEG markers change with different modalities of MDD treatments, and to synthesize the breadth of EEG markers used in conjunction with MDD treatments. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from 2000 to 2021 for studies reporting resting EEG (rEEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with EEG (TMS-EEG) measures in patients undergoing MDD treatments. The search yielded 966 articles, 204 underwent full-text screening, and 51 studies were included for a narrative synthesis of findings along with confidence in the evidence. In rEEG studies, non-linear quantitative algorithms such as theta cordance and theta current density show higher predictive value than traditional linear metrics. Although less abundant, TMS-EEG measures show promise for predictive markers of brain stimulation treatment response. Future focus on TMS-EEG measures may prove fruitful, given its ability to target cortical regions of interest related to MDD.

AB  - Introduction Stigma affects people with mental illness globally, however, it is proposed that stigma is less prevalent in wealthier countries and that people hold more positive attitudes in Northern and Western Europe. Even so, accounts from surveys in Denmark and Sweden reveal that stigma is very much prevalent. Aim This scoping review aims to shed light on the body of literature regarding mental-health-related stigma in the Nordic Countries and identify knowledge gaps. Methods We searched four electronic databases in December 2017 and again in June 2020. All types of empirical studies (qualitative, quantitative, and mix-methods) examining the stigma of people with mental illness were included. Results In total, 61 studies were included. Overall, findings from the Nordic countries resemble global findings. Studies are primarily descriptive, and mostly survey studies of attitudes toward people with mental illness in the general population. Few studies focus on discrimination, and those who do, measure intended behavior in hypothetical situations rather than actual acts of discrimination in real-life situations. Studies were mostly conducted on a community or organizational level; no studies were identified on a system level. Experienced stigma and discrimination by patients, but also relatives, were a focus in one-third of the studies. Very few studies of interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination were identified. Conclusion More studies into stigma on a system or institutional level are needed. Ways to measure acts of discrimination should be invented. Furthermore, interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination should be developed, targeting all levels of society.

AB  - Objective: There are reports of functional neurological disorder (FND) developing after anaesthesia, though separating any aetiological role from other possible factors is challenging. We aimed to systematically review all published cases of post-anaesthetic FND to see if any common factors supported an anaesthetic role. We also aimed to identify all cases of post-anaesthetic FND arising in our FND clinic, to obtain an estimate of its frequency.
   Methods: For the review, a systematic search for published cases of FND developing within 48 h of anaesthesia was conducted in June 2022. For the case series, the medical records of all patients attending an FND clinic in Melbourne between 2017 and 2019 were examined, and all cases with FND within 48 h of anaesthesia extracted.
   Results: 36 published cases were identified for the review. Sixteen described preceding stressors and 16 psychiatric diagnoses, including 8 with previous FND. Thirty-two (92%) had undergone general anaesthesia, most commonly for obstetric procedures. Motor/sensory loss was the most common presentation, followed by seizures and coma. Most (80.5%) developed symptoms immediately on induction or cessation of anaesthesia. For the case series, 8 of 107 clinic patients (7.5%), developed FND within 48 h of anaesthesia. All had previous psychiatric diagnoses, including 3 with previous FND. Three underwent general anaesthesia and 3 procedural sedation, with seizures the most common presentation. All developed symptoms immediately on induction or cessation of anaesthesia.
   Conclusion: These cases provide some support for an aetiological role for anaesthesia: there is evidence for an anaesthetic 'model' for the symptoms of FND that arise, they largely arise with the onset or termination of anaesthesia, and they arise most frequently during general anaesthesia or sedation.

AB  - To investigate the efficacy of self-management group education versus the standard care for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). An electronic search was performed in nine databases including PubMed for selecting eligible studies. Meta-analysis was used for pooling of the results. Of 3446 records screened, we included ten studies for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Regarding assessment of effectiveness, there was a significant superiority reported in the intervention group when compared to the usual/standard care (standardized mean difference [95% confidence interval] = 0.24 [0.15; 0.32]). The intervention group had a significant reduction in the levels of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and body mass index compared to the usual/standard care (p < 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference was observed in the levels of high-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure (SBP), or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the two groups (p > 0.05). Self-management group education interventions are recommended in patients with type 2 DM for their effectiveness in different clinical aspects.

Methods: A primary literature search of five electronic databases was performed to identify cohort, prospective, and longitudinal trials. Studies of adults who diagnosed with a MSK injury, such as sprains, strains or trauma, were included. Results: Eighteen studies involving 5372 participants were included in this review. Participants' ages ranged from 18-95 years. Most of the included studies were of prospective longitudinal design. Participants had a variety of MSK injuries (traumatic and non-traumatic) causing persistent pain. Multiple factors were identified as influencing the development of persistent pain following a MSK injury, including high pain intensity at baseline, post-traumatic stress syndrome, presence of medical comorbidities, and fear of movement. Scarcity of existing literature and the heterogeneity of the studies made meta-analysis not possible. Conclusions: This systematic review highlighted factors that might help predict persistent pain and disability following MSK injury in the general population, including athletes. Identification of these factors may help clinicians and other health care providers prevent the development of persistent pain following a MSK injury.

AB  - It is well established that access to preventative care, such as breast or cervical cancer screening, can reduce morbidity and mortality. Certain groups may be missed out of these healthcare services, such as women with disabilities, as they face many access barriers due to underlying inequalities and negative attitudes. However, the data have not been reviewed on whether women with disabilities face inequalities in the uptake of these services. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to compare the uptake of breast and cervical cancer screening in women with and without disabilities. A search was conducted in July 2021 across four databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, Global Health, and CINAHL. Quantitative studies comparing the uptake of breast or cervical cancer screening between women with and without disabilities were eligible. Twenty-nine studies were included, all from high-income settings. One third of the 29 studies (34.5%, n = 10) were deemed to have a high risk of bias, and the remainder a low risk of bias. The pooled estimates showed that women with disabilities have 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72-0.84) lower odds of attending breast cancer screening and have 0.63 (95% CI: 0.45-0.88) lower odds of attending cervical cancer screening, compared to women without disabilities. In conclusion, women with disabilities face disparities in receipt of preventative cancer care. There is consequently an urgent need to evaluate and improve the inclusivity of cancer screening programs and thereby prevent avoidable morbidity and mortality.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed gaps and areas of need in health systems worldwide. This work aims to map the evidence on COVID-19-related healthcare needs of adult patients, their family members, and the professionals involved in their care during the first year of the pandemic. We searched the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full texts for eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Descriptive data were extracted and inductive qualitative content analysis was used to generate codes and derive overarching themes. Thirty-six studies met inclusion criteria, with the majority reporting needs from the perspective of professionals (35/36). Professionals' needs were grouped into three main clusters (basic, occupational, and psycho-socio-emotional needs); patients' needs into four (basic, healthcare, psycho-socio-emotional, and other support needs); and family members' needs into two (psycho-socio-emotional and communication needs). Transversal needs across subgroups were also identified and grouped into three main clusters (public safety, information and communication, and coordination and support needs). This evidence map provides valuable insight on COVID-19-related healthcare needs. More research is needed to assess first-person perspectives of patients and their families, examine whether needs differ by country or region, and evaluate how needs have evolved over time.

AB  - Human herpesviruses (HHVs) have been implicated as possible risk factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Persistent lifelong HHVs infections may directly or indirectly contribute to the generation of AD hallmarks: amyloid beta (A beta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and synaptic loss. The present review focuses on summarizing current knowledge on the molecular mechanistic links between HHVs and AD that include processes involved in A beta accumulation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, autophagy, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. A PubMed search was performed to collect all the available research data regarding the above mentioned mechanistic links between HHVs and AD pathology. The vast majority of research articles referred to the different pathways exploited by Herpes Simplex Virus 1 that could lead to AD pathology, while a few studies highlighted the emerging role of HHV 6, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr Virus. The elucidation of such potential links may guide the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics to counter this devastating neurological disorder that until now remains incurable.

AB  - In ICD-11, catatonia is a complex syndrome that includes psychomotor disorders (negativity, catalepsy, wax flexibility, mutism, automatism, mannerisms, or echolalia) and volitional processes affect modulation and action planning, which leads to hypofunctional, hyperfunctional, or parafunctional motor action. This is a very important clue that this state can be associated with both mental and somatic diseases. In order to create a narrative review, authors analyzed the diagnostic criteria of ICD-10 and ICD-11 and searched the PubMed medical base for articles on the diagnosis and different approaches to the treatment of catatonia. The treatment of catatonia is not standardized. It is based on the use of benzodiazepines, GABAa receptor antagonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, D2 receptor antagonist, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The authors also would like to present the case of a patient in whom the diagnosis of catatonia was not so clear according to the diagnostic criteria, emphasizing the importance of the key diagnosis for the patient's recovery. The authors would also like to point out that the topic of catatonia should be of interest not only to psychiatrists, but also to doctors of other specialties, who may encounter cases of catatonia complicating somatic states in hospital wards.

AB  - The first emergency was to receive and treat COVID-19 patients in their acute phase; today, there is a clear need to propose appropriate post-acute rehabilitation programs. The aim of this research was to systematically review the effects of physical activity programs in the recovery of post-COVID-19 patients. The literature search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022289219), and was conducted between August and December 2021. A total of 35 studies out of the 1528 initially identified were finally included in the analysis. The systematic review clearly showed the health benefits of rehabilitation including physical activity in post-COVID-19 recovery, regardless of exercise modalities. These positive results were even observed using minor muscle re-mobilization for severe cases (i.e., postural changes, few steps-2 times/day) or using low volumes of exercise for mild-to-moderate cases (i.e., 120 min/week). A total of 97% of the 29 studies that performed statistical analyses demonstrated a significant increase in at least one parameter of functional capacity, and 96% of the 26 studies that statistically investigated the effects on the quality of life, mental health, and general state reported improvements. Yet, most of the studies were retrospective, uncontrolled, and enrolled aged people with comorbidities presented in severe forms of COVID-19. Physical activity programs, in addition to their high heterogeneity, remained poorly described in 83% of the studies and were part of a multidisciplinary program for 89% of the studies. Despite promising results, there is today a real need for prospective well-designed studies specifically assessing the effects of physical activity. In addition, it might appear relevant to propose standardized programs further considering the main characteristics of patients such as age, comorbidities, or the severity of COVID-19.

AB  - Gamification, which refers to the use of game design elements in non-game contexts, provides similar experiences and motivations as games do; this makes gamification a useful approach to promote positive behaviors. As a useful tool for keeping users motivated, engaged and active, there is a wide interest in adopting gamification solutions for supporting and promoting positive behaviors and behavior change (e.g. quit smoking, ecological behaviors, food choices, civic engagement, mental healthcare, sustainability, etc.). In this study, we use the CiteSpace software to examine 984 publications and their 46,609 unique references on gamification applied for behavior change. The corpus of studies was downloaded from the Scopus database and refers to studies published between 2011 and the beginning of 2022. Several methods were used to analyze these data: (1) document co-citation analysis (DCA) was performed to identify the pivotal researches and the research areas; (2) author cocitation analysis (ACA) was performed to identify the main authors; (3) and keyword analysis was performed to detect the most influential keywords and their change over time. The results of the analysis provide an overview of the influential documents, authors and keywords that have given shape to the literature of the field, and how it has evolved, showing an initial interest in motivational and persuasion techniques, and in the gamification design, and subsequently in the development of more rigorous methodologies for both design and use. As the first scientometric review of gamification applied to behavior change, this study will be of interest to junior and senior researchers, graduate students, and professors seeking to identify research trends, topics, major publications, and influential scholars.

AB  - Regular physical activity (PA) engagement has multiple benefits for individual general health at all ages and life stages. The present work focuses on badminton, which is one of the most popular sports worldwide. The aim was to conduct a systematic review focused on examining and analysing this sport and the benefits it brings to the health of those who engage in it. Examination was conducted from the viewpoint of overall health and provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art as presented in published scientific literature. PRISMA 2020 guidelines were adhered to. An exhaustive search was conducted of four electronic databases or search engines: Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE and Google Scholar. The search terms used were "badminton AND health" and "badminton AND benefits". In total, 27 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. After analysing the results, it was concluded that badminton engagement may lead to an improvement in all areas, the most studied being those related to physical health, in particular the improvement of cardiac and pulmonary functions and the development of basic physical capacities.

AB  - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has published 94 calls to action to redress the legacy of residential schools where thousands of Indigenous children have died. The objective of this narrative review is to address some of these calls by summarising the available evidence on work and health issues encountered by Indigenous workers in Canada. We searched seven databases to retrieve studies on Indigenous people, in Canada, and on occupational health as defined by the International Labour Organization. We included 31 studies, from which we found that Indigenous workers are experiencing intersectionality issues: in addition to having differential health issues related to a belowaverage socioeconomic status, Indigenous workers face discrimination in workplaces that affects their mental health. Indigenous workers might also cumulate occupational and environmental exposures from industries that have settled close to their dwellings (eg, exposure to polychlorobiphenyls). There is a scarcity of studies on major occupational health topics such as occupational cancers or musculoskeletal disorders in Indigenous people.

AB  - Introduction: Neuromuscular diseases comprise a heterogeneous group of genetic syndromes that lead to progressive muscle weakness, resulting in functional limitation. There is a gap in the literature regarding the communication of the diagnosis of such diseases, compromising the autonomy of patients and families, besides causing stress on the assistant physician. Objectives: Developing a guide to reduce communication barriers in the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases. Methodology: Systematic review, after searching the descriptors ("Muscular Diseases" OR "Neuromuscular Diseases") AND ("Truth Disclosure" OR "Bad news communication" OR "Breaking bad News") in the Pubmed, Bireme, and Scopus websites, and these results were analyzed through narrative textual synthesis. Results: 16 articles were submitted to the final analysis, giving rise to seven steps to support the communication process. These are Empathy, Message, Prognosis, Reception, Time, Individualization, and Autonomy. Discussion and conclusion: The empathic transmission of the message and the prognosis must accommodate the feelings of the interlocutors with different information needs. In this way, communication planning optimizes the time and individualizes each context, respecting the autonomy of those involved. EMPATIA reflects the bioethical and interdisciplinary analysis of the literature and comes to fill the gap related to the communication of bad news in neuromuscular diseases.

AB  - Post-COVID-19 conditions, also known as 'Long-COVID-19', describe a longer and more complex course of illness than acute COVID-19 with no widely accepted uniform case definition. We aimed to map the available evidence on persistent symptoms and sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database on 5 November 2021. We included longitudinal and cross-sectional studies and we extracted their characteristics, including the type of core outcomes for post-COVID-19 conditions. We included 565 studies (657 records). Most studies were uncontrolled cohort studies. The median follow-up time was 13 weeks (IQR 9 to 24). Only 72% of studies were conducted in high-income countries, 93% included unvaccinated adults with mild-to-critical disease, only 10% included children and adolescents, and less than 5% included children under the age of five. While most studies focused on health symptoms, including respiratory symptoms (71%), neurological symptoms (57%), fatigue (54%), pain (50%), mental functioning (43%), cardiovascular functioning (40%), and post-exertion symptoms (28%), cognitive function (26%), fewer studies assessed other symptoms such as overall recovery (24%), the need for rehabilitation (18%), health-related quality of life (16%), changes in work/occupation and study (10%), or survival related to long-COVID-19 (4%). There is a need for controlled cohort studies with long-term follow-up and a focus on overall recovery, health-related quality of life, and the ability to perform daily tasks. Studies need to be extended to later phases of the pandemic and countries with low resources.

AB  - Background: Preeclampsia (PE) is a multi-organ syndrome that onsets in the second half of pregnancy. It is the second leading cause of maternal death globally. The homeostasis of zinc (Zn) levels is important for feto-maternal health. Objective: We aimed to collect all studies available to synthesize the evidence regarding the association between maternal Zn levels and the risk of preeclampsia. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted via searching seven electronic databases [PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, African Journals Online (AJOL), ClinicalTrial.gov, and two Chinese databases: Wanfang and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, CNKI]. Studies reporting maternal serum Zn levels in pregnant women with or without preeclampsia were included. Eligible studies were assessed through Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the meta-analysis was performed via RevMan and Stata. The random-effects method (REM) was used for the meta-analysis with 95% confidence interval (CI). The pooled result was assessed using standard mean difference (SMD). The heterogeneity test was carried out using I-2 statistics, and the publication bias was evaluated using Begg's and Egger's test. Meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was performed via Stata software. Results: A total of 51 studies were included in the final analysis. 6,947 participants from 23 countries were involved in our study. All studies went through the quality assessment. The pooled results showed that maternal serum Zn levels were lower in preeclamptic women than in healthy pregnant women (SMD: -1.00, 95% CI: -1.29, -0.70). Sub-group analysis revealed that geographical, economic context, and disease severity may further influence serum Zn levels and preeclampsia. Limitations: There are significant between-study heterogeneity and publication bias among included studies. Conclusions: A lower level of maternal Zn was associated with increased risks of preeclampsia. The associations were not entirely consistent across countries and regions worldwide.

AB  - Children, and particularly infants, have physiological, anatomic, and social factors that increase vulnerability to temperature extremes. We performed a systematic review to explore the association between acute adverse infant outcomes (children 0-1 years) and exposure to high and low ambient temperatures. MEDLINE (Pubmed), Embase, CINAHL Plus, and Global Health were searched alongside the reference lists of key papers. We included published journal papers in English that assessed adverse infant outcomes related to short-term weather-related temperature exposure. Twenty-six studies met our inclusion criteria. Outcomes assessed included: infant mortality (n = 9), sudden infant death syndrome (n = 5), hospital visits or admissions (n = 5), infectious disease outcomes (n = 5), and neonatal conditions such as jaundice (n = 2). Higher temperatures were associated with increased risk of acute infant mortality, hospital admissions, and hand, foot, and mouth disease. Several studies identified low temperature impacts on infant mortality and episodes of respiratory disease. Findings on temperature risks for sudden infant death syndrome were inconsistent. Only five studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries, and evidence on subpopulations and temperature-sensitive infectious diseases was limited. Public health measures are required to reduce the impacts of heat and cold on infant health.

AB  - Under circumstances of pervasive global aging combined with weakened traditional family elder care, an incremental demand for institutional elder care is generated. This has led to a surge in research regarding institutional elder care. Rural residents' institutional elder care is receiving more attention as a major theme in social sciences and humanities research. Based on 94 articles related to rural institutional elder care, this study identified the most influential articles, journals and countries in rural institutional elder care research since 1995. This was done using science mapping methods through a three-step workflow consisting of bibliometric retrieval, scoping analysis and qualitative discussion. Keywords revealed five research mainstreams in this field: (1) the cognition and mental state of aged populations, (2) the nursing quality and service supply of aged care institutions, (3) the aged care management systems' establishment and improvements, (4) the risk factors of admission and discharge of aged care institutions, and (5) deathbed matters regarding the aged population. A qualitative discussion is also provided for 39 urban and rural comparative research papers and 55 pure rural research papers, summarizing the current research progress status regarding institutional elder care systems in rural areas. Gaps within existing research are also identified to indicate future research trends (such as the multi-dimensional and in-depth comparative research on institutional elder care, new rural institutional elder care model and technology, and correlative policy planning and development), which provides a multi-disciplinary guide for future research.

In this review of the related studies on TC, the authors explore its origin and development; summarize its therapeutic effect in treating depression, low back pain and other diseases; and further analyze its underlying mechanism. According to the literature, TC was primarily applied in the field of orthopedics and then was gradually used in neurology, psychiatry and psychology. It provides a new means for the treatment of depression, lower back pain, multiple sclerosis and other diseases. There are two potential mechanisms: physiological and psychological. In the future, exercise effects, adverse effects and exercise prescriptions of TC should be explored with large samples and high-quality randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Background: Preoperative anxiety has adverse effects on children and negative impacts on postoperative rehabilitation. Anesthesiologists can accurately identify children with preoperative anxiety, and individualized intervention can effectively improve their psychological state and clinical prognosis. However, a comprehensive summary of the current available evidence has yet to be conducted. Searches were conducted in Medline databases from inception to March 2022. Primary studies that reported preoperative anxiety in children and its attendant effects on postoperative recovery and prognosis were screened and included. Among the 309 publications identified, 12 related studies (n = 3540 patients) met the eligibility criteria. The incidence of preoperative anxiety in children in the included studies ranged from 41.7% to 75.44%. While 16 influencing factors were identified, only 5 factors had a significant impact on preoperative anxiety in children: younger age (n = 8), parental anxiety (n = 7), negative previous hospitalizations (n = 3), less sociableness (n = 2), and surgical setting (n = 1). The current scoping review identified risk factors for preoperative anxiety in children. Healthcare workers should identify and manage preoperatively anxious children. There are still some factors that are controversial, and large-scale clinical studies are needed.

AB  - Simple Summary The world is facing an overarching threat to food security, particularly in developing nations. The issue is further exacerbated by the apparent impacts of biotic and abiotic stresses driving down crop yields and productivity. Conventional strategies to improve yields and sustain productivity have been employed, including plant breeding for favourable and resilient agronomic traits. However, the efficacy and success rates of these methods are declining, partly due to the rapid changes in climate variability and the emergence of new and resistant phytopathogens. Additionally, the process of creating new and improved transgenic varieties of crops is long and can be expensive. Thus, new and innovative technologies are required for crop improvement. This review explores recent advances in the science of metabolomics and chemoinformatics, which have presented an avenue for rapid and robust analysis; moreover, it explores the elucidation of the complex plant metabolome, providing the opportunity to decipher the reactionary mechanisms of plants to the surrounding environment through their metabolic activity. As such, specific metabolites can, thus, be selected as biomarkers for crop improvement based on their functional characteristics under varying environmental conditions (growth, development, and defence). This new knowledge can enhance breeding practices through rapid and robust metabolic engineering techniques for sustainable agriculture. The United Nations (UN) estimate that the global population will reach 10 billion people by 2050. These projections have placed the agroeconomic industry under immense pressure to meet the growing demand for food and maintain global food security. However, factors associated with climate variability and the emergence of virulent plant pathogens and pests pose a considerable threat to meeting these demands. Advanced crop improvement strategies are required to circumvent the deleterious effects of biotic and abiotic stress and improve yields. Metabolomics is an emerging field in the omics pipeline and systems biology concerned with the quantitative and qualitative analysis of metabolites from a biological specimen under specified conditions. In the past few decades, metabolomics techniques have been extensively used to decipher and describe the metabolic networks associated with plant growth and development and the response and adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress. In recent years, metabolomics technologies, particularly plant metabolomics, have expanded to screening metabolic biomarkers for enhanced performance in yield and stress tolerance for metabolomics-assisted breeding. This review explores the recent advances in the application of metabolomics in agricultural biotechnology for biomarker discovery and the identification of new metabolites for crop improvement. We describe the basic plant metabolomics workflow, the essential analytical techniques, and the power of these combined analytical techniques with chemometrics and chemoinformatics tools. Furthermore, there are mentions of integrated omics systems for metabolomics-assisted breeding and of current applications.

AB  - Human exposure to indoor pollution is one of the most well-established ways that housing affects health. We conducted a review to document evidence on the morbidity and mortality outcomes associated with indoor household exposures in children and adults in South Africa. The authors conducted a scientific review of the publicly available literature up to April 2022 using different search engines (PubMed, ProQuest, Science Direct, Scopus and Google Scholar) to identify the literature that assessed the link between indoor household exposures and morbidity and mortality outcomes in children and adults. A total of 16 studies with 16,920 participants were included. Bioaerosols, allergens, dampness, tobacco smoking, household cooking and heating fuels, particulate matter, gaseous pollutants and indoor spray residue play a significant role in different morbidity outcomes. These health outcomes include dental caries, asthma, tuberculosis, severe airway inflammation, airway blockage, wheeze, rhinitis, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, phlegm on the chest, current rhinoconjunctivitis, hay fever, poor early life immune function, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational hypertension, and increased incidence of nasopharyngeal bacteria, which may predispose people to lower respiratory tract infections. The findings of this research highlight the need for more initiatives, programs, strategies, and policies to better reduce the negative consequences of indoor household exposures.

AB  - Simple Summary A stroke occurs when there is a lack of blood flow to the brain. Stroke injures the brain and can have devastating outcomes depending on the size and location of the brain tissue affected. Currently, there are only a limited number of treatment options for stroke. Extracellular vesicles are small vesicles secreted by cells. Importantly, extracellular vesicles have specific markers indicating the cell they were released from and can pass from the brain into the blood. For these reasons, assessing extracellular vesicles in the blood may create a window into changes occurring in the brain. Assessing changes in extracellular vesicles in the blood during stroke may produce new insight into the cellular changes in the brain causing injury during stroke. This in turn may generate potential targets for the development of future treatments. We summarize what is known about changes in brain-cell-specific extracellular vesicles during stroke and stress the importance of continuing to study these changes. Stoke is a prevalent and devastating neurologic condition with limited options for therapeutic management. Since brain tissue is rarely accessible clinically, peripheral biomarkers for the central nervous system's (CNS's) cellular response to stroke may prove critical for increasing our understanding of stroke pathology and elucidating novel therapeutic targets. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived, membrane-enclosed vesicles secreted by all cell types within the CNS that can freely pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and contain unique markers and content linked to their cell of origin. These unique qualities make brain-derived EVs novel candidates for non-invasive blood-based biomarkers of both cell specificity and cell physiological state during the progression of stroke and recovery. While studies are continuously emerging that are assessing the therapeutic potential of EVs and profiling EV cargo, a vast minority of these studies link EV content to specific cell types. A better understanding of cell-specific EV release during the acute, subacute, and chronic stages of stroke is needed to further elucidate the cellular processes responsible for stroke pathophysiology. Herein, we outline what is known about EV release from distinct cell types of the CNS during stroke and the potential of these EVs as peripheral biomarkers for cellular function in the CNS during stroke.

AB  - Low back pain (LBP) is a global and disabling problem. A considerable number of systematic reviews published over the past decade have reported a range of factors that increase the risk of chronicity due to LBP. This study summarizes up-to-date and high-level research evidence on the biopsychosocial prognostic factors of outcomes in adults with non-specific low back pain at follow-up. An umbrella review was carried out. PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus and PEDro were searched for studies published between 1 January 2008 and 20 March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed review quality. Fifteen systematic reviews met the eligibility criteria; all were deemed reliable according to our criteria. There were five prognostic factors with consistent evidence of association with poor acute-subacute LBP outcomes in the long term (high levels of pain intensity and disability, high emotional distress, negative recovery expectations and high physical demands at work), as well as one factor with consistent evidence of no association (low education levels). For mixed-duration LBP, there was one predictor consistently associated with poor outcomes in the long term (high pain catastrophism). We observed insufficient evidence to synthesize social factors as well as to fully assess predictors in the chronic phase of LBP. This study provides consistent evidence of the predictive value of biological and psychological factors for LBP outcomes in the long term. The identified prognostic factors should be considered for inclusion into low back pain explanatory models.

AB  - Sea star wasting-marked in a variety of sea star species as varying degrees of skin lesions followed by disintegration-recently caused one of the largest marine die-offs ever recorded on the west coast of North America, killing billions of sea stars. Despite the important ramifications this mortality had for coastal benthic ecosystems, such as increased abundance of prey, little is known about the causes of the disease or the mechanisms of its progression. Although there have been studies indicating a range of causal mechanisms, including viruses and environmental effects, the broad spatial and depth range of affected populations leaves many questions remaining about either infectious or non-infectious mechanisms. Wasting appears to start with degradation of mutable connective tissue in the body wall, leading to disintegration of the epidermis. Here, we briefly review basic sea star biology in the context of sea star wasting and present our current knowledge and hypotheses related to the symptoms, the microbiome, the viruses, and the associated environmental stressors. We also highlight throughout the article knowledge gaps and the data needed to better understand sea star wasting mechanistically, its causes, and potential management.

AB  - Overweight and obesity, including their prevalence and consequences, reflect a leading public health problem. Studies have already shown that physical activity leads to a reduction in body weight in children and adults. However, the university setting has rarely been investigated. The aim of this review is, therefore, to examine and summarize the effectiveness of physical-activity-based interventions to reduce obesity and overweight in university students. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched for relevant studies published in English between January 2010 and February 2022. Quantitative studies conducting a physical-activity-based intervention with overweight or obese university students and reporting changes in BMI were included. Data were described in a narrative synthesis. Out of 16 included studies, 11 reported a significant reduction in BMI. However, all studies except one were able to demonstrate some BMI improvements, whereas all studies reported significant changes in at least one health-related indicator. Aerobic exercises were able to demonstrate the greatest reductions in BMI. This review is the first systematic presentation on the effectiveness of physical-activity-based interventions in overweight and obese university students. Future work should reconsider BMI as the primary outcome if appropriate within the respective study design (i.e., to measure long-term effects). More interventions are needed to improve strategies.

AB  - By far, no revolutionary breakthrough in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) was found. It is indeed a knotty problem to select a satisfactory strategy for treating some patients with advanced stage PD. Development of novel therapeutic targets against PD has been an urgent task faced by global PD researchers. Targets in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway (KP) were then considered. Metabolites in the KP are liposoluble. Some neurotoxic metabolites, including 3-hydroxykynurenine and its downstream 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and quinolinic acid, are mainly produced peripherally. They can easily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and exert their neurotoxic effects in the central neuron system (CNS), which is considered as a potential pathophysiological mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, agents against the targets in the KP have two characteristics: (1) being independent from the dopaminergic system and (2) being seldom affected by the BBB. Inspiringly, one agent, namely, the inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, has been currently reported to present satisfactory efficacy comparable to levodopa, implying that the KP might be a potential novel target for PD. This review collected and summarized the updated information regarding the association of the KP with PD, which is helpful for understanding the clinical value of the KP in the PD scenario.

AB  - Parenting children with developmental disabilities (DD) can be generally characterized by a considerable psychological burden. The effects on parental and familial psychological well-being and, consequently, on children's developmental outcomes should not be underestimated, especially in early childhood. The current review aims to advance our understanding of the key factors (e.g., formats, sample characteristics, research design) that characterize parent training interventions, and that could be related to their outcomes, to guide researchers and clinical practitioners to develop and provide efficient programs. Studies were identified via an Internet search from three electronic databases, following PRIMSA guidelines. Studies published until November 2021 were taken into account. The initial search yielded a total of 2475 studies. Among them, 101 studies were fully reviewed. Finally, ten of the studies, which met all the inclusion criteria, formed the basis for this review. Participants' characteristics, main features of the interventions (i.e., study design, structure, and contents), outcome variables and treatment efficacy were deeply examined and discussed. Key factors of parent training interventions with parents of children affected by DD are enlightened, to guide researchers and clinicians in the design and implementation of tailored specific programs, aimed to sustain parenting and foster children's developmental outcomes, from early stages of life.

AB  - Purpose: The objective was to review sexual and gender minority (SGM) health research studies to gain an understanding of how the community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework has been operationalized.Methods: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct a review of all SGM health research studies published in the past 10 years that cited a CBPR approach (PROSPERO Registration No. CRD42016036608). CINAHL, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases were systematically searched in October 2020. Dimensions of community involvement (e.g., shared decision-making; flexibility to community needs and priorities) and the strength of evidence for each dimension were rated using guidance from the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality.Results: The 48 eligible articles identified reported a range of 0-11 (out of 13) community elements. Seven studies reported zero elements. Qualitative studies (n=28; 58.3%) had an average quality score of 2.32 (range: 1.43-2.5). The 15 (31.3%) cross-sectional studies had an average quality score of 2.08 (range: 1.64-2.27).Conclusion: Adhering to the CBPR framework is challenging. The benefits of striving toward its principles, however, can move us toward transformative and sustainable social change within SGM communities.

AB  - Background: Trajectories of decline across different socio-cognitive domains in healthy older adults and in pathological aging conditions have not been investigated. This was addressed in the present systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, CENTRAL, and PsycInfo were searched for studies investigating social cognition across four domains (Theory of Mind, ToM; emotion recognition, ER; Social-decision making, SD; visual perspective taking, VPT) in healthy older individuals, individuals with subjective and mild cognitive impairment (SCD, MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Results: Of 8137 screened studies, 132 studies were included in the review. ToM and ER showed a clear progression of impairment from normal aging to AD. Differential patterns of decline were identified for different types of ToM and ER.
   Conclusion: This systematic review identified progression of impairment of specific socio-cognitive abilities, which is the necessary pre-requisite for developing targeted interventions. We identified a lack of research on socio-cognitive decline in different populations (e.g., middle age, SCD and MCI-subtypes) and domains (SDM, VPT).

Based on a pre-registered protocol (PROPSPERO: CRD42021289827), we searched a broad range of electronic databases up to 02.02.2021 for randomized control trials (RCTs) of melatonin. We assessed study quality using the Risk of Bias tool, v2. We included a total of 34 RCTs (21 in children/adolescents: N = 984; 13 in adults: N = 1014). We found evidence that melatonin significantly improved sleep onset latency and total sleep time, but not sleep awaking, in children and adolescents with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, and sleep onset latency (measured by diary) as well as total sleep time (measured with polysomnography) in adults with delayed sleep phase disorder. No evidence of significant differences between melatonin and placebo was found in terms of tolerability. We discuss clinical and research implications of our findings.

AB  - In order to maximize adaptations and to avoid nonfunctional overreaching syndrome or noncontact injury, coaches in high-performance sports must regularly monitor recovery before and after competitions/important training sessions and maintain well-being status. Therefore, quantifying and evaluating psychometric states of recovery during the season in sports teams such as soccer is important. Over the last years, there has been substantial growth in research related to psychometric states of recovery in soccer. The increase in research on this topic is coincident with the increase in popularity obtained by subjective monitoring of the pre-fatigue state of the players before each training sessions or match with a strong emphasis on the effects of well-being or recovery state. Among the subjective methods for players' control, the Hooper index (HI) assesses the quality of sleep during the previous night, overall stress, fatigue, and delayed-onset muscle soreness. Additionally, the total quality of recovery (TQR) scale measures recovery status. The HI and TQR recorded before each training session or match were affected by the variability of training load (TL) and influenced the physical and technical performances, and the affective aspects of soccer players. Researchers have recommended wellness monitoring soccer players' psychometric state of recovery before each training session or match in order to detect early signs of fatigue and optimize high-level training performance. This method allows for better detecting signs of individual fatigue and allows coaches to adapt and readjust the TL, and avoid physical and technical gaps in order to improve the performance of soccer players.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has influenced the entire world. There has been great surge of mental health problems after the pandemic has started. The second wave has almost exhausted the Indian Health care system. There has also been cases of suicide due to COVID-19 infection. The objective of study was to highlight various factors involved in COVID-19 related suicide (CRS) during second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India. CRS reports on the websites of 10 popular newspapers and television news channels in North India and official government websites such as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare were searched between February 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021. We also searched the Medline and Google Scholar databases for CRS reports from India using the terms "corona", "COVID-19", "SARS CoV 2", "India", and "suicide" in various combinations. A total of 62 articles were included for the study. Most common mode of suicide was hanging and most common site was the deceased's home. Fear of infecting family members was the most common cause of CRS during second wave of the ongoing pandemic in India. Many individuals lost their lives to suicide due to COVID-19 pandemic. The media report does not provide the exact picture of community suicide. Proper physician counselling at the time of providing treatment can help in reducing few CRS.

AB  - Neurological physiotherapy adopts a problem-based approach for each patient as determined by a thorough evaluation of the patient's physical and mental well-being. This work aims to provide a literature review of physical therapy interventions in the elderly with neurological diseases (NDs) and discuss physiotherapy procedures and methods that utilize cutting-edge technologies for which clinical studies are available. Hence, the review focuses on acute NDs (stroke), deteriorating NDs (Parkinson's disease), and age-related cognitive impairment. The most used physiotherapy procedures on which clinical data are available are balance and gait training (robot-assisted or not), occupational therapy, classical physiotherapy, walking and treadmill training, and upper limb robot-assisted therapy. Respectively, the most often-used equipment are types of treadmills, robotic-assisted equipment (Lokomat (R) and Gait Trainer GT1), and portable walkway systems (GAITRite (R)), along with state-of-the-art technologies of virtual reality, virtual assistants, and smartphones. The findings of this work summarize the core standard tools and procedures, but more importantly, provide a glimpse of the new era in physiotherapy with the utilization of innovative equipment tools for advanced patient monitoring and empowerment.

AB  - Multiple psychosocial interventions to treat ADHD symptoms have been developed and empirically tested. However, no clear recommendations exist regarding the utilization of these interventions for treating core ADHD symptoms across different populations. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis by the CADDRA Guidelines work Group was to generate such recommendations, using recent evidence. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses (MA) from 2010 to 13 February 2020 were searched in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, EBM Reviews and CINAHL. Studies of populations with significant levels of comorbidities were excluded. Thirty-one studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (22 RCT, 9 MA) and 24 studies (19 RCT, 5 MA) were included in the quantitative synthesis. Using three-level meta-analyses to pool results of multiple observations from each RCT, as well as four-level meta-analyses to pool results from multiples outcomes and multiple studies of each MA, we generated recommendations using the GRADE approach for: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Physical Exercise and Mind-Body intervention; Caregiver intervention; School-based and Executive intervention; and other interventions for core ADHD symptoms across Preschooler, Child, Adolescent and Adult populations. The evidence supports a recommendation for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for adults and Caregiver intervention for Children, but not for preschoolers. There were not enough data to provide recommendations for the other types of psychosocial interventions. Our results are in line with previous meta-analytic assessments; however, they provide a more in-depth assessment of the effect of psychosocial intervention on core ADHD symptoms.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Negative symptoms have a detrimental impact on functional outcomes and quality of life in people with schizophrenia, and few therapeutic options are considered effective for this symptomatic dimension. Studies have suggested that noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) interventions may be effective in treating negative symptoms. However, the comparative efficacy of different NIBS protocols for relieving negative symptoms remains unclear.
   OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and acceptability of different NIBS interventions for treating negative symptoms.
   DATA SOURCES The ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, ProQuest, PubMed, ScienceDirect, ClinicalTrials.gov, andWeb of Science electronic databases were systematically searched from inception through December 7, 2021.
   STUDY SELECTION A frequentist model network meta-analysis was conducted to assess the pooled findings of trials that evaluated the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), theta-burst stimulation, transcranial random noise stimulation, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation on negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining NIBS interventions for participants with schizophrenia were included.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. Data were independently extracted by multiple observers. The pair-wise meta-analytic procedures were conducted using a random-effects model.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary outcomeswere changes in the severity of negative symptoms and acceptability (ie, dropout rates owing to any reason). Secondary outcomes were changes in positive and depressive symptoms.
   RESULTS Forty-eight RCTs involving 2211 participants (mean [range] age, 38.7 [24.0-57.0] years; mean [range] proportion of female patients, 30.6%[0%-70.0%]) were included. Compared with sham control interventions, excitatory NIBS strategies (standardized mean difference [SMD]: high-definition transcranial random noise stimulation, -2.19 [95% CI, -3.36 to -1.02]; intermittent theta-burst stimulation, -1.32 [95% CI, -1.88 to -0.76]; anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, -1.28 [95% CI, -2.55 to -0.02]; high-frequency rTMS, -0.43 [95% CI, -0.68 to -0.18]; extreme high-frequency rTMS, -0.45 [95% CI, -0.79 to -0.12]) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with or without other inhibitory stimulation protocols in the contralateral regions of the brain were associated with significantly larger reductions in negative symptoms. Acceptability did not significantly differ between the groups.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this network meta-analysis, excitatory NIBS protocols over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were associated with significantly large improvements in the severity of negative symptoms. Because relatively few studies were available for inclusion, additional well-designed, large-scale RCTs are warranted.

AB  - Neurological disorders often cause severe long-term disabilities with substantial activity limitations and participation restrictions such as community integration, family functioning, employment, social interaction and participation. Increasing understanding of brain functioning has opened new perspectives for more integrative interventions, boosting the intrinsic central nervous system neuroplastic capabilities in order to achieve efficient behavioral restitution. Neurorehabilitation must take into account the many aspects of the individual through a comprehensive analysis of actual and potential cognitive, behavioral, emotional and physical skills, while increasing awareness and understanding of the new self of the person being dealt with. The exclusive adoption by the rehabilitator of objective functional measures often overlooks the values and goals of the disabled person. Indeed, each individual has their own rhythm, unique life history and personality construct. In this challenging context, it is essential to deepen the assessment through subjective measures, which more adequately reflect the patient's perspective in order to shape genuinely tailored instead of standardized neurorehabilitation approaches. In this overly complex panorama, where confounding and prognostic factors also strongly influence potential functional recovery, the healthcare community needs to rethink neurorehabilitation formats.

AB  - (1) Background: Given that the most effective dose, optimal type, and most beneficial population for improving sleep with mindfulness-based movement (MBM) remains unknown, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with moderator analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess these effects. (2) Methods: Three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCO) were systematically searched for RCTs published through August 2021 for analysis. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed with Review Manager 5.3, and the meta-analysis was performed in Stata 16.0. (3) Results: A meta-analysis of 61 RCTs with 2697 participants showed that MBM significantly improved sleep quality compared to controls (SMD = -0.794; 95% CI: -0.794 to -0.994, p < 0.001, I-2 = 90.7%). Moderator analysis showed that a long-term MBM (SMD = -0.829; 95% CI: 0.945 to 0.712; p < 0.001) had a larger effect size on sleep than a short-term MBM (SMD = -0.714; 95% CI: 0.784 to 0.644; p < 0.001). Practicing at least twice per week (SMD = -0.793; 95% CI: -0.868 to -0.718; p < 0.001) was more effective compared to practicing once per week (SMD = -0.687; 95% CI: -0.804 to -0.570; p < 0.001). Studies with a total intervention time of more than 24 h also revealed better sleep quality improvement (SMD = -0.759; 95% CI: -0.865 to -0.653; p < 0.001). In addition, the healthy population and older adults gained more from MBM than the patients and younger adults. (4) Conclusions: MBM can effectively improve subjective sleep quality, and the optimal intervention dose of MBM can be utilized in future intervention studies to treat or improve sleep disturbance (MBM more than twice a week for more than three months, with a total intervention time of more than 24 h).

Physical activity seems to be a feasible and useful complementary intervention to improve the physical, psychological, and social spheres and decrease some symptoms, especially for survivors. Consequently, the objective of the present umbrella review was to analyze the efficacy of different physical-activity interventions in the physical, mental, and social spheres of breast-cancer survivors. (2) Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on breast-cancer survivors and physical-activity effects were searched on the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus till 9 August 2022. The quality of the studies included was evaluated, and the results were narratively analyzed. (3) Results: Physical-activity intervention generally improves the physical, mental, and social spheres of breast-cancer survivors, but the studies included present heterogeneity in the protocols adopted. (4) Conclusions: A well-structured and planned physical-activity intervention is useful for improvements in the physical, mental, and social spheres of breast-cancer survivors, but the studies presented high heterogeneity. Yoga seems to be the most effective physical intervention to complement medical therapy.

AB  - Children (< 18 years of age) face unique physiological and sociological obstacles in regards to hydration. Research regarding the impact of hydration on children's cognitive performance lags considerably when compared to adults. Following methods of a systematic literature search, an exploratory review of current literature examining hydration and cognitive function in children is presented. Fourteen published studies in which fluid intake was manipulated or participants were grouped based on hydration status markers met a priori inclusion criteria. No studies altered hydration status via sweat loss. Many studies were conducted in participants' school settings. Results were often reported as association between hydration status and performance with multiple covariates (e.g., IQ or socioeconomic status) versus contrast of raw scores between conditions, limiting direct, magnitude-based comparisons. Three major methodological themes were used to classify articles: (a) studies with a single, acute fluid intake intervention, (b) hydration interventions in which investigators attempted to intentionally alter fluid intake for an extended period, and (c) studies comparing cognitive results based on hydration status markers or reported fluid intake. The only intervention that consistently resulted in an improvement in cognitive task performance was acute fluid consumption. These results suggest encouragement to consume similar to 250 ml of water 20-60 min before challenging academic engagement may be advantageous to children. Research on mechanistic origins that explain acute fluid intake benefits on cognitive performance, differences in cognitive performance improvements due to fluid intake among children versus adults, and if routine academic tasks are improved by acute fluid intake is warranted.

AB  - Background Renal transplantation is considered the gold standard treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Adolescent and young adult kidney transplant recipients have the highest rate of graft loss amongst transplanted patients. It is largely accepted this is due to psychosocial and behavioural difficulties, which impact adherence to prescribed therapies. This phenomenon is not isolated to a particular healthcare system having been observed in multiple countries across different continents. It is a global issue of concern. We sought to review the psychosocial needs of these patients, and the interventions designed to meet these needs. Methods A scoping review was conducted based on Arksey and O'Malley's six-stage framework. Eligibility criteria included primary studies of any type that investigated the psychosocial needs of adolescent and/or young adult renal transplant recipients or studies which examined interventions designed to address these needs. Search strategies were developed and conducted on PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were critically reviewed using a descriptive-analytical narrative method. Results Thirty-nine studies met our inclusion criteria, 30 of which related to psychosocial needs, and the remainder examined psychosocial interventions. Four main themes were derived from our analysis of psychosocial needs literature, as follows: the need for (1) emotional support, (2) acceptance, (3) direction, (4) equality in healthcare. 2 main themes emerged from analysis of psychosocial intervention literature, namely: psychosocial (1) capability, (2) assessment. Despite the evidence that graft health is strongly associated with psychosocial wellbeing, findings revealed a significant lack of literature investigating how best to meet psychosocial needs. Trends were observed amongst intervention studies, namely interventions of novel and non-evidenced based design, with the aim of improving medication adherence through organisational strategies and education. However, literature regarding psychosocial needs showed non-adherence to therapies was not simply a result of disorganisation or lack of understanding, but rather, was founded on a recipient's idiosyncratic relationship with their prescribed therapies e.g., psychological, social or financial reasons for non-adherence. Conclusions Future research should be directed at investigating the efficacy of evidence-based interventions that empower the individual patient to overcome their specific barrier to an optimal relationship with their therapies.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are peptide hormones and growth factors. A major pathological feature of both Alzheimer's dis-ease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of synaptic transmission in the cortex in AD and the loss of dopaminergic synapses in the nigra-striatal dopaminergic projection. Several studies demonstrate that GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonists protect synapses and synaptic transmission from the toxic events that underlie AD and PD. In a range of AD animal models, treatment with GLP-1, GIP, or dual-GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists effectively protected cognition, synaptic trans-mission, long-term potentiation (LTP), and prevented the loss of synapses and neurons. In PD models, dopaminergic production resumed and synapses became functional again. Importantly, the GLP-1 receptor agonists exendin-4 and liraglutide have shown good protective effects in clinical trials in AD and PD patients. Studies show that growth factors and peptide drugs that can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) better are more potent than those that do not cross the BBB. We therefore developed dual-GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists that can cross the BBB at an enhanced rate and showed superior protective properties on synapses in animal models of AD and PD.

KW  - keyword clustering
KW  - focuses
KW  - trends
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly influenced the world. In wave after wave, many countries suffered from the pandemic, which caused social instability, hindered global growth, and harmed mental health. Although research has been published on various mental health issues during the pandemic, some profound effects on mental health are difficult to observe and study thoroughly in the short term. The impact of the pandemic on mental health is still at a nascent stage of research. Based on the existing literature, we used bibliometric tools to conduct an overall analysis of mental health research during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Researchers from universities, hospitals, communities, and medical institutions around the world used questionnaire surveys, telephone-based surveys, online surveys, cross-sectional surveys, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and systematic umbrella reviews as their research methods. Papers from the three academic databases, Web of Science (WOS), ProQuest Academic Database (ProQuest), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), were included. Their previous research results were systematically collected, sorted, and translated and CiteSpace 5.1 and VOSviewers 1.6.13 were used to conduct a bibliometric analysis of them. Result: Authors with papers in this field are generally from the USA, the People's Republic of China, the UK, South Korea, Singapore, and Australia. Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University are the top three institutions in terms of the production of research papers on the subject. The University of Toronto, Columbia University, and the University of Melbourne played an important role in the research of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The numbers of related research papers in the USA and China are significantly larger than those in the other countries, while co-occurrence centrality indexes in Germany, Italy, England, and Canada may be higher. Conclusion: We found that the most mentioned keywords in the study of mental health research during the COVID-19 pandemic can be divided into three categories: keywords that represent specific groups of people, that describe influences and symptoms, and that are related to public health policies. The most-cited issues were about medical staff, isolation, psychological symptoms, telehealth, social media, and loneliness. Protection of the youth and health workers and telemedicine research are expected to gain importance in the future.

AB  - Background Internationally, an increasing proportion of emergency department visits are mental health related. Concurrently, psychiatric wards are often occupied above capacity. Healthcare providers have introduced short-stay, hospital-based crisis units offering a therapeutic space for stabilisation, assessment and appropriate referral. Research lags behind roll-out, and a review of the evidence is urgently needed to inform policy and further introduction of similar units. Aims This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of short-stay, hospital-based mental health crisis units. Method We searched EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL and PsycINFO up to March 2021. All designs incorporating a control or comparison group were eligible for inclusion, and all effect estimates with a comparison group were extracted and combined meta-analytically where appropriate. We assessed study risk of bias with Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions and Risk of Bias in Randomized Trials. Results Data from twelve studies across six countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, The Netherlands, UK and USA) and 67 505 participants were included. Data indicated that units delivered benefits on many outcomes. Units could reduce psychiatric holds (42% after intervention compared with 49.8% before intervention; difference = 7.8%; P < 0.0001) and increase out-patient follow-up care (chi(2) = 37.42, d.f. = 1; P < 0.001). Meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in length of emergency department stay (by 164.24 min; 95% CI -261.24 to -67.23 min; P < 0.001) and number of in-patient admissions (odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.43-0.68; P < 0.001). Conclusions Short-stay mental health crisis units are effective for reducing emergency department wait times and in-patient admissions. Further research should investigate the impact of units on patient experience, and clinical and social outcomes.

AB  - Anecdotal experiences show that the human perception of time is subjective, and changes with one's emotional state. Over the past 25 years, increasing empirical evidence has demonstrated that emotions distort time perception and usually result in overestimation. Yet, some inconsistencies deserve clarification. Specifically, it remains controversial how valence (positive/negative), arousal (high/low), stimulus type (scenic picture/facial expression/word/sound), and temporal paradigm (reproduction/estimation/discrimination) modulate the effect of emotion on time perception. Thus, the current study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to quantify evidence for these moderators. After searching the Web of Science, SpiScholar, and Google Scholar, 95 effect sizes from 31 empirical studies were calculated using Hedges'g. The included studies involved 3,776 participants. The results a highlighted significant moderating effect of valence, arousal, stimulus type, and temporal paradigm. Specifically, negative valence tends to result in overestimation relative to positive valence; the increasing arousal leads to increasing temporal dilating; scenic picture, facial picture, and sound are more effective in inducing distortions than word; the overestimation can be better observed by discrimination and estimation paradigms relative to reproduction paradigms, and estimation paradigm is likely to be the most effective. These results suggest that the effect of emotion on time perception is influenced by valence, arousal, stimulus type, and temporal paradigm. These mitigating factors should be considered by scientists when studying time perception.

AB  - Public Significance Statement The enactment effect is the finding that physically performing an action represented by a word or phrase leads to enhanced memory for that information relative to simply reading it. This review integrates evidence from behavioral, neuroimaging, and patient studies to highlight the utility of encoding multiple facets of an item or an event to enhance its retention. Enactment was found to be a reliable and effective mnemonic tool for both neurotypical and patient populations.
   The enactment effect is the phenomenon that physically performing an action represented by a word or phrase (e.g., clap, clap your hands) results in better memory than does simply reading it. We examined data from three different methodological approaches to provide a comprehensive review of the enactment effect across 145 behavioral, 7 neuroimaging, and 31 neurological patient studies. Boosts in memory performance following execution of a physical action were compared to those produced by reading words or phrases, by watching an experimenter perform actions, or by engaging in self-generated imagery. Across the behavioral studies, we employed random-effects meta-regression with robust variance estimation (RVE) to reveal an average enactment effect size of g = 1.23. Further meta-analyses revealed that variations in study design and comparison task reliably influence the size of the enactment effect, whereas four other experiment factors-test format, learning instruction type, retention interval, and the presence of objects during encoding-likely do not influence the effect. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated enactment-related activation to be prevalent in the motor cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Patient studies indicated that, regardless of whether impairments of memory (e.g., Alzheimer's) or of motor capability (e.g., Parkinson's) were present, patients were able to benefit from enactment. The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis highlight two components accounting for the memory benefit from enactment: a primary mental contribution relating to planning the action and a secondary physical contribution of the action itself.

AB  - Recent information technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) allow the creation of simulated sensory worlds with which we can interact. Using programming language, digital details can be overlaid onto displays of our environment, confounding what is real and what has been artificially engineered. Natural language, particularly the use of direct verbal suggestion (DVS) in everyday and hypnotic contexts, can also manipulate the meaning and significance of objects and events in ourselves and others. In this review, we focus on how socially rewarding language can construct and influence reality. Language is symbolic, automatic and flexible and can be used to augment bodily sensations e.g. feelings of heaviness in a limb or suggest a colour that is not there. We introduce the term 'suggested reality' (SR) to refer to the important role that language, specifically DVS, plays in constructing, maintaining and manipulating our shared reality. We also propose the term edited reality to encompass the wider influence of information technology and linguistic techniques that results in altered subjective experience and review its use in clinical settings, while acknowledging its limitations. We develop a cognitive model indicating how the brain's central executive structures use our personal and linguistic-based narrative in subjective awareness, arguing for a central role for language in DVS. A better understanding of the characteristics of VR, AR and SR and their applications in everyday life, research and clinical settings can help us to better understand our own reality and how it can be edited.

AB  - Background: Front-line nurses have played a critical role during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A number of qualitative studies reported front-line nurses' experiences and needs in caring for patients with COVID-19. However, the application of evidence from a single qualitative study to guide clinical practice has limitations. This study aimed to explore front-line nurses' experiences and needs during the COVID-19 pandemic through a qualitative meta-synthesis. Methods: Seven databases were searched from 1 December 2019 to 20 January 2022, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane COVID-19 study register, CINAHL, PsycINFO, MedRxiv, and bioRxiv. The quality of included studies was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) qualitative research appraisal tool. Meta-synthesis was used to synthesize the data from included studies. Results: A total of 70 studies were included, and five synthesized findings were developed: (1) Although nurses actively devoted themselves to fighting against COVID-19, considering their professional responsibility and historical previous experience with mankind, they were not invulnerable; (2) There were various difficulties and challenges in caring for patients with COVID-19, including fear related to providing patients with care, shortage of protective equipment and manpower, and negative attitude of family members; (3) Facing difficulties and challenges, nurses could only partly cope by using mixed means to overcome those, including media, learning, gaining skills, responding together, and organizational assistance; (4) To better respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses' needs should be paid attention to. Counseling, training, information, resources, and investment are pivotal; (5) Despite the hardships, nurses became stronger and gained gratitude, positivity, mental peace, and confidence. Conclusions: This study reveals that the psychological experiences of front-line nurses varied, and they faced a variety of challenges. Although nurses had some coping strategies, they still needed multifaceted support to meet the challenges.Systematic review registration, PROSPERO: CRD42021255468.

AB  - Background: Violence to others (hereinafter referred to as "violence-TO ") is common in individuals with schizophrenia. The reported prevalence of violence-TO among schizophrenics ranges widely in existing studies. Improved prevalence estimates and identification of moderators are needed to guide future management and research. Methods: We searched EBSCO, EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, WANFANG data, and CBM for relevant articles published before June 5, 2022. Meanwhile, violence-TO was summarized into four categories: (a) violence-TO on the reviews of official criminal or psychiatric records (type I); (b) less serious forms of violence-TO (type II); (c) physical acts causing demonstrable harm to victims (type III); (d) homicide (type IV). We did meta-analysis for the above types of violence-TO, respectively, and applied subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Results: A total of 56 studies were eligible in this study and 34 of them were high-quality. The prevalence of type I to type IV in individuals with schizophrenia in China was 23.83% (95% CI: 18.38-29.75%), 23.16% (95% CI: 8.04-42.97%), 17.19% (95%CI: 8.52-28.04%), and 0.62% (95% CI: 0.08-1.54%) respectively. The results of the subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of type I was higher among subjects in the inland than in the coastal non-economic zone, while the prevalence of type III was the highest in the coastal economic zone, followed by the inland region and the lowest in the coastal non-economic zone. The results of multivariate meta-regression analyses showed that: patient source in type I (beta = 0.15, P < 0.01), patient source (beta = 0.47, P < 0.01), and proportion of male (beta = 0.19, P < 0.01) in type II, age (beta = 0.25, P < 0.01), and GDP per capita (beta = 0.05, P = 0.01) in type III were statistically significant. Conclusion: The prevalence of different types of violence-TO and their influencing factors varied. Therefore, the authorities should take different management measures. In addition to individual factors, regional factors may also affect violence-TO, which suggests the need for a multi-sectorial approach to prevention and treatment for subjects in different regions and adopting targeted control strategies.Systematic Review Registration[], identifier [CRD42021269767].

AB  - Dysfunction in dopamine (DA) signaling contributes to neurological disorders ranging from drug addiction and schizophrenia to depression and Parkinson's Disease. How might impairment of one neurotransmitter come to effect these seemingly disparate diseases? One potential explanation is that unique populations of DA-releasing cells project to separate brain regions that contribute to different sets of behaviors. Though dopaminergic cells themselves are spatially restricted to the midbrain and constitute a relatively small proportion of all neurons, their projections influence many brain regions. DA is particularly critical for the activity and function of medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) ensembles. The midbrain and mPFC exhibit reciprocal connectivity - the former innervates the mPFC, and in turn, the mPFC projects back to the midbrain. Viral mapping studies have helped elucidate the connectivity within and between these regions, which likely have broad implications for DA-dependent behaviors. In this review, we discuss advancements in our understanding of the connectivity between the mPFC and midbrain DA system, focusing primarily on rodent models.

AB  - Adolescence is a late developmental period marked by pronounced reorganization of brain networks in which epigenetic mechanisms play a fundamental role. This brain remodeling is associated with a peculiar behavior characterized by novelty seeking and risky activities such as alcohol and drug abuse, which is associated with increased susceptibility to stress. Hence, adolescence is a vulnerable postnatal period since short- and long-term deleterious effects of alcohol drinking and drug abuse are a serious worldwide public health concern. Among several other consequences, it has been proposed that exposure to stress, alcohol, or other drugs disrupts epigenetic mechanisms mediated by small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs). During adolescence, this modifies the expression of a variety of genes involved in neurodevelopmental processes such as proliferation, differentiation, synaptogenesis, neural plasticity, and apoptosis. Hence, the effect of miRNAs dysregulation during adolescence might contribute to a long-term impact on brain function. This systematic review focuses on the miRNA expression patterns in the adolescent rodent brain with special interest in the impact of stress and drugs such as amphetamine, cocaine, nicotine, cannabis, and ketamine. The results point to a relevant and complex role of miRNAs in the regulation of the molecular processes involved in adolescent brain development as part of a dynamic epigenetic network sensitive to environmental events with distinctive changes across adolescence. Several miRNAs have been assessed evidencing changing expression profiles during the adolescent transition which are altered by exposure to stress and drug abuse. Since this is an emerging rapidly growing field, updating the present knowledge will contribute to improving our understanding of the epigenetic regulation mechanisms involved in the neurodevelopmental changes responsible for adolescent behavior. It can be expected that increased knowledge of the molecular mechanisms mediating the effect of environmental threats during the adolescent critical developmental period will improve understanding of psychiatric and addictive disorders emerging at this stage.

AB  - In addition to its profound implications in the fight against cancer, pyroptosis have important role in the regulation of neuronal injury. Microglia are not only central members of the immune regulation of the central nervous system (CNS), but are also involved in the development and homeostatic maintenance of the nervous system. Under various pathological overstimulation, microglia pyroptosis contributes to the massive release of intracellular inflammatory mediators leading to neuroinflammation and ultimately to neuronal damages. In addition, microglia pyroptosis lead to further neurological damage by decreasing the ability to cleanse harmful substances. The pathogenic roles of microglia in a variety of CNS diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, multiple sclerosis and depression, and many other neurological disorders have been gradually unveiled. In the context of different neurological disorders, inhibition of microglia pyroptosis by targeting NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing (NLRP) 3, caspase-1 and gasdermins (GSDMs) by various chemical agents as well as natural products significantly improve the symptoms or outcome in animal models. This study will provide new ideas for immunomodulatory treatment of CNS diseases.

AB  - Background The use of distance-based interventions (DBIs) to reduce suicidal ideation and behaviours are an increasingly relevant form of intervention. DBIs are more affordable, scalable and available than traditional face-to-face interventions, helping to narrow the gap between needed and provided care. Aims To evaluate the overall effectiveness of DBIs against suicidal ideation and behaviours. Method We systematically searched Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed for all DBIs primarily aimed at reducing suicidal ideation and behaviours. Data were analysed with a robust variance estimation corrected, multi-level meta-analysis. Results We found 38 studies, reporting 110 outcomes. Effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation was low (standardised mean difference -0.174, 95% CI -0.238 to -0.110). DBIs were significantly less effective against suicidal behaviours than against suicidal ideation, although still effective (standardised mean difference -0.059, 95% CI -0.087 to -0.032). Human involvement had no significant effect on effectiveness. Conclusions Despite low effectiveness, DBIs might play a role in large-scale prevention efforts against suicidal ideation within a stepped care approach. Further, DBIs may be helpful in expanding mental health services in low- and middle-income countries with otherwise limited access to mental healthcare. Although the evidence for DBIs efficacy is well grounded, the technical and scientific evaluation of DBIs regarding their set up, functionality and components needs to be addressed in future studies.

AB  - While there is evidence for the effects of positive psychology interventions (PPIs) in the Western world, we know little about their effects on Arab cultures. This review aimed to assess the effects of PPIs on well-being and mental health across Arab countries. Systematic searches of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies investigating PPIs in Arabia were conducted in six English and Arabic databases from the inception of positive psychology in 1998 to 28 February 2022. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tools. The protocol was published in the BMJ Open. Forty-four studies from 10 Arab countries (n = 3598 participants) were included. Of these, 12 were RCTs and 32 were quasi-experimental. The studies mainly focused on adults (73%) and healthy populations (86%). PPIs included mindfulness, positive thinking, strengths, hope, optimism, self-compassion, positive traits, and multiple PPIs. Nearly all studies (91%) mentioned cultural adaptation; however, little detail was given. This is the first review in Arabia. PPIs appear to be effective for promoting well-being and reducing mental health issues. However, there were some risks of bias concerns. Future research should include younger and clinical populations, using larger samples and providing more details about adaptation.

AB  - Mitochondria are one of the essential cellular organelles. Apart from being considered as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria have been widely known to regulate redox reaction, inflammation, cell survival, cell death, metabolism, etc., and are implicated in the progression of numerous disease conditions including neurodegenerative diseases. Since brain is an energy-demanding organ, mitochondria and their functions are important for maintaining normal brain homeostasis. Alterations in mitochondrial gene expression, mutations, and epigenetic modification contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. Dysregulation of reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria and aggregation of proteins in neurons leads to alteration in mitochondria functions which further causes neuronal death and progression of neurodegeneration. Pharmacological studies have prioritized mitochondria as a possible drug target in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the present review article has been intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases mainly Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis followed by possible intervention and future treatment strategies to combat mitochondrial-mediated neurodegeneration.

AB  - Objectives Rapid cycling is a common and disabling phenomenon in individuals with bipolar disorders. In the absence of a recent literature examination, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise the evidence of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of treatments for individuals with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (RCBD). Method A systematic search was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials assigning participants with RCBD to pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological interventions. Study inclusion and data extraction were undertaken by two reviewers independently. The primary outcome was continuous within-subject RCBD illness severity before and after treatment. Pre-post random effects meta-analyses were conducted for each outcome/intervention arm studied, generating a standardised effect size (hedge's g) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of 34 articles describing 30 studies were included. A total of 16 separate pharmacological treatments were examined in contrast to 1 psychological therapy study. Only quetiapine and lamotrigine were assessed in >5 studies. By assessing 95% CI overlap of within-subject efficacy effects compared to placebo, the only interventions suggesting significant depression benefits (placebo g = 0.60) were olanzapine (with/without fluoxetine; g = 1.01), citalopram (g = 1.10) and venlafaxine (g = 2.48). For mania, benefits were indicated for quetiapine (g = 1.01), olanzapine (g = 1.19) and aripiprazole (g = 1.09), versus placebo (g = 0.33). Most of these effect sizes were from only one trial per treatment. Heterogeneity between studies was variable, and 20% were rated to have a high risk of bias. Conclusions While many interventions appeared efficacious, there was a lack of robust evidence for most treatments. Given the limited and heterogeneous evidence base, the optimal treatment strategies for people with RCBD are yet to be established.

AB  - A scoping review of systematic reviews was carried out to identify evidence of efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of universal and selective suicide prevention programs among university students worldwide. Five databases were reviewed using terms in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. The following were the inclusion criteria: systematic review or meta-analysis or meta-synthesis, suicide prevention in college students, evaluation of the efficacy, effectiveness and/or cost-effectiveness of interventions, and peer-reviewed studies. The quality of reviews was assessed. The field of study features three decades of publication in high-income countries. The strategy used, the components of the program, and the target audience to which they are delivered interfere with efficacy. In the psychoeducation strategy, the experiential and didactic components are more efficacious in the knowledge about suicide. And the motivational enhancement component promotes greater self-efficacy in suicide prevention. Programs that take a multimodal approach are effective in increasing short-term attitudes related to suicide and reducing rates of completed suicide. The gatekeeper strategy delivered to peer counselors is the most effective one in the outcomes, including short-term and long-term knowledge about suicide and its prevention and self-efficacy in suicide prevention. A greater number of evaluated studies of gatekeeper interventions were identified, indicating a trend in this research field. No review addressed the effects on subgroups that were classified based on sex, racial or sexual minorities, and special (indigenous) populations. Only one study addressed cost-effectiveness, pointing out that the psychoeducation and gatekeeper strategies have relevant net benefit rates, but the gatekeeper strategy has a higher cost-benefit ratio compared to the psychoeducation strategy. The findings indicate that psychoeducation and gatekeeper interventions tend to be more efficacious when they combine education and skills training to intervene in suicidal behavior. The components of the intervention and the target audience to which it is delivered influence efficacy. Multimodal interventions evaluate completed suicide outcomes, but require greater implementation efforts, in terms of human and financial resources and more time for the evaluation.

AB  - Objectives: We aimed to examine the association of TPH1 polymorphisms with the risk of suicide behavior (SB). Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Method: All relevant studies that evaluated the association between the A218C (rs1800532), A779C (rs1799913) and A6526G (rs4537731) polymorphisms and the susceptibility to SB published up to September 2021 were identified through a comprehensive systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO and Science Direct electronic databases. The association between TPH1 gene polymorphisms and SB was evaluated using inherence models by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses, heterogeneity analyses, and publication bias were also tested in this meta-analysis. Results: The meta-analysis for TPH1 A218C revealed an increased risk of SB in the dominant model (OR = 1.11, 95%CI 1.01-1.22). We also observed a positive association in the allelic (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 1.05-1.21), homozygous (OR = 1.22, 95%CI 1.06-1.40), heterozygous (OR = 1.21, 95%CI 1.08-1.37) and dominant (OR = 1.21, 95%CI 1.09-1.34) inherence models with the suicide attempt. Additionally, in the heterozygous (OR = 0.84, 95%CI 0.73-0.97) and dominant (OR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.68-0.91) inherence models we detected an association with completed suicide. Based on ethnicity, an association of SB in the European population also was observed (OR = 1.29, 95%CI 1.12-1.51). However, for both A779C and A6526G polymorphisms we did not find evidence of an association with SB. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that the A218C polymorphism of TPH1 gene could be a possible risk factor of SB. Future large-scale studies are required to analyze the molecular mechanisms by which affect the susceptibility of developing suicide behavior.

AB  - Living organisms constantly need to adapt to their surrounding environment and have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to deal with stress. Mitochondria and lysosomes are central organelles in the response to energy and nutrient availability within a cell and act through interconnected mechanisms. However, when such processes become overwhelmed, it can lead to pathologies. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder (NDD) characterized by proteinaceous intracellular inclusions and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, which causes motor and non-motor symptoms. Genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the disease etiology. Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been recognized as a hallmark of PD pathogenesis, and several aspects of mitochondrial biology are impaired in PD patients and models. In addition, defects of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway have extensively been observed in cell and animal models as well as PD patients' brains, where constitutive autophagy is indispensable for adaptation to stress and energy deficiency. Genetic and molecular studies have shown that the functions of mitochondria and lysosomal compartments are tightly linked and influence each other. Connections between these organelles are constituted among others by mitophagy, organellar dynamics and cellular signaling cascades, such as calcium (Ca2+) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling and the activation of transcription factors. Members of the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor family (MiT), including MITF, TFE3 and TFEB, play a central role in regulating cellular homeostasis in response to metabolic pressure and are considered master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis. As such, they are part of the interconnection between mitochondria and lysosome functions and therefore represent attractive targets for therapeutic approaches against NDD, including PD. The activation of MiT transcription factors through genetic and pharmacological approaches have shown encouraging results at ameliorating PD-related phenotypes in in vitro and in vivo models. In this review, we summarize the relationship between mitochondrial and autophagy-lysosomal functions in the context of PD etiology and focus on the role of the MiT pathway and its potential as pharmacological target against PD.

AB  - Background: Providing long-term care for a family member with psychosis can cause significant distress for informal carers due to the trauma of seeing their loved one in crisis, dealing with the difficult symptoms of psychosis and the burden of providing care. An important aspect of carers' adjustment can be construed as their personal recovery in relation to having a relative affected by psychosis. Self-report measures are increasingly used to assess personal recovery in service users, but less is known about the utility of such tools for carers. Aims: This review aimed to identify all self-report measures assessing aspects of carers' personal recovery, and to quality appraise them. Methods: Academic Search Ultimate, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and PubMed were searched for articles that reported the development of self-report measures created for carers of those with psychosis. Studies were appraised using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. A Levels of Evidence synthesis provided overall quality scores for each measure. Results: The search identified 3,154 articles for initial screening. From a total of 322 full text articles, 95 self-report measures were identified with a final 10 measures included for the quality assessment showing varying levels of psychometric rigor. Conclusions: The results show that no single self-report measure is currently available for use to comprehensively assess personal recovery for carers, highlighting the need for further research in this area and the development of a new measure.

AB  - Objective The widespread use of pesticides poses serious health hazards to farmers and their families. Some evidence shows that culturally sensitive interventions could be associated with improved outcomes; however, little is known about the effectiveness of cultural adaptations in interventions among farmers and farmworkers. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to summarize strategies used in the cultural adaptation interventions addressing the reduction of pesticide exposure in farmers and farmworkers, as well as assessing the effects of these strategies. Methods A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Clarivate Web of Science, Scopus, NIOSHTIC, Agricola, Agris, as well as reference lists to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from January 2000 until March 2022. Data were extracted to examine the characteristics of interventions in terms of the cultural adaptation strategies and their effectiveness by two independent reviewers. Results Eleven articles from ten trials met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA (n = 7) and were ranked as poor quality (n = 5). Four of the ten studies were rated moderate, and six were rated weak. The socio-cultural and constituent-involving strategies were the most commonly reported across the included studies, followed by linguistic strategy. Six studies (seven articles) were tailored for subgroups or individuals. Overall, 8 of 10 studies reported significant changes in whole and some outcomes in the intervention groups over controls. Seven studies received moderate cultural adaptation scores which may reflect the moderate effectiveness of the interventions. Conclusion Our review underscored the paucity and low quality of existing studies investigating the culturally adapted interventions in reducing farmers' and farmworkers' pesticide exposure. Future high-quality culturally sensitive studies could increase our knowledge regarding the culture's role in reducing pesticide exposure in farmers and farmworkers.

AB  - Objectives This systematic review and meta-analysis focussed on insights into the relationship between CACNA1C-rs1006737 and ZNF804A-rs1344706 polymorphisms and cognitive performance in schizophrenia (SCZ) spectrum and bipolar disorder (BD) and provide some contributions for clinical practice. Methods We searched the websites databases (PubMED, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) using eligibility and exclusion criteria to capture all potential studies, based on PICO model and according to the PRISMA. Results Eight articles were included in this systematic review (five referring to CACNA1C-rs1006737 and three related to ZNF804A-rs1344706 polymorphisms), with a total of 5759 participants (1751 SCZ patients, 348 BD patients, 3626 controls and 34 first-degree relatives). The results demonstrated that the pooled effect of CACNA1C-rs1006737 (risk difference RD = 0.08; 95% CI 0.02-0.15) was associated with altered cognitive function in patients with severe mental disorders, but not ZNF804A-rs1344706 polymorphism (RD = 0.19; 95% CI 0.09-0.48. Conclusion The present meta-analysis provides evidence regarding slight association between CACNA1C-rs1006737 polymorphisms and cognitive performance in severe mental disorders, indicating that cognitive impairment in severe mental disorders associated with the CACNA1C rs1006737 risk variants could only be expressed when interacting with environmental exposures. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42021246726.

AB  - Aim Previous research has indicated that individuals expressing high schizotypal traits and patients with Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SPD), show deficits in facial emotion recognition, compared to low schizotypal or control groups. On the other hand, non-significant findings also exist and the association of facial emotion recognition deficits with the different schizotypal dimensions is not well defined, thus limiting any conclusive outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to further clarify this relationship. Methods PsychInfo, Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed were systematically searched, and 23 papers with a cross-sectional design were selected. Nineteen studies examined individuals with high schizotypal traits and four studies evaluated SPD individuals with behavioural facial emotion recognition paradigms and self-report measures or clinical interviews for schizotypal traits. All selected studies were published between 1994 and August 2020. Results According to the evidence of studies, high schizotypal individuals and SPD patients have poorer performance in facial emotion recognition tasks. Negative schizotypy was related to lower accuracy for positive and negative emotions and faster emotion labeling while positive schizotypy was associated with worse accuracy for positive, negative and neutral emotions and more biases. Disorganized schizotypy was associated with poorer accuracy for negative emotions and suspiciousness with higher accuracy for disgust faces but lower total accuracy. Conclusions These findings are consistent with the vulnerability for schizophrenia spectrum disorders and support the idea that emotion recognition deficits are trait markers for these conditions. Thus, the effectiveness of early-intervention programmes could increase by also targeting this class of deficits.

AB  - We performed a scientometric analysis of the scientific literature on ADHD to evaluate key themes and trends over the past decades, informing future lines of research. We conducted a systematic search in Web of Science Core Collection up to 15 November, 2021 for scientific publications on ADHD. We retrieved 28,381 publications. We identified four major research trends: 1) ADHD treatment, risks factors and evidence synthesis; 2) neuro-physiology, neuropsychology and neuroimaging; 3) genetics; 4) comorbidity. In chronological order, identified clusters of themes included: tricyclic antidepressants, ADHD diagnosis/treatment, bipolar disorder, EEG, poly-morphisms, sleep, executive functions, pharmacology, genetics, environmental risk factors, emotional dysregu-lation, neuroimaging, non-pharmacological interventions, default mode network, Tourette, polygenic risk score, sluggish cognitive tempo, evidence-synthesis, toxins/chemicals, psychoneuroimmunology, Covid-19, and phys-ical exercise. In conclusion, research on ADHD over the past decades has been driven mainly by a medical model. Whereas the neurobiological correlates of ADHD are undeniable and crucial, we look forward to further research on relevant psychosocial aspects related to ADHD, such as societal pressure, the concept of neurodiversity, and stigma.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of undiagnosed cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure is alarmingly high in Asia. There is still no consensus on cognitive screening tools to detect cognitive impairment in the Asian heart failure population. The clinical implications based on our systematic review may help to improve cognitive screening practice for patients with heart failure in Asia. Methods: This review is registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42021264288). Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, we searched PubMed, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, the Web of Science, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data in English and Chinese literatures concerning heart failure and cognitive impairment. Results: The search yielded 21 eligible studies. Only in five studies, cognitive brief tests, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Mini-Cog, were used as cognitive screening tools for Asian patients with heart failure. In the rest 16 studies, brief cognitive tests were used as screening tools for global cognition. Only one study validated screening tests against a gold standard formal neuropsychological assessment test battery. Among these studies, patients with heart failure tended to perform worse than patients without heart failure. The presence of cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure is associated with poorer self-care, quality of life, and hospital readmission. Conclusion: Brief cognitive tests have been used in Asian patients with heart failure and these tests are frequently used as a measure of global cognitive function for cognitive screening. However, validating brief cognitive tests against a gold standard formal neuropsychological assessment in Asian patients with heart failure is lacking. Future studies need to address methodological issues to validate cognitive screening measures in a larger population of Asian patients with heart failure.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a complicated range of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders which can occur via genetic or non-genetic factors. Clinically, ASD is associated with problems in relationships, social interactions, and behaviors that pose many challenges for children with ASD and their families. Due to the complexity, heterogeneity, and association of symptoms with some neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD, anxiety, and sleep disorders, clinical trials have not yielded reliable results and there still remain challenges in drug discovery and development pipeline for ASD patients. One of the main steps in promoting lead compounds to the suitable drug for commercialization is preclinical animal testing, in which the efficacy and toxicity of candidate drugs are examined in vivo. In recent years, zebrafish have been able to attract the attention of many researchers in the field of neurological disorders such as ASD due to their outstanding features. The presence of orthologous genes for ASD modeling, the anatomical similarities of parts of the brain, and similar neurotransmitter systems between zebrafish and humans are some of the main reasons why scientists draw attention to zebrafish as a prominent animal model in preclinical studies to discover highly effective treatment approaches for the ASD through genetic and non-genetic modeling methods.

AB  - Background Mental health is mostly affected by numerous socioeconomic factors that need to be addressed through comprehensive strategies. The aftermath of armed conflict and natural disasters such as Ebola disease virus (EVD) outbreaks is frequently associated with poor access to mental healthcare. To design the basis of improving mental health services via the integration of mental health into primary health care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we conducted a scoping review of available literature regarding mental illness in armed conflict and EVD outbreak settings. Methods This scoping review of studies conducted in armed conflict and EVD outbreak of DRC settings synthesize the findings and suggestions related to improve the provision of mental health services. We sued the extension of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to scoping studies. A mapping of evidence related to mental disorders in the eastern part of DRC from studies identified through searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Psych Info, Google Scholar, and CINAHL). Screening and extraction of data were conducted by two reviewers independently. Results This review identified seven papers and described the findings in a narrative approach. It reveals that the burden of mental illness is consistent, although mental healthcare is not integrated into primary health care. Access to mental healthcare requires the involvement of affected communities in their problem-solving process. This review highlights the basis of the implementation of a comprehensive mental health care, through the application of mental health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) at community level. Lastly, it calls for further implementation research perspectives on the integration of mental healthcare into the health system of areas affecting by civil instability and natural disasters. Conclusion This paper acknowledges poor implementation of community mental health services into primary health care in regions affected by armed conflict and natural disasters. All relevant stakeholders involved in the provision of mental health services should need to rethink to implementation of mhGAP into the emergency response against outbreaks and natural disasters.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study is to observe the effect of combination of lithium and lamotrigine in treatment of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder (RCBD).
   Method: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library in English and CBM, CNKI, WANFANG, and CSSCI in Chinese to find literature from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2020 related to the combination of lithium carbonate and lamotrigine for treatment of RCBD.
   Results: Five comparison studies with 265 subjects of 131 cases in a study group and 134 cases in a control group met the inclusion criteria and were included for the final meta-analysis. The comprehensive analysis shows that the study group had a significant lower score in mental symptoms than the control group (Z = 2.34, P = 0.02) with a random model (X-2 = 33.02, df = 7, P < 0.01). However, the differences were only shown in PANSS (Z = 5.18, P < 0.01) and BPRS (Z = 3.08, P < 0.01). There was no difference in response rate (54.9 vs. 45.7%; OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 0.79 similar to 2.73; Z = 1.21, P > 0.05,) and remission rate (47.9 vs. 45.9%; OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.49 similar to 2.25; Z = 0.13, P > 0.05,) found between the two groups. The response rate of lamotrigine and lithium combination was significantly higher compare to that of monotherapy of lithium in patients with no treatment resistant (82 vs. 54%; OR = 4.26; 95% CI: 1.65 similar to 10.99; Z = 3.99, P < 0.01) with the fixed effect model (X-2 = 0.89, df = 1, P > 0.05, I-2 = 0%).
   Conclusion: The combination of lithium and lamotrigine resulted in better improvement of psychotic symptoms and higher response rate in patients with RCBP with no treatment resistant.

AB  - Purpose of Review We reviewed recent evidence on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the geriatric population. This review looked at the literature on depression, for which there is a breadth of data, as well as other conditions that have historically not been as well studied, as well as attempting to provide practical recommendations for ECT practitioners. This review also examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ECT in the elderly. Recent Findings ECT shows robust efficacy across many psychiatric diseases, from depression and bipolar disorder to psychosis and catatonia. It has also shown positive results at improving behavioral symptoms of dementia, as well as improving motor symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease. It is routinely found to be a safe treatment as well, generally with only minimal transient side effects. Summary ECT should not be considered a "last-resort" treatment for geriatric patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. It has historical and recent literature supporting its use in many psychiatric disorders and has been shown to be safe with minimal side effects when appropriate considerations are taken for the elderly population.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global health crisis that has negatively impacted the mental health and wellbeing of the population. A large amount of scientific literature has emerged since 2019, but none of these studies have focused on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on smoking consumption. We aimed to analyse the changes in smoking consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic through longitudinal studies. This systematic review follows the PRISMA Statement. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021282235). MEDLINE, ERIC, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to 24 October 2021. We completed an extensive assessment of all prospective cohort studies that aimed to explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco consumption habits. According to the PICOS's acronym, we included all population (P) types and studies developed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (I) with a change in nicotine consumption as the outcome (O), as well as prospective cohort studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. The results showed that 14 cohorts reported in 11 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 58,052 participants were included in the review. Most of the studies pointed out a reduction in the number of cigarettes and e-cigarettes consumed from baseline (before the pandemic) to follow-up (during the pandemic). Only two studies reported an increase in cigarette or e-cigarette consumption from baseline to follow-up. The majority of studies presented a low risk of bias. In conclusion, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behavior is complex and uncertain. The decrease in smoking consumption during the pandemic could be related to the fear of becoming infected by COVID-19, the advancement of COVID-19, and the reduction in social gatherings. In several cases, the increases in nicotine consumption can be explained by psychological distress. These findings can be used to create strategies to prevent relapses during the post-vaccination phases of the pandemic.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology is the most common motor neurodegenerative disease that occurs due to the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain. The histopathological hallmark of the disease is fibrillary aggregate called Lewy bodies which majorly contain alpha-synuclein, suggesting the critical implication of diminished protein degradation mechanisms in disease pathogenesis. This alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies are evident in both experimental models as well as in postmortem PD brain and are speculated to be pathogenic but still, the lineal association between these aggregates and the complexity of disease pathology is not yet well established and needs further attention. However, it has been reported that alpha-synuclein aggregates have consorted with the declined proteasome and lysosome activities. Therefore, in this review, we reappraise intracellular protein degradation mechanisms during PD pathology. This article focused on the findings of the last two decades suggesting the implications of protein degradation mechanisms in disease pathogenesis and based on shreds of evidence, some of the approaches are also suggested which may be adopted to find out the novel therapeutic targets for the management of PD patients.

AB  - The current coral reefs crisis is motivating a number of innovative projects attempting to leverage new mechanisms to avoid coral bleaching, reduce coral mortality and restore damaged reefs. Shading the reef, through seawater atomised fogging, is one tool in development to reduce levels of irradiance and temperature. To evaluate the potential viability of this concept, here we review 91 years (1930-2021) of published research looking at the effects of different levels of shade and light on coral reefs. We summarised the types of studies, places, coral species used, common responses variable measured, and types of shades used among studies. We discuss issues related to reef scale shading applicability, different methods used to measure light, standardisation methods and most importantly the positive and negative effects of shading corals.

AB  - Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows the combination of evidence on the effectiveness of several interventions. NMA has mainly been applied in the medical science field, whereas in the domain of psychology and educational sciences its use is less frequent. Consequently, systematic reviews that describe the characteristics of published NMAs are limited to the field of medicine, and nothing is known about the characteristics of NMAs published in the psychology and educational sciences field. However, this information is still relevant for the design of future simulation studies and for detecting good and bad research practices. Thus, this study describes the features of the meta-analytic datasets of NMAs published in the field of psychology and educational sciences, as well as their methodological characteristics, and compares them to those observed in the medical domain. Results show that the number of studies included is larger in NMAs from psychology and educational sciences, the most commonly used effect size is the standardized mean difference (unlike the odds ratio in medicine), the sample size is smaller, more intervention groups are included, and inconsistent effects are observed more often. These results can be used in future simulation studies to generate realistic datasets. Finally, we warn about the poor quality of reporting of some technical aspects of the NMA, such as the statistical model used.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the oldest and most effective forms of neurostimulation, wherein electrical current is used to elicit brief, generalized seizures under general anesthesia. When electrodes are positioned to target frontotemporal cortex, ECT is arguably the most effective treatment for severe major depression, with response rates and times superior to other available antidepressant therapies. Neuroimaging research has been pivotal in improving the field's mechanistic understanding of ECT, with a growing number of magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrating hippocampal plasticity after ECT, in line with evidence of upregulated neurotrophic processes in the hippocampus in animal models. However, the precise roles of the hippocampus and other brain regions in antidepressant response to ECT remain unclear. Seizure physiology may also play a role in antidepressant response to ECT, as indicated by early positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and electro-encephalography research and corroborated by recent magnetic resonance imaging studies. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting neuroplasticity in the hippocampus and other brain regions during and after ECT, and their associations with antidepressant response. We also offer a mechanistic, circuit-level model that proposes that core mechanisms of antidepressant response to ECT involve thalamocortical and cerebellar networks that are active during seizure generalization and termination over repeated ECT sessions, and their interactions with corticolimbic circuits that are dysfunctional prior to treatment and targeted with the electrical stimulus.

In particular, we selected and analyzed papers on emotion recognition and processing, Theory of Mind (TOM), empathy, and other facets of social cognition as decision making. We identified 16 papers published between 2012 and 2022 which meet inclusion criteria. Papers search, selection, and extraction followed the PRISMA guidelines. In order to summarize data from papers, we used a narrative synthesis approach. Results show different evidence of impairment in social cognition domains in adults with ADHD. Our systematic review suggests the importance of promoting more research on this topic because it is essential to keep in mind that social cognition plays a central role in socialization and social relationships.

AB  - Background Evidence on the impact of the pandemic on healthcare presentations for self-harm has accumulated rapidly. However, existing reviews do not include studies published beyond 2020. Aims To systematically review evidence on presentations to health services following self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A comprehensive search of databases (WHO COVID-19 database; Medline; medRxiv; Scopus; PsyRxiv; SocArXiv; bioRxiv; COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, PubMed) was conducted. Studies published from 1 January 2020 to 7 September 2021 were included. Study quality was assessed with a critical appraisal tool. Results Fifty-one studies were included: 57% (29/51) were rated as 'low' quality, 31% (16/51) as 'moderate' and 12% (6/51) as 'high-moderate'. Most evidence (84%, 43/51) was from high-income countries. A total of 47% (24/51) of studies reported reductions in presentation frequency, including all six rated as high-moderate quality, which reported reductions of 17-56%. Settings treating higher lethality self-harm were overrepresented among studies reporting increased demand. Two of the three higher-quality studies including study observation months from 2021 reported reductions in self-harm presentations. Evidence from 2021 suggests increased numbers of presentations among adolescents, particularly girls. Conclusions Sustained reductions in numbers of self-harm presentations were seen into the first half of 2021, although this evidence is based on a relatively small number of higher-quality studies. Evidence from low- and middle-income countries is lacking. Increased numbers of presentations among adolescents, particularly girls, into 2021 is concerning. Findings may reflect changes in thresholds for help-seeking, use of alternative sources of support and variable effects of the pandemic across groups.

AB  - Motivation for bodily movement, physical activity and exercise varies from moment to moment. These motivation states may be "affectively-charged," ranging from instances of lower tension (e.g., desires, wants) to higher tension (e.g., cravings and urges). Currently, it is not known how often these states have been investigated in clinical populations (e.g., eating disorders, exercise dependence/addiction, Restless Legs Syndrome, diabetes, obesity) vs. healthy populations (e.g., in studies of motor control; groove in music psychology). The objective of this scoping review protocol is to quantify the literature on motivation states, to determine what topical areas are represented in investigations of clinical and healthy populations, and to discover pertinent details, such as instrumentation, terminology, theories, and conceptual models, correlates and mechanisms of action. Iterative searches of scholarly databases will take place to determine which combination of search terms (e.g., "motivation states" and "physical activity"; "desire to be physically active," etc.) captures the greatest number of relevant results. Studies will be included if motivation states for movement (e.g., desires, urges) are specifically measured or addressed. Studies will be excluded if referring to motivation as a trait. A charting data form was developed to scan all relevant documents for later data extraction. The primary outcome is simply the extent of the literature on the topic. Results will be stratified by population/condition. This scoping review will unify a diverse literature, which may result in the creation of unique models or paradigms that can be utilized to better understand motivation for bodily movement and exercise.

AB  - Multiple stressors, threaten bee health, a major one being pesticides. Bees are simultaneously exposed to multiple pesticides that can cause both lethal and sublethal effects. Risk assessment and most research on bee health, however, focus on lethal individual effects. Here, we performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis that summa-rizes and re-interprets the available qualitative and quantitative information on lethal, sublethal, and combined toxicity of a comprehensive range of pesticides on bees. We provide results (1970-2019) for multiple bee species (Bombus, Osmia, Megachile, Melipona, Partamona, Scaptotrigona), although most works focused on Apis mellifera L. (78 %). We provided harmonised results on the lethal toxicity of pesticides in bees (n = 377 pesticides) and documented the types of sublethal testing methods and related effects that cause a sublethal effect (n = 375 sublethal experiments). We identified the most common combinations of pesticides and mode of actions tested, and summarize the experimental methods, magnitude of the interactions, and robustness of available data (n = 361 experiments). We provide open access searchable, comprehensive, and integrated list of pesticides and their levels causing lethal, suble-thal, and combined effects. We report major data gaps related to pesticide's sublethal (71 %) and combined (e.g.,-99 %) toxicity. We identified pesticides and mode of actions of greatest concern in terms of sublethal (chlorothalonil, pymetrozine, glyphosate; neonicotinoids) and combined (tau-fluvalinate combinations; acetylcholinesterase inhibi-tors and neonicotinoids) effects. Although certain pesticides have faced regulatory restrictions in specific countries (chlorothalonil, pymetrozine, neonicotinoids), most are still widely used worldwide (e.g., glyphosate). This work aims at facilitating the implementation of more comprehensive and harmonised research and risk assessments, consid-ering sublethal and combined effects. To ensure safeguarding pollinators and the environment, we advocate for a more refined and holistic assessment that do not only focus on lethality but uses harmonised methods to test sublethal and relevant combinations.

AB  - Background: The association between belonging to a disadvantaged socio-economic status or social class and health outcomes has been consistently documented during recent decades. However, a meta-analysis quantifying the association between belonging to a lower social class and the risk of dementia has yet to be performed. In the present work, we sought to summarise the results of prospective, longitudinal studies on this topic. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective, longitudinal studies measuring the association between indicators of social class and the risk of all-cause/Alzheimer's dementia. The search was conducted in four databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science and PsychInfo). Inclusion criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis were: (a) longitudinal prospective study, (b) aged > 60 years at baseline, (c) issued from the general population, (d) no dementia at baseline and (e) mention of social class as exposure. Exclusion criteria were: (a) study of rare dementia types (e.g. frontotemporal dementia), (b) abstract-only papers and (c) articles without full text available. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies. We calculated the overall pooled relative risk of dementia for different social class indicators, both crude and adjusted for sex, age and the year of the cohort start. Results: Out of 4548 screened abstracts, 15 were included in the final analysis (76,561 participants, mean follow-up 6.7 years (2.4-25 years), mean age at baseline 75.1 years (70.6-82.1 years), mean percentage of women 58%). Social class was operationalised as levels of education, occupational class, income level, neighbourhood disadvantage and wealth. Education (relative risk (RR)=2.48; confidence interval (CI) 1.71-3.59) and occupational class (RR=2.09; CI 1.18-3.69) but not income (RR=1.28; CI 0.81-2.04) were significantly associated with the risk of dementia in the adjusted model. Some of the limitations of this study are the inclusion of studies predominantly conducted in high-income countries and the exclusion of social mobility in our analysis. Conclusions: We conclude that there is a significant association between belonging to a social class and the risk of dementia, with education and occupation being the most relevant indicators of social class regarding this risk. Studying the relationship between belonging to a disadvantaged social class and dementia risk might be a fruitful path to diminishing the incidence of dementia over time. However, a narrow operationalisation of social class that only includes education, occupation and income may reduce the potential for such studies to inform social policies.

AB  - Introduction Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is suggested to be neuroprotective. However, influence of Dex on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in the elderly remains unknown. Methods We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of Dex on POCD. Relevant studies were obtained by search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane's Library databases. A random-effect model was used to pool the results. Results Fourteen RCTs including 1626 adults of 60 years or older who received surgery with general anesthesia were included. Because methodologically diverse scales were used for POCD, eight RCTs with POCD diagnosed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were included in the meta-analysis, while the remaining six RCTs with POCD diagnosed with other scales were qualitative synthesized. Pooled results of RCTs with MMSE showed that Dex significantly reduced the incidence of POCD (risk ratio: 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.60, p < 0.001) with no significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 0%) or publication bias (p for Egger's regression test = 0.579). For the remaining six RCTs with POCD diagnosed with other scales, three of them showed that Dex was associated with a significantly lower incidence of POCD, while the other three RCTs did not show a significant difference. Conclusions Dex is associated with a reduced risk of POCD in elderly patients receiving surgeries with general anesthesia, and the results were mainly obtained in studies with POCD diagnosed with MMSE. Based on these findings, Dex may be considered as a preventative measure for POCD in elderly patients.

AB  - Background: Accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation (aTMS) is an emerging delivery schedule of repetitive TMS (rTMS). TMS is "accelerated " by applying two or more stimulation sessions within a day. This three-part review comprehensively reports the safety/tolerability, efficacy, and stimulation parameters affecting response across disorders. Methods: We used the PubMed database to identify studies administering aTMS, which we defined as applying at least two rTMS sessions within one day. Results: Our targeted literature search identified 85 aTMS studies across 18 diagnostic and healthy control groups published from July 2001 to June 2022. Excluding overlapping populations, 63 studies delivered 43,873 aTMS sessions using low frequency, high frequency, and theta burst stimulation in 1543 participants. Regarding safety, aTMS studies had similar seizure and side effect incidence rates to those reported for once daily rTMS. One seizure was reported from aTMS (0.0023% of aTMS sessions, compared with 0.0075% in once daily rTMS). The most common side effects were acute headache (28.4%), fatigue (8.6%), and scalp discomfort (8.3%), with all others under 5%. We evaluated aTMS efficacy in 23 depression studies (the condition with the most studies), finding an average response rate of 42.4% and remission rate of 28.4% (range = 0-90.5% for both). Regarding parameters, aTMS studies ranged from 2 to 10 sessions per day over 2-30 treatment days, 10-640 min between sessions, and a total of 9-104 total accelerated TMS sessions per participant (including tapering sessions). Qualitatively, response rate tends to be higher with an increasing number of sessions per day, total sessions, and total pulses. Discussion: The literature to date suggests that aTMS is safe and well-tolerated across conditions. Taken together, these early studies suggest potential effectiveness even in highly treatment refractory conditions with the added potential to reduce patient burden while also expediting response time. Future studies are warranted to sys-tematically investigate how key aTMS parameters affect treatment outcome and durability.

AB  - Introduction: Childhood maltreatment is associated with pregnancy complications. This study aimed to system-atically review and quantitatively synthesize the strength of the associations between maternal histories of childhood maltreatment and the risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and gestational diabetes. Methods: Subject Headings and keywords for childhood maltreatment and the pregnancy outcomes were searched in MEDLINE (Ovid; 1946-Present), PsycINFO (Ovid; 1806-Present), and Web of Science Core Collection. Original studies or dissertations that reported quantitative associations between childhood maltreatment and any of the pregnancy outcomes of interest were included. Two independent reviewers selected the pertinent studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. Pooled effect sizes were calculated for the three outcomes. Results: Twenty-eight studies were reviewed and 22 were meta-analysed. Maternal childhood maltreatment was associated with preterm birth (OR = 1.27 95% CI: 1.06-1.52, p = 0.001), low birth weight (OR = 1.42 95% CI: 1.10-1.83, p = 0.001), and gestational diabetes (RR = 1.37 95% CI: 1.02-1.83, p = 0.030), however high levels of heterogeneity were found. Findings were insignificant for studies examining gestational age and birth weight as continuous variables. Discussion: Findings confirm that under certain conditions, childhood maltreatment is associated with pregnancy outcomes. Future research should prioritize mediation and moderation models to clarify the mechanisms un-derlying these relationships. Trauma-informed care is needed to tailor the appropriate care for expecting mothers.

AB  - Occupational health has evolved as a field over the last 20 years, most significantly over the last 2 years. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the amount and complexity of challenges for occupational health professionals and at the same time provided a unique opportunity for the field in light of the heightened focus on health at the workplace. Responsibilities have become broader and more multi-faceted including areas such as mental wellbeing and psychosocial risk factors. The pandemic has shown us that the workplace is an essential setting to promote health with a growing number of employers investing in policies and programs for their employees. However, many global health campaigns and large scale national initiatives do not include the workplace setting in their strategy to the detriment of the their effectiveness. In addition to the pressing global health needs, two recent developments have propelled workplace health to the forefront and are asking questions of employers. The Sustainable Development Goals as well as the ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) agenda on behalf of the financial sector are pushing the corporate sector to act responsibly beyond seeking profits and disclose related policies and actions. Healthy workplaces are essential for global development and progress.

This study aimed to analyze the scientific evidence on barriers and facilitators perceived by stakeholders on the implementation of PA in PHC.The search databases consisted of Web of Science, Medline, Scopus, and Lilacs. Two independent researchers reviewed the eligibility criteria and extracted and coded the information according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research was used to report the quality of the included studies. We analyzed 8.471 studies but included only 16. The studies identified 54 different reports on barriers and 48 on facilitators. Reports were often identified in the "environ-mental context and resources" domain, with 27 reports on barriers and 27 on facilitators. We found 25 reports of barriers and 16 of facilitators in the TDF domains that demonstrate professional profile characteristics. The low expectations in the professional profile for the implementation can influence the context and the organizational climate to identify more barriers than facilitators.

AB  - Up to 50% of most mammalian genomes are made up of transposable elements (TEs) that have the potential to mobilize around the genome. Despite this prevalence, research on TEs is only beginning to gain traction within the field of neuroscience. While TEs have long been regarded as "junk" or parasitic DNA, it has become evident that they are adaptive DNA and RNA regulatory elements. In addition to their vital role in normal development, TEs can also interact with steroid receptors, which are key elements to sexual development. In this review, we provide an overview of the involvement of TEs in processes related to sexual development- from TE activity in the germline to TE accumulation in sex chromosomes. Moreover, we highlight sex differences in TE activity and their regulation of genes related to sexual development. Finally, we speculate on the epigenetic mechanisms that may govern TEs' role in sexual development. In this context, we emphasize the need to further the understanding of sexual development through the lens of TEs including in a variety of organs at different developmental stages, their molecular networks, and evolution.

AB  - Background: Cannabis is the most frequently consumed drug around the world. Its use has been associated with increased suicide behaviors; nonetheless, the association of cannabis smoking and suicide behaviors in adoles-cents has not yet been established. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the risk of suicide attempt, suicidal ideation or suicide planning in individuals of 11-21 years of age who smoke cannabis. Methods: We performed an online searched using PubMed, EBSCO and Science Direct databases, up to July 2021. We calculated odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the association between suicide attempt, suicidal ideation or suicide planning and cannabis smoking in individuals of 11-21 years of age. Results: Twenty studies reported suicide attempts in 34,859 young individuals, suicidal ideation in 26, 937 in-dividuals, and suicide planning in 9054 young individuals. We found an increased risk of suicide attempt in cannabis smokers than in non-cannabis users (OR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.78-3.05; Z p value; < 0.0001; I-2 = 97.12%), as well as a significant association between cannabis smoking and suicidal ideation (OR: 2.04; 95%CI: 1.64-2.53; Z p value: < 0.001; I-2: 94.88) and suicide planning (OR: 1.674; 95% CI: 1.554-1.804; Z p value: 0.000; I-2: 92.609). Subgroup analyses showed that American teens have an increased risk of suicidal ideation; the meta-regression analysis revealed that age was negatively associated with the risk of suicide attempt.<br />Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows that cannabis smoking increased the risk of suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and suicide planning in young individuals of 11-21 years of age. The high risk of suicide behaviors could vary depending on the population studied; therefore, more studies are necessary to corroborate the risk of presenting suicide behaviors in individuals of 11-21 years of age who smoke cannabis.

To further explain this relationship and explore the gap in research, this paper will appraise the available evidence regarding the relationship digital technology use and psychological/emotional outcomes and report on the strength of the associations observed between these variables. Methodology: To select relevant studies, five separate computerized searches of online and electronic databases were performed. These included PubMed (MEDLINE, National Library of Medicine), ScienceDirect, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science to attain literature from January 2017 to April 2022. The author independently reviewed studies for eligibility as per the inclusion/exclusion criteria and extracted the data according to a priori defined criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for healthcare studies and Cochrane Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) assessment tool. Results: Seven studies were included in this review. A positive relationship was found between excessive digital technology usage and negative psychological and emotional outcomes in digitods aged 14-18 (p <= 0.005). A statistically significant difference was found between girls and boys, with girls experiencing more negative outcomes than boys. Conclusions: As the evidence in this review is distinctive, it is imperative that further research be conducted to investigate any synergistic relationships among these variables on a larger scale in order to better advise public health initiatives to specifically target heightened digital technology usage in adolescents.

AB  - Background Afghanistan, Colombia and Myanmar are the world's leading heroin and cocaine producers and have also experienced prolonged periods of armed conflict. The link between armed conflict and drug markets is well established but how conflict impacts on the health and social determinants of people who use drugs is less clear. The aim was to investigate health outcomes and associated factors among people who use illicit drugs in Afghanistan, Colombia and Myanmar. Methods We conducted a systematic review searching Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Global Health databases using terms relating to Afghanistan, Colombia and Myanmar; illicit drug use (all modes of drug administration); health and influencing factors. Quality assessment was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale and papers were analysed narratively. Results 35 studies were included in Afghanistan (n = 15), Colombia (n = 9) and Myanmar (n = 11). Health outcomes focused predominantly on HIV, Hepatitis C (HCV), Hepatitis B and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with one study looking at human rights violations (defined as maltreatment, abuse and gender inequality). Drug use was predominantly injection of heroin, often alongside use of amphetamines (Myanmar), cocaine and cocaine-based derivatives (Colombia). Only one study measured the effect of a period of conflict suggesting this was linked to increased reporting of symptoms of STIs and sharing of needles/syringes among people who inject drugs. Findings show high levels of external and internal migration, alongside low-income and unemployment across the samples. External displacement was linked to injecting drugs and reduced access to needle/syringe programmes in Afghanistan, while initiation into injecting abroad was associated with increased risk of HCV infection. Few studies focused on gender-based differences or recruited women. Living in more impoverished rural areas was associated with increased risk of HIV infection. Conclusions More research is needed to understand the impact of armed-conflict and drug production on the health of people who use drugs. The immediate scale-up of harm reduction services in these countries is imperative to minimize transmission of HIV/HCV and address harms associated with amphetamine use and other linked health and social care needs that people who use drugs may face.

AB  - Modern society needs people to be equipped with 21st century skills (e.g., critical thinking, creativity, communication, digital literacy, or collaboration skills). For this reason, teaching and learning nowadays should promote not only students' knowledge acquisition in various learning contexts but also their 21st century skills, and language learning context is no exception. This study reviewed research on technology-supported language learning and 21st century skills. The reason is that earlier studies reviewed only articles related to language learning supported by technology and mostly focused on languages, language skills and technologies used. That is to say, 21st century skills were not considered in earlier review studies. The present study selected and reviewed 34 articles published between 2011 and 2022 (February) and focused on the following dimensions: (1) research focus such as language skills and 21st century skills; (2) theoretical foundations; (3) technologies; (4) learning activities; (5) methodology; and (6) findings. The present research found that reviewed studies had focused most frequently on such language skills as speaking and writing and on such 21st century skills as communication and collaboration. The social constructivism theory was often used by scholars to base their studies on. Facebook, Google Docs, and Moodle were popular technologies in reviewed studies to facilitate language and 21st century skills. Scholars in reviewed studies reported that technology-supported language learning activities provided learners with good learning experiences and enhanced their learning motivation, engagement, and confidence. However, some challenges that learners faced during learning activities were also reported. Based on the results of the review, this study made several recommendations for stakeholders such as educators and researchers in the field.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have provided varying prevalence estimates of trichotillomania (TTM) and other hair -pulling behaviors. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide data-driven prevalence es-timates of TTM and hair-pulling. PubMed, PsycInfo and Embase were searched on June 2020 (updated in November 2021). Studies reporting the frequency of TTM defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria or hair-pulling behaviors were included. Prevalence data was extracted for both gen-ders, and female-to-male odds ratios (OR) were computed for TTM and any hair-pulling behaviors. Data were pooled through random-effects meta-analyses. Of the 713 records identified through database searches, 30 studies involving 38,526 participants were included. Meta-analyses indicated TTM had a prevalence of 1.14% (95% CI 0.66%, 1.96%), while any hair-pulling behavior had a prevalence of 8.84% (95% CI 6.33%, 12.20%). Meta-analyses demonstrated females were at an increased risk of any hair-pulling when noticeable hair loss was required (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.60, 3.10, p < 0.0001), but not of any hair-pulling when noticeable hair loss was not required (OR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.72, 1.64, p = 0.33). Meta-analyses did not indicate female preponderance in TTM (k = 10; N = 22,775; OR = 1.29; 95% CI 0.91, 1.83; I2 = 28%, p = 0.15), although there was considerable heterogeneity across studies. This study demonstrates that TTM impacts-1% of the population, while general hair-pulling behaviors affects-8%, highlighting the significant public health impact of this understudied con-dition. Additional research should clarify the gender distribution of TTM in epidemiological samples.

AB  - As a significant health challenge, chronic disease can have critical spiritual consequences for patients. Therefore, the study of spiritual well-being as an aspect of health is essential but has been less considered with regard to chronic diseases. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to investigate spiritual well-being in patients with chronic diseases. For this purpose, in the initial search that was performed of valid databases, a total of 615 descriptive studies published between 2000 and 2018 were found. After carefully assessing these, only 24 studies were included in the review. Overall, the spiritual well-being of 3289 patients with chronic disease was investigated. This study showed that the total mean score of the spiritual well-being of patients with chronic diseases was 86.65 (P < 0.001, 95%, CI: 80.34-92.96), indicating a moderate level of spiritual well-being in these patients. Thus, patients with chronic diseases are recommended to consider spiritual consultation programs.

AB  - Elevated responsiveness to verbal suggestions is hypothesized to represent a predisposing factor for the dissociative disorders (DDs) and related conditions. However, the magnitude of this effect has not been estimated in these populations nor has the potential moderating influence of methodological limitations on effect size variability across studies. This study assessed whether patients with DDs, trauma- and stressor-related disorders (TSDs), and functional neurological disorder (FND) display elevated hypnotic suggestibility. A systematic literature search identified 20 datasets. A random-effects meta-analysis revealed that patients displayed greater hypnotic suggestibility than controls, Hedges's g = 0.92 [0.66, 1.18]. This effect was observed in all subgroups but was most pronounced in the DDs. Although there was some evidence for publication bias, a bias-corrected estimate of the group effect remained significant, g = 0.57 [0.30, 0.85]. Moderation analyses did not yield evidence for a link between effect sizes and methodological limitations. These results demonstrate that DDs and related conditions are characterized by elevated hypnotic suggestibility and have implications for the mechanisms, risk factors, and treatment of dissociative psychopathology.

AB  - Background: Preliminary data suggest that patients with COVID-19 may experience psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the concurrence of new-onset psychosis or exacerbation of clinically stable psychosis through case reports and case series. Methods: Six databases were searched, followed by an electronic and manual search of the relevant articles. Studies were identified using predetermined eligibility criteria. We evaluated the demographic characteristics, clinical history, course of illness, management, and prognosis of the patients in these studies. Results: Case reports and case series, altogether consisting of 57 unique cases were included. The mean patient age for onset of psychotic symptoms was 43.4 years for men and 40.3 years for women. About 69% of patients had no prior history of psychiatric disorders. Most patients had mild COVID-19-related symptoms, with only 15 (26.3%) presenting with moderate to severe COVID-19-related disease and complications. The most commonly reported psychotic symptoms were delusions and hallucinations. Patients with psychotic symptoms were treated with antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, valproic acid, and electroconvulsive treatment. In 36 cases, psychotic symptoms resolved completely or improved significantly. Ten cases had partial improvement with residual psychotic symptoms, and one patient died due to cardiac arrest. Conclusion: Most patients responded to a low-to-moderate dose of antipsychotics with a quick recovery. However, the residual psychiatric symptoms highlight the need for careful monitoring and longer follow-up. Clinicians should be mindful of the occurrence of psychosis due to COVID-19 infection in a subset of COVID-19 patients that can be misdiagnosed as a psychotic disorder alone.

AB  - Climate change directly impacts the foraging opportunities of cetaceans (e.g. lower prey availability), leads to habitat loss, and forces cetaceans to move to other feeding grounds. The rise in ocean temperature, low prey availability and loss of habitat can have severe consequences for cetacean survival, particularly those species that are already threatened or those with a limited habitat range. In addition, it is predicted that the concentration of contaminants in aquatic environments will increase owing to Arctic meltwater and increased rainfall events leading to higher rates of land-based runoff in downstream coastal areas. These persistent and mobile contaminants can bioaccumulate in the ecosystem, and lead to ecotoxicity with potentially severe consequences on the reproductive organs, immune system and metabolism of marine mammals. There is a need to measure and assess the cumulative impact of multiple stressors, given that climate change, habitat alteration, low prey availability and contaminants do not act in isolation. Human-caused perturbations to cetacean foraging abilities are becoming a pervasive and prevalent threat to many cetacean species on top of climate change-associated stressors. We need to move to a greater understanding of how multiple stressors impact the metabolism of cetaceans and ultimately their population trajectory.This article is part of the theme issue 'Nurturing resilient marine ecosystems'.

AB  - Pesticides have been used in agriculture, public health programs, and pharmaceuticals for many decades. Though pesticides primarily target pests by affecting their nervous system and causing other lethal effects, these chemical entities also exert toxic effects in inadvertently exposed humans through inhalation or ingestion. Mounting pieces of evidence from cellular, animal, and clinical studies indicate that pesticide-exposed models display metabolite alterations of pathways involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, identifying common key metabolites/metabolic pathways between pesticide-induced metabolic reprogramming and neurodegenerative diseases is necessary to understand the etiology of pesticides in the rise of neurodegenerative disorders. The present review provides an overview of specific metabolic pathways, including tryptophan metabolism, glutathione metabolism, dopamine metabolism, energy metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, fatty acids, and lipid metabolism that are specifically altered in response to pesticides. Furthermore, we discuss how these metabolite alterations are linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and to identify novel biomarkers for targeted therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The increasing social and economic burdens of neurological disorders are driven by global population growth and aging. Depression is a common psychiatric symptom in numerous neurological disorders. It is also a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. The rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine for severe depression was accidentally discovered. Interest-ingly, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than (S)-ketamine in ro-dents. Importantly, its side effects in rodents and humans are lower than those of (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Furthermore, (R)-ketamine could elicit beneficial actions in various rodent models of neurological disorders, including PD, multiple sclerosis (MS), and stroke. In this article, we review the potential of (R)-ke-tamine as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for neurological disorders including AD and other dementias, PD, MS, and stroke.

AB  - Background: It has been suggested that the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with particularly stigmatizing connotations, particularly among mental health professionals. The goal of this study was to synthesize quantitative studies investigating the attitudes and responses of clinicians to BPD and to appraise the methodological quality of these studies. Methods: A systematic search was carried out using MEDLINE Complete, CINAHL Complete, PsychoINFO, PsychARTICLES, Scopus, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Academic Search Complete. Study quality was rated using an adapted tool. Results: This review included 37 papers involving an estimated 8196 participants: 21 cross-sectional survey studies, 5 studies assessing training workshops, 5 studies assessing countertransference, and 6 experimental studies. The methodological quality of the studies was mixed, with many differing measures with questionable validity used. Conclusions: Negative attitudes toward BPD continue to be a problem to differing degrees among clinical staff. Although this issue is most prominent among psychiatric nurses, the results of this review highlight evidence of negative attitudes across all mental health professions as well as potentially in professionals working in physical health settings. Various clinician-level factors may play a role in the development and maintenance of such attitudes. Greater exposure to patients with BPD and attendance at training programs have been found to be associated with improved attitudes. Professionals require regular training concerning BPD that is sufficiently evidence-based.

AB  - Young people experience high rates of suicidal ideation, self-harm, suicide attempt and death due to suicide. As a result of increasing globalisation, young people are increasingly mobile and can migrate from one country to another seeking educational and employment opportunities. With a growing number of young migrants, it is important to understand the prevalence of suicidal behaviour among this population group. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception until 31 March 2022. Eligible studies were those providing data on suicidal ideation, self-harm, suicide attempt, and death due to suicide. Seventeen studies were included in the review, some of which provided data on multiple outcomes of interest. Twelve studies provided data on suicidal ideation, five provided data on self-harm, eight provided data on suicide attempt, and one study had data on suicide death among young migrants. The quality of the included studies was varied and limited. The studies included in this review commonly reported that young migrants experience higher rates of self-harm and suicide attempt, but no major differences in suicidal ideation and suicide death compared to non-migrant young people. However, the limited number of studies focused on suicidal behaviour among young migrants highlights the need for further high-quality studies to capture accurate information. This will enable the development of policies and interventions that reduce the risk of suicidal behaviour among young migrants.

AB  - Simple Summary Environmental stresses are one of the biggest threats to modern agriculture, and climate change has heightened the risks of these stresses in different parts of the world. Among all the environmental stresses, salinity and drought are a severe threat to arid and semi-arid regions of the world, and for a long time, scientists have been searching for ways to reduce the risk of these stresses. In recent decades, solutions have been developed to reduce the risk of environmental stress on plants by identifying beneficial soil microorganisms. This study was conducted to identify morphophysiological and molecular changes of plants in coexistence with Serendipita indica and their impact on drought and salinity stress reduction. The study also has investigated the stressors' impact on plants and the plants' mechanisms to cope with them; Furthermore, sharing results with researchers provides a clear path for future research. Plant stress is one of the biggest threats to crops, causing irreparable damage to farmers' incomes; Therefore, finding suitable, affordable, and practical solutions will help the agricultural economy and prevent the loss of millions of tons of agricultural products. Scientists have taken significant steps toward improving farm productivity in the last few decades by discovering how beneficial soil microorganisms enhance plant resistance to environmental stresses. Among these microorganisms is Serendipita indica, which the benefits of coexisting this fungus with plant roots have been extensively explored in recent years. By investigating fungus specification and its effects on plants' morphological, physiological, and molecular traits, the present study seeks to understand how Serendipita indica affects plant resistance to salinity and drought conditions. Furthermore, this study attempts to identify the unknown mechanisms of action of the coexistence of Serendipita indica with plants in the face of stress using information from previous studies. Thus, it provides a way for future research to assess the impact of this fungus on tackling environmental stresses and enhancing agricultural productivity.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the best option among traditional Chinese exercises for reducing oxidative stress in middle-aged and older adults, using a network meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI databases were used. We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on middle-aged and older adults to influence oxidative stress by any traditional Chinese exercises from the beginning to 20 January 2022. A network meta-analysis of randomized control trials was performed comparing the changes in the concentration of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as primary outcomes, following different therapeutic interventions with traditional Chinese exercises in middle-aged and older adults over 30 years old. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the correlation between each group of interventions, and surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) was used to rank the best interventions. Results: The meta-analysis comprised 15 trials with a total of 927 participants and six interventions: (Wuqinxi (WQX), Baduanjin (BDJ), Tai Ji Quan (TJQ), Yijinjing (YJJ), Mawangdui Daoyin (MWD), and no exercise intervention (NEI)). Regarding GPX: WQX [SMD = 2.79 (1.75, 3.83)], TJQ [SMD = 0.47 (0.23, 0.70)], YJJ [SMD = 1.78 (1.18, 2.37)], MWD [SMD = 1.89 (1.36, 2.43)] were superior in increasing GPX relative to NEI. Regarding MDA: WQX [SMD = 1.68 (0.94, 2.42)], YJJ [SMD = 0.99 (0.28, 1.69)] were superior in reducing MDA relative to NEI. Regarding SOD: WQX [SMD = 1.05 (0.10, 2.01)] were superior in increasing SOD relative to NEI. WQX topped the SUCRA with GPX: 0.97, MDA: 0.91, and SOD: 0.94. Furthermore, WQX was more effective than TJQ in interfering with GPX [SMD = 2.32 (1.26, 3.39)] and MDA [SMD = 1.47 (0.26, 2.67)], and a significantly better intervention effect on SOD than YJJ [SMD = 1.52 (0.80, 2.24)] and MWD [SMD = 0.89 (0.03, 1.75)]. Conclusion: Traditional Chinese exercise can help middle-aged and older adults reduce oxidative stress. WQX may be the best traditional Chinese exercise of the exercises evaluated for reducing oxidative stress in middle-aged and older adults.

AB  - Background Educational attainment is associated with wellbeing and health, but patients with schizophrenia achieve lower levels of education than people without. Several effective interventions can ameliorate this situation. However, the magnitude of the education gap in schizophrenia and its change over time are unclear. We aimed to reconstruct the trajectories of educational attainment in patients with schizophrenia and, if reported, their healthy comparator controls.
   Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis including all studies reporting on patients with schizophrenia (of mean age >= 18 years) and describing the number of years of education of the participants, with or without healthy controls. There were no other design constraints on studies. We excluded studies that included only patients with other schizophrenia spectrum disorders and studies that did not specify the number of years of education of the participants. 22 reviewers participated in retrieving data from a search in PubMed and PsycINFO (Jan 1, 1970, to Nov 24, 2020). We estimated the birth date of participants from their mean age and publication date, and meta-analysed these data using random-effects models, focusing on educational attainment, the education gap, and changes over time. The primary outcome was years of education. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020220546).
   Findings From 32 593 initial references, we included 3321 studies reporting on 318 632 patients alongside 138 675 healthy controls (170 941 women and 275 821 men from studies describing sex or gender; data on ethnicity were not collected). Patients' educational attainment increased over time, mirroring that of controls. However, patients with schizophrenia in high-income countries had 19 months less education than controls (-1.59 years, 95% CI -1.66 to -1.53; p<0.0001), which is equivalent to a Cohen's d of -0.56 (95% CI -0.58 to -0.54) and implies an odds ratio of 2.58 for not completing 12 years of education (ie, not completing secondary education) for patients compared with controls. This gap remained stable throughout the decades; the rate of change in number of total years of education in time was not significant (annual change: 0.0047 years, 95% CI -0.0005 to 0.0099; p=0.078). For patients in low-income and middle-income countries, the education gap was significantly smaller than in high-income countries (smaller by 0.72 years, 0.85 to 0.59; p<0.0001), yet there was evidence that this gap was widening over the years, approaching that of high-income countries (annual change: -0.024 years, -0.037 to -0.011; p=0.0002).
   Interpretation Patients with schizophrenia have faced persistent inequality in educational attainment in the last century, despite advances in psychosocial and pharmacological treatment. Reducing this gap should become a priority to improve their functional outcomes. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present a scope review on the identification of internal speech through surface electromyography and encephalography. A search was performed in the literature of the last five years (2015 to 2020), using descriptors in English and Portuguese, organized according to the following syntax: ("silent speech" OR "inner speech" OR "covert speech" OR "self-talk" OR "imaginary speech") AND (electromyography OR electromyographies OR "surface electromyography" "electromyographies, surface" OR "electromyography, surface" OR "surface electromyographies" OR electromyogram OR electromyograms OR electroencephalography OR EEG OR electroencephalogram OR electroencephalograms), not including citations and patents in different databases. The concept of internal speech differed among the studies included in this review, but it was similar in terms of the absence of sound and articulatory movement. The purpose of the research that analyzed the biosignals of electroencephalography and/or surface electromyography in internal speech, comparing them or not with audible speech, was to develop systems that are controlled by the mental processing of the language.

AB  - Introduction: Suicide by abdominal cut wounds and consequent disembowelment is a modality rarely described in the literature, with rates between 1.6% and 3%. The incidence is higher in men. This type of suicide might be so unusual as the abdominal injuries are not supposed to be related to immediate death (compared to the wrists or throat, which involves rapid bleeding, for example). Considering the infrequency of suicides by abdominal self-cutting, in such cases, the main hypothesis is a homicide, especially in those with multiple injuries or occurred in a complex setting. These cases require a detailed autopsy report with the analysis of the injuries and circumstances of death (e.g., farewell note, history of depression, previous suicide attempts, defense injuries, and signs of hesitation) to allow a differential diagnosis between suicide and homicide. This study aims to highlight the characteristics of suicides through self-cut wounding, focusing on those that determine a large abdominal opening and evisceration. Methods: The authors conducted the literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, on PubMed and Scopus databases, using the following keywords: "(suicide) AND (abdominal stab wounds)", "(suicide) AND (abdominal sharp injuries)", "(suicide) AND (abdominal self-stabbing)", "(suicide) AND (abdominal cut wounds)". Results: 7 articles were included in the systematic review, for a total of 11 cases of suicide by abdominal self-cutting. Of these cases, 3 were women and 8 were men. Conclusions: The analysis of the external examination findings versus the crime scene results is essential to clarify if injuries arc self-inflicted with suicidal intention. Suicide through a violent act can also be practiced by people who have no history of psychiatric conditions or other risk factors. Therefore, in cases of abdominal cut and evisceration with victims' survival time, the forensic pathologist has to consider that the deceased himself could cause modifications to the crime scene, turning it into a complicated suicide.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) exposure is associated with the disruption of human circadian processes. Through numerous pathophysiological mechanisms such as melatonin dysregulation, it is hypothesised that ALAN exposure is involved in asthma and allergy, mental illness, and cancer outcomes. There are numerous existing studies considering these relationships; however, a critical appraisal of available evidence on health outcomes has not been completed. Due to the prevalence of ALAN exposure and these outcomes in society, it is critical that current evidence of their association is understood. Therefore, this systematic scoping review will aim to assess the association between ALAN exposure and asthma and allergy, mental health, and cancer outcomes. This systematic scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. We will search bibliographic databases, registries, and references. We will include studies that have described potential sources of ALAN exposure (such as shift work or indoor and outdoor exposure to artificial light); have demonstrated associations with either allergic conditions (including asthma), mental health, or cancer-related outcomes; and are published in English in peer-reviewed journals. We will conduct a comprehensive literature search, title and abstract screening, full-text review, and data collection and analysis for each outcome separately.

AB  - Bullying and victimisation are extremely damaging behaviours that are present in schools all over the world. However, there is little research on the involvement of students with emotional and behavioural disabilities in the bullying dynamic and their risk and protective factors. Following the PRISMA guidelines, the search terms were entered in bibliographic databases in February 2020. Articles needed to report on empirical studies that examined the association between EBD and bullying with primary data and be published in English in a peer-reviewed journal.Articles were excluded based on certain designs and no verifiable diagnosis. The narrative synthesis includes 12 articles, 8 are included in the meta-analysis. General trends indicate that students with EBD are more frequently victims and perpetrators of bullying. The meta-analysis reveals small to moderate significant effect sizes. Students with EBD are more often involved in the bullying dynamic. The heterogeneity of the studies is low to moderate. The funnel plots demonstrate evidence of publication for perpetration but none for victimisation. Limitations include the varying conceptualisations of bullying behaviour and the limited number of studies focusing on specific disabilities. Although more research is needed, the review provides indications of the significance of developing targeted interventions and preventions.

AB  - A Abstract: BackgroundDisease modification trials in dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not met with success. One potential criticism of these trials is the lack of sensitive outcome measures. A large number of outcome measures have been employed in dementia and MCI trials. This review aims to describe and analyze the utility of cognitive/clinical outcome measures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and MCI trials. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted using relevant MeSH terms and exploded keywords. The search was confined to English language publications of human studies from the last five years which describe the latest trends in the use of outcome measures. Results: Despite broad use, the outcome measures employed are heterogeneous, with little data on correlations between scales. Another problem is that most studies are over-reliant on clinician/researcher assessment and cognitive outcomes, and there is a definite lack of stakeholder input. Finetuning of the paradigm is also required for people with early-stage disease, mild to moderate disease, and advanced dementia, as the outcome measures in these subgroups have varying relevance. Disease modification/prevention is an appropriate goal in early disease, whereas palliation and freedom from discomfort are paramount in later stages. The outcome measures selected must be suitable for and sensitive to these particular care goals. Although there is a shift to enrich MCI cohorts using a biomarker-based approach, the clinical relevance of such outcome measures remains uncertain. Conclusions: Outcome measures in dementia/MCI trials remain inhomogeneous and diverse, despite extensive use. Outcome measures fall within several paradigms, including cognitive, functional, quality-of-life, biomarker-based, and patient-reported outcome measures. The success of future disease-modifying trials is reliant to a large extent on the selection of outcome measures which combine all outcomes of clinical relevance as well as clinical meaning. Outcome measures should be tied to the type and stage of dementia and to the specific interventions employed.

AB  - The occupational environment is an important factor for oral health because people spend a long time in the workplace throughout their lives and are affected by work-related stress and occupational health policies. This study aimed to review evidence for the association between occupation and oral health status and behaviors. A literature search of PubMed was conducted from February to May 2022, as well as a manual search analyzing the article origins. Articles were screened and considered eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) published in English; (2) epidemiological studies on humans; and (3) examined the association between occupation and oral health status and behaviors. All 23 articles identified met the eligibility criteria. After full-text assessments, ten articles from Japan were included in this review: four on the association between occupation and dental caries, three on occupation and periodontal disease, two on occupation and tooth loss, and one on occupation and oral health behaviors. An association was apparent between occupation, oral health status and behaviors among Japanese workers. In particular, skilled workers, salespersons, and drivers who work longer hours and often on nightshifts, tended to have poor oral health.

AB  - Background: Excessive alcohol consumption has negative effects not only on the drinkers' health but also on others around them. Previous studies suggest that excessive alcohol consumption can be related to a combination of factors such as age, family background, religiosity, etc. Investigating and clarifying these roots of alcohol consumption is crucial so that the right type of interventions can be designed in a specific and targeted manner. Objectives: This work was conducted as a systematic review to reveal the factors associated with alcohol consumption and to heighten the understanding of the differences among various communities and segments of the population regarding their usage of alcohol. Data sources: A systematic search of Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar was performed. Results: Forty-five studies were included in the review after excluding irrelevant records and duplicates. Conclusions: Alcohol consumption patterns can be associated with several factors related to communities and individuals, and our review revealed demographic factors, including age and proximity to alcohol outlets, as well as social factors, including family background, socioeconomic background, and religious influence. These findings can be used to establish a guideline for further studies in understanding alcohol consumption patterns among individuals according to their personal characteristics and sociocultural backgrounds.

AB  - Leaders play a significant role in organizations and their leadership behaviors can either enhance or undermine the well-being of their employees. This study aimed to meta-analyze the relationship between transformational leadership and well-being in the service industry, and how employees' gender and service sector moderated the strength of this relationship. This study used a convergent mixed-method approach. PubMed, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, AMED, and Scopus electronic databases were utilized to search for relevant studies. Textual data were analyzed using a text data-mining technique (Leximancer) to determine the relevant themes and concepts. Statistical data were examined through a comprehensive meta-analysis to determine their effect sizes. The qualitative results outline the major themes that emerged: leadership, well-being, and health. The quantitative findings revealed that the perceived well-being of male employees and those working outside of the health-care service sector was positively higher when employees' leaders showed transformational leadership. In general, the findings from the qualitative and quantitative data converge. The findings confirm the positive relationship between transformational leadership and employee well-being. This study also highlights the applicability of a convergent mixed-method approach as a useful methodological strategy when analyzing both lexical and statistical data.

AB  - Background Severe childhood malnutrition impairs growth and development short-term, but current understanding of long-term outcomes is limited. We aimed to identify studies assessing neurodevelopmental, cognitive, behavioural and mental health outcomes following childhood malnutrition. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and PsycINFO for studies assessing these outcomes in those exposed to childhood malnutrition in low-income and middle-income settings. We included studies assessing undernutrition measured by low mid-upper arm circumference, weight-for-height, weight-for-age or nutritional oedema. We used guidelines for synthesis of results without meta-analysis to analyse three outcome areas: neurodevelopment, cognition/academic achievement, behaviour/mental health. Results We identified 30 studies, including some long-term cohorts reporting outcomes through to adulthood. There is strong evidence that malnutrition in childhood negatively impacts neurodevelopment based on high-quality studies using validated neurodevelopmental assessment tools. There is also strong evidence that malnutrition impairs academic achievement with agreement across seven studies investigating this outcome. Eight of 11 studies showed an association between childhood malnutrition and impaired cognition. This moderate evidence is limited by some studies failing to measure important confounders such as socioeconomic status. Five of 7 studies found a difference in behavioural assessment scores in those exposed to childhood malnutrition compared with controls but this moderate evidence is similarly limited by unmeasured confounders. Mental health impacts were difficult to ascertain due to few studies with mixed results. Conclusions Childhood malnutrition is associated with impaired neurodevelopment, academic achievement, cognition and behavioural problems but evidence regarding possible mental health impacts is inconclusive. Future research should explore the interplay of childhood and later-life adversities on these outcomes. While evidence on improving nutritional and clinical therapies to reduce long-term risks is also needed, preventing and eliminating child malnutrition is likely to be the best way of preventing long-term neurocognitive harms.

This review aimed to examine the feasibility and efficacy of classroom movement breaks (CMB) and physically active learning (PAL) on physical and cognitive outcomes in university students in the tertiary setting. Methods: Five electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsychINFO, and PubMed) were searched for articles published up until November 2021. Manual searching of reference lists and citation tracking were also completed. Two reviewers independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed quality assessment. Articles were included if they evaluated CMB or PAL interventions delivered to university students in a tertiary setting. Results: Of the 1691 articles identified, 14 studies with 5997 participants met the inclusion criteria. Average study quality scores were poor for both CMB and PAL studies. CMBs and PAL are feasible in the tertiary setting and increase physical activity, reduce sedentary behaviour, increase wellbeing, and reduce fatigue in university students. In addition, CMBs increased student focus and attention in class and PAL had no detrimental effect on academic performance. Conclusions: University educators should feel confident in introducing CMB and/or PAL interventions into their classes to improve student health and wellbeing.

Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published until January 2021. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, and LILACS were searched. The inclusion criteria were observational (retrospective or prospective), case-control, and/or cross-sectional reports that contained samples of cocaine users aged over 14 years who were assessed in health facilities or were in treatment. The random-effects model was used to calculate the overall prevalence of suicidal behavior with a 95% confidence interval. Subgroup analysis was conducted to investigate sources of heterogeneity. Results: Twenty articles were included, yielding a total of 2,252 cocaine users. The estimated prevalence was 43.59% (95%CI 31.10-57.38) for suicidal ideation and 27.71% (95%CI 21.63-34.73) for suicide attempts. High heterogeneity was found between studies for both outcomes (I2 X 93%), although subgroup analysis considering the quality of the studies showed a significant difference in suicide attempts (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Cocaine use can be considered a risk factor for suicidal behavior, and prevention and early screening measures should be implemented to facilitate adequate treatment.

KW  - CORONAVIRUS
AB  - COVID-19, first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a global pandemic by the WHO following the rapid spread of cases worldwide. The pandemic resulted in governments enforcing nationwide lockdowns, halting economic activities except for essential services. This review aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender-based violence (GBV) among women in South Africa. The literature search for this review was limited to African peer-reviewed articles and studies published in English between March 2020 and July 2021. EBSCOhost (PubMed, EBSCOhost, APA PsycArticles, APA PsychINFO, Academic Search Ultimate, Africa-Wide Information, Sociology Source Ultimate, CAB Abstracts, CINAHL with full text, and MEDLINE) electronic database platforms and the Google Scholar search engine and bibliographies of identified sources were used to identify studies that are included in the review. 82 studies were identified for this review and 18 were included in the synthesis. Multiple factors contributed to the surge in GBV cases in South Africa, including alcohol availability and consumption, job losses, financial dependence, psychological distress, and emotional imbalances. Effective intervention strategies are proposed, calling for more research to better understand women's experiences of GBV during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Simple Summary Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are growing in prevalence and relevance in our society, entailing notable consequences for the individual and healthcare systems. These medical conditions are associated with a systemic inflammatory milieu and an aberrant functioning of the immune system, establishing a bidirectional interplay with other organs and systems of the body. Psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology (PNIE) is an area of great interest relating the immune system with the individual's psyche, nervous, and endocrine system. As compelling evidence supports the pivotal role of PNIE in the understanding and clinical management of IMIDs, the aim of the present review is to deepen the current basic and clinical knowledge in this field. Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) represent a large group of diseases (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis) evidenced by systemic inflammation and multiorgan involvement. IMIDs result in a reduced quality of life and an economic burden for individuals, health care systems, and countries. In this brief descriptive review, we will focus on some of the common biological pathways of these diseases from the point of view of psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology (PNIE). PNIE consists of four medical disciplines (psychology, nervous system, immune system, and endocrine system), which are key drivers behind the health-disease concept that a human being functions as a unit. We examine these drivers and emphasize the need for integrative treatments that addresses the disease from a psychosomatic point of view.

AB  - Nowadays, people spend long periods on social media, ignoring the implications this carries in daily life. In this context, the concept of social media literacy, an emerging concept scarcely developed in the literature, is relevant. This study sought to analyze, descriptively, the main definitions and competences of the concept of social media literacy. The methodology included a systematic search of literature in the databases Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus between 2010 and 2021, applying filters for English and Spanish, including only scientific articles. A total of 1093 articles were obtained. An article selection process took place, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in a total of 15 articles being selected. The findings indicate that the concept of social media literacy is based on media literacy to then integrate the characteristics and the implications of digital platforms. This is linked to the development of cognitive competences, where critical thinking, socio-emotional competences, and technical competences are fundamental, considering the social context. The development of socio-emotional competences stands out since social media are a frequent place of interaction between people.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) among the frontline health care workers (HCWs). Even though PPE helps in preventing infection, it poses significant physical and psychological impacts at varying levels. Correspondingly, multiple independent studies have brought out the PPE-associated problems. However, there exists a lacuna on comprehensive information of global prevalence related to the same. Aim: To estimate the prevalence and risk factors of PPE among HCWs during COVID-19 across the globe. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Method: The review was undertaken as per the protocol registered in PROSPERO CRD42021272216 following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis(PRISMA) guidelines. Two independent reviewers have undertaken the search strategy, study selection, and methodological quality assessment. Discrepancies were addressed by the third reviewer. Heterogeneity was addressed through I2 statistics and forest plots generated by open meta-software. Results: A total of 16 articles conducted across 6 different countries among 10,182 HCWs were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of skin lesions, headache, sweating, breathing difficulty, vision difficulty, thirst/dry mouth, fatigue, and communication difficulty, anxiety, fear were 57 (47-66%), 51 (37-64%), 75 (56-90%), 44 (23-68%), 61 (21-94%), 54 (30-77%), 67 (58-76%), 74 (47-94%), 28 (24-33%), 14 (10-17%), respectively. Moreover, the various risk factors included are the use of PPE for > 6 h and young females. In addition, the medical management of new-onset problems created an additional burden on the frontline health care personnel (HCP). Conclusion: The frontline HCWs encountered physical and psychological problems at varying levels as a result of wearing PPE which needs to be addressed to prevent the inadequate use of PPE leading to infections.

AB  - The number of scientists and tourists visiting Antarctica is on the rise and, despite the management framework for environmental protection, some coastal areas, particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula region, are affected by plastic contamination. The few data available on the occurrence of microplastics (<5 mm) are difficult to compare, due to the different methodologies used in monitoring studies. However, indications are emerging to guide future research and to implement environmental protocols. In the surface and subsurface waters of the Southern Ocean, plastic debris >300 p.m appears to be scarce and far less abundant than paint chips released from research vessels. Yet, near some coastal scientific stations, the fragmentation and degradation of larger plastic items, as well as microbeads and microfibers released into wastewater from personal care products and laundry, could potentially affect marine organisms. Some studies indicate that, through long-range atmospheric transport, plastic fibers produced on other continents can be deposited in Antarctica. Drifting plastic debris can also cross the Polar Front, with the potential to carry alien fouling organisms into the Southern Ocean. Sea ice dynamics appear to favor the uptake of microplastics by ice algae and Antarctic krill, the key species in the Antarctic marine food web. Euphausia superba apparently has the ability to fragment and expel ingested plastic particles at the nanoscale. However, most Antarctic organisms are endemic species, with unique ecophysiological adaptations to extreme environmental conditions and are likely highly sensitive to cumulative stresses caused by climate change, microplastics and other anthropogenic disturbances. Although there is limited evidence to date that micro- and nanoplastics have direct biological effects, our review aims at raising awareness of the problem and, in order to assess the real potential impact of microplastics in Antarctica, underlines the urgency to fill the methodological gaps for their detection in all environmental matrices, and to equip scientific stations and ships with adequate wastewater treatment plants to reduce the release of microfibers.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating mental disorder. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising approach for refractory OCD patients. Research aiming at treatment outcome prediction is vital to provide optimized treatments for different patients. The primary purpose of this systematic review was to collect and synthesize studies on outcome prediction of OCD patients with DBS implantations in recent years. This systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022335585) followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. The search was conducted using three different databases with the following search terms related to OCD and DBS. We identified a total of 3814 articles, and 17 studies were included in our review. A specific tract confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was predictable for DBS outcome regardless of implant targets, but inconsistencies still exist. Current studies showed various ways of successful treatment prediction. However, considering the heterogeneous results, we hope that future studies will use larger cohorts and more precise approaches for predictors and establish more personalized ways of DBS surgeries.

AB  - Heavy alcohol consumption and other drug use are prominent across Africa and increase the risk of exposure to violence, HIV acquisition, and other life-threatening injuries. This review synthesizes evidence on alcohol and other drug (AOD) interventions in Africa; evaluates the differences between interventions that do and do not specifically target populations that use AODs; and highlights the impact of comprehensive vs. brief interventions and those that address syndemic issues from a gender and contextualized lens. Literature searches were conducted to identify research outcomes of randomized interventions published between January 2010 and May 2022 that address AOD use in Africa. Thirty-five full-text articles were included in this review. Most of the identified research studies were concentrated in a few countries. Most studies were conducted in South Africa. Many of the studies comprised brief interventions. However, the most comprehensive interventions were the most effective for AOD outcomes. Several studies indicated the importance of addressing AOD use alongside gender-based violence, mental health needs, gender roles, and other social determinants that affect health outcomes. Intervening on AOD use and addressing social determinants from a gender and contextually relevant perspective is essential to ensuring the long-term health and well-being of people in Africa.

AB  - Background Diabetes often places a large burden on people with diabetes (hereafter 'patients') and the society, that is, in part attributable to its complications. However, evidence from models predicting diabetes complications in patients remains unclear. With the collaboration of patient partners, we aimed to describe existing prediction models of physical and mental health complications of diabetes.
   Methods Building on existing frameworks, we systematically searched for studies in Ovid-Medline and Embase. We included studies describing prognostic prediction models that used data from patients with pre-diabetes or any type of diabetes, published between 2000 and 2020. Independent reviewers screened articles, extracted data and narratively synthesised findings using established reporting standards.
   Results Overall, 78 studies reported 260 risk prediction models of cardiovascular complications (n=42 studies), mortality (n=16), kidney complications (n=14), eye complications (n=10), hypoglycaemia (n=8), nerve complications (n=3), cancer (n=2), fracture (n=2) and dementia (n=1). Prevalent complications deemed important by patients such as amputation and mental health were poorly or not at all represented. Studies primarily analysed data from older people with type 2 diabetes (n=54), with little focus on pre-diabetes (n=0), type 1 diabetes (n=8), younger (n=1) and racialised people (n=10). Per complication, predictors vary substantially between models. Studies with details of calibration and discrimination mostly exhibited good model performance.
   Conclusion This rigorous knowledge synthesis provides evidence of gaps in the landscape of diabetes complication prediction models. Future studies should address unmet needs for analyses of complications n> and among patient groups currently under-represented in the literature and should consistently report relevant statistics.

AB  - Many emotion regulation assessments have been developed for research purposes, but few are frequently used in schools despite the rapid growth of social and emotional learning programs with an explicit focus on emotion regulation in schools. This systematic review provides an overview of emotion regulation assessments that have been utilized with children and adolescents of grades 1-12 or ages 6-18 in school-based research or practice within the USA over the past two decades. Qualitative analyses on the operational definition, administration and feedback, sampling characteristics, and psychometric evidence of the assessments were carried out to illuminate factors that may bridge the gap between researchers in assessment development and educators in assessment use. Emotion regulation assessments were identified via searches in educational research, psychological assessment, and social-emotional learning databases. Measure development and validation studies were then sought using academic search engines. A total of 25 assessments and 55 studies met the inclusion criteria. Results revealed divergent conceptualizations of emotion regulation, trade-offs between methodological rigor and practicality, limited transformation of raw data into actionable information, under-sampling of marginalized or disadvantaged groups, and insufficient psychometric evidence across assessments. More work is needed to enhance the scientific rigor (e.g., evidence-based recommendations and limitations for assessment use), practical relevance (e.g., sustainable use and perceived utility for students and educators), and equitable reach (e.g., accessibility and fairness for diverse student populations) of emotion regulation assessments for educational purposes.

Antipsychotics are however associated with adverse effects including metabolic syndrome. This review outlines the rates of monitoring for and rates of metabolic syndrome in patients treated with LAI antipsychotics. Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane for Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms including metabolic syndrome or MetS and depot or LAI antipsychotics. We included data regarding participants' clinical characteristics, dose and type of antipsychotics administered, rates of monitoring for-and rates of metabolic syndrome and individual metabolic parameters (body mass index or measure of central obesity, blood pressure, lipid levels, plasma glucose and/or HbA1C levels). Results: Six studies were included that evaluated rates of monitoring for-and 39 studies examined rates of metabolic syndrome or individual metabolic parameters. Metabolic parameters were not routinely measured in approximately 75% of patients. Rates of metabolic syndrome ranged between 24.3% and 53.2%, with most studies finding no significant differences between oral and LAIs; however, a more preferable weight and lipid profile was detected with LAIs compared to the oral antipsychotics olanzapine and clozapine. Rates of metabolic syndrome and abnormalities of metabolic parameters were comparable among first-and second-generation and between second-generation LAIs. Conclusions: LAI antipsychotics are associated with high rates of metabolic syndrome but low rates of regular monitoring. A robust screening plan to monitor for metabolic syndrome in individuals treated with LAIs is advised including measurement of individual metabolic parameters.

AB  - The importance of self-regulatory skills for the socio-emotional competencies of children is being researched and discussed extensively. However, in order to make a clear statement about the impact of self-regulation on children's morality, a systematic review of the literature is urgently needed. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyze associations between self-regulation and morality of preschool and elementary school children. In this context, distinctions among different definitions and operationalizations of self-regulation and morality are considered. Search terms were entered in the bibliographic databases PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. To meet the inclusion criterion, studies needed to report empirical associations between self-regulation and morality in children of preschool and elementary school age. Furthermore, the studies should report primary data and be published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. Studies with secondary or summarized data, special populations or with certain designs were excluded. A total of 37 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. 35 of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. The narrative synthesis showed that different definitions and operationalizations were used for both self-regulation and morality. There also seems to be no consensus regarding the association between the constructs. Meta-analysis results revealed a small positive combined effect between self-regulation and morality, especially between temperament-related self-regulation and moral behavior and moral emotions. In order to gain a better understanding of the effects of self-regulation on morality, longitudinal research and further research addressing different forms of these constructs are essential.

AB  - Menstrual health and hygiene are a major public health and social issues in Nepal. Due to inadequate infrastructure to provide education, healthcare, and communication as well as religious teachings, women and girls are excluded from participation in many activities of daily living and community activities during menstruation. Evidence based research addressing menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal is scares. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal through a socio-ecological perspective. This systematic review identifies knowledge gaps and targets for future research and interventions. Studies from Nepal that examined factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were identified through searches across six databases (Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Nepal Journals Online and Kathmandu University Medical Journal) in January 2019. The SEM is a public health framework that describes how health is impacted at multiple levels including the individual, interpersonal, community, organizational and policy levels. Key themes were identified, and factors contributing to menstrual health and hygiene were categorized as per the level of socio-ecological model (SEM). After a comprehensive literature review, twenty peer-reviewed publications, published between 2003 and January 2019 were included in this review. Eighteen studies were descriptive and two were interventional. The main outcomes reported were reproductive health concerns and menstrual hygiene practices. Nine studies focused on knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding menstruation, seven studies highlighted reproductive health issues, three studies focused on prevalence of culturally restrictive practices, and one on school absenteeism and intimate partner violence. Lack of awareness regarding menstrual health and hygiene, inadequate WASH facilities, no sex education and culturally restrictive practices makes menstruation a challenge for Nepali women. These challenges have negative implications on women and girls' reproductive as well as mental health and school attendance among adolescent girls. There are gaps in the evidence for high quality interventions to improve menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. Future research and interventions should address needs identified at all levels of the SEM.
   Plain language summary Menstrual health and hygiene are major public health and social issues in Nepal, due to a lack of health and education infrastructure, gender-based disparities and restrictive cultural and social norms. This study reviewed the current state of research on menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. The socio-ecological model (SEM)-a public health framework that examines individual, interpersonal, community, organizational, and policy impacts on health-was employed to describe impacts on menstrual health and hygiene. After a comprehensive literature review, 20 papers were included in this analysis, of which 18 were descriptive and two were interventional. The primary menstrual health and hygiene outcomes reported were reproductive health concerns and menstrual hygiene practices. Key themes identified were knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding menstruation, reproductive health issues, prevalence of culturally restrictive practices, school absenteeism and intimate partner violence. The study results indicated lower menstrual health and hygiene challenges arose from lack of education around menstruation, lack of proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities, poor sex education, and culturally restrictive practices. These challenges negatively impact women and girls' reproductive health as well as mental health and school attendance. There is need for high quality, effective interventions to improve menstrual health and hygiene in Nepal. Future research and interventions should address improvements in menstrual health and hygiene at all levels of the socio-ecological model.

AB  - Objective: With an aging population and advances in medicine, more research focuses on health and longevity in geriatric adults. Recently, frailty has gradually emerged to assess physical conditions. Frailty can be generally described as a multi-dimensional situation of increased vulnerabilities to both endogenous and exogenous stressors. The objective of the review was to evaluate the predictive value of frailty on adverse outcomes in geriatric hip fracture patients. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library for relevant literature about the connection between frailty and poor outcomes in hip fracture elders. Results: Eleven studies involving a total of 45,979 participants were selected in our study. Our results indicated that frailty could significantly predict postoperative and in-patient complications (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13-1.90; I-2 = 77.4%). Frail elders had higher risk of inpatient mortality (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.26-2.25; I-2 = 0.0%), 6-month mortality (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.25-1.72; I-2 = 0.0%) and >= 1-year mortality (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.66-3.04; I-2 = 91.3%). Furthermore, the risk of prolonged hospital stays was 1.15 times more likely in frail patients (95% CI, 1.03-1.28; I-2 = 14.8%). Conclusion: Frailty can predict adverse outcomes effectively in geriatric hip fracture patients.

AB  - Patients with acquired brain injury frequently report experiencing sensory stimuli as abnormally under- (sensory hyposensitivity) or overwhelming (sensory hypersensitivity). Although they can negatively impact daily functioning, these symptoms are poorly understood. To provide an overview of the current evidence on atypical sensory sensitivity after acquired brain injury, we conducted a systematic literature review. The primary aim of the review was to investigate the behavioural and neural mechanisms that are associated with self-reported sensory sensitivity. Studies were included when they studied sensory sensitivity in acquired brain injury populations, and excluded when they were not written in English, consisted of non-empirical research, did not study human subjects, studied pain, related sensory sensitivity to peripheral injury or studied patients with a neurodegenerative disorder, meningitis, encephalitis or a brain tumour. The Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for appropriate studies. A qualitative synthesis of the results of the 81 studies that were included suggests that abnormal sensory thresholds and a reduced information processing speed are candidate behavioural mechanisms of atypical subjective sensory sensitivity after acquired brain injury. Furthermore, there was evidence for an association between subjective sensory sensitivity and structural grey or white matter abnormalities, and to functional abnormalities in sensory cortices. However, further research is needed to explore the causation of atypical sensory sensitivity. In addition, there is a need for the development of adequate diagnostic tools. This can significantly advance the quantity and quality of research on the prevalence, aetiology, prognosis and treatment of these symptoms.

AB  - Background Measurable differences in the experience and treatment of mental health conditions have been found to exist between different racial categories of community groups. The objective of this research was to review the reported mental health of Black African-Caribbean communities in the UK, determinants of mental health, and interventions to enhance their experiences of mental health services. Method The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement was applied. To be included, papers must be published in a peer reviewed journal; report on adult populations (over 18) from any of Black African, Black Caribbean or Black mixed people in the UK; and assess (quantitative), or discuss (qualitative) mental health experiences, determinants of mental health, or interventions intended to enhance experiences of mental health services among the target population. The aims, inclusion criteria, data extraction, and data quality evaluation were specified in advance. Searches were conducted using EBSCO (PsychInfo; MEDLINE; CINAHL Plus; psychology and behavioural sciences collection). The search strategy included search terms relating to the aim. Risk of bias was assessed using a standard tool, records were organised using Endnote, and data were extracted and synthesised using Microsoft Excel. Results Thirty-six studies were included, of which 26 were quantitative and six reported exclusively on Black participants. Black populations were less likely to access mental health support via traditional pathways due to stigma and mistrust of mental health services. Black Africans especially, sought alternative help from community leaders, which increased the likelihood of accessing treatment at the point of crisis or breakdown, which in turn increased risk of being detained under the Mental Health Act and via the criminal justice system. Discussion Findings suggest a cycle of poor mental health, coercive treatment, stigma, and mistrust of services as experienced by Black communities. Evidence was limited by poorly defined ethnic categories, especially where Black populations were subsumed into one category. It is recommended that mental health services work collaboratively with cultural and faith communities in supporting Black people to cope with mental illness, navigate mental health pathways, and provide culturally appropriate advice.

AB  - Forensic research and practice have historically focused on risk assessment and prevention. This risk-oriented paradigm is shifting towards a more recovery-oriented perspective. The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of research on the factors influencing rehabilitation and recovery and discuss the recovery paradigm in a forensic setting. We performed a systematic search of the literature from the past 10 years, in Pubmed, Cinahl and PsycInfo, on recovery and rehabilitation. All types of study designs were included. Data was analysed and charted using an Excel template with various data items of interest. Clinical, personal, social, functional and forensic factors were found to be of influence on recovery and rehabilitation. A number of these overlapped with factors of influence on recidivism and desistance, others did not. Most studies on recovery and rehabilitation focused on a clinical forensic setting. This study provides an overview of the current body of knowledge on the factors influencing recovery and rehabilitation in forensic clients, and encourages researchers and practitioners in their focus on the recovery paradigm in forensic care. The body of evidence on rehabilitation and recovery is not yet as profound as that on recidivism and desistance. More knowledge on recovery trajectories for offenders in prison or ambulatory care, for example, is required.

AB  - Parenting an autistic child can reduce the time parents have to participate in their own interests, but the impact this has on caregiver quality of life is not well understood. The aim in undertaking this scoping review was to examine and describe current research about occupational participation and quality of life among parents of autistic children. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension guidelines, a comprehensive search of multiple databases was conducted with a systematic selection process resulting in a final set of 70 articles. These included publications related to leisure, community and employment occupations, and quality of life in parents and caregivers of autistic children or children with additional needs. The review revealed the impact of caregiving demands and challenges in raising an autistic child that often take priority over the caregiver's own needs and desires, particularly in occupational participation, which impacts their quality of life. Gaps were identified in the literature on parental occupations and the relationship with quality of life among caregivers of autistic children, particularly fathers. Further investigation into caregiving experiences and examination of the relationship between parental occupations and quality of life in caregivers of autistic children is needed, as the findings can inform the development of suitable supports for them. Lay abstract We searched a wide range of academic journals for published information on the participation levels of caregivers of autistic children in activities relating to leisure, social, community and employment contexts, and the impact that participation may have on caregiver quality of life. Overall, we found that the impact of parenting an autistic child is broad with caregivers often prioritising their child's needs over their own, particularly in occupational participation, which impacts their quality of life. Findings also highlighted a need for further research to investigate the experience of caregivers, and the relationship between participation and quality of life in caregivers of autistic children, as the results can inform the development of better supports for them.

AB  - Background Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) offer enormous promise for illness monitoring and treatment to improve the provided medical care and promote health and wellbeing. Objective We applied bibliometric quantitative analysis and network visualization to highlight research trends and areas of particular interest. We expect by summarizing the trends in mHealth app research, our work will serve as a roadmap for future investigations. Methods Relevant English publications were extracted from the Scopus database. VOSviewer (version 1.6.17) was used to build coauthorship networks of authors, countries, and the co-occurrence networks of author keywords. Results We analyzed 550 published articles on mHealth apps from 2020 to February 1, 2021. The yearly publications increased from 130 to 390 in 2021. JMIR mHealth and uHealth (33/550, 6.0%), J. Med. Internet Res. (27/550, 4.9%), JMIR Res. Protoc. (22/550, 4.0%) were the widest journals for these publications. The United States has the largest number of publications (143/550, 26.0%), and England ranks second (96/550, 17.5%). The top three productive authors were: Giansanti D., Samuel G., Lucivero F., and Zhang L. Frequent authors' keywords have formed major 4 clusters representing the hot topics in the field: (1) artificial intelligence and telehealthcare; (2) digital contact tracing apps, privacy and security concerns; (3) mHealth apps and mental health; (4) mHealth apps in public health and health promotion. Conclusions mHealth apps undergo current developments, and they remain hot topics in COVID-19. These findings might be useful in determining future perspectives to improve infectious disease control and present innovative solutions for healthcare.

AB  - Hundreds of millions of people around the world suffer from neurological disorders or have experienced them intermittently, which has significantly reduced their quality of life. The common treatments for neurological disorders are relatively expensive and may lead to a wide variety of side effects including sleep attacks, gastrointestinal side effects, blood pressure changes, etc. On the other hand, several herbal medications have attracted colossal popularity worldwide in the recent years due to their availability, affordable prices, and few side effects. Aromatic plants, sage (Salvia officinalis), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), and rosemary (Salvia Rosmarinus) have already shown anxiolytics, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. They have also shown potential in treating common neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, migraine, and cognitive disorders. This review summarizes the data on the neuroprotective potential of aromatic herbs, sage, lavender, and rosemary.

AB  - Research on animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) has increased massively in the last few years. But it is still not clear how AAIs work and how important the animal is in such interventions. The aim of this systematic review was to compile the existing state of knowledge about the working mechanisms of AAIs. We searched 12 major electronic databases for previous AAI studies with active control groups. Of 2001 records identified, we included 172 studies in the systematic review. We extracted previously published hypotheses about working mechanisms and factors that have been implicitly considered specific or non-specific in AAI research by categorizing control conditions using content analysis. We analyzed the categories using descriptive statistics. We found that 84% of the included studies mentioned a hypothesis of working mechanisms, but 16% did not define specific hypotheses. By analyzing their control conditions, we found that in most controlled studies, the animal or the interaction with the animal was implicitly considered as a specific factor for the effects of the AAI. Non-specific factors such as therapeutic aspects, social interactions, or novelty have also been controlled for. We conclude that AAI research still cannot answer the question of how and why AAIs work. To address this important research gap, we suggest using component studies with innovative control conditions and results from placebo research to address both the specific and non-specific, contextual factors of AAIs to disentangle its mechanisms.

AB  - A constant metabolism and energy supply are crucial to all organs, particularly the brain. Age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), are associated with alterations in cellular metabolism. These changes have been recognized as a novel hot topic that may provide new insights to help identify risk in the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease, understand disease pathogenesis, track disease progression, and determine critical endpoints. Nuclear receptor-related factor 1 (NURR1), an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of PD, and changes in NURR1 expression can have a detrimental effect on cellular metabolism. In this review, we discuss recent evidence that suggests a vital role of NURR1 in dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron development and the pathogenesis of PD. The association between NURR1 and cellular metabolic abnormalities and its implications for PD therapy have been further highlighted.

AB  - Human activity puts our oceans under multiple stresses, whose impacts are already significantly affecting biodiversity and physicochemical properties. Consequently, there is an increased international focus on the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, including the protection of fragile benthic biodiversity hotspots in the deep sea, identified as vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs). International VME risk assessment and conservation efforts are hampered because we largely do not know where VMEs are located. VME distribution modelling has increasingly been recommended to extend our knowledge beyond sparse observations. Nevertheless, the adoption of VME distribution models in spatial management planning and conservation remains limited. This work critically reviews VME distribution modelling studies, and recommends promising avenues to make VME models more relevant and impactful for policy and management decision making. First, there is an important interplay between the type of VME data used to build models and how the generated maps can be used in making management decisions, which is often ignored by model-builders. Overall, there is a need for more precise VME data for production of reliable models. We provide specific guidelines for seven common applications of VME distribution modelling to improve the matching between the modelling and the user need. Second, the current criteria to identify VME often rely on subjective thresholds, which limits the transparency, transferability and effective applicability of distribution models in protection measures. We encourage scientists towards founding their models on: (i) specific and quantitative definitions of what constitute a VME, (ii) site conservation value assessment in relation to VME multi-taxon spatial predictions, and (iii) explicitly mapping vulnerability. Along with the recent increase in both deep-sea biological and environmental data quality and quantity, these modelling recommendations can lead towards more cohesive summaries of VME's spatial distributions and their relative vulnerability, which should facilitate a more effective protection of these ecosystems, as has been mandated by numerous international agreements.

AB  - Climate change is impacting organisms in every region of the world ocean by acting though on individuals in response to their local environments. Given projected future risks derived from these changes, it is becoming increasingly important to understand regional signals of how organisms respond to facilitate their governance and protection. Benthic organisms structure ecological compositions and ecosystem dynamics, therefore not only providing insights into their own response to climate change but also how ecosystems might respond to future conditions. European seas are transitional areas including boreal, warm-temperate, and subarctic waters with organisms frequently at limits of their distributions. Here, we use a meta-analytical approach to assess how calcification, growth, metabolism, photosynthesis, reproduction, and survival in European benthic organisms respond to ocean acidification and warming. Using meta-regression, we examine how study design factors influence effect-size outcomes. Longer experimental periods generally amplified the effects of climate change on taxonomic groupings and related physiological traits and against expectation do not result in acclimation. In agreement with global studies, we find that impacts vary considerably on different taxonomic groupings and their physiological traits. We found calcifying organisms are an at-risk taxon in European waters, with climate stressors decreasing growth rates, reproduction, and survival rates. Fleshy algal species demonstrate resilience to climate stressors, suggesting future European benthic ecosystems will undergo restructuring based on current climate emission pathways.

AB  - Chromium (Cr) is a crucial element for all life forms. Various anthropogenic activities have been responsible for environmental contamination with Cr (VI) in recent years. For this review, articles were collected using electronic databases such as Web of Science, Pubmed, ProQuest, and Google Scholar as per the guidelines of PRISMA2015, applying the Boolean search methods. Chromium can cause severe health complications in humans and animals and threatens the surrounding environment, with negative impacts on crop yield, development, and quality. Hence, monitoring Cr contamination is essential, and various remediation technologies have emerged in the past 50 years to reduce the amount of Cr in the environment. This review focuses on chromium exposure and the associated environmental health risks. We also reviewed sustainable remediation processes, with emphasis on nanoparticle and endophytic remediation processes.

AB  - Background: Specific learning disorders (SLD) comprise varied conditions with ongoing problems in one of the three areas of educational skills-reading, writing, and arithmetic-which are essential for the learning process. There is a dearth of systematic reviews focused exclusively on the prevalence of SLD in India. Hence, this study was done to estimate the prevalence of SLD in Indian children. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was conducted. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the full-text articles. The third author reassessed all selected studies. A standardized data extraction form was developed and piloted. The pooled prevalence of SLDs was estimated from the reported prevalence of eligible studies, using the random-effects model. Results: Six studies of the systematic review included the diagnostic screening of 8133 children. The random-effects meta-analysis showed that the overall pooled prevalence of SLD in India was 8% (95% CI = 4-11). The tools used to diagnose SLD in the studies were the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)-SLD index and the Grade Level Assessment Device (GLAD). Conclusions: Nearly 8% of children up to 19 years have SLD. There are only a few high-quality, methodologically sound, population-based epidemiological studies on this topic. There is a pressing need to have large population-based surveys in India, using appropriate screening and diagnostic tools. Constructing standardized assessment tools, keeping in view the diversity of Indian culture, is also necessary.

AB  - First-episode psychosis (FEP) can be quite variable in clinical presentation, and both sex and gender may account for some of this variability. Prior literature on sex or gender differences in symptoms of psychosis have been inconclusive, and a comprehensive summary of evidence on the early course of illness is lacking. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to summarize prior evidence on the sex and gender differences in the symptoms of early psychosis. We conducted an electronic database search (MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO, and CINAHL) from 1990 to present to identify quantitative studies focused on sex or gender differences in the symptoms of early psychosis. We used random effects models to compute pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) and risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI), for a range of symptoms. Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, and 30 studies were included in the meta-analysis. All studies examined sex differences. Men experienced more severe negative symptoms (SMD = - 0.15, 95%CI = - 0.21, - 0.09), whereas women experienced more severe depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.21, 95 %CI = 0.14, 0.27) and had higher functioning (SMD = 0.16, 95%CI = 0.10, 0.23). Women also had a lower prevalence of substance use issues (RR =0.65, 95%CI = 0.61, 0.69). Symptoms of early psychosis varied between men and women; however, we were limited in our ability to differentiate between biological sex and gender factors. These findings may help to inform early detection and intervention efforts to better account for sex and gender differences in early psychosis presentation.

AB  - Background The health of an (unborn) child is largely determined by the health and social determinants of its parents. The extent to which social determinants of parents or prospective parents affect their own health depends partly on their coping or resilience abilities. Inadequate abilities allow negative effects of unfavourable social determinants to prevail, rendering them vulnerable to adverse health outcomes. Addressing these determinants in the reproductive-aged population is therefore a key approach in improving the health of the future generation. This systematic review aims to synthesise evidence on social determinants of vulnerability, i.e., inadequate coping or low resilience, in the general population of reproductive age. Methods The databases EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, were systematically searched from database inception to December 2th 2021. Observational studies examining social determinants and demographics in relation to vulnerability among the general population of reproductive age (men and women aged 18-40 years), conducted in a high-income country in Europe or North America, Australia or New Zealand were eligible for inclusion. Relevant data was extracted from each included article and findings were presented in a narrative and tabulated manner. Results We identified 40,028 unique articles, of which 78 were full text reviewed. Twenty-five studies were included, of which 21 had a cross-sectional study design (84%). Coping was the most frequently assessed outcome measure (n = 17, 68%). Thirty social determinants were identified. Overall, a younger age, lower socioeconomic attainment, lack of connection with the social environment, and adverse life events were associated with inadequate coping or low resilience. Conclusions This review shows that certain social determinants are associated with vulnerability in reproductive-aged individuals. Knowing which factors make people more or less vulnerable carries health-related implications. More high-quality research is needed to obtain substantial evidence on the strength of the effect of these social conditions in this stage of life.

AB  - A considerable amount of research on foreign language (FL) listening anxiety has emerged since 1986, yet a lack of sufficient attention on the conceptual definitions of FL listening anxiety and inappropriate employment of instruments to measure FL listening anxiety cause confusion in the research to a certain extent. This study presents a systematic review of 35 years of FL listening anxiety research. After initially searching 2,172 studies in 7 databases, 76 studies were identified for in-depth analysis. The results verified that the definitions of FL listening anxiety can be categorized into psychological, social, and situation-specific approaches, but the measure of FL listening anxiety was not only examined under these three approaches, but also additionally examined by sources of anxiety, learner characteristics, FL listening ability, and physiological factors. The results also showed that the definition of FL listening anxiety was not clear-cut nor that the measure was accurate, and to a great extent, the measure and the definition were inconsistent. This inconsistency can attribute to conceptual fuzziness in theoretical defining and casual utilization of scales without justification or explanation. We argue that future research needs to provide a tighter link between a more precise definition based on different situations and a valid measure of FL listening anxiety.

AB  - Damage to DNA is generally considered to be a harmful process associated with aging and aging-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases that involve the selective death of specific groups of neurons. However, recent studies have provided evidence that DNA damage and its subsequent repair are important processes in the physiology and normal function of neurons. Neurons are unique cells that form new neural connections throughout life by growth and re-organisation in response to various stimuli. This "plasticity" is essential for cognitive processes such as learning and memory as well as brain development, sensorial training, and recovery from brain lesions. Interestingly, recent evidence has suggested that the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, the most toxic form of damage, is a physiological process that modifies gene expression during normal brain activity. Together with subsequent DNA repair, this is thought to underlie neural plasticity and thus control neuronal function. Interestingly, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington's disease, manifest by a decline in cognitive functions, which are governed by plasticity. This suggests that DNA damage and DNA repair processes that normally function in neural plasticity may contribute to neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarize current understanding about the relationship between DNA damage and neural plasticity in physiological conditions, as well as in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - University students globally are reportedly living unhealthy lifestyles, challenging universities to develop physical activity (PA) and health promotion (HP) intervention strategies. The current study aimed to review global universities' physical activity and health promotion activities to inform the PA and HP guidelines for Eswatini university students in the Sub-Saharan region. An electronic search was performed for review articles published between 1996 and 2021, using Cochrane, Google Scholar, PubMed Central, Scopus, and Medline Web of Science databases. The documents reviewed showed that some global universities under investigation follow the health promoting university (HPU) concept influenced by the Ottawa charter (1986). The review articles further showed that implementing the healthy university concept differs due to cultural and contextual differences from one institution to another. The reviews showed the main item areas as smoking control/alcohol and drug abuse, mental health, sexual health, physical activities, healthy eating habits/diet categorized under health promotion. The main PA activities were pedometer activity tracking, measurement of PA using validated questionnaires, sports, games, among other intervention activities. The HPU concept is thus a good starting point that can be promoted and spread to all other universities globally with different charters' guidance, including the Ottawa charter and the Okanagan charter.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Negative symptoms have a detrimental impact on functional outcomes and quality of life in people with schizophrenia, and few therapeutic options are considered effective for this symptomatic dimension. Studies have suggested that noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) interventions may be effective in treating negative symptoms. However, the comparative efficacy of different NIBS protocols for relieving negative symptoms remains unclear.
   OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and acceptability of different NIBS interventions for treating negative symptoms.
   DATA SOURCES The Clinical Key, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, ProQuest, PubMed, ScienceDirect, ClinicalTrials.gov. and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched from inception through December 7, 2021.
   STUDY SELECTION A frequentist model network meta-analysis was conducted to assess the pooled findings of trials that evaluated the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), theta-burst stimulation, transcranial random noise stimulation, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation on negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining NIBS interventions for participants with schizophrenia were included.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. Data were independently extracted by multiple observers. The pair-wise meta-analytic procedures were conducted using a random-effects model.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary outcomes were changes in the severity of negative symptoms and acceptability (ie, dropout rates owing to any reason). Secondary outcomes were changes in positive and depressive symptoms.
   RESULTS Forty-eight RCTs involving 2211 participants (mean [range] age, 38.7 [24.0-57.0] years; mean [range] proportion of female patients, 30.6% [0%-70.0%]) were included. Compared with sham control interventions, excitatory NIBS strategies (standardized mean difference [SMD]: high-definition transcranial random noise stimulation. -2.19 [95% CI, -3.36 to -1.02]; intermittent theta-burst stimulation, -1.32 [95% CI, -1.88 to -0.76]; anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, -1.28 [95% CI, -2.55 to -0.02]; high-frequency rTMS, - 0.43 [95% CI, -0.68 to -0.18]; extreme high-frequency rTMS, -0.45 [95% CI, -0.79 to - 0.12]) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with or without other inhibitory stimulation protocols in the contralateral regions of the brain were associated with significantly larger reductions in negative symptoms. Acceptability did not significantly differ between the groups.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this network meta-analysis, excitatory NIBS protocols over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were associated with significantly large improvements in the severity of negative symptoms. Because relatively few studies were available for inclusion, additional well-designed, large-scale RCTs are warranted.

AB  - Purpose: In diagnostic systems (e.g., DSM-5, ICD-10), depression is defined categorically. However, the concept of subthreshold depression (SD) has gained increasing interest in recent years. The purpose of the present paper was to review, based on a scoping review, the relevant papers in this field published between October 2011 and September 2020. Materials and methods: Of the 1,160 papers identified, 64 records could be included in further analysis. The scoping review was conducted using both electronic and manual methods. Results: The main result of the analysis is that the operationalisation criteria used are highly heterogeneous, which also leads to very heterogenous epidemiological data. Conclusions: Clear conclusions are not possible scrutinising the reported results. Most definitions seem to be arbitrary, with considerable overlap (e.g., between SD and minor depression). The review also revealed that the impact of SD on quality of life and related parameters appear to be in the range of the respective impact of major depression (MD) and therapeutic approaches might be helpful for SD and also for the prevention of conversion from SD to MD. Keeping the presented difficulties in mind, a proposal for the definition of SD is made in the present paper in order to facilitate the discussion leading to more homogeneous criteria.

AB  - Cognitive reappraisal is an important emotion regulation strategy that shows considerable developmental change in its use and effectiveness. This paper presents a systematic review of the evidence base regarding the development of cognitive reappraisal from early childhood through adolescence and provides methodological recommendations for future research. We searched Scopus, PsycINFO, and ERIC for empirical papers measuring cognitive reappraisal in normative samples of children and youth between the ages of 3 and 18 years published in peer-reviewed journals through August 9th, 2018. We identified 118 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We first present a quantitative review of the methodologies used to investigate cognitive reappraisal in children and adolescents, with attention to variations in methodologies by the sample age range. We then present a qualitative review of findings with attention to: (1) the age at which children begin to effectively use cognitive reappraisal to regulate their emotions, and (2) developmental changes in cognitive reappraisal from early childhood through adolescence. We consider how methodological differences may contribute to inconsistencies in findings, highlight gaps in the literature that remain to be addressed, and make recommendations for future directions.

AB  - Introduction. People with severe mental illness (SMI) are more likely to have obesity and engage in health risk behaviours than the general population. The aims of this study are (1) evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that focus on body weight, smoking cessation, improving sleeping patterns, and alcohol and illicit substance abuse; (2) Compare the number of interventions addressing body weight and health risk behaviours in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) v. those reported in published systematic reviews focusing on high-income countries (HICs).
   Methods. Intervention studies published up to December 2020 were identified through a structured search in the following database; OVID MEDLINE (1946-December 2020), EMBASE (1974-December 2020), CINAHL (1975-2020), APA PsychoINFO (1806-2020). Two authors independently selected studies, extracted study characteristics and data and assessed the risk of bias. and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool V2. We conducted a narrative synthesis and, in the studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to address body weight, we conducted random-effects meta-analysis of mean differences in weight gain. We did a systematic search of systematic reviews looking at cardiometabolic and health risk behaviours in people with SMI. We compared the number of available studies of LMICs with those of HICs.
   Results. We assessed 15 657 records, of which 9 met the study inclusion criteria. Six focused on healthy weight management, one on sleeping patterns and two tested a physical activity intervention to improve quality of life. Interventions to reduce weight in people with SMI are effective, with a pooled mean difference of -4.2 kg (95% CI -6.25 to -2.18, 9 studies, 459 participants, I2 = 37.8%). The quality and sample size of the studies was not optimal, most were small studies, with inadequate power to evaluate the primary outcome. Only two were assessed as high quality (i.e. scored 'low' in the overall risk of bias assessment). We found 5 reviews assessing the effectiveness of interventions to reduce weight, perform physical activity and address smoking in people with SMI. From the five systematic reviews, we identified 84 unique studies, of which only 6 were performed in LMICs.
   Conclusion. Pharmacological and activity-based interventions are effective to maintain and reduce body weight in people with SMI. There was a very limited number of interventions addressing sleep and physical activity and no interventions addressing smoking, alcohol or harmful drug use. There is a need to test the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of context-appropriate interventions to address health risk behaviours that might help reduce the mortality gap in people with SMI in LMICs.

AB  - Neuropeptides, a diverse class of signaling molecules in the nervous system, modulate various biological effects including membrane excitability, synaptic transmission and synaptogenesis, gene expression, and glial cell architecture and function. To date, most of what is known about neuropeptide action is limited to subcortical brain structures and tissue outside of the central nervous system. Thus, there is a knowledge gap in our understanding of neuropeptide function within cortical circuits. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of various families of neuropeptides and their cognate receptors that are expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Specifically, we highlight dynorphin, enkephalin, corticotropin-releasing factor, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Further, we review the implication of neuropeptide signaling in prefrontal cortical circuit function and use as potential therapeutic targets. Together, this review summarizes established knowledge and highlights unknowns of neuropeptide modulation of neural function underlying various biological effects while offering insights for future research. An increased emphasis in this area of study is necessary to elucidate basic principles of the diverse signaling molecules used in cortical circuits beyond fast excitatory and inhibitory transmitters as well as consider components of neuropeptide action in the PFC as a potential therapeutic target for neurological disorders. Therefore, this review not only sheds light on the importance of cortical neuropeptide studies, but also provides a comprehensive overview of neuropeptide action in the PFC to serve as a roadmap for future studies in this field.

AB  - Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) constitute the leading cause of mortality globally. Low and middle-income countries (LMICs) not only experience the largest burden of humanitarian emergencies but are also disproportionately affected by NCDs, yet primary focus on the topic is lagging. We conducted a systematic review on the effect of humanitarian disasters on NCDs in LMICs assessing epidemiology, interventions, and treatment. Methods A systematic search in MEDLINE, MEDLINE (PubMed, for in-process and non-indexed citations), Social Science Citation Index, and Global Health (EBSCO) for indexed articles published before December 11, 2017 was conducted, and publications reporting on NCDs and humanitarian emergencies in LMICs were included. We extracted and synthesized results using a thematic analysis approach and present the results by disease type. The study is registered at PROSPERO (CRD42018088769). Results Of the 85 included publications, most reported on observational research studies and almost half (48.9%) reported on studies in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO), with scant studies reporting on the African and Americas regions. NCDs represented a significant burden for populations affected by humanitarian crises in our findings, despite a dearth of data from particular regions and disease categories. The majority of studies included in our review presented epidemiologic evidence for the burden of disease, while few studies addressed clinical management or intervention delivery. Commonly cited barriers to healthcare access in all phases of disaster and major disease diagnoses studied included: low levels of education, financial difficulties, displacement, illiteracy, lack of access to medications, affordability of treatment and monitoring devices, and centralized healthcare infrastructure for NCDs. Screening and prevention for NCDs in disaster-prone settings was supported. Refugee status was independently identified both as a risk factor for diagnosis with an NCD and conferring worse morbidity. Conclusions An increased focus on the effects of, and mitigating factors for, NCDs occurring in disaster-afflicted LMICs is needed. While the majority of studies included in our review presented epidemiologic evidence for the burden of disease, research is needed to address contributing factors, interventions, and means of managing disease during humanitarian emergencies in LMICs.

AB  - This scoping review assesses the use of conditional cash transfer (CCT) interventions - direct distribution of money to individuals conditional on their compliance to certain requirements - in randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies and large community-based randomised trials with health-focused outcomes. Five databases were searched to identify 68 records published 2004-2021 from 25 countries (8 low- (32%), 5 lower middle- (20%), 6 upper middle- (24%) and 6 high-income (24%), according to the World Bank Categorisation (2017). Forty-six studies were unique (after excluding multiple publications on a single study). The most common outcomes assessed were infectious diseases (30%); maternal health (24%); vaccination rates (17%); and childhood developmental measures (17%). The number of participants receiving CCT in each study ranged from 47 to 5,788, with a median of 487 individuals. The number of total participants ranged from 72 to 14,000, with a median of 1,289 individuals. Fifteen percent of studies involved mobile CCT disbursement. More than a quarter of payments were greater than 50 USD (29%), and most payments were 20 USD or less (58%). Seventy-eight percent of unique full-length studies reported statistically significant CCT effects. Although CCTs remain controversial, a growing evidence base is emerging for their potential impact in specific health conditions.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are generally considered proteinopathies but whereas this may initiate disease in familial cases, onset in sporadic diseases may originate from a gradually disrupted organellar homeostasis. Herein, endolysosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and altered lipid metabolism are commonly observed in early preclinical stages of major NDs, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the multitude of underlying defective molecular mechanisms that have been suggested in the past decades, dysregulation of inter-organellar communication through the so-called membrane contact sites (MCSs) is becoming increasingly apparent. Although MCSs exist between almost every other type of subcellular organelle, to date, most focus has been put on defective communication between the ER and mitochondria in NDs, given these compartments are critical in neuronal survival. Contributions of other MCSs, notably those with endolysosomes and lipid droplets are emerging, supported as well by genetic studies, identifying genes functionally involved in lysosomal homeostasis. In this review, we summarize the molecular identity of the organelle interactome in yeast and mammalian cells, and critically evaluate the evidence supporting the contribution of disturbed MCSs to the general disrupted inter-organellar homeostasis in NDs, taking PD and AD as major examples.

AB  - The brain extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly glycosylated environment and plays important roles in many processes including cell communication, growth factor binding, and scaffolding. The formation of structures such as perineuronal nets (PNNs) is critical in neuroprotection and neural plasticity, and the formation of molecular networks is dependent in part on glycans. The ECM is also implicated in the neuropathophysiology of disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Schizophrenia (SZ). As such, it is of interest to understand both the proteomic and glycomic makeup of healthy and diseased brain ECM. Further, there is a growing need for site-specific glycoproteomic information. Over the past decade, sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic methods have been developed and refined to provide comprehensive information about the glycoproteome. Core ECM molecules including versican, hyaluronan and proteoglycan link proteins, and tenascin are dysregulated in AD, PD, and SZ. Glycomic changes such as differential sialylation, sulfation, and branching are also associated with neurodegeneration. A more thorough understanding of the ECM and its proteomic, glycomic, and glycoproteomic changes in brain diseases may provide pathways to new therapeutic options.

AB  - Background The public safety sector includes law enforcement officers (LEO), corrections officers (CO), firefighter service (FF), wildland firefighting (WFF), and emergency medical services (EMS), as defined in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Across these occupations, shiftwork, long-duration shifts, and excessive overtime are common. Our objective was to identify research gaps related to working hours, sleep, and fatigue among these workers. Methods We used a scoping review study design that included searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CAB Abstracts, Global Health, PsychInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Academic Search Complete, Agricultural and Environmental Science Collection, ProQuest Central, Cochrane Library, Safety Lit, Homeland Security Digital Library, and Sociological Abstracts using a range of occupational search terms and terms related to working hours, sleep, and fatigue. Results Out of 3415 articles returned from our database search, 202 met all inclusion criteria. Six common outcomes related to working hours, sleep, and fatigue emerged: sleep, fatigue, work performance, injury, psychosocial stress, and chronic disease. Nearly two-thirds (59%, n = 120) of the studies were observational, of which 64% (n = 77) were cross sectional and 9% were (n = 11) longitudinal; 14% (n = 30) of the studies were reviews; and 19% (n = 39) were experimental or quasi-experimental studies. Only 25 of the 202 articles described mitigation strategies or interventions. FFs, LEOs, EMS, and WFFs were the most studied, followed by COs. Conclusions In general, more longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to enrich the knowledge base on the consequences of long working hours, poor sleep, and fatigue in the public safety sector. Few experimental studies have tested novel approaches to fatigue mitigation in diverse sectors of public safety. This gap in research limits the decisions that may be made by employers to address fatigue as a threat to public-safety worker health and safety.

AB  - This review aims to systematically review the effects of physical exercise on the cognitive performance of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its mechanisms of action. Databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until December 2021. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effect of an exercise intervention (compared with no exercise) on patients with AD. The measures included cognitive function [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease assessment scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog), Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA) and Executive Function (EF)]. The methodological quality of the included literature was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Twenty-two studies (n = 1647, mean age: 77.1 +/- 6.3 years) were included in the systematic review, sixteen of which were included in the meta-analysis. A systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that physical exercise positively affects cognitive performance in older patients with AD. However, the positive effects of the intervention should be interpreted with caution considering the differences in methodological quality, type, frequency, and duration of exercise in the included studies. Future studies should consider the design rigor and specification of RCT protocols.

AB  - Mitochondria generate ATP essential for neuronal growth, function, and regeneration. Due to their polarized structures, neurons face exceptional challenges to deliver mitochondria to and maintain energy homeostasis throughout long axons and terminal branches where energy is in high demand. Chronic mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by bioenergetic failure is a pathological hallmark of major neurodegenerative diseases. Brain injury triggers acute mitochondrial damage and a local energy crisis that accelerates neuron death. Thus, mitochondrial maintenance defects and axonal energy deficits emerge as central problems in neurodegenerative disorders and brain injury. Recent studies have started to uncover the intrinsic mechanisms that neurons adopt to maintain (or reprogram) axonal mitochondrial density and integrity, and their bioenergetic capacity, upon sensing energy stress. In this review, we discuss recent advances in how neurons maintain a healthy pool of axonal mitochondria, as well as potential therapeutic strategies that target bioenergetic restoration to power neuronal survival, function, and regeneration.

AB  - Suicide is a serious social issue and is often treated using psychological interventions. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effectiveness of self-esteem-related interventions on suicidal behaviors. A systematic literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including a self-esteem component was conducted on 29 May 2021 and updated on 4 April 2022. In total, 12 studies were included in the systematic review and five studies were included in the meta-analysis. Small effect sizes were found for suicidal ideation at post intervention [g = -0.24, 95% CI (-0.48, 0.00)] and a 3-month follow-up [g = -0.36, 95% CI (-0.62, -0.11)]. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited number of included studies and varied sample population. In conclusion, the current review suggests that future intervention studies should incorporate self-esteem enhancement in the treatment of suicidal behaviors, especially for suicidal ideation.

AB  - Screening is an essential prevention practice for a number of health conditions. However, screening coverage remains generally low. Studies that investigate determinants of screening participation are becoming more common, but oftentimes investigate screening for health conditions in an individualized rather than integrated fashion. In routine clinical practice, however, healthcare professionals are often confronted with situations in which several screening procedures are recommended for the same patient. The consideration of their common determinants may support a more integrated screening approach. The objectives of this umbrella review were therefore to examine: 1) the determinants (barriers and facilitators) that have been identified in relation to recommended health screening procedures; and 2) the modifiable determinants (in primary care) common across health conditions or specific to individual procedures. Results were presented through a narrative synthesis. PubMed, PsycInfo and Cochrane were searched up to January 2022. Systematic reviews reporting determinants of participation in health screening procedures with grade A or B recommendation according to the US Preventive Services Task Force were included. A total of 85 systematic reviews were included, most which contained both qualitative and quantitative studies on determinants that describe individual factors (961 occurrences), social factors (113 occurrences, healthcare professional factors (149 occurrences), health system factors (105 occurrences) and screening procedure factors (99 occurrences). The most studied screening procedures concerned cervical cancer/human papillomavirus (n = 33), breast cancer (n = 28), colorectal cancer (n = 25) and the human immunodeficiency virus (n = 12). Other conditions have been under-studied (e.g. cardiovascular problems, lung cancer, syphilis). The individual domain, including determinants such as knowledge, beliefs and emotions, was the most covered across health conditions. Healthcare professional's recommendations and the quality of patient-provider communication were identified to have a strong influence on screening participation in most conditions. The other three domains included determinants which were more specific to a condition or a population. Various determinants modifiable in primary care were found in the individual domain and in the health system, healthcare professional and screening procedure domains. Quality was assessed as low for most systematic reviews included. The identification of various modifiable determinants common across conditions highlights the potential of an integrated screening participation approach. Interventions may address common determinants in a broader person-centred framework within which tailoring to specific procedures or populations can be considered. This approach needs to be explored in intervention studies. The systematic review registration is PROSPERO CRD42019126709.

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, glioma, and epilepsy, involve oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, often leading to long-term disability or death. Emerging studies suggest that oxidative stress may induce epigenetic modifications that contribute to CNS disorders. Non-coding RNAs are epigenetic regulators involved in CNS disorders and have attracted extensive attention. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs more than 200 nucleotides long and have no protein-coding function. However, these molecules exert regulatory functions at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic levels. However, the major role of lncRNAs in the pathophysiology of CNS disorders, especially related to oxidative stress, remains unclear. Here, we review the molecular functions of lncRNAs in oxidative stress and highlight lncRNAs that exert positive or negative roles in oxidation/antioxidant systems. This review provides novel insights into the therapeutic potential of lncRNAs that mediate oxidative stress in CNS disorders.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 outbreak has spread to almost every country around the world and caused more than 3 million deaths. The pandemic has triggered enormous disruption in people's daily lives with profound impacts globally. This has also been the case in Australia, despite the country's comparative low mortality and physical morbidity due to the virus. This scoping review aims to provide a broad summary of the research activity focused on mental health during the first 10 months of the pandemic in Australia. Results A search of the Australian literature was conducted between August-November 2020 to capture published scientific papers, online reports and pre-prints, as well as gaps in research activities. The search identified 228 unique records in total. Twelve general population and 30 subpopulation group studies were included in the review. Conclusions Few studies were able to confidently report changes in mental health driven by the COVID-19 context (at the population or sub-group level) due to a lack of pre-COVID comparative data and non-representative sampling. Never-the-less, in aggregate, the findings show an increase in poor mental health over the early period of 2020. Results suggest that young people, those with pre-existing mental health conditions, and the financially disadvantaged, experienced greater declines in mental health. The need for rapid research appears to have left some groups under-researched (e.g. Culturally and Linguistically Diverse populations and Indigenous peoples were not studied), and some research methods under-employed (e.g. there was a lack of qualitative and mixed-methods studies). There is a need for further reviews as the follow-up results of longitudinal studies emerge and understandings of the impact of the pandemic are refined.

AB  - Social prescribing is being proposed by policy makers as a solution to primarily address lowered wellbeing and increased loneliness in older adults. Previous reviews have found a lack of supporting evidence for social prescribing. However, these reviews were using a narrow definition which may have left out some important evaluations. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the evidence for social prescribing programs using a broader definition to encompasses a variety of referral pathways and activities. The review was conducted by searching PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and ProQuest Social Sciences databases, and a final 77 articles were included. We found that there were five main themes in the outcomes reported: social connection; improvement in the management of health and health status; improvement in mental health and wellbeing; life enrichment; and link worker support. Social prescribing programs appeared to have generally positive impacts however there was a large variety in both programs reported and quality of the research, which made drawing definitive conclusions difficult. Researchers evaluating programs in future should attempt to recruit larger sample sizes and use a mixed methods approach to further examine the evidence base for social prescribing.

AB  - An inherent challenge that mitochondria face is the continuous exposure to diverse stresses which increase their likelihood of dysregulation. In response, human cells have evolved sophisticated quality control mechanisms to identify and eliminate abnormal dysfunctional mitochondria. One pivotal mitochondrial quality control pathway is PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy which mediates the selective removal of the dysfunctional mitochondria from the cell by autophagy. PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) is a mitochondrial Ser/Thr kinase that was originally identified as a gene responsible for autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Notably, upon failure of mitochondrial import, Parkin, another autosomal-recessive PD gene, is recruited to mitochondria and mediates the autophagic clearance of deregulated mitochondria. Importantly, recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria hinges on the accumulation of PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Normally, PINK1 is imported from the cytosol through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex, a large multimeric channel responsible for the import of most mitochondrial proteins. After import, PINK1 is rapidly degraded. Thus, at steady-state, PINK1 levels are kept low. However, upon mitochondrial import failure, PINK1 accumulates and forms a high-molecular weight > 700 kDa complex with TOM on the OMM. Thus, PINK1 functions as sensor, tagging dysfunctional mitochondria for Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Although much has been learned about the function of PINK1 in mitophagy, the biochemical and structural basis of negative regulation of PINK1 operation and functions is far from clear. Recent work unveiled new players as PTEN-l as negative regulator of PINK1 function. Herein, we review key aspects of mitophagy and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy with highlighting the role of negative regulation of PINK1 function and presenting some of the key future directions in PD cell biology.

AB  - Purpose Of the 80% people with psychosis living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), up to 90% are left to the care of families. The World Health Organization has recommended the inclusion of families in community-based rehabilitation and while there is evidence of its implementation in LMICs, this has not been reviewed yet. This study aims to describe the key features and implementation strategies of family-based interventions in LMICs, and appraise their effectiveness. Methods Included are people with psychosis in LMICs who receive any form of family-based intervention, compared to their usual or absence of treatment, with patient outcome measures. We searched (August 2021) through Embase, MEDLINE, Global Health, PsycInfo, Social Policy and Practice, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), as well as from grey literature and hand-searched records. Risk of bias was assessed through the Integrated Quality Criteria for Review of Multiple Study Designs (ICROMS) and Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS), then analyzed narratively. Results 27 studies were included from the 5254 records. Psychotherapeutic features, systems approach and task-sharing were key intervention elements. Delivery strategies included preliminary research, sustained family engagement, and cultural adaptation. There were positive health impacts across four outcome domains. Conclusion All studies recommended family-based interventions, with limitations in heterogeneity and 70% of them rated high risk of bias. Other Review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021256856).

AB  - Fungicides account for more than 35% of the global pesticide market and their use is predicted to increase in the future. While fungicides are commonly applied during bloom when bees are likely foraging on crops, whether real-world exposure to these chemicals - alone or in combination with other stressors - constitutes a threat to the health of bees is still the subject of great uncertainty. The first step in estimating the risks of exposure to fungicides for bees is to understand how and to what extent bees are exposed to these active ingredients. Here we review the current knowledge that exists about exposure to fungicides that bees experience in the field, and link quantitative data on exposure to acute and chronic risk of lethal endpoints for honey bees (Apis mellifera). From the 702 publications we screened, 76 studies contained quantitative data on residue detections in honey bee matrices, and a further 47 provided qualitative information about exposure for a range of bee taxa through various routes. We compiled data for 90 fungicides and metabolites that have been detected in honey, beebread, pollen, beeswax, and the bodies of honey bees. The risks posed to honey bees by fungicide residues was estimated through the EPA Risk Quotient (RQ) approach. Based on residue concentrations detected in honey and pollen/beebread, none of the reported fungicides exceeded the levels of concern (LOC) set by regulatory agencies for acute risk, while 3 and 12 fungicides exceeded the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) chronic LOC for honey bees and wild bees, respectively. When considering exposure to all bees, fungicides of most concern include many broad-spectrum systemic fungicides, as well as the widely used broad-spectrum contact fungicide chlorothalonil. In addition to providing a detailed overview of the frequency and extent of fungicide residue detections in the bee environment, we identified important research gaps and suggest future directions to move towards a more comprehensive understanding and mitigation of the risks of exposure to fungicides for bees, including synergistic risks of co-exposure to fungicides and other pesticides or pathogens.

We searched 8-to 24-week randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov on November 22, 2021. We included 12 RCTs (N = 792) studying agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, nortriptyline, no treatment, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine, and placebo. Compared to placebo, the standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (SMD, 95%CIs) for depression severity reduction revealed that escitalopram ranked first (-2.93,-3.92 to-1.94), followed by agomelatine (-0.68,-1.15 to-0.20). Compared to placebo, the mean differences (MDs, 95%CIs) for HbA1c reduction suggested that vortioxetine ranked first (-2.35,-4.13 to-0.57), followed by escitalopram (-1.00,-1.42 to-0.57) and agomelatine (-0.79,-1.16 to-0.42). Limited evidence from short-term trials in depressed patients with T2DM suggests that escitalopram and agomelatine may have a favorable profile in reducing depression and controlling glycemic goals, but more trials are required.

AB  - Background: Worldwide, there is an increase in the incidence of suicide each year. Suicide attempts are estimated to be more frequent than actual suicide mortality. One potential contributor to suicide risk is the presence of sensory impairments (visual or hearing impairments). The present review aimed to assess the direction and strength of the association between visual impairment (VI) and the risk of suicidal behavior. Methods: A systematic search was carried out on the literature published up to July 2021 in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov. The association between VI and suicidal ideation/attempt was summarized by pooled odds ratio with 95% CI. Results: Six studies with a sample size of 1,64,752 were included in the final quantitative synthesis. The pooled odds ratios (95% CI) for suicidal ideation and attempt among persons with VI were 1.53 (1.30-1.79) and 4.55 (2.39-8.67), respectively. On subgroup analysis, the odds of suicidal ideation were higher in persons with additional sensory impairment, 2.07 (1.21-3.53), than in the group with VI only, 1.63 (95% 1.34-1.98). Conclusion: This study found a significant association between suicidal behavior and VI, more so in persons with dual impairment. Structured assessment for psychological health and appropriate management should be an integral part of managing people with visual and other sensory impairments, to prevent this serious adverse consequence.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury is a debilitating medical condition, currently with only a limited amount of therapies aimed at protecting the cerebral parenchyma. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that via the RNA-induced silencing complex either degrade or prevent target messenger RNAs from being translated and thus, can modulate the synthesis of target proteins. In the neurological field, miRNAs have been evaluated as potential regulators in brain development processes and pathological events. Following ischemic hypoxic stress, the cellular and molecular events initiated dysregulate different miRNAs, responsible for long-terming progression and extension of neuronal damage. Because of their ability to regulate the synthesis of target proteins, miRNAs emerge as a possible therapeutic strategy in limiting the neuronal damage following a cerebral ischemic event. This review aims to summarize the recent literature evidence of the miRNAs involved in signaling and modulating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injuries, thus pointing their potential in limiting neuronal damage and repair mechanisms. An in-depth overview of the molecular pathways involved in ischemia reperfusion injury and the involvement of specific miRNAs, could provide future perspectives in the development of neuroprotective agents targeting these specific miRNAs.

AB  - BackgroundSerious games (SGs) as one kind of intervention that can improve the level of knowledge and change behavior to affect health outcomes has been increasingly applied in health care. ObjectiveAnalyze hotspots and trends of the application of SGs in health care and provide reference and direction for further research in the future. MethodsThe Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database was used for extracting the literature on SGs in health care for the period from the database established to 11 October, 2021. Scoping review and bibliometric analysis were used to deeply analyze and visualize countries, categories of studies, annual study output, cited authors, cited journals, cited articles, and keywords of healthcare field. ResultsA total of 1,322 articles were retrieved, then every articles' title and abstract were read one by one, and 795 articles were included after screening with an exponential increase in publication volume. The United States of America made the greatest contribution to global publications regarding SGs in health care. From the total, 20.8% of articles fall under the category of health care sciences services. The target groups were mainly concentrated in children (18.0%), youth (13.8%), the elderly (10.9%), adolescents (9.1%), and adults (3.4%). Baranowski T (n = 103 citations) is the most influential author, followed by Kato PM (n = 73 citations) and Desmet A (n = 58 citations). The top three cited journals were "Plos One" (n = 268 citations), "Games for Health Journal" (n = 209 citations), and "Journal of Medical Internet Research" (n = 197 citations), and the top three cited articles were "A meta-analysis of serious digital games for healthy lifestyle promotion," "A Systematic Review of Serious Games in Training Health Care Professionals," and "Video game training enhances cognitive control in older adults." More and more studies focus on specific age groups, such as children, adolescents, and the elderly. The research hotspots and trends included "rehabilitation," "medical education," and "design." ConclusionsThe application of SGs in health care remains important areas for future research. "Rehabilitation," "medical education," and "design" reflected the latest research hotpots and future trends.

AB  - Aging is a risk factor for a number of diseases, being the more notorious ones perhaps neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These and other age-related pathologies are often associated with accumulation of proteotoxic material inside cells, as well as with the accumulation of protein deposits extracellularly. It is widely accepted that this accumulation of toxic proteins trails a progressive decline in the mechanisms that regulate protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, during aging. However, despite significant efforts, the progress in terms of novel or improved therapies targeting accumulation of proteotoxic material has been rather limited. For example, clinical trials for new drugs aimed at treating Alzheimer's disease, by preventing accumulation of toxic proteins, have notoriously failed. On the other hand, it is becoming increasingly apparent that regulation of proteostasis is not a cell autonomous process. In fact, cells rely on complex transcellular networks to maintain tissue and organ homeostasis involving endocrine and paracrine signaling pathways. In this review we will discuss the impact of cell non-autonomous proteostasis mechanisms and their impact in aging and disease. We will focus on how transcellular proteostasis networks can shed new light into stablished paradigms about the aging of organisms.

AB  - Space environment provides many challenges to pilots, astronauts, and space scientists, which are constantly subjected to unique conditions, including microgravity, radiations, hypoxic condition, absence of the day and night cycle, etc. These stressful stimuli have the potential to affect many human physiological systems, triggering physical and biological adaptive changes to re-establish the homeostatic state. A particular concern regards the risks for the effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system (CNS), as several lines of evidence reported a great impact on neuroplasticity, cognitive functions, neurovestibular system, short-term memory, cephalic fluid shift, reduction in motor function, and psychological disturbances, especially during long-term missions. Aside these potential detrimental effects, the other side of the coin reflects the potential benefit of applicating space-related conditions on Earth-based life sciences, as cancer research. Here, we focused on examining the effect of real and simulated microgravity on CNS functions, both in humans and in cellular models, browsing the different techniques to experience or mime microgravity on-ground. Increasing evidence demonstrate that cancer cells, and brain cancer cells in particular, are negatively affected by microgravity, in terms of alteration in cell morphology, proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis, representing an advancing novel side of space-based investigations. Overall, deeper understandings about the mechanisms by which space environment influences CNS and tumor biology may be promisingly translated into many clinical fields, ranging from aerospace medicine to neuroscience and oncology, representing an enormous pool of knowledge for the implementation of countermeasures and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has become a global concern for its severe adverse effects on both mother and fetus. Recent epidemiological studies reported inconsistent results of the association between cadmium (Cd) exposure and GDM. Therefore, a systematic review and meta- analysis were performed. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and SpringerLink were searched up to July 2021. Observational studies containing the adjusted relative risks between Cd exposure and GDM were included in the quantitative synthesis. The retrieval comprised 218 articles out of which 11 met our criteria and 9 were included in the meta-analysis, representing a total of 32,392 subjects (2881 GDM). In total, Cd exposure might increase the risk of GDM in some extent (OR = 1.21, 95% CI [0.89, 1.64]), even without statistical significance in high heterogeneity (Q = 28.45, p < 0.05, I-2 = 71.9%). Filtering two outliers indicated by Galbraith plot yielded a similar risk (OR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.02, 1.39]) with statistical significance. However, the heterogeneity among studies was obviously reduced (Q = 11.75, p = 0.068, I-2 = 48.9%). Additionally, biological specimen, study design, and diagnostic criteria contributed to the high heterogeneity according to the subgroup analysis. Since some important results do not deny that Cd exposure increases the risk of GDM, high-quality multi-centered large cohort studies are required in the future.

AB  - Ketamine is a promising therapeutic option in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The acute efficacy of ketamine in TRD has been demonstrated in replicated randomised-controlled trials (RCTs), but the generalizability of RCT data to real-world practice is limited. To this end, we conducted a systematic review (Search date: 25/12/ 2021; 1482 records identified) and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the real-world clinical effectiveness of ketamine in TRD patients. Four overlapping syntheses (Total n = 2665 patients; k = 79 studies) and 32 metaregressions (Total n = 2050; k = 37) were conducted. All results suggest that the mean antidepressant effect is substantial (mean +/- 95% CI, % responded = 45 +/- 10%; p < 0.0001, % remitted = 30 +/- 5.9%; p < 0.0001, Hedges g of symptomatological improvement = 1.44 +/- 0.609; p < 0.0001), but the effect varies considerably among patients. The more treatment-resistant cases were found to remit less often (p < 0.01), but no such effect on response was evident (p > 0.05). Meta-regressions also confirmed that the therapeutic effect does not significantly decline with repeated treatments (p > 0.05). These results demonstrate that even the most treatment-resistant patients may benefit from ketamine, and that mid-to-long term treatment is effective in many patients.

AB  - Background Rates of preterm birth are substantial with significant inequalities. Understanding the role of risk factors on the pathway from maternal socioeconomic status (SES) to preterm birth can help inform interventions and policy. This study therefore aimed to identify mediators of the relationship between maternal SES and preterm birth, assess the strength of evidence, and evaluate the quality of methods used to assess mediation. Methods Using Scopus, Medline OVID, "Medline In Process & Other Non-Indexed Citation", PsycINFO, and Social Science Citation Index (via Web of Science), search terms combined variations on mediation, socioeconomic status, and preterm birth. Citation and advanced Google searches supplemented this. Inclusion criteria guided screening and selection of observational studies Jan-2000 to July-2020. The metric extracted was the proportion of socioeconomic inequality in preterm birth explained by each mediator (e.g. 'proportion eliminated'). Included studies were narratively synthesised. Results Of 22 studies included, over one-half used cohort design. Most studies had potential measurement bias for mediators, and only two studies fully adjusted for key confounders. Eighteen studies found significant socioeconomic inequalities in preterm birth. Studies assessed six groups of potential mediators: maternal smoking; maternal mental health; maternal physical health (including body mass index (BMI)); maternal lifestyle (including alcohol consumption); healthcare; and working and environmental conditions. There was high confidence of smoking during pregnancy (most frequently examined mediator) and maternal physical health mediating inequalities in preterm birth. Significant residual inequalities frequently remained. Difference-of-coefficients between models was the most common mediation analysis approach, only six studies assessed exposure-mediator interaction, and only two considered causal assumptions. Conclusions The substantial socioeconomic inequalities in preterm birth are only partly explained by six groups of mediators that have been studied, particularly maternal smoking in pregnancy. There is, however, a large residual direct effect of SES evident in most studies. Despite the mediation analysis approaches used limiting our ability to make causal inference, these findings highlight potential ways of intervening to reduce such inequalities. A focus on modifiable socioeconomic determinants, such as reducing poverty and educational inequality, is probably necessary to address inequalities in preterm birth, alongside action on mediating pathways.

AB  - Background: Digital mental health interventions have a great potential to alleviate mental illness and increase access to care. However, these technologies face significant challenges, especially in terms of user engagement and adoption. It has been suggested that this issue stems from a lack of user perspective in the development process; accordingly, several human-centered design approaches have been developed over the years to consider this important aspect. Yet, few human-centered design approaches to digital solutions exist in the field of mental health, and rarely are end users involved in their development.Objective: The main objective of this literature review is to understand how human-centered design is considered in e-mental health intervention research.Methods: An exploratory mapping review was conducted of mental health journals with the explicit scope of covering e-mental health technology. The human-centered design approaches reported and the core elements of design activity (ie, object, context, design process, and actors involved) were examined among the eligible studies.Results: A total of 30 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 22 mentioned using human-centered design approaches or specific design methods in the development of an e-mental health solution. Reported approaches were classified as participatory design (11/27, 41%), codesign (6/27, 22%), user-centered design (5/27, 19%), or a specific design method (5/27, 19%). Just over half (15/27, 56%) of the approaches mentioned were supported by references. End users were involved in each study to some extent but not necessarily in designing. About 27% (8/30) of all the included studies explicitly mentioned the presence of designers on their team.Conclusions: Our results show that some attempts have indeed been made to integrate human-centered design approaches into digital mental health technology development. However, these attempts rely very little on designers and design research. Researchers from other domains and technology developers would be wise to learn the underpinnings of human-centered design methods before selecting one over another. Inviting designers for assistance when implementing a particular approach would also be beneficial. To further motivate interest in and use of human-centered design principles in the world of e-mental health, we make nine suggestions for better reporting of human-centered design approaches in future research.(JMIR Ment Health 2022;9(6):e35591) doi: 10.2196/35591

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration and deposition of alpha-synuclein. Mechanisms associated with PD etiology include oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and abnormalities in neurotransmission, to name a few. Drugs used to treat PD have shown significant limitations in their efficacy. Therefore, recent focus has been placed on the potential of active plant ingredients as alternative, complementary, and efficient treatments. Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid that has shown promise as a pharmacological treatment in PD, given its ability to modulate several molecular pathway associated with the disease. Here, we review contemporary knowledge supporting the need to further characterize berberine as a potential treatment for PD.

AB  - Background Self-harm, including suicide, is common among prisoners. Staff attitudes and perceptions regarding self-harm may affect quality of care and patient safety. Aims To systematically review the experiences, perceptions and attitudes of staff in adult prisons regarding self-harm. Method Systematic searches of EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were conducted, and supplemented by hand-searching and grey literature review, to identify relevant English-language articles published since the year 2000. Articles were screened by two authors and evaluated with standardised quality appraisal tools. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, whereas quantitative data were narratively synthesised because of high study heterogeneity. Results Two thousand articles were identified, of which 32 were included, involving 6389 participants from five countries. Most studies were moderate (n = 15) or poor (n = 10) quality, and seven were rated as good quality. Staff frequently witnessed self-harm and described multiple perceived risk factors and causes of this. Perceptions that self-harm is 'manipulative' or 'attention-seeking' were associated with hostility toward prisoners and lower quality of care. Perceived barriers to preventing and managing self-harm included low staffing levels, prison environments and culture, poor staff confidence and insufficient training. The importance of multidisciplinary teamwork and building staff-prisoner relationships were highlighted. Staff occasionally experienced intense psychological reactions to self-harm, which resulted in adaptive or maladaptive coping that influenced their capacity to care. Conclusions There are mixed attitudes and perceptions toward self-harm among prison staff. Further training, support and resources are required to protect staff's well-being and improve self-harm prevention and management in prisons.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a tool that can be used to administer treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, although the clinical efficacy is still rather modest. Overly general stimulation protocols that consider neither patient-specific depression symptomology nor individualized brain characteristics, such as anatomy or structural and functional connections, may be the cause of the high inter- and intraindividual variability in rTMS clinical responses. Multimodal neuroimaging can provide the necessary insights into individual brain characteristics and can therefore be used to personalize rTMS parameters. Optimal coil positioning should include a three-step process: 1) identify the optimal (indirect) target area based on the exact symptom pattern of the patient; 2) derive the cortical (direct) target location based on functional and/or structural connectomes derived from functional and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data; and 3) determine the ideal coil position by computational modeling, such that the electric field distribution overlaps with the cortical target. These TMS-induced electric field simulations, derived from anatomical and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data, can be further applied to compute optimal stimulation intensities. In addition to magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography can provide complementary information regarding the ongoing brain oscillations. This information can be used to determine the optimal timing and frequency of the stimuli. The heightened benefits of these personalized stimulation approaches are logically reasoned, but speculative. Randomized clinical trials will be required to compare clinical responses from standard rTMS protocols to personalized protocols. Ultimately, an optimized clinical response may result from precision protocols derived from combinations of personalized stimulation parameters.

AB  - Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are one of the major causes of death in infants and young children, and heavy metal exposure during pregnancy is one of the possible risk factors. However, the effect of heavy metal exposure on CHDs is still controversial. We searched English (PubMed, Web of Science) and Chinese (CNKI and WanFang database) databases for relevant articles. The summarized effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by pooling estimates using the random-effects model. Egger's test was used to estimate publication bias. Heterogeneity among studies was indicated by p-values and 1 2 . Finally, we conducted subgroup analyses to elucidate the causes of heterogeneity. Thirteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. A positive association between maternal exposure to heavy metals and CHDs was found. Pooling odds ratios (ORs) for arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead were 2.12, 1.30, 1.22, and 2.30, respectively for total CHDs. Regarding CHD subtypes, arsenic was associated with an increased risk of septal defects (OR: 1.82), barium with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) (OR: 1.15) and septal defects (OR: 1.21), and lead with conotruncal defects (OR: 2.34) and LVOTO (OR: 1.93). A heterogeneous relationship was found between studies using different methods of measurement, which were mainly due to differences in actual exposure levels to heavy metals. This meta-analysis suggests significant associations between arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead exposure during pregnancy and an increased risk of specific CHDs in offspring. These findings underscore the importance of heavy metal exposure during pregnancy in the risk of CHDs in offspring.

AB  - Most neurodegenerative disorders are diseases of protein homeostasis, with misfolded aggregates accumulating. The neurodegenerative process is mediated by numerous metabolic pathways, most of which lead to apoptosis. In recent years, hydrophilic bile acids, particularly tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), have shown important anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities, with numerous experimental and clinical evidence suggesting their possible therapeutic use as disease-modifiers in neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental evidence on the mechanisms underlying TUDCA's neuroprotective action derives from animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cerebral ischemia. Preclinical studies indicate that TUDCA exerts its effects not only by regulating and inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, but also by reducing oxidative stress, protecting the mitochondria, producing an anti-neuroinflammatory action, and acting as a chemical chaperone to maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. Furthermore, data from phase II clinical trials have shown TUDCA to be safe and a potential disease-modifier in ALS. ALS is the first neurodegenerative disease being treated with hydrophilic bile acids. While further clinical evidence is being accumulated for the other diseases, TUDCA stands as a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background Euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) are practices that aim to alleviate the suffering of people with life-limiting illnesses, but are controversial. One area of debate is the relationship between EAS and suicide rates in the population, where there have been claims that availability of EAS will reduce the number of self-initiated deaths (EAS and suicide combined). Others claim that legislation for EAS makes it acceptable to end one's own life, a message at variance with that of suicide prevention campaigns. Aims To examine the relationship between the introduction of EAS and rates of non-assisted suicide and self-initiated death. Method We conducted a systematic review to examine the association between EAS and rates of non-assisted suicide and of self-initiated death. We searched PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and Science Direct, until 20 December 2021. Studies that examined EAS and reported data on population-based suicide rates were included. Results Six studies met the inclusion criteria; four reported increases in overall rates of self-initiated death and, in some cases, increased non-assisted suicide. This increase in non-assisted suicide was mostly non-significant when sociodemographic factors were controlled for. Studies from Switzerland and Oregon reported elevated rates of self-initiated death among older women, consistent with higher rates of depressive illnesses in this population. Conclusions The findings of this review do not support the hypothesis that introducing EAS reduces rates of non-assisted suicide. The disproportionate impact on older women indicates unmet suicide prevention needs in this population.

AB  - Objective: Sexual abuse is a major public health problem. Its disclosure to a health professional could help to reduce its impact on survivors' lives. The objective of this metasynthesis, combining a systematic review and an analysis of the qualitative studies, was to explore the qualitative literature concerning the experience of a survivor disclosing sexual violence experienced in childhood to a health professional, from the perspective of both. Methods and Data Sources: We used four databases and two journals (Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and SSCI, and the Journal of Sexual Abuse and Child Abuse and Neglect) to identify studies concerning this disclosure of sexual abuse to healthcare professionals from the point of view of the survivors and the health professionals. After assessing the methodological quality of the articles with the "Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP), " we conducted a thematic analysis of the data extracted during the review. Results: This review includes 20 articles, covering the data of 612 participants: 291 who were adults at the time of the study but abused in childhood, 152 minors, 14 parents of adolescents, and 155 healthcare professionals. Two themes emerged from the analysis: (1) the disclosure as experienced by the professionals, and (2) the disclosure as experienced by the survivors. Conclusion: Our results show that survivors had a diachronic approach to the experience of disclosure. They suggest a change over time in how survivors experience disclosure: relief and release were seen only among the adult participants, at a distance from - long after - the disclosure. This study made it possible to identify new perspectives for research in the field of child psychiatry and to formulate concrete clinical proposals, in particular, by applying the principle of patient experts to involve now-adult survivors in training and increase the awareness of the healthcare professionals concerned.

AB  - Introduction. - Sleep disorders are prevalent in patients with a neurocognitive disorder, and diagnosis and treatment in these patients remain challenging in clinical practice. Methods. - This narrative review offers a systematic approach to diagnose and treat sleep disorders in neurocognitive disorders. Results. - Alzheimer's disease is often associated with circadian rhythm disorders, chronic insomnia, and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. Alpha-synucleinopathies (e.g., Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia) are often associated with a rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, chronic insomnia, and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. A focused history allows to diagnose most sleep disorders. Clinicians should ensure to gather the following information in all patients with a neurocognitive disorder: (1) the presence of difficulties falling asleep or staying asleep, (2) the impact of sleep disturbances on daily functioning (fatigue, sleepiness and other daytime consequences), and (3) abnormal movements in sleep. Sleep diaries and questionnaires can assist clinicians in screening for specific sleep disorders. Polysomnography is recommended if a rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder or a sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome are suspected. Sleep complaints should prompt clinicians to ensure that comorbidities interfering with sleep are properly managed. The main treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome remains continuous positive airway pressure, as its efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with neurocognitive disorders. Medications should also be reviewed, and time of administration should be optimized (diuretics and stimulating medications in the morning, sedating medications in the evening). Importantly, cholinesterase inhibitors (especially donepezil) may trigger insomnia. Switching to morning dosing or to an alternative drug may help. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is indicated to treat chronic insomnia in neurocognitive disorders. False beliefs regarding sleep should be addressed with the patient and their caregiver. The sleep environment should be optimized (decrease light exposure at night, minimize noise, avoid taking vital signs, etc.). Sleep restriction can be considered as patients with a neurocognitive disorder often spend too much time in bed. The need for naps should be assessed case by case as naps may contribute to insomnia in some patients but allow others to complete their diurnal activities. Trazodone (50 mg) may also be used under certain circumstances in chronic insomnia. Recent evidence does not support a role for exogenous melatonin in patients with a neucognitive disorder and insomnia. Patients in long-term care facilities are often deprived of an adequate diurnal exposure to light. Increasing daytime exposure to light may improve sleep and mood. Patients with circadian rhythm disorders can also benefit from light therapy (morning bright light therapy in case of phase delay and evening bright light therapy in case of phase advance). Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder can lead to violent behaviors, and the sleeping environment should be secured (e.g., mattress on the floor, remove surrounding objects). Medication exacerbating this disorder should be stopped if possible. High dose melatonin (6 to 18 mg) or low dose clonazepam (0.125-0.25 mg) at bedtime may be used to reduce symptoms. Melatonin is preferred in first-line as it is generally well tolerated with few side effects.
   Patients with restless legs syndrome should be investigated for iron deficiency. Medication decreasing dopaminergic activity should be reduced or stopped if possible. Behavioral strategies such as exercise and leg massages may be beneficial. Low-dose dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole 0.125 mg two hours before bedtime) can be used to treat the condition, but a prolonged treatment may paradoxically worsen the symptoms. Alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands can also be used while monitoring for the risk of falls. Conclusion. - Multiple and sustained nonpharmacological approaches are recommended for the treatment of sleep disturbances in patients with neurocognitive disorder. Pharmacological indications remain limited, and further randomized clinical trials integrating a multimodal approach are warranted to evaluate the treatment of sleep disorders in specific neurocognitive disorders.

AB  - In this meta-analysis, we synthesized the results of randomized controlled trials of different exercise training interventions on participants' feelings of fatigue, energy, and vitality. The search of studies was conducted using six databases as well as several other supplementary search strategies available before December 2021. The initial search generated over 3,600 articles with 81 studies (7,050 participants) and 172 effects meeting the inclusion criteria. We analyzed the effects from the studies using a meta-analytic multivariate model and considered the potential moderating effect of multiple variables. Our analysis revealed exercise to decrease the feelings of fatigue by a small effect size (g = -0.374; 95% CI [-0.521, -0.227]), increase energy by a small-to-moderate effect size (g = 0.415; 95% CI [0.252, 0.578]), and to increase the feeling of vitality by a moderate effect size (g = 0.537; 95% CI [0.404, 0.671]). All main results remained robust after several sensitivity analyses using different statistical estimators, and consideration of outlier and influential studies. Moreover, moderator analyses revealed significant effects of exercise intensity and intervention duration on fatigue, exercise intensity, and modality on energy, and participant health, exercise intensity modality, and exercise training location on vitality. We conclude that when groups adopt a moderate intensity exercise training program while participating in a randomized trial, compared to controls, this typically results in small-to-moderate average improvements in feelings of fatigue, energy, and vitality.

AB  - Accumulation of impaired mitochondria and energy metabolism disorders are non-negligible features of both aging and age-related neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A growing number of studies suggest that mitophagy disorders play an important role in AD occurrence and development. The interaction between mitophagy deficits and A beta or Tau pathology may form a vicious cycle and cause neuronal damage and death. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of mitophagy and its role in AD may provide insights into the etiology and mechanisms of AD. Defective mitophagy is a potential target for AD prevention and treatment.

AB  - Clinical research into serotonergic psychedelics is expanding rapidly, showing promising efficacy across myriad disorders. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a commonly used strategy to identify psychedelic-induced changes in neural pathways in clinical and healthy populations. Here we, a large group of psychedelic imaging researchers, review the 42 research articles published to date, based on the 17 unique studies evaluating psychedelic effects on rs-fMRI, focusing on methodological variation. Prominently, we observe that nearly all studies vary in data processing and analysis methodology, two datasets are the foundation of over half of the published literature, and there is lexical ambiguity in common outcome metric terminology. We offer guidelines for future studies that encourage coherence in the field. Psychedelic rs-fMRI will benefit from the development of novel methods that expand our understanding of the brain mechanisms mediating its intriguing effects; yet, this field is at a crossroads where we must also consider the critical importance of consistency and replicability to effectively converge on stable representations of the neural effects of psychedelics.

AB  - Growing demands stimulate the intensification of production and create the need for practices that are both economically viable and environmentally sustainable. As European Union banned the use of antibiotics in production in 2003, several alternative treatments have been suggested, including probiotics. The first probiotic study in aquaculture was published in 1986, and since then probiotics have been considered as a beneficial tool in this industry. Today current evidence suggests that administration of certain probiotic strains might be able to enhance growth rate, improve the welfare of different fish species by modulating gut microbiota, improve physiological functions, such as metabolism, digestion, immunity, stress tolerance, intestinal histology, and disease resistance. Even though lactic acid bacteria and Bacillus spp. are the most frequently used probiotics in aquaculture, numerous studies have been published on other interesting probiotics. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to summarize, comment, and discuss the current knowledge related to the effects of Aeromonas, Aliivibrio, Alteromonas, Arthrobacter, Bifidobacterium, Brochothrix, Clostridium, Enterovibrio, Kocuria, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Paenibacillus, Phaeobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, Rhodopseudomonas, Rhodosporidium, Roseobacter, Shewanella and Vibrio as probiotics in finfish aquaculture, and present general information on their presence in the gastrointestinal tract of finfish. Moreover, some considerations for future studies are also indicated.

KW  - SOCIAL DETERMINANTS
KW  - REDUCE
KW  - CARE
AB  - Racial, ethnic, and other mental health disparities have been documented for several decades. However, progress in reducing or eliminating these disparities has been slow. In this review, the authors argue that understanding and addressing mental health disparities requires using a multidimensional lens that encompasses a wide array of social determinants of health at individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal levels. However, much of the current research on mental health disparities, including research funded by the National Institutes of Health, is characterized by a narrower focus on a small number of determinants. The authors offer a research framework, adapted from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, that provides examples of determinants that may cause or sustainmental health disparities and that can serve as intervention targets to reduce those disparities. They also discuss different types ofmental health disparities research to highlight the need for more research testing and implementing interventions that directly modify social determinants of health and promote mental health equity.

AB  - Aggression in adolescence is an important antecedent of an antisocial developmental pathway. Research on the stress responsivity system, specifically, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS), has been instrumental in understanding the development of aggression, yet a recent overview of research on these bio-behavioral associations is currently lacking. We synthesized and analyzed literature since 2011 on HPA-axis (i.e., cortisol) and ANS (i.e., heart rate and skin conductance) measures during rest and stress, with aggression in adolescence (11-19 years). We considered general aggression as well as its subclassifications (e.g., proactive, reactive aggression), and included both self-/other-reports, and laboratory aggression. A literature search (PubMed, Embase, APA PsycINFO) was performed up to March 19, 2021. Sixteen-hundred-fourteen records were screened for eligibility, 28 articles were included in the final synthesis. Although base measures (lower basal cortisol and resting heart rate) related to higher levels of aggression fairly consistently, studies assessing HPA-axis and ANS reactivity yield mixed findings, possibly due to variations in tasks used to evoke reactivity. Furthermore, tentative evidence suggests that lowered arousal relates to proactive forms of aggression, while higher arousal relates to reactive forms of aggression. Finally, the studies show that psychological and social factors, in particular social adversity, internalizing problems, and empathy, impact the association between neurobiological measures and aggression. We recommend that future studies consider different types of aggression using multiple measurement instruments, multiple reactivity tasks, and include a psychosocial assessment. Together, we advocate for a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to understand what drives aggression in adolescence.

AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a group of conditions associated with the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and characterized by somatic and neuropsychological alterations. On the other hand, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by a multifaceted neurobehavioral syndrome. Since alcohol can affect every stage of brain development, some authors hypothesized that in utero alcohol exposure might be linked to an increased risk of ASD in subjects with genetic vulnerability. The present review aimed to summarize the available literature on the possible association between FASD and ASD, also focusing on the reported clinical overlaps and on the possible shared pathogenic mechanisms. Studies in this field have stressed similarities and differences between the two conditions, leading to controversial results. The available literature also highlighted that both the disorders are often misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, stressing the need to broaden the perspective, paying specific attention to milder presentations and sub-syndromic traits.

AB  - This paper contains a narrative review of the literature in the field of school-based mind-body interventions (MBIs). The aim of the current review is to verify whether the school-based MBI programs implemented in primary and secondary schools over the past 5 years are effective in helping schoolchildren cope with stress-related, behavioral, and affective issues, as well as improve stress response and school performance. All articles were retrieved using a number of databases. Inclusion criteria comprised qualitative and quantitative, English language, and peer-reviewed studies among third graders (8-9 years old) to twelfth graders (17-18 years old), including special needs pupils. Qualitative studies were limited to pupils' experience only. Ten studies meeting the criteria for this review were assessed. The school-based interventions included yoga-based programs and mindfulness training. Evidence was evaluated and summarized. Across the reviewed studies, we found support for MBIs as part of school curricula to reduce negative effects of stress and promote overall well-being with caveats to consider in choosing specific programs. The practical implications of the current review include considerations related to the incorporation of MBIs in school curricula, which would likely benefit schoolchildren.

AB  - Food strategies are currently used to improve inflammation and oxidative stress conditions in chronic pain which contributes to a better quality of life for patients. The main purpose of this systematic review is to analyze the effectiveness of different dietary strategies as part of the treatment plan for patients suffering from chronic pain and decreased health. PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cambridge Core, and Oxford Academy databases were used to review and to appraise the literature. Randomized clinical trials (RCT), observational studies, and systematic reviews published within the last 6 years were included. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale, the PEDro Internal Validity (PVI), the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a variety of fields (QUALSYT), and the Quality Assessment Tool of Systematic Reviews scale were used to evaluate the risk of bias of the included studies. A total of 16 articles were included, of which 11 were RCTs and 5 were observational studies. Six of them showed an improvement in pain assessment, while two studies showed the opposite. Inflammation was shown to be decreased in four studies, while one did not show a decrease. The quality of life was shown to have improved in five studies. All of the selected studies obtained good methodological quality in their assessment scales. In the PVI, one RCT showed good internal validity, five RCTs showed moderate internal quality, while five of them were limited. Current research shows that consensus on the effects of an IF diet on pain improvement, in either the short or the long term, is lacking. A caloric restriction diet may be a good long term treatment option for people suffering from pain. Time restricted food and ketogenic diets may improve the quality of life in chronic conditions. However, more studies analyzing the effects of different nutritional strategies, not only in isolation but in combination with other therapies in the short and the long term, are needed.

AB  - Psychosis is the most ineffable experience of mental disorder. We provide here the first co-written bottom-up review of the lived experience of psychosis, whereby experts by experience primarily selected the subjective themes, that were subsequently enriched by phenomenologically-informed perspectives. First-person accounts within and outside the medical field were screened and discussed in collaborative workshops involving numerous individuals with lived experience of psychosis as well as family members and carers, representing a global network of organizations. The material was complemented by semantic analyses and shared across all collaborators in a cloud-based system. The early phases of psychosis (i.e., premorbid and prodromal stages) were found to be characterized by core existential themes including loss of common sense, perplexity and lack of immersion in the world with compromised vital contact with reality, heightened salience and a feeling that something important is about to happen, perturbation of the sense of self, and need to hide the tumultuous inner experiences. The first episode stage was found to be denoted by some transitory relief associated with the onset of delusions, intense self-referentiality and permeated self-world boundaries, tumultuous internal noise, and dissolution of the sense of self with social withdrawal. Core lived experiences of the later stages (i.e., relapsing and chronic) involved grieving personal losses, feeling split, and struggling to accept the constant inner chaos, the new self, the diagnosis and an uncertain future. The experience of receiving psychiatric treatments, such as inpatient and outpatient care, social interventions, psychological treatments and medications, included both positive and negative aspects, and was determined by the hope of achieving recovery, understood as an enduring journey of reconstructing the sense of personhood and re-establishing the lost bonds with others towards meaningful goals. These findings can inform clinical practice, research and education. Psychosis is one of the most painful and upsetting existential experiences, so dizzyingly alien to our usual patterns of life and so unspeakably enigmatic and human.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The seasonal pattern (SP) of bipolar disorder (BD) has been accepted with its clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic consequences. It is interesting to study its epidemiological characteristics, such as the influence of gender on this pattern. Little research has been done in this regard thus missing the impact it could have.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review was carried out employing a bibliographic search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. After a selection process, 7 studies were included in the review. All articles studied the gender influence in participants with SP of BD. This systematic review aims to clarify the impact of gender and seasonality on BD and evaluate the clinical differences based on gender.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The initial search showed a total of 96 articles, 7 of which met the inclusion criteria. Women present SP associated with manic, depressive, or mixed episodes; however, men predominately present depressive episodes. Men are more often associated with BD type II and depressive episodes whereas women with rapid cycling and eating disorders. Male manic episodes are associated with psychotic symptoms with greater severity in admissions. Women appear to have a higher risk of SP than men, with the clinical and prognostic repercussions that this entails.
   CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of the SP in BD continues to be a fundamental challenge. It was found that gender influences both the clinical characteristics and the course, management, and prognosis of bipolar disorders seasonality.

AB  - Background and aim: A wide range of studies indicates that men and women with Problem (PrG) and Pathological Gambling (PG) differ in several clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. However, evidence for sex differences, such as the telescoping effect, is contradictory, and it is still unclear whether sex differences observed in offline gambling can also be found for online gambling. Furthermore, reviews have so far focused on binary sex differences but neglect gender aspects. In this study, an updated literature survey of sex- and gender-related differences in PrG and PG was conducted. Methods: We searched PsyInfo, Medline/Pubmed, and the Web of Science databases from 2005 to 2020 for studies investigating sex and gender differences in gambling. A total of 126 papers were included in the literature survey. Results: We are presenting our findings according to the categories 'prevalence' (offline, online, LGBTQI*), 'sociodemographic factors', 'preferred gambling type', 'gambling motives', 'severity', 'progression of gambling problems', 'use of professional help/motivation for treatment', 'comorbidity', 'trauma', 'violence and criminality/delinquency'. The studies indicate that, despite some robust sex differences (e.g., concerning prevalence rates), results for most areas were mixed or suggest no sex differences (e.g., violence, gambling motives). Discussion and conclusion: To date, there is a lack of studies assessing gender, and not only sex, warranting further research in this area.

AB  - Background: This review examined the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) triggered by physical injury or medical trauma. It discusses implications in support of rehabilitation management for COVID-19 survivors diagnosed with PTSD. Methods: This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and the Interim Guidance from the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. The authors searched for randomized control trials in PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases up to 31 March 2021. Results: Five studies (n = 459) met the inclusion criteria. Each study measured a different comparison of interventions. The certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low for all outcomes. Post-traumatic stress disorder symptom reduction was found to be in favor of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive function improvements were observed in favor of the cognitive processing therapy control intervention. Conclusions: Overall, there is uncertainty about whether behavioral interventions are effective in reducing PTSD symptoms and improving functioning and quality of life when the disorder is triggered by a physical or medical trauma rather than a psychological trauma. Further research should investigate their efficacy in the context of rehabilitation management and gather evidence on this population.

AB  - Current trends in quantitative health research have highlighted the inadequacy of the usual operationalisation of sex and gender, resulting in a growing demand for more nuanced options. This scoping review provides an overview of recent instruments for the operationalisation of sex and gender in health-related research beyond a concept of mutually exclusive binary categories as male or masculine vs. female or feminine. Our search in three databases (Medline, Scopus and Web of Science) returned 9935 matches, of which 170 were included. From these, we identified 77 different instruments. The number and variety of instruments measuring sex and/or gender in quantitative health-related research increased over time. Most of these instruments were developed with a US-American student population. The majority of instruments focused on the assessment of gender based on a binary understanding, while sex or combinations of sex and gender were less frequently measured. Different populations may require the application of different instruments, and various research questions may ask for different dimensions of sex and gender to be studied. Despite the clear interest in the development of novel sex and/or gender instruments, future research needs to focus on new ways of operationalisation that account for their variability and multiple dimensions.

AB  - The degradation of neurons marks as the pathological reason for onset of most of the neurological diseases although the functional deficiencies and symptoms may vary. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) boosts regeneration of both motor and sensory neurons and thus presents as a potential treatment in management of neurological disorders. IGF-I is a pleiotropic agent which stimulates the survival and outgrowth of neurons accompanied by their motility as well as myelination by glial cells. This hormone has been found to possess neuroprotective properties which is in association with its antioxidant and mitochondrial protection activity. Studying and exploring the signaling pathways which mediate pleotropic responses intracellularly have elucidated significant therapeutic approach in treatment and management of neurological disorders by IGF-I. The current review highlights the role of IGF-I in management of major neurological disorders such as depression, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease and also covers the mechanisms involved in the process.

AB  - Judges are the central actors in the organization and functioning of the judicial system. Concerns about work efficiency, driven by the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice, led countries to adopt a set of reforms in line with private sector ideals applied to the public field to better manage their financial and human resources. In the last decades, the Portuguese judicial system has undergone a reform based on New Public Management principles by adopting the new Law on the Organization of the Judiciary System (LOSJ), significantly altering judges' duties, who beyond their traditional role of applying the law, perform the additional role of court-of-law judge-manager. The objective of this study is to explore the influence of role conflict and role ambiguity in occupational burnout among judges and to analyze the influence of calling orientation as a moderating variable, so as to present a conceptual model of role-stress management among the judiciary. Theoretically, this work contributes to the literature on role-stress management through its introduction of calling moderation, as well as to the literature on the positive influence of calling on burnout. In terms of its practical implications, the work contributes to a reconsideration of the current organizational structure of judicial work.

AB  - Introduction: Irish Travellers are an indigenous ethnic minority (IEM) with poor health outcomes. Whilst they constitute less than 1% of the Irish population, they account for 10% of national young adult male suicide statistics.
   Methods: A rapid review of scientific publications related to mental health and suicide in Irish Travellers was undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches of PubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were performed. Eligibility criteria included: (i) Irish Travellers/Gypsy Travellers; (ii) information on mental health/suicide/self-harm; (iii) psychosocial anthropological perspectives of mental health; (iv) publications in english. Data on studies including design, methods, participants and key findings were extracted using a spreadsheet template.
   Results: From 5160 scientific references over the past 20 years, 19 papers made reference to Traveller mental health, and only 5 papers made specific data-based reference to suicide in Travellers. It was only when we qualified Travellers as being 'Irish Travellers' in our scientific review did we detect meaningful references to their existence as an IEM, and their health and well-being. Due to sample sizes and heterogeneity in design, results were synthesised narratively.
   Discussion: This paper draws together strands from the disciplines of psycho/socio/anthropological perspectives to gain deeper insights into mental health and suicide in Irish Travellers. In a knowledge vacuum, it behoves the scientific community to explain the value of scientific research and rigour to both policymakers as well as Travellers, shifting the existing discourse towards new knowledge and understanding around mental health and suicide in Travellers.

AB  - Background: Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is widening pre-pandemic health, social, and economic inequalities between refugees, migrants, and asylum seekers and the general population. This global scoping review examined the impact of the pandemic on community-based asylum seekers and undocumented migrants in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest Central. We applied Katikireddi's framework of understanding and addressing inequalities to examine the differential impact of the pandemic across exposure, vulnerability to infection, disease consequences, social consequences, effectiveness of control measures, and adverse consequences of control measures. Results: We included 32 articles in the review. The analysis showed that asylum seekers and undocumented migrants experienced greater exposure to the COVID-19 virus and higher infection rates. They also experienced differential social consequences in the form of job loss and lost and/or reduced work hours. The effectiveness of pandemic response measures on asylum seekers and undocumented migrants was also affected by pre-pandemic social and economic marginalisation, exclusion from pandemic-induced policy measures, lack of appropriate pandemic communication, and variable trust in governments and authority. Pandemic control measures had greater adverse consequences on asylum seekers and undocumented migrants than the general population, with the majority of studies included in this review reporting worsened mental health and social isolation conditions and reduced access to health care. Conclusions: Asylum seekers and undocumented migrants experienced a disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the six thematic areas of comparison. Policies that reduce exposure and vulnerability to the infection, grant equitable access to health and social care, and build capacities and resilience, are critical to enable asylum seekers and undocumented migrants to cope with and recover from pre-pandemic and pandemic-induced inequalities.

AB  - Background: Hardiness is one of the personality traits that can help individuals in stressful situations. Since human beings are constantly under stressful situations and the stresses inflicted on people in each situation are different, various scales have been developed for assessing this feature among different people in different situations. Hence, it becomes necessary for researchers and health workers to assess this concept with valid and reliable scales. This systematic review aims to rigorously assess the methodological quality and psychometric properties of hardiness scales. Method: In the first step, the databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of science, and Persian databases were searched using suitable keywords without limitation time. We select eligible suitable studies after screening titles and abstracts. The quality of studies was evaluated using the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist and the Terwee quality criteria. Result: Of the 747 articles identified, 33 articles were entered in this study. Based on the COSMIN checklist, the most reported properties were as following structural validity (84%), hypothesis testing (56%), content validity (42%), and internal consistency (39%). Furthermore, 12 studies reported cross-cultural validity, three studies criterion validity, and one study reported measurement error. Conclusion: The "family caregivers' hardiness scale, " "Japanese Athletic Hardiness Scale, " "Occupational Hardiness Questionnaire, " and "Children's Hardiness Scale " are the best tools for assessing hardiness in family caregivers, athletes, employees, and children respectively. In addition, the "Dispositional Resilience Scale " (DRS-15) and The Personal Views Survey (PVS III-R) are the most frequently used scales with suitable features for measuring hardiness in the general population.

AB  - We aimed to provide an overview of how work environment and occupational health are affected, and describe interventions designed to improve the work environment during epidemics and pandemics. The guidelines on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) were followed. The databases Cinahl, Medline, PsycInfo, and Web of Science were searched for population: working population; exposure: coronavirus epidemic or pandemic; and outcome: work environment, in articles published until October 2020. Quality assessment was based on a modified version of the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). After deduplication 3711 articles remained, of which 530 were selected for full-text screening and 119 for quality assessment. After the exclusion of studies that were low quality, 95 remained, of which 85 focused on healthcare personnel and 10 on employees in other industries; 73 used quantitative methods and 22 used qualitative or mixed methods; the majority were based on cross-sectional data. Healthcare staff experienced increased job demands, poor leadership, and lack of resources (personal protective equipment, personnel, and competence). High demands and work with infected patients were associated with negative mental health outcomes. There was a lack of studies assessing interventions, studies from industries other than healthcare, and studies of high quality.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to identify the main factors affecting the training process of para-athletes, as well as the barriers they encounter. For this purpose, a systematic review was carried out in accordance with the PRISMA declaration guidelines, in which six databases were analysed (Web of Science, Scopus, SportDiscus, Pubmed, Eric, and PsycInfo). A total of 19 articles were selected for analysis after applying the inclusion criteria. The results show that the figures of the coach and families in the sporting and social contexts, respectively, had a relevant influence on the training process of para-athletes. Furthermore, in terms of psychological aspects, stress reduction, the importance of self-esteem, and motivation were highlighted. On the other hand, there are some barriers hindering the training and performance of athletes, which are related to the lack of financial support, lack of visibility in the media, and dependence on other people. These considerations can be of great help to coaches and competent institutions in the field (Paralympic committees, federations, etc.) in order to improve the training process and performance of para-athletes and to eliminate the barriers encountered by this group, promoting policies which facilitate access to sports for people with disabilities.

AB  - Groundwater, the world's largest and most exploited freshwater resource is a crucial ingredient for global socioeconomic development. However, the domination of human-induced drivers such as climate change, rapid demographic escalation, alteration in land use, industrialisation, and an increase in water demand has further stressed the unfrozen freshwater resources. This review provides a comprehensive literature-based analysis on different assessment methodologies for groundwater governance, and critically analysed the applicability and knowledge gaps in the assessment methodologies for evaluating groundwater governance under climatic and nonclimatic stresses. Furthermore, in the absence of a designated groundwater governance framework under stress, the study emphasized the need for developing a ready-to-use groundwater governance framework to assess the existing state of governance, tackling the prevailing knowledge gaps. A multidimensional framework consisting of key groundwater governance elements, the inclusion of the vulnerable and marginalised groups, current and future stressors, and an approach for aggregating multiple elements would overcome the limitations in previous assessment methodologies. Additionally, this framework would contribute to understanding current governance provisions and the capacity to manage those provisions, realise the strengths, gaps, and areas for improvement, and quantitatively visualise the prevailing state of groundwater governance for planning multiple strategies to possible threats and conflicts from the stresses.

AB  - Eco-driving guidance refers to courses, warnings, or suggestions provided to human drivers to improve driving behaviour to enable less energy use and emissions. This paper reviews existing eco-driving guidance studies and identifies challenges to tackle in the future. We summarize two categories of current guidance systems, static and dynamic, distinguished by whether real-world driving records are used to generate behaviour guidance or not. We find that influencing factors, such as the content of suggestions, the display methods, and drivers' socio-demographic characteristics, have varied effects on the guidance results across studies. Drivers are reported to have basic eco-driving knowledge, while the question of how to motivate the acceptance and practice of such behaviour, especially in the long term, is overlooked. Adaptive driving suggestions based on drivers' individual habits can improve the effectiveness and acceptance while this field is under investigation. In-vehicle assistance presents potential safety issues, and visualized in-vehicle assistance is reported to be most distractive. Given existing studies focusing on the operational level, a common agreement on the guidance design and associated influencing factors has yet to be reached. Research on the systematic and tactical design of eco-driving guidance and in-vehicle interaction is advised.

AB  - Cadmium pollution of soil threatens the environmental quality and human health. Phytoremediation of cadmium-contaminated soil has attracted global attention in recent decades. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature on phytoremediation of cadmium-contaminated soil based on bibliometric analysis. A total of 5494 articles published between 1994 and 2021 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Our knowledge mapping presented the authors, journals, countries, institutions, and other basic information to understand the development status of phytoremediation of cadmium-contaminated soil. Based on a keyword cluster analysis, the identified major research domains were "biochar", "Thlaspi caerulescens", "endophytic bacteria", "oxidative stress", "EDTA", and "bioconcentration factor". Overall, this study provided a detailed summary of research trends and hotspots. Based on the keyword co-occurrence and burst analysis, the core concepts and basic theories of this field were completed in 2011. However, the pace of theoretical development has been relatively slow. Finally, future research trends/frontiers were proposed, such as biochar addition, rhizosphere bacterial community manipulation, cadmium subcellular distribution, and health risk assessment.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer people and minority gender identities and sexualities (LGBTIQ+) are often stigmatized and experience discrimination in health care settings, leading to poorer mental health outcomes and unmet needs compared to heterosexual and cisgendered peers. It is thus imperative that mental health providers consider and address structural challenges in order to reduce mental health inequalities of this population. This narrative review assessed the barriers that may prevent access to care and the pathways for care in LGBTIQ + communities. PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and Scopus were searched for papers published between December 2021 and February 2022. A total of 107 papers were included with studies reflecting five themes: (1) Unmet mental health needs; (2) Young people; (3) Substance abuse and addiction; (4) Barriers and pathways to care; and (5) Interventions. Findings demonstrate that LGBTIQ + people experience stigmatization and higher rates of substance misuse and mental ill health, which may lead to barriers in accessing health care services, and fewer tailored interventions being provided. These findings have implications for policy, health care screening, and how specialist services are structured. Substantial gaps in the evidence-base exist, and future research should examine how mental health care providers can challenge social issues that maintain discriminatory and stigmatizing practices, and support LGBTIQ + individuals to sustain their resilience.

AB  - Background: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders are common in people living with HIV/AIDS and affect the adherence of patients to prescriptions, activities of daily living, and quality of life of patients. However, there is a lack of summative evidence in the area. The present meta-analysis was therefore addressing this gap. Methods: We did our electronic search in Psych-Info, EMBASE, Scopus, and PubMed. The retrieved articles were stored with the endnote reference manager and data was extracted using Meta-XL version 5.3. The quality of studies was evaluated with the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A random-effect model and STATA-16 were used to compute the average estimate of HAND. Heterogeneity was weighed with I-2 statistics. A sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were employed. The existence/nonexistence of a publication bias was checked with the Eggers test of publication bias. Results: The average prevalence of HAND was 50.41% (95% CI: 45.56, 55.26). The average estimate of HAND in Europe was found to be 50.015% whereas in Africa, Asia, and the United States of America (USA) it was 49.566, 52.032, and 50.407% respectively. The prevalence of HAND in studies that used the HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) was 36.883% and 59.956% at cutoff points of IHDS < 9.5 and IHDS < 10 respectively. Besides, the estimated average of HAND with the global dementia scale (GDS) was 40.766%. The prevalence of HAND in cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies was 49.52, 54.087, and 44.45% in that order. Socio-demographic variables; low level of education and older age, clinical and HIV related variables; the advanced stage of the illness and CD4 count of 500 cells/dl or less and psychological variables such as comorbidity of depression increases the risk of HAND. Conclusion: The prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders was about 50.41%. Low level of education and older age, clinical and HIV related variables such as the advanced stage of the illness and CD4 count of 500 cells/dl or less, and comorbidity of depression were associated with HIV associated neurocognitive disorders. Public health interventions for HIV patients should target these essential problems.

AB  - BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated therapeutic potential for treating patients with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). However, the most effective target and stimulation frequency of rTMS for treating MUD remains unclear. This meta-analysis explored the effect of rTMS on MUD. MethodsIn this study, PubMed, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials were searched electronically for double-blind randomized controlled trials that used rTMS for treating MUD. We used published trials to investigate the efficacy of rTMS in MUD up to March 5, 2022, and pooled studies using a random-effect model to compare rTMS treatment effects. Patients who were diagnosed with MUD according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were recruited. Clinical craving scores between baseline and after rTMS were compared using the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The heterogeneity of the included trials was evaluated through a visual inspection of funnel plots and the I-2 statistic. ResultsWe identified seven trials with 462 participants with MUD that met the inclusion criteria. All the studies evaluated craving scores, with rTMS demonstrating a more significant effect than the sham treatment on reducing craving scores (SMD = 0.983, CI = 0.620-1.345, p <= 0.001). A subgroup meta-analysis revealed that intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) had a greater positive effect than 10-Hz rTMS. A metaregression revealed that the SMDs increased with the increase in baseline craving scores, whereas they decreased with the increase in the proportion of men and duration of abstinence. ConclusionThe meta-analysis suggests that rTMS may be associated with treatment effect on craving symptoms in patients with MUD. iTBS may have a greater positive effect on craving reduction than 10-z rTMS.

AB  - The environmental changes in the wetlands are one of the major problems facing us in recent decades. Lately, many fluctuations have been observed in Wadi El-Rayan lakes. The geo-spatial analysis plays a great role in detecting the changes in Wadi El-Rayan lakes. The aim of the current study is to enrich the knowledge about Wadi El-Rayan Depression and to identify the changes in its lakes (Upper Lake and Lower Lake) and land cover by integration between RS and GIS techniques. The Upper Lake has become completely full with relative stability in its water area of around 53.61 (+/- 2%) million m2, but the Lower Lake is markedly decreasing by 1.92 million m2 per year. It should be noted that it is hard to manage those artificial lakes because of human activities. These activities include reusing drainage water, land reclamation, and rapidly expanding aquaculture. Therefore, the optimum solution to this problem is to adjust water allocation within Wadi El-Rayan lakes by reducing the amount of water diverted for reuse, agriculture, and fish farms, or at least resecting the growth in these water uses to help stop or slow the decrease in Wadi El-Rayan lakes.

AB  - Background. The Global Burden of Disease attributable to psychotic disorders in African countries is high and has increased sharply in recent years. Yet, there is a scarcity of evidence on effective, appropriate and acceptable interventions for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders on the continent.
   Methods. We carried out a systematic review and narrative synthesis of peer-reviewed literature evaluating the impact of non-pharmacological interventions for adolescents and adults (10-65 years) in African countries. Two reviewers independently double-screened all articles and performed data extraction and quality appraisal using standardized tools.
   Results. Of the 8529 unique texts returned by our search, 12 studies were identified for inclusion, from seven countries: Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Sudan. They evaluated a range of interventions with one or more clinical, psychological or psychosocial, education or awareness or traditional or faith-based components, and were delivered by either mental health specialists or non-specialist health workers. Ten of the 12 included studies reported significant, positive effects on a range of outcomes (including functioning, symptoms and stigma). Nearly half of the interventions were based out of health facilities. Based on quality appraisals, confidence in these studies' findings is only rated low to medium. Conclusion. Further research is needed to develop and evaluate interventions that meet the diverse needs of people with psychosis, within and beyond the health sector.

AB  - This meta-analytic study investigates the effectiveness of different interventions in alleviating loneliness among Chinese older adults aged 50 years and above. We searched eight English databases, four Chinese databases, and grey literature. Thirty-four studies, including four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 30 quasi-experimental studies, were eventually included in the meta-analysis (n = 3843). Quality appraisal indicated risks of bias in the included studies. The pooled effect size was large and significant (Hedge's g = 0.84, 95% CI [0.54, 1.15]), indicating the effectiveness of interventions in reducing loneliness. However, the effect size may be overestimated due to publication bias. Moderation analyses showed significant differences in effect sizes by study designs and regions of studies. Network meta-analysis (NMA) indicated that hybrid and psychological interventions appeared to be advantageous over others. In addition, group-based delivery modes can add extra benefits to the interventions. This study adds to the knowledge of the effectiveness of current interventions in reducing Chinese older people's loneliness. However, the findings need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively low study quality, considerable heterogeneity, and publication bias. Despite the limitations, this study offers valuable insights for future research, practice, and policy-making in reducing older people's loneliness.

AB  - Introduction Fear of hypoglycemia (FOH) is a phenomenon that affects people with diabetes experiencing hypoglycemia. On the one hand, FOH is an adaptive mechanism that helps to protect patients from hypoglycemia and its consequences. On the other hand, the non-normative level of FOH causes anxiety and tension, disturbs normal functioning, and makes normoglycemia maintenance difficult. Objective The main objective of this review was to describe factors influencing FOH and methods of measurement of FOH levels. Moreover, we highlighted the impact of the new technologies used in diabetes therapy on FOH and different therapeutic possibilities helping patients cope with excessive levels of FOH. We also presented clinical cases of patients with high FOH levels met in clinical practice and discussed methods to better diagnose and assist people with this kind of problem. Methods We searched for studies and articles via PubMed using the keywords fear of hypoglycemia, diabetes, and hypoglycemia. From screened documents identified from literature search, 67 articles were included in our review. Results We divided results from literature screening into five parts: fear of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia definition, risk factors for the FOH, methods of measuring levels of FOH, therapies for the FOH, and modern technologies. We also described clinical examples of abnormal fear of hypoglycemia in patients. Conclusion The review highlights the importance of taking into consideration fear of hypoglycemia phenomenon in diabetic patients in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - Abiotic stresses of various chemical contamination of physical, inorganic, organic and biotoxin origin and biotic stresses of bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal origins are the significant constraints in achieving higher aquaculture production. Testing and rapid detection of these chemical and microbial contaminants are crucial in identifying and mitigating abiotic and biotic stresses, which has become one of the most challenging aspects in aquaculture and culture-based fisheries. The classical analytical techniques, including titrimetric methods, spectrophotometric, mass spectrometric, spectroscopic, and chromatographic techniques, are tedious and sometimes inaccessible when required. The development of novel and improved bioanalytical methods for rapid, selective and sensitive detection is a wide and dynamic field of research. Biosensors offer precise detection of biotic and abiotic stressors in aquaculture and culture-based fisheries within no time. This review article allows filling the knowledge gap for detection and monitoring of chemical and microbial contaminants of abiotic and biotic origin in aquaculture and culture-based fisheries using nano(bio-) analytical technologies, including nano(bio-)molecular and nano(bio-)sensing techniques.

AB  - Background There remains a disproportionally high tobacco smoking rate in low-income populations. Multicomponent tobacco dependence interventions in theory are effective. However, which intervention components are necessary to include for low socioeconomic status (SES) populations is still unknown. Objective To assess the effectiveness of multicomponent tobacco dependence interventions for low SES and create a checklist tool examining multicomponent interventions. Methods EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published with the primary outcome of tobacco smoking cessation measured at 6 months or post intervention. RCTs that evaluated tobacco dependence management interventions (for reduction or cessation) in low SES (experience of housing insecurity, poverty, low income, unemployment, mental health challenges, illicit substance use and/or food insecurity) were included. Two authors independently abstracted data. Random effects meta-analysis and post hoc sensitivity analysis were performed. Results Of the 33 included studies, the number of intervention components ranged from 1 to 6, with smoking quit rates varying between 1% and 36.6%. Meta-analysis revealed that both the 6-month and 12-month outcome timepoints, multicomponent interventions were successful in achieving higher smoking quit rates than the control (OR 1.64, 95% Cl 1.41 to 1.91; OR 1.74, 95% Cl 1.30 to 2.33). Evidence of low heterogeneity in the effect size was observed at 6-month (I-2=26%) and moderate heterogeneity at 12-month (I-2=56%) outcomes. Conclusion Multicomponent tobacco dependence interventions should focus on inclusion of social support, frequency and duration of components. Employing community-based participatory-action research approach is essential to addressing underlying psychosocioeconomic-structural factors, in addition to the proven combination pharmacotherapies.

AB  - Dissociative disorders are an important group of trauma-related disorders associated with significant disability. The co-occurrence of dissociative disorders (DD) and symptoms (DS) in bipolar disorder has been relatively understudied, but there is some evidence that this comorbidity may have significant mechanistic and clinical implications. This paper presents the results of a scoping review of the frequency and correlates of DS and DD in bipolar disorder. Based on the available evidence, DS/DD are more common in bipolar disorder than in healthy controls or in unipolar depression, are related to childhood trauma, and are associated with psychotic symptoms, suicide attempts, and a poorer response to treatment in patients with bipolar disorder. The implications of these findings, and possible mechanistic pathways underlying them, are discussed based on the current literature. Clinicians should be aware of the frequent occurrence of significant DS or DD when treating patients with bipolar disorder. A tentative future research agenda for this field, based on clinical, risk factor-related and neurobiological considerations, is outlined.

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane libraries were searched till November 2021 to collect studies in relation to AAT that had been adopted in patients with dementia. Eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 825 participants were included. Compared with the control group, the AAT group showed a significant reduction in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), especially depression. However, no significant improvement was found in cognitive function, activities of daily living, agitation, or the quality of life. This meta-analysis shows that AAT can effectively reduce BPSD in patients with dementia.

AB  - Emotional self-regulation in childhood and adolescence constitutes a growing interest in the scientific community, highlighting in recent years the need to observe its development in their daily life. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to characterize publications referring to the development of emotional self-regulation of people under 18 years-old, in natural contexts. Based on the PRISMA guidelines, searches are carried out in the Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO databases, and in Google Scholar until May 2020. After reviewing the full text of 376 publications, 14 works are selected that are observed in their extrinsic, substantive and methodological characteristics based on the GREOM and MQCOM guidelines, by two independent evaluators. Most of the studies correspond to the last 20 years, increasing the interest in observing older children, in interaction with adults and/or in different cultures. They apply mixed methodologies, not always ascribing to a low intensity design. Strengths are observed regarding the collection and analysis of the quality of the data; and weaknesses related to the failure to record the duration and sequence of behaviors, highlighting the use of guidelines as guides for future research.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment is a core feature of disorders on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum, i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed to be a biomarker of cognitive impairment in these disorders as it plays a critical role in neuroplasticity and proposed to mediate some of the psychotropic effects of medication. However, despite numerous studies investigating the association between circulating BDNF and these disorders, no solid conclusions have been drawn regarding its involvement in cognitive impairment. Objectives: The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine blood BDNF levels and cognitive dysfunction in patients on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum as well as to evaluate whether circulating BDNF measurements can act as a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction. Methods: Studies were identified by searching Embase and Medline databases for English language articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2000 January and 2021 June according to the PRISMA guidelines. A total of 815 articles were identified of which 32 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review - reporting on comparisons between blood BDNF levels and cognitive functions of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder patients versus healthy controls (no studies involving schizoaffective patients were specifically obtained for the time being). Twenty-four of these studies (19 with schizophrenia and 5 with bipolar disorder patients) were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. Results: Our findings indicated that circulating BDNF levels were significantly reduced in patients experiencing an acute episode of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder compared to healthy controls. Cognitive function was also found to be significantly worse in patients, however, correlations between BDNF levels and cognitive impairment were not always detected. Interventions, especially pharmacotherapy seemed to improve certain aspects of cognition and increase circulating BDNF levels. Conclusion: Circulating BDNF alone does not seem to be a valid biomarker of cognitive dysfunction in patients with disorders on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum, owing to several confounding factors. Changes of the circulating levels of BDNF should be evaluated in a wider context of other stress-, immune-, and inflammatory-related factors.

AB  - While ketamine has been used clinically over the past decades, it has only been recently shown to be a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, ketamine and related dissociative agents may also be misused recreationally, creating significant concerns for abuse liability when prescribed for depression. Although the abuse potential of ketamine is widely recognized, there is limited evidence on the differential abuse liability of ketamine enantiomers, (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine. The current scoping review aims to summarize the extant literature on the abuse liability of (R,S)-ketamine and the enantiomers. A systematic search was conducted on the Embase, Medline, and APA PsycInfo databases from 1947 to July 29, 2021. Clinical and preclinical studies that assessed the abuse potential of (R,S)-ketamine, (S)-ketamine, and (R)-ketamine were screened and assessed for eligibility by two independent reviewers. A total of 65 eligible studies were identified; 55 were preclinical studies and 10 were clinical studies. Only 4 preclinical studies evaluated the abuse liability of ketamine enantiomers. Available preclinical evidence suggests that (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine have greater risk for abuse compared to (R)-ketamine. (R)-ketamine, at the antidepressant-relevant doses in rodents, appears to be safe with minimal liability for abuse. Although the abuse potential of (R,S)-ketamine is well-established in animals, limited clinical studies indicate that single or repeated ketamine administrations in professionally controlled settings did not result in misuse, dependence, diversion and/or gateway activity in patients with TRD. However, most clinical studies were retrospective and did not systematically evaluate the abuse liability of ketamine via validated psychological scales/questionnaires. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to ascertain the abuse liability of racemic, (S)- and (R)-ketamine in TRD population, especially among patients with comorbid substance use disorders.

AB  - Purpose Human health risk assessments of glyphosate have focused on animal toxicology data for determining neurotoxic potential. Human epidemiological studies have not yet been systematically reviewed for glyphosate neurotoxicity hazard identification. The objective of this systematic literature review was to summarize the available epidemiology of glyphosate exposure and neurological outcomes in humans. Methods As of December 2021, 25 eligible epidemiological studies of glyphosate exposure and neurological endpoints were identified and assessed for five quality dimensions using guidance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Studies that assessed personal use of glyphosate were prioritized, whereas those assessing indirect exposure (other than personal use) were rated as low quality, since biomonitoring data indicate that indirect metrics of glyphosate exposure almost always equate to non-detectable glyphosate doses. Results Overall, the scientific evidence on glyphosate and neurotoxicity in humans is sparse and methodologically limited, based on nine included epidemiological studies of neurodegenerative outcomes (two high quality), five studies of neurobehavioral outcomes (two high quality), six studies of neurodevelopmental outcomes (none high quality), and five studies of other and mixed neurological outcomes (one high quality). The five high-quality studies showed no association between glyphosate use and risk of depression, Parkinson disease, or peripheral nerve conduction velocity. Results were mixed among the eight moderate-quality studies, which did not demonstrate consistent associations with any neurological endpoints or categories. Low-quality studies were considered uninformative about possible neurotoxic effects due primarily to questionable assessments of indirect exposure. Conclusions No association has been demonstrated between glyphosate and any neurological outcomes in humans. To move the state of science forward, epidemiological studies should focus on scenarios involving direct and frequent use of glyphosate while collecting information on validated health outcomes, concomitant agricultural exposures, and relevant personal characteristics.

AB  - Background: Homocysteine (Hcy) has been confirmed to be associated with depression, but its relationship with poststroke depression (PSD) remains controversial. So far, there is no meta-analysis of the correlation between Hcy level in acute stroke and PSD.
   Methods: Asystematic search of a sub-database of studies reporting the level of Hcy in the acute phase of ischemic stroke and PSD as of November 2021 was performed. Data extraction was performed strictly according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All data were analyzed using STATA 11.0. The standardized root mean square difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to compare continuous variables.
   Results: A total of 11 studies were included in this study, including 2789 participants. The results of this meta-analysis showed that admission the levels of Hcy were significantly higher in PSD survivors, compared to non-PSD survivors (SMD = 0.37, 95%CI = 0.07-0.66, P<.001). Subgroup analysis showed that survivors with PSD diagnosed more than 3 months after stroke had significantly different the levels of from non-PSD survivors (6 months: SMD = 0.61, 95%CI = 0.40-0.82, 9 months: SMD = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.59-1.41).
   Conclusion: The level of Hcy in the acute phase of ischemic stroke is a risk factor for PSD.

However, several current challenges of BES-based metal removal and recovery, especially concentrating target metals from complex contaminated wastewater or soil and their economic feasibility of engineering applications. This review summarized the applications of BES-based metal removal and recovery systems from wastewater and contaminated soil and evaluated their performances on electricity generation and metal removal/recovery efficiency. In addition, an in depth review of several key parameters (BES configurations, electrodes, catalysts, metal concentration, pH value, substrate categories, etc.) of BES-based metal removal and recovery was carried out to facilitate a deep understanding of their development and to suggest strategies for scaling up their specific application fields. Finally, the future intervention on multifunctional BES to improve their performances of mental removal and recovery were revealed.

Despite a proliferation of peer mentoring programs, there is little consensus as to what approaches are effective and even less published data on the impact of such programs on student outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe peer mentoring programs for autistic college students and understand whether they are improving outcomes. The search identified 21 articles, with half reporting student outcomes data. Most programs provided weekly one-on-one mentoring individualized to student needs and offered additional supports (e.g., social skills group). Among them, three tracked academic outcomes, three reported non-academic outcomes, and one followed both academic and non-academic outcomes.

AB  - IntroductionMuch of the published literature on suicide comes from high income countries. In countries such as India, female suicide rates exceed the global suicide rate and suicide rates found in their male counterparts. Results from previous studies indicate that factors related to suicide among men and women in India are different from those seen in high-income countries. To date, no reviews have considered the relationship between gender and suicide in India. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of existing literature reporting gender differences in suicide rates, methods, risk factors and antecedent factors in India by reviewing published studies. MethodA scoping review was conducted to map the existing literature on gender differences in suicide in India. To identify peer-reviewed publications, online databases PsycINFO and Embase were searched. The search terms were [suicid* AND India*]. The searches took place in November 2020 and May 2021, with no language restrictions. Articles published from 2014 onwards from India were included. Reference lists of selected studies were searched for studies that could meet the inclusion criteria. ResultsThis review identified 17 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The ratio between women and men who die by suicide in India is much lower than in high-income countries. Hanging was found to be a more commonly used method of suicide among both men and women, in comparison to high-income countries where hanging is more common among men. This review also identified several gaps in the literature. There were few studies that examined suicide among transgender Indians. There was limited literature on gender differences in risk and protective factors for suicide. Limitations such as the omission of a lack of gender-based analyses in several studies and under-reporting of suicide rates were identified. ConclusionUnderstanding suicide within the context of individual countries is essential in designing culture-appropriate suicide prevention strategies. This review identified an urgent need to establish and evaluate suicide surveillance systems in India. Furthermore, additional research is warranted to understand suicide among individuals who identify outside the gender binary, and gender-specific risk and protective factors.

AB  - Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic diseases, including eczema, atopic dermatitis (AD), and allergic rhinitis (AR), have increased prevalence in recent decades. Recent studies have proved that environmental pollution might have correlations with IgE-mediated allergic diseases, but existing research findings were controversial. Thus, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis from published observational studies to evaluate the risk of long-term and short-term exposure to air pollutants on eczema, AD, and AR in the population (per 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 and PM10; per 1-ppb increase in SO2, NO2, CO, and O-3). PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched to identify qualified literatures. The Cochran Q test was used to assess heterogeneity and quantified with the I-2 statistic. Pooled effects and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate outcome effects. A total of 55 articles were included in the study. The results showed that long-term and short-term exposure to PM10 increased the risk of eczema (PM10, RRlong = 1.583, 95% CI: 1.328, 1.888; RRshort = 1.006, 95% CI: 1.003-1.008) and short-term exposure to NO2 (RRshort = 1.009, 95% CI: 1.008-1.011) was associated with eczema. Short-term exposure to SO2 (RRshort: 1.008, 95% CI: 1.001-1.015) was associated with the risk of AD. For AR, PM2.5 (RRlong = 1.058, 95% CI: 1.014-1.222) was harmful in the long term, and short-term exposure to PM10 (RRshort: 1.028, 95% CI: 1.008-1.049) and NO2 (RRshort: 1.018, 95% CI: 1.007-1.029) were risk factors. The findings indicated that exposure to air pollutants might increase the risk of IgE-mediated allergic diseases. Further studies are warranted to illustrate the potential mechanism for air pollutants and allergic diseases.

AB  - Introduction: The multiplicity and complexity of the neuronal connections in the central nervous system make it difficult to disentangle circuits that play an essential role in the development or treatment of (neuro)psychiatric disorders. By choosing the evolutionary development of the forebrain as a starting point, a certain order in the connections can be created. The dorsal diencephalic connection (DDC) system can be applied for the development of biomarkers that can predict treatment response. Materials and methods: After providing a brief introduction to the theory, we examined neuroanatomical publications on the connectivity of the DDC system. We then searched for neurochemical components that are specific for the habenula. Results and discussion: The best strategy to find biomarkers that reflect the function of the habenular connection is to use genetic variants of receptors, transporters or enzymes specific to this complex. By activating these with probes and measuring the response in people with different functional genotypes, the usefulness of biomarkers can be assessed. Conclusions: The most promising biomarkers in this respect are those linked to activation or inhibition of the nicotine receptor, dopamine D4 receptor, mu-opioid receptor and also those of the functioning of habenular glia cells (astrocytes and microglia).

AB  - Introduction: Adolescent connectedness, a key component of positive youth development, is associated with various positive health outcomes. Several measures have been developed to assess this construct. However, no study has summarized data on the existing measures of adolescent connectedness. We conducted this scoping review to fill this gap. We specifically aimed to: (i) identify the existing measures of adolescent connectedness, (ii) determine the most frequently used measures among the identified measures, and (iii) summarize the psychometric properties of these measures with a keen interest in highlighting their cross-cultural utility and validity. Methods: We searched CINAHL, Embase, PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for relevant articles published since database inception to 7th February 2021. Our search structure contained the key words "Adolescents ", "Connectedness ", and "Measures ". We also searched Open Gray for potentially relevant gray literature. Results: We identified 335 measures from 960 eligible studies assessing various domains of adolescent connectedness, including school, family, community, peer, ethnic, racial, cultural, religious/spiritual, and self-connectedness. Most of the included studies (72.1%) were from North America and Europe. Most of the measures (n = 132, 39.4%) were measures of school connectedness among adolescents. Of the identified measures, 60 of them met our criteria of frequently used measures (i.e., the top five most used measures per domain of connectedness). These frequently used measures were used across 481 of the included studies with 400 of them reporting their psychometric properties. The reported reliability of these measures was adequate (Cronbach's alpha & GE; 0.70) in 89.8% of these studies. These measures also appeared to be valid in terms of their face, content, construct, criterion, convergent, discriminant, concurrent, predictive, measurement invariance, and cross-cultural validity. Conclusions: There exists a wide array of measures of adolescent connectedness. Sixty of these measures have been frequently used across studies and appear to be reliable and/or valid. However, this evidence is mostly from North America and Europe. This is a reflection of the limitation of this review where only studies published in English were considered. It might also reflect the paucity of research in other regions of the world. More research is needed for clearer insights.

AB  - The prevalence of sleep dysfunction is considerably higher in the autistic population than in the non-autistic. Similarly, the incidence of sensory reactivity differences in autism exceeds that in the neurotypical population. The basis of sleep disorders in autism is multifactorial, but sensory integration/processing concerns may play a role. Research that investigates this interplay for autistic individuals is limited but vital. In this scoping review, we examined literature addressing the following research question: What is the relationship between sleep and sensory integration/processing in autism? We included articles if they were peer-reviewed, English or Spanish, purposefully addressed sensory integration/processing differences, were sleep focused and included autism as the primary diagnosis or population. Articles were excluded if the language was not English or Spanish, research was conducted with animals, they were non-peer-reviewed, the primary population was not autistic, the sensory focus reflected a specific sensorineural loss (e.g., blindness, or deafness), there was not a clear inclusion of sensory integration/processing or sleep. We searched six databases and included all citations from the inception of each database through June 2021. The search strategy identified 397 documents that were reduced to 24 included articles after exclusion criteria were applied. The majority of studies we identified characterized the relation between sleep and sensory integration/processing differences in autism. Investigators found multiple sleep concerns such as bedtime resistance, sleep anxiety, delayed sleep onset, night awaking, and short sleep duration in autistic individuals. Identified sensory concerns focused on reactivity, finding hyper- and hypo-reactivity as well as sensory seeking across sensory domains. Co-existence of sleep concerns and sensory integration/processing differences was frequently reported. Few intervention studies showed a clear sensory focus; those that did emphasized pressure, movement, touch, and individual sensory preferences/needs. Swimming programs and massage showed promising results. No studies were of high quality. At a minimum, there is a co-existence of sensory reactivity differences and sleep concerns in autistic children, and possibly autistic adults. The relationship between poor sleep and sensory integration/processing differences is complex and multi-faceted, requiring additional research. Interventions that purposefully include a central sensory component have not been well studied in autistic children or adults. Overall studies with greater rigor and purposeful use of sensation and sensorimotor supports as a component of intervention are needed. This study was not funded.

AB  - Background Mental health crisis presentations are common in those who have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD), and psychosocial interventions should be provided. However, there is limited evidence outlining what a crisis-focused psychosocial intervention for this population should include. Aims To conduct a systematic review and narrative synthesis of crisis-focused psychosocial interventions for people diagnosed with BPD. Method Three databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo) were searched for eligible studies. Studies were included if they were quantitative studies comparing a crisis-focused intervention with any control group and they included adults (18+ years of age) who were diagnosed with BPD (or with equivalent experiences). A narrative synthesis was undertaken to analyse results. Results A total of 3711 papers were initially identified, 95 full texts were screened and 5 studies were included in the review. Two of five studies reported on the same trial, so four individual trials were included. Overall moderate risk of bias across studies was identified. The review tentatively demonstrated that crisis-focused psychosocial interventions are feasible and acceptable to people with BPD and that they have potential impacts on outcomes such as self-harm and number of days spent in hospital. There is limited consensus on what outcome measures should be used to assess the impact of interventions. Conclusions There is presently insufficient data to recommend any specific psychosocial crisis intervention for people with BPD. Given the relationship between BPD and the high frequency of crises experienced by this group, further large-scale trials examining crisis-focused psychosocial interventions are required. Statement on language We acknowledge that the term personality disorder can be controversial and stigmatising. As the term borderline personality disorder has been retained in DSM-5 and is used in the research evidence base we have decided to use this term throughout this review. However, we recognise that this term may not be acceptable to all.

AB  - Objectives People who self-harm frequently present to the emergency department (ED) and are treated by generalist healthcare staff with no specialist mental health training. We systematically reviewed (i) training interventions for generalist ED providers and (ii) psychosocial interventions delivered predominantly by generalist ED providers for people who self-harm. Method Five databases were searched for studies reporting on training interventions for generalist ED staff (at least 50% of the sample needed to be generalist ED staff) or psychosocial interventions for people who self-harm delivered predominantly by generalist ED staff. No limitations were placed regarding study design/country. Narrative synthesis was conducted. Results Fifteen studies from high-income countries were included. Nine studies of moderate methodological quality evaluated training for generalist ED providers (n = 1587). Six studies of good methodological quality evaluated psychosocial interventions for adults who self-harm (n = 3133). Only one randomized controlled trial was identified. Training was linked with pre-post improvements in staff knowledge, and less consistently with improvement in skills, attitudes, and confidence. Evidence on patient outcomes was lacking. Patient-level interventions involving common suicide prevention strategies-safety planning and follow-up contact-were consistently linked to pre-post reductions in suicide attempts. Effects on treatment engagement and psychiatric admissions were unclear. Conclusions There is a clear need for further RCTs to improve the evidence base for ED generalist providers managing patients with self-harm. Evidence supports potential benefits of training for improving staff knowledge, attitudes, and skills, and of safety planning and follow-up contact for reducing repeat suicide attempts.

AB  - Despite the recognition of floodplain importance in the scientific community, floodplains are not afforded the same legal protection as river channels. In the United States alone, flood-related economic losses were much higher in the second half of the 20th century than the first half despite the expenditure of billions of dollars on flood defenses. Partially to blame are the low appraisal and understanding of human impacts to floodplain functions. Here, we explore the impacts of levees on floodplain functions and analyze case studies of floodplain restoration through levee removal. Floodplain functions include (1) fluxes of water, solutes, and particulate materials; (2) enhanced spatial heterogeneity of hydrology and biogeochemistry; (3) enhanced habitat abundance and diversity; (4) enhanced biomass and biodiversity; and (5) hazard mitigation. Case studies of floodplain restoration involving artificial levee adjustment are heavily concentrated in North America, Europe, and Japan, and those case studies assess floodplain functions within 30 years of restoration. In the United States, restoration through levee removal comprises less than 1% of artificial levee length and 1-2% of disconnected floodplains. In Europe, restoration effectiveness was severely limited by upstream flow regulation. Most case studies were impacted by stressors outside the study site and took place in lowland alluvial rivers. Reconfiguration was successful at achieving limited aims while reconnection set floodplains on a trajectory to more fully restore floodplain functions. Case studies illustrated the tension between restoration scale and study resolution in time and space as well as the role of site-specific characteristics in determining restoration outcomes. Numerous knowledge gaps surrounding the integrative relationships between floodplain functions must be addressed in future studies. The ubiquity of flow regulation demands that future floodplain restoration occur in a whole-of-basin manner. Monitoring of restoration must take place for longer periods of time and include multiple functions.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing evidence in literature addressing the relationship between video game participation and loneliness. The following databases were searched on October 2, 2021: Medline, Psychinfo, SportDiscus, Web of Science, and CINAHL. The risk of bias of cross-sectional study was assessed by using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies with attrition bias added for longitudinal studies. The results of all included studies were synthesized using narrative synthesis. Meta-analysis was utilized to synthesis the findings of the studies that had sufficient degree of statistical and methodological homogeneity. Eighteen studies were included in this systematic review, which comprised of 20,372 participants. The narrative synthesis showed mixed findings on the relationship between video game participation and loneliness. Meta-analysis that was conducted to nine cross-sectional studies revealed that video game participation was positively and weakly associated with loneliness (r = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.03-0.17). Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies demonstrated serious risk of bias with the addition of serious inconsistency of findings from cross-sectional studies. The existing literature is equivocal in terms of making a definitive judgment on the association between video game participation and loneliness. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021283025.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and affects approximately 2-3% of the population over the age of 65. PD is characterised by the loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra, leading to debilitating motor symptoms including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. PD also results in a host of non-motor symptoms such as cognitive decline, sleep disturbances and depression. Although existing therapies can successfully manage some motor symptoms for several years, there is still no means to halt progression of this severely debilitating disorder. Animal models used to replicate aspects of PD have contributed greatly to our current understanding but do not fully replicate pathological mechanisms as they occur in patients. Because of this, there is now great interest in the use of human brain-based models to help further our understanding of disease processes. Human brain-based models include those derived from embryonic stem cells, patient-derived induced neurons, induced pluripotent stem cells and brain organoids, as well as post-mortem tissue. These models facilitate in vitro analysis of disease mechanisms and it is hoped they will help bridge the existing gap between bench and bedside. This review will discuss the various human brain-based models utilised in PD research today and highlight some of the key breakthroughs they have facilitated. Furthermore, the potential caveats associated with the use of human brain-based models will be detailed.

AB  - The global issues of climate change and marine litter are interlinked and understanding these connections is key to managing their combined risks to marine biodiversity and ultimately society. For example, fossil fuel-based plastics cause direct emissions of greenhouse gases and therefore are an important contributing factor to climate change, while other impacts of plastics can manifest as alterations in key species and habitats in coastal and marine environments. Marine litter is acknowledged as a threat multiplier that acts with other stressors such as climate change to cause far greater damage than if they occurred in isolation. On the other hand, while climate change can lead to increased inputs of litter into the marine environment, the presence of marine litter can also undermine the climate resilience of marine ecosystems. There is increasing evidence that that climate change and marine litter are inextricably linked, although these interactions and the resulting effects vary widely across oceanic regions and depend on the particular characteristics of specific marine environments. Ecosystem resilience approaches, that integrate climate change with other local stressors, offer a suitable framework to incorporate the consideration of marine litter where that is deemed to be a risk, and to steer, coordinate and prioritise research and monitoring, as well as management, policy, planning and action to effectively tackle the combined risks and impacts from climate change and marine litter.

AB  - Background: People living with HIV/AIDS have a higher rate of depression/depressive symptoms and this highly affects antiretroviral medication adherence. Therefore, much stronger evidence weighing the burden of depressive symptoms/major depression is warranted. Methods: We investigated PubMed, Scopus, Psych-Info, and Embase databases for systematic review studies. A PRISMA flow diagram was used to show the search process. We also used the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist scores. A narrative review and statistical pooling were accompanied to compute the pooled effect size of outcome variables. Results: Overall, 8 systematic review studies addressing 265 primary studies, 4 systematic review studies addressing 48 primary studies, and six systematic review studies addressing 442 primary studies were included for depressive symptoms, major depression, and their effect on medication non-adherence, respectively. Globally, the average depressive symptoms prevalence using the random effect model was 34.17% (24.97, 43.37). In addition, the average prevalence of major depressive disorder was obtained to be 13.42% (10.53, 16.31). All of the 6 included systematic review studies reported a negative association between depressive symptoms and antiretroviral medication non-adherence. The pooled odds ratio of antiretroviral medication adherence among patients with depressive symptoms was 0.54 (0.36, 0.72) (I-2 = 0.0%, p = 0.487). Conclusion: Globally, the prevalence of depressive symptoms and major depression is high. There existed a high degree of association between depressive symptoms and antiretroviral medication non-adherence. So, focused intervention modalities should be developed and implemented.

AB  - Disturbances in social cognition are a core feature of schizophrenia. While most research in the field has focused on emotion perception, social knowledge, theory of mind, and attribution styles, the domain of social perception has received little specific attention. In this paper, we suggest that this issue can be explained by the lack of a precise and unitary definition of the concept, this leads to the existence of different competing uses of the concept and their conflation with other domains of social cognition. Relying on resources coming from the ecological approach to psychology and the phenomenological tradition in psychiatry, we propose that the concept of Social Perception should be used to refer to low-level pre-reflective processes underlying the awareness of interpersonal interactions with and between others. Clinical data suggests that people with schizophrenia have problems perceiving social situations as opportunities for social engagement, so, in order to fulfil this explanatory need, we propose that the term should be used to capture this important-yet neglected-domain of social cognition. We conclude with the discussion of some future directions for research derived from our proposal.

AB  - Standardized mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been proved to be effective across many populations while the time commitment for the standardized intervention leads to high attrition rate. To address the problem, there has been a growing interest in conducting a single component of MBSR such as body scan. However, the impact of a sole mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of body scan meditation. A search of databases, including PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Cochrance, Proquest Dissertations, and Theses, was conducted for randomized controlled trials with no population restriction. Fourteen independent articles were identified and outcomes were divided into seven categories. A meta-analysis with robust variance estimation was conducted separately for different outcome categories. Body scan only had small effect on mindfulness when compared with passive control (Hedge's g = .268, 95% CI = [0.032, 0.504], p < .05). The attrition rate of long-term interventions was low. The quality of these studies was low. There was high heterogeneity across studies. A sole body scan meditation is not effective enough to improve health-related outcomes.

AB  - Background Owing to multiple, complex and intersecting health inequities, systemic oppression and violence and discrimination in their home countries, some transgender people are forced to migrate to countries that offer them better legal protection and wider social acceptance. Aims This review sought to explore and understand the multiple factors that shape the mental health outcomes of transgender forced migrants (TFMs). Method We systematically searched nine electronic databases for multidisciplinary literature (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020183062). We used a meta-ethnographic approach to synthesise data. We completed a quality appraisal and developed a socio-ecological model to draw together our findings. Results We retrieved 3399 records and screened titles, abstracts and full text to include 24 qualitative studies in this review. The synthesis identified individual survival strategies and factors in interpersonal, organisational and societal environments that contributed to profound deprivation and mental distress in TFMs. Pervasive and persistent violence and discrimination, economic exclusion, barriers to healthcare and a dependency on legal documentation were identified as key factors leading to poor mental health outcomes. Sources of resilience included community acceptance and support, being granted asylum, societal affirmation of gender, fulfilment of basic rights and healthcare access. Individual strategies for survival, such as hope and having purpose in life, were important in bringing relief from distress. Conclusions Improved communication and knowledge about the unique needs and concerns of TFMs through interventions at the individual, interpersonal, organisational and societal levels are necessary to improve mental health outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: This article is a scoping review of efforts in labour market inclusion of the chronically ill in the Scandinavian countries, a research area that has received much political as well as research attention in recent years. The aim of the review was to identify promising strategies and the need for further research. Methods: Six electronic databases were searched for literature published between 2015 and 2020. We included peer-reviewed articles that studied the effect of measures, aimed at the workplace or at the individual, that are intended to increase participation. Our search resulted in 2718 articles; our screening procedures resulted in 47 included articles. Results: Among the included studies, musculoskeletal problems (17 articles) and mental health problems (29 articles) were the most frequent chronic conditions. Multimodal occupational rehabilitation programmes directed towards the individual employee were the most frequent interventions (30 articles). Return to work (24 articles) and sickness absence (12 articles) were the most common outcomes. About half (25 articles) of the included studies reported a positive impact of the intervention on work inclusion of the chronically ill. Conclusions: Our review found little evidence of how government programmes directed towards the supply side of the labour market succeed in including the chronically ill. Our review further indicated that multidisciplinary workplace interventions have a substantial effect. We also identified a significant lack of research on the effect of various governmental policies and programmes, including local health, work and welfare services, and limited coordination and cooperation between health and work services professions.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and measures aimed at its mitigation, such as physical distancing, have been discussed as risk factors for loneliness, which increases the risk of premature mortality and mental and physical health conditions. To ascertain whether loneliness has increased since the start of the pandemic, this study aimed to narratively and statistically synthesize relevant high-quality primary studies. This systematic review with meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO (ID CRD42021246771). Searched databases were PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library/Central Register of Controlled Trials/EMBASE/CINAHL, Web of Science, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database, supplemented by Google Scholar and citation searching (cutoff date of the systematic search December 5, 2021). Summary data from prospective research including loneliness assessments before and during the pandemic were extracted. Of 6,850 retrieved records, 34 studies (23 longitudinal, 9 pseudolongitudinal, 2 reporting both designs) on 215,026 participants were included. Risk of bias (RoB) was estimated using the risk of bias in non-randomised studies-of interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Standardized mean differences (SMD, Hedges' g) for continuous loneliness values and logOR for loneliness prevalence rates were calculated as pooled effect size estimators in random-effects meta-analyses. Pooling studies with longitudinal designs only (overall N = 45,734), loneliness scores (19 studies, SMD = 0.27 [95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.40], Z = 4.02, p < .001, I (2) = 98%) and prevalence rates (8 studies, logOR = 0.33 [0.04-0.62], Z = 2.25, p = .02, I (2) = 96%) increased relative to prepandemic times with small effect sizes. Results were robust with respect to studies' overall RoB, pseudolongitudinal designs, timing of prepandemic assessments, and clinical populations. The heterogeneity of effects indicates a need to further investigate risk and protective factors as the pandemic progresses to inform targeted interventions.
   Public Significance Statement This synthesis of international research with a focus on longitudinal study designs shows small, but robust increases in loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic across gender and age groups. As loneliness jeopardizes mental and physical health, these findings indicate that public health responses to the continuing pandemic should include monitoring of feelings of social connectedness and further research into risk and protective factors.

AB  - Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) a complex neuropsychiatric disorder, is characterized by irresistible obsessive thinking and compulsive behavior. Folate is a member of water-soluble vitamins in the human body and sustains many normal daily activities (e.g., exercise, sleep, and memory). Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing non-essential amino acid, has been investigated in numerous psychiatric disorders (e.g., OCD). Vitamin B12 is a type of complex organic compound with cobalt contained. Moreover, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency and high levels of homocysteine were found to have an effect on brain functions and also lead to non-specific psychiatric symptoms. Objectives: This study aimed to confirm the epidemiological evidence of OCD and investigate whether vitamin B12, folate, and homocysteine have an effect on the etiology of OCD. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on eight databases (i.e., PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database), and the retrieval time was up to March 2021. The available articles involving patients with OCD with/without abnormal serum levels of vitamin B12, folate, and homocysteine were comprehensively reviewed and analyzed. Results: A total of 5 studies involving 309 patients were included in this meta-analysis, including 172 cases in the experimental group and 137 in the control group. The content of folate in the OCD group was not significantly different from that in the control group (SMD = -0.089, 95%CI -0.755 to 0.577, p = 0.794). And serum homocysteine was significantly higher in the patients with OCD (SMD = 1.132, 95%CI 0.486 to 1.778, p = 0.001). Vitamin B12 was significantly lower in patients with OCD (SMD = -0.583, 95%CI -0.938 to -0.229, p = 0.001). Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows serum high levels of homocysteine, low levels of vitamin B12, and normal folate level are closely correlated with OCD. However, high-quality case-control studies should be further conducted to explore the correlation between serum levels of vitamin B12, folate, homocysteine, and OCD.

AB  - We now know that the immune system plays a major role in the complex processes underlying brain development throughout the lifespan, carrying out a number of important homeostatic functions under physiological conditions in the absence of pathological inflammation or infection. In particular, complement-mediated synaptic pruning during critical periods of early life may play a key role in shaping brain development and subsequent risk for psychopathology, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. However, these disorders vary greatly in their onset, disease course, and prevalence amongst sexes suggesting complex interactions between the immune system, sex and the unique developmental trajectories of circuitries underlying different brain functions which are yet to be fully understood. Perturbations of homeostatic neuroimmune interactions during different critical periods in which regional circuits mature may have a plethora of long-term consequences for psychiatric phenotypes, but at present there is a gap in our understanding of how these mechanisms may impact on the structural and functional changes occurring in the brain at different developmental stages. In this article we will consider the latest developments in the field of complement mediated synaptic pruning where our understanding is beginning to move beyond the visual system where this process was first described, to brain areas and developmental periods of potential relevance to psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The dynamic systems (DS) theory has been previously applied to the regulatory processes that characterize the parent-child dyad. These processes provide infants with adequate flexibility to respond and adapt to environmental stimulations and sufficient stability to develop and maintain coherent self-organization. The State Space Grid (SSG) tool was specifically developed to provide graphical representations and quantitative assessments of different measures of dyadic flexibility and organization. During the last 20 years, the SSG has been increasingly adopted in research projects. The present review provides a comprehensive and integrated discussion of the SSG literature about parent-child interaction so far. The literature search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus and 16 studies were selected. Results showed that flexibility allows dyads to manage interactive perturbations, leading the system to a new possible equilibrium and promoting better child outcomes. Studies suggested a developmental trend in organization with a reduction of dispersion at an older age, that was associated with better child functioning. Significant individual differences emerged for child and caregiver sex. In sum, this review confirms the potentials of SSG to depict flexibility and organization constructs in parent-child dyads from a genuine DS perspective. Future SSG studies on atypical and at-risk parent-child populations are needed to bridge the gap between DS research and clinical practice.

AB  - Due to current water stress, there is a problem with hygiene and sanitation in many parts of the world. According to predictions from the United Nations, more than 2.7 billion people will be challenged by water scarcity by the middle of the century. The water industry is increasingly interested in desalination of the sea, ocean, and brackish water. Desalination processes are widely classified as thermal or membrane technologies. In the Middle East, thermal desalination remains the primary technology of choice, but membrane processes, for example reverse osmosis (RO), have evolved rapidly and in many other parts of the world are currently even surpassing thermal processes. The purpose of this paper is to review the renewable energy source, the technology, desalination systems, and their possible integration with renewable energy resources and their cost. This article suggests that the most practical renewable desalination techniques to be used are the solar photovoltaic integrated RO desalination process, the hybrid solar photovoltaic-wind integrated RO desalination process, the hybrid solar photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) integrated RO desalination process, and the hybrid solar photovoltaic-thermal effect distillation (PVT-MED) desalination process. However, intensive research is still required to minimize the cost, reduce the heat loss, enhance the performance, and increase the productivity.

AB  - Gout is a chronic disease with inflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals deposition, an elevated serum urate level (hyperuricaemia) is the critical factor leading to MSU crystals deposition and promoting the progression of gout. The onset and development of gout is generally the result of multiple factors, such as diet, heredity and environmental factors. Although genetics and diet are thought to play as major factors, a growing body of research evidence has highlighted that environmental factors also play a significant role in the onset and exacerbation of gout. Recent studies have shown that air pollutants such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO) may increase the risk of hospitalizations for gout, and that the changes in temperature and humidity may affect uric acid (UA) levels. There is also seasonal trend in gout. It has been demonstrated that environmental factors may induce or accelerate the production and release of proinflammatory mediators, causing an unbalance oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, and then participating in the overall process or a certain link of gout. Moreover, several environmental factors have shown the ability to induce the production urate and regulate the innate immune pathways, involving in the pathogenesis of gout. Nevertheless, the role of environmental factors in the etiology of gout remains unclear. In this review, we summarized the recent literatures and aimed to discuss the relationship between environmental factors (such as microclimate, season, ambient/indoor air pollution and extreme weather) and gout. We further discussed the inflammatory mechanisms of environmental factors and gout and the comprehensive effects of environmental factors on gout. We also made a prospect of the management and treatment of gout, with special consideration to environmental factors associated with gout.

AB  - Background Self-harm in children and adolescents is difficult to treat. Peripheral and neural correlates of self-harm could lead to biomarkers to guide precision care. We therefore conducted a scoping review of research on peripheral and neural correlates of self-harm in this age group. Methods PubMed and Embase databases were searched from January 1980-May 2020, seeking English language peer-reviewed studies about peripheral and neural correlates of self-harm, defined as completed suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, or non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in subjects, birth to 19 years of age. Studies were excluded if only investigating self-harm in persons with intellectual or developmental disability syndromes. A blinded multi-stage assessment process by pairs of co-authors selected final studies for review. Risk of bias estimates were done on final studies. Results We screened 5537 unduplicated abstracts, leading to the identification of 79 eligible studies in 76 papers. Of these, 48 investigated peripheral correlates and 31 examined neural correlates. Suicidality was the focus in 2/3 of the studies, with NSSI and any type of self-harm (subjects recruited with suicidality, NSSI, or both) investigated in the remaining studies. All studies used observational designs (primarily case-control), most used convenience samples of adolescent patients which were predominately female and half of which were recruited based on a disorder. Over a quarter of the specific correlates were investigated with only one study. Inter-study agreement on findings from specific correlates with more than one study was often low. Estimates of Good for risk of bias were assigned to 37% of the studies and the majority were rated as Fair. Conclusions Research on peripheral and neural correlates of self-harm is not sufficiently mature to identify potential biomarkers. Conflicting findings were reported for many of the correlates studied. Methodological problems may have produced biased findings and results are mainly generalizable to patients and girls. We provide recommendations to improve future peripheral and neural correlate research in children and adolescents, ages 3-19 years, with self-harm.

AB  - Despite that counselling psychologists represent a substantial group of registered psychologists in South Africa, literature specifically on the sub-speciality within the country is limited. The aim of this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive summary of the literature available on counselling psychology in South Africa and examine the extent to which literature is available from a lifespan or career-stage perspective. Three electronic databases (EBSCOhost, Sabinet (R), and PubMed) were searched for articles published between 2000 and 2021. Titles and abstracts were reviewed, and data extracted and synthesised thematically. Of 507 citations identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicate that literature on counselling psychology in South Africa is scarce, subject to methodological limitations, and dominated by a small number of authors conducting multiple analyses on the same sets of data. Furthermore, literature on counselling psychologists at key career stages across the professional lifespan is largely missing from the professional discourse. Emphasis is instead placed on counselling psychology as embedded in the sociopolitical history of South Africa, professional identity, the contemporary status of the profession, professional threats and challenges, and the profession's future promise. Our review highlights the need for more empirically informed studies making use of different methodologies, involving multiple authors with diverse backgrounds, tracking employment trends, and soliciting first-person accounts of counselling psychologist's experiences at key career stages. Without doing so, ideas about how best to support and utilise this particular group of practitioners may be misguided, in turn compromising the successful provision of mental health care within the country.

In this review, routes of SARS-Cov-2 entry into the brain via neuroinvasive pathways such as transcribrial, ocular surface or hematogenous system are discussed. It is argued that SARS-Cov-2-induced cytokine storm, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Further studies on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants on protein aggregation, glia or microglia activation, and blood-brain barrier are warranted.

AB  - Background Post-psychotic depression (PPD) after a FEP (first-episode psychosis) differs from other depressive symptoms in chronic schizophrenia in its aetiology, symptomatology, and prognostic implications. The objective was to search if any pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions have proven to be effective on depressive symptoms after a FEP. Methods for this systematic review we systematically searched and screened PubMed for articles published from August 1975 to October 15, 2020, with the terms: treatment AND first-episode psychosis OR post-psychotic OR post-schizophrenic AND depression. Results we identified 139 articles of which 20 met the inclusion criteria. These interventions were then categorized into four subgroups (antipsychotics, antidepressants, psychological and miscellaneous) Limitations this review has several limitations. The reviewed studies were heterogeneous as to assessments, interventions, and samples; furthermore, only one study had PPD in FEP as its primary outcome. Conclusions to our knowledge, this is the first review of PPD in a FEP's treatment. PPD continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The available evidence for the use of treatment whether pharmacological or non-pharmacological is limited. However, certain approaches such as online therapy and treatment with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) show promising results. It could be of interest for future studies to focus not only on the treatment of PPD but also on the diagnostic heterogeneity of the sample and the adaptation of the content of the intervention to the individual.

AB  - Introduction: Many mental illnesses begin during adolescence. Parents of adolescents need to have sufficient mental health literacy (MHL) to recognize mental health problems in their children and to assist them with help-seeking. Although several educational programs have been developed to enhance parental MHL, their effectiveness has not been established. This study provides a systematic review for the effectiveness of MHL programs in parents of adolescents.
   Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC and Web of Science were searched from the earliest date possible until February 2022; references of studies which met eligibility criteria were also screened. Studies that assessed quantitative change in at least one of the following components of parental MHL were included: knowledge of mental health/illnesses; stigma toward people with mental health problems; confidence in helping children with mental health problems, and intention, knowledge or behavior of helping children with mental health problems. Risk of bias (ROB) for each outcome within the included studies was rated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies for nonrandomized studies.
   Results: Nine studies (four RCTs, three controlled before-and-after studies, and two case series), reported in 10 articles, were included. Mental health knowledge and/or confidence was significantly improved in several studies, while no studies observed significant improvement in stigma and/or intention/behavior of helping children. ROB was high in five out of nine studies (10 out of 18 outcomes) and unclear in the others.
   Conclusions: A limited number of studies have evaluated effects of MHL program in parents and inconsistent quality contributes to difficulty in establishing their overall effectiveness. More studies with appropriate methods of recruitment, measurement and analysis, and transparent reporting are needed.

AB  - The selection of appropriate outcome measures is fundamental to the design of any successful clinical trial. Although dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most common neurodegenerative conditions, assessment of therapeutic benefit in clinical trials often relies on tools developed for other conditions, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. These may not be sufficiently valid or sensitive to treatment changes in DLB, decreasing their utility. In this review, we discuss the limitations and strengths of selected available tools used to measure DLB-associated outcomes in clinical trials and highlight the potential roles for more specific objective measures. We emphasize that the existing outcome measures require validation in the DLB population and that DLB-specific outcomes need to be developed. Finally, we highlight how the selection of outcome measures may vary between symptomatic and disease-modifying therapy trials.

AB  - The excess mortality observed in people with severe mental disorders (SMD) has not improved over time and is not captured in estimates of disease burden. This study aimed to improve upon previous analytic approaches to account for potential sources of heterogeneity in pooled mortality estimates. A systematic review of studies examining excess mortality in people with psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder was conducted. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched from January 1, 1980 to 31/12/20. Studies were eligible if they were longitudinal; the study population was diagnosed according to established criteria, not restricted to subgroups and the disorder was primary and not acute or transient; and mortality was reported in comparison to the general population or a control group without SMD. Meta-regression models were used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) of all-cause and cause-specific mortality adjusted for study- and population-level covariates. Risk of bias was assessed using an adaptation of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A total of 76 studies were included in the analyses. Covariates incorporated into the final models included age, sex, population type and mid-year. The adjusted RR for all-cause mortality in schizophrenia was 2.89 (95% CI 2.50 to 3.34) and 2.51 (95%CI 2.10 to 3.00) for bipolar disorder. There were larger RRs for broader categories of psychotic disorders. Mortality was elevated in each cause of death examined. Most of the heterogeneity between studies could not be accounted for. Future research should investigate underlying causal pathways and find ways to incorporate the excess mortality associated with SMD into global health estimates.

AB  - The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is globally increasing, and the current available interventions show variable success. Thus, there is a growing interest in additional interventions such as music therapy (MT). Therefore, we aimed to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of music and people with, or at risk of, ASD. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and used PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science as databases, with "music", "music therapy", "autism spectrum disorder", and "ASD" as search terms. Among the identified and screened articles, 81 out of 621 qualified as scientific studies involving a total of 43,353 participants. These studies investigated the peculiarities of music perception in people with ASD, as well as the effects of music and MT in this patient group. Most of the music-based interventions were beneficial in improving social, emotional, and behavioural problems. However, the availability of studies utilizing a rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) design was scarce. Most of the studies had a small sample size, and the applied therapeutic and scientific research methods were heterogeneous.

AB  - Popular mobile applications receive millions of user reviews. These reviews contain relevant information for software maintenance, such as bug reports and improvement suggestions. The review's information is a valuable knowledge source for software requirements engineering since the apps review analysis helps make strategic decisions to improve the app quality. However, due to the large volume of texts, the manual extraction of the relevant information is an impracticable task. Opinion mining is the field of study for analyzing people's sentiments and emotions through opinions expressed on the web, such as social networks, forums, and community platforms for products and services recommendation. In this paper, we investigate opinion mining for app reviews. In particular, we compare textual representation techniques for classification, sentiment analysis, and utility prediction from app reviews. We discuss and evaluate different techniques for the textual representation of reviews, from traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) to the most recent state-of-the-art Neural Language models (NLM). Our findings show that the traditional Bag-of-Words model, combined with a careful analysis of text pre-processing techniques, is still competitive. It obtains results close to the NLM in the classification, sentiment analysis and utility prediction tasks. However, NLM proved to be more advantageous since they achieved very competitive performance in all the predictive tasks covered in this work, provide significant dimensionality reduction, and deals more adequately with semantic proximity between the reviews' texts.

AB  - Purpose in life (PIL) is a psychological construct that reflects one's life goals and the desire or determination to pursue them. Having a purpose provides an intrinsic motivation to adopt healthy behaviors as we age, which will help us to achieve positive health outcomes. Thus, promoting PIL is the cornerstone for successful aging and better health outcomes. This systematic review aims to identify how PIL is conceptualized, measured in the existing literature and what are the determinants of PIL in older adults (>= 65 years). Electronic searches were conducted in five databases (Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science). A total of 44 studies were included in the review. PIL was conceptualized in six different ways: health and well-being, meaningful goals and purpose, inner strength, social relationships, mattering to others, and spirituality and religiousness. There were six main questionnaires and semi structured interviews used to capture PIL. Female gender, higher education and income, being married, ethnicity, health and well-being, inner strength, social integration and spirituality were associated with PIL. Majority of the included studies had low to moderate Risk of Bias (RoB) assuring confidence in the results. The conceptual frameworks of PIL identified in the review underscore the complexity of the construct. Several sociodemographic and other determinants of PIL were identified.

AB  - High-risk disordered eating (HRDE) negatively affects physical, mental, and social wellbeing. This scoping review aimed to estimate the prevalence of HRDE amongst adolescents and young adults in the Middle East. MEDLINE database was searched for studies published in English or Arabic from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2020, estimating HRDE prevalence (using the Eating Attitudes Test 26 or 40 item questionnaire) in the Middle East. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts of potentially eligible records, followed by data extraction from eligible studies. Nineteen studies (n = 16,288; 65.8% female) from Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates were included. Prevalence of HRDE varied considerably across countries and was lowest amongst adolescents in Israel (F 8.2%; M 2.8%) and highest amongst university students in Egypt (F 75.8%; M 69.6%). Prevalence of high-risk for anorexia nervosa ranged from 0.0% in Jordan to 9.5% in Oman; high-risk for bulimia nervosa from 0.6% in Jordan to 1.0% in the United Arab Emirates; and high-risk for binge eating disorder was 1.0% and 1.8% in Turkey and Jordan, respectively. Future studies should employ a standardized two-stage design with clinical diagnosis to verify the prevalence of abnormal eating behaviours in the Middle East.

AB  - Parental feeding practices and styles influence child diet quality and growth. The extent to which these factors have been assessed in the context of disadvantage, particularly household food insecurity (HFI), is unknown. This is important, as interventions designed to increase responsive practices and styles may not consider the unique needs of families with HFI. To address this gap, a scoping review of studies published from 1990 to July 2021 in three electronic databases was conducted. A priori inclusion criteria were, population: families with children aged 0-5 years experiencing food insecurity and/or disadvantage; concept: parental feeding practices/behaviours/style; and context: high income countries. The search identified 12,950 unique papers, 504 full-text articles were screened and 131 met the inclusion criteria. Almost all the studies (91%) were conducted in the United States with recruitment via existing programs for families on low incomes. Only 27 papers assessed feeding practices or styles in the context of HFI. Of the eleven interventions identified, two assessed the proportion of participants who were food insecure. More research is required in families outside of the United States, with an emphasis on comprehensive and valid measures of HFI and feeding practices. Intervention design should be sensitive to factors associated with poverty, including food insecurity.

AB  - Shallow or near-shore environments, such as ponds, estuaries and intertidal zones, are among the most physiologically challenging of all aquatic settings. Animals inhabiting these environments experience conditions that fluctuate markedly over relatively short temporal and spatial scales. Living in these habitats requires the ability to tolerate the physiological disturbances incurred by these environmental fluctuations. This tolerance is achieved through a suite of physiological and behavioural responses that allow animals to maintain homeostasis, including the ability to dynamically modulate their physiology through reversible phenotypic plasticity. However, maintaining the plasticity to adjust to some stresses in a dynamic environment may trade off with the capacity to deal with other stressors. This paper will explore studies on select fishes and invertebrates exposed to fluctuations in dissolved oxygen, salinity and pH. We assess the physiological mechanisms these species employ to achieve homeostasis, with a focus on the plasticity of their responses, and consider the resulting physiological trade-offs in function. Finally, we discuss additional factors that may influence organismal responses to fluctuating environments, such as the presence of multiple stressors, including parasites. We echo recent calls from experimental biologists to consider physiological responses to life in naturally fluctuating environments, not only because they are interesting in their own right but also because they can reveal mechanisms that may be crucial for living with increasing environmental instability as a consequence of climate change.

AB  - While most patients with depression respond to pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, about one-third will present treatment resistance to these interventions. For patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), invasive neurostimulation therapies such as vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and epidural cortical stimulation may be considered. We performed a narrative review of the published literature to identify papers discussing clinical studies with invasive neurostimulation therapies for TRD. After a database search and title and abstract screening, relevant English-language articles were analyzed. Vagus nerve stimulation, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a TRD treatment, may take several months to show therapeutic benefits, and the average response rate varies from 15.2-83%. Deep brain stimulation studies have shown encouraging results, including rapid response rates (> 30%), despite conflicting findings from randomized controlled trials. Several brain regions, such as the subcallosal-cingulate gyrus, nucleus accumbens, ventral capsule/ventral striatum, anterior limb of the internal capsule, medial-forebrain bundle, lateral habenula, inferiorthalamic peduncle, and the bed-nucleus of the stria terminalis have been identified as key targets for TRD management. Epidural cortical stimulation, an invasive intervention with few reported cases, showed positive results (40-60% response), although more extensive trials are needed to confirm its potential in patients with TRD.

TI  - The Emergence of Psychiatry: 1650-1850
KW  - DUALISM
KW  - BRAIN
KW  - MIND
AB  - Western psychiatry emerged as a medical specialty caring for the mentally ill over the course of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This emergence was a contingent process, dependent on the co-occurrence of three historical developments that together shaped the young discipline. The first was the rise of the mind as an entity with numerous active faculties in the conceptual space between the body and the Christian soul. Only by the latter half of the 18th century was it common to conceptualize conditions like mania or melancholy as mental illnesses. The second advance critical to psychiatry's proto-specialty status, with its increasing focus on a mechanistic understanding of disease, was the rejection of humoral theories of insanity in favor of the brain and nerves as the seat of madness. The third development was the rise of the asylum. Only in dedicated institutions could mad-doctors be exposed to large numbers of the insane, permitting the development of a specialized clinical vocabulary grounded in faculties of mind, which led to new nosologic systems. The decline of humoral medicine, with its purges, bleeding, and emetics, and the urgent clinical need for care produced, in early asylums, the first novel treatment from the young specialty: moral therapy. We tell this story focusing mainly on the work of five philosophers and physicians: Descartes, Willis, Locke, Boerhaave, de Sauvages, and Cullen. Throughout its history, psychiatry has struggled with its sometimes disconjugate goals of understanding both mind and brain, with alternating efforts to expel one of these tasks from the profession. A historical perspective demonstrates that psychiatry is a profession inextricably linked to these two contrasting projects-and, indeed, jointly constituted by them.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which is recommended for the improvement of some pain-related symptoms and for antidepressant treatment, on the primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). We searched for studies comparing rTMS and sham rTMS in the M1 of FM patients. Pain intensity, quality of life, health status, and depression were compared with or without rTMS for at least 10 sessions. We searched four databases. Quality assessment and quantitative analysis were performed using RevMan 5.4. After screening, five randomized controlled trials of 170 patients with FM were included in the analysis. As a result of the meta-analysis of rTMS on the M1 of individuals with FM, high-frequency rTMS resulted in a significant improvement on quality of life (MD = -2.50; 95% CI: -3.99 to -1.01) compared with sham rTMS. On the other hand, low-frequency rTMS resulted in a significant improvement on health status (MD = 15.02; 95% CI: 5.59 to 24.45). The application of rTMS to the M1 is proposed as an adjunctive measure in the treatment of individuals with FM. Because rTMS has various effects depending on each application site, it is necessary to classify sites or set frequencies as variables.

AB  - Background: Individuals recovering from a suicide attempt may benefit from support provided by informal carers, that is, family members and other support persons, who may require support themselves. Aims: This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize available literature on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for this carer population. Method: A search of peer-reviewed literature in five databases was carried out. Studies using any design were eligible and results were synthesized using a narrative review. Results: Eight articles reporting on seven quantitative studies met the eligibility criteria. This included three studies on interventions designed specifically for informal carers and four studies on interventions designed for persons who have made a suicide attempt, and which involved their informal carers. Overall, informal carers were satisfied with support and psychosocial interventions they received. Interventions were related to some improvements in carers' mental health outcomes, lowered burden, and improved ability to provide care. There were mixed results regarding family functioning and quality of life. Limitations: No studies from lower- and middle-income countries were identified and the small number of heterogeneous studies precluded conducting ameta-analysis. Conclusion: Given the low number of studies and their overall poor quality, this review can only draw preliminary conclusions. More high-quality intervention studies are needed to formulate recommendations for effective psychosocial support for family members and other informal support persons after a suicide attempt.

AB  - The death of a loved one is a major stressor, and bereaved people are at a higher risk of negative health effects. This risk is higher during the COVID-19 pandemic, which raises the need for understanding existing bereavement support interventions. This scoping review aimed to map and summarize findings from the existing literature regarding bereavement support interventions (i.e., psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions) for family carers of people who died of COVID-19. The Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework was used. Five databases-Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science-were searched for articles available from the inception of COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) to January 2022, following the PRISMA guidelines. Among the 990 studies identified, only seven met this study's inclusion criteria. The analysis comprised three key topics: types of support programmes and bereavement interventions; tools used to measure the outcomes; and evidence of the impacts of the interventions. All studies analysed included interdisciplinary interventions, commonly developed in clinical settings. Support for recently bereaved individuals can entail cognitive behavioural therapy strategies and other tools to educate, guide, support, and promote healthy integration of loss. To mitigate the effects of non-normative family bereavement, we recommend a systematic approach and coordination between organizational settings, including access to informal and professional support, in order to find hope while navigating the aftermath of COVID-19.

AB  - Irisin is a hormone-like molecule mainly released by skeletal muscles in response to exercise, which is proposed to induce the 'browning' of white adipose tissue. Since its identification, irisin was reported to be closely associated with many metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and metabolic bone diseases. In recent years, irisin has attracted increasing research interest, and numerous studies have been published in this field. Thus, it is essential to identify the current research status of irisin and measure research hotspots and possible future trends. In this study, by utilizing two visualization software named CiteSpace and VOSviewer, we analyzed 1510 Web of Science publications on irisin published from 2012 to 2021. Our results show that the number of irisin-related articles published annually has increased significantly. China participates in the most studies, followed by the United States and Turkey. Firat University, Harvard University, and Shandong University are three major institutions with larger numbers of publications. The analysis of keywords co-occurrence indicates that insulin resistance, inflammation, and circulating irisin levels in serum are the research hotspots. Apoptosis, BDNF, and osteoporosis will likely become the focus of future research related to irisin. Overall, this study may provide helpful insights for researchers to understand the current research situation and identify the potential frontiers of irisin.

AB  - Background: The culprit of trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) may occur at any point between the nerve's root entry zone (REZ) and Meckel's cave. Meckel's cave meningoencephaloceles are rare middle cranial fossa defects that usually remain asymptomatic but may contain prolapsed trigeminal nerve rootlets and result in TGN. Their management and surgical outcomes remain poorly understood.
   Objectives: To perform a systematic review of clinical presentation and surgical outcomes of middle fossa defects presenting with trigeminal nerve-related symptoms.
   Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for all reports of middle cranial fossa defects causing trigeminal nerve-related symptoms. The pathophysiology, presentation, surgical management, and outcomes are discussed and illustrated with a case.
   Results: Initial search from inception to March 2021 identified 33 articles for screening. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were included representing a total of 8 cases in addition to our case (n = 9). All 9 patients were females and 33.3% (n = 3) presented with classic trigeminal neuralgia. "Empty sella" syndrome and radiologic signs of intracranial hypertension were present in 40%-62%. No patient presented with cerebrospinal fluid leak. The preferred treatment modality was surgical with subtemporal extradural repairs using combinations of autologous fat and muscle grafts and synthetic dura. Postoperative outcomes were only available in 55.5% (n = 5) of the cases, and nearly all reported complete symptom resolution, except for one case in which the meningoencephalocele wall was incised, along with trigeminal rootlets adhered to it. Our patient had immediate and durable symptom relief after a 4-year follow-up.
   Conclusions: MEC containing prolapsed trigeminal nerve rootlets can cause typical trigeminal neuralgia from chronic pulsatile stress. This supports the hypothesis that the compressive or demyelinating culprit can locate more ventrally on the course of the trigeminal nerve. Subtemporal extradural surgical repairs can be safe, effective, and durable. Incising the MEC wall should be avoided as it may have trigeminal rootlets adhered to it.

AB  - We aimed to review the determinants of burnout onset in teachers. The study was conducted according to the PROSPERO protocol CRD42018105901, with a focus on teachers. We performed a literature search from 1990 to 2021 in three databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase. We included longitudinal studies assessing burnout as a dependent variable, with a sample of at least 50 teachers. We summarized studies by the types of determinant and used the MEVORECH tool for a risk of bias assessment (RBA). The quantitative synthesis focused on emotional exhaustion. We standardized the reported regression coefficients and their standard errors and plotted them using R software to distinguish between detrimental and protective determinants. A qualitative analysis of the included studies (n = 33) identified 61 burnout determinants. The RBA showed that most studies had external and internal validity issues. Most studies implemented two waves (W) of data collection with 6-12 months between W1 and W2. Four types of determinants were summarized quantitatively, namely support, conflict, organizational context, and individual characteristics, based on six studies. This systematic review identified detrimental determinants of teacher exhaustion, including job satisfaction, work climate or pressure, teacher self-efficacy, neuroticism, perceived collective exhaustion, and classroom disruption. We recommend that authors consider using harmonized methods and protocols such as those developed in OMEGA-NET and other research consortia.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to impact global health regarding both morbidity and mortality. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the virus interacts with and influences other organs and tissues, including blood vessel endothelium, heart, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. We are learning much about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, we are just beginning to study and understand the long-term and chronic health consequences. Since the pandemic's beginning in late 2019, older adults, those with pre-existing illnesses, or both, have an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe COVID-19. Furthermore, older adults are also more likely to develop the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease (PD), with advanced age as the most significant risk factor. Thus, does SARS-CoV-2 potentially influence, promote, or accelerate the development of PD in older adults? Our initial focus was aimed at understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and the connection to neurodegenerative disorders. We then completed a literature review to assess the relationship between PD and COVID-19. We described potential molecular and cellular pathways that indicate dopaminergic neurons are susceptible, both directly and indirectly, to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We concluded that under certain pathological circumstances, in vulnerable persons-with-Parkinson's disease (PwP), SARS-CoV-2 acts as a neurodegenerative enhancer to potentially support the development or progression of PD and its related motor and non-motor symptoms.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the impact of bedside handoff among ICU nursing professionals on patient safety. A bibliographic search (2016-2021) was made of health science databases, in line with the PRISMA statement guidelines. The quality of the studies was assessed according to the type of study to be evaluated (STROBE, CASPe and TREND). Fifteen articles were included in the review. They show that the bedside handoff benefits for the safety of nursing professionals (reduces distractions, offers greater precision and prevents loss of information) and for patients (they can check that the information transmitted is true, and be involved in their own recovery process) outweigh any stress or loss of privacy that may arise.

AB  - Objectives Chronic conditions represent an important source of major health issues among Indigenous People. The same applies to those, who live off-reserve and in urban areas. However, very few healthcare services are considered culturally safe, resulting in some avoidance of the public healthcare system. Our goal was to review the literature on culturally safe practices available to urban Indigenous People who suffer from chronic diseases.
   Design We conducted a scoping review to determine what culturally safe healthcare services are currently offered for the management of chronic conditions in urban Indigenous populations, to contribute to a tailored, holistic and safe space in mainstream healthcare systems.
   Eligibility criteria Peer-reviewed original research articles had to be published by 27 October 2020, in English or French.
   Information source: In October 2020, we searched five academic databases (EBSCO, PsycArticles, SocINDEX, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) and also reviewed grey literature and the websites of organisations or governments. The data were extracted and collected in an EXCEL spreadsheet. Two reviewers independently screened 326 titles and abstracts, followed by an independent evaluation of 48 full text articles. A total of 19 studies were included in this scoping review, as well as 5 websites/documents from the grey literature.
   Results In total, 19 studies were included in our analysis. We found that Elders, family and the assistance of an interpreter are crucial elements to include to make urban Indigenous feel safe when they seek healthcare services. With this scoping review, we report interventions that are successful in terms of healthcare delivery for this population. Our findings provide insight on what services should be in place in mainstream healthcare settings to create a culturally safe experience for urban Indigenous People.
   Conclusions In recent years, there appears to be a growing awareness of the need to provide culturally safe health services. This scoping review identified multiple strategies to promote cultural safety in this context, as well as barriers and facilitators to their implementation. These elements, which have been extensively documented in the literature, should be included in the chronic diseases management interventions to be developed by urban and primary care settings.

AB  - Objective: The present meta-analysis was conducted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the bipolarity index (BI) and Rapid Mode Screener (RMS) as compared with the Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale (BSDS), the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32), and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) in people with bipolar disorder (BD).
   Methods: We systematically searched five databases using standard search terms, and relevant articles published between May 1990 and November 30, 2021 were collected and reviewed.
   Results: Ninety-three original studies were included (n=62,291). At the recommended cutoffs for the BI, HCL-32, BSDS, MDQ, and RMS, the pooled sensitivities were 0.82, 0.75, 0.71, 0.71, and 0.78, respectively, while the corresponding pooled specificities were 0.73, 0.63, 0.73, 0.77, and 0.72, respectively. However, there was evidence that the accuracy of the BI was superior to that of the other tests, with a relative diagnostic odds ratio (RDOR) of 1.22 (0.98-1.52, p < 0.0001). The RMS was significantly more accurate than the other tests, with an RDOR (95%CI) of 0.79 (0.67-0.92, p < 0.0001) for the detection of BD type I (BD-I). However, there was evidence that the accuracy of the MDQ was superior to that of the other tests, with an RDOR of 1.93 (0.89-2.79, p = 0.0019), for the detection of BD type II (BD-II).
   Conclusion: The psychometric properties of two new instruments, the BI and RMS, in people with BD were consistent with considerably higher diagnostic accuracy than the HCL-32, BSDS, and MDQ. However, a positive screening should be confirmed by a clinical diagnostic evaluation for BD.

AB  - Musical interventions in therapy have become increasingly relevant for rehabilitation in many clinics. What was long known for physiotherapy training-that the agency of the participant is crucial and moving is much more efficient for rehabilitation success than being moved-has over recent years also been shown to be true for music therapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that active musical interventions are especially efficient at helping rehabilitation success. Here, we review various approaches to active music therapy. Furthermore, we present several components that allow for manipulating musical expressiveness and physical engagement during active musical interventions, applying a technology-based music feedback paradigm. This paper will allow for a transfer of insights to other domains of music-based therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Background: Hand trauma requires specific rehabilitation protocol depending on the different structures involved. According to type of surgical intervention, and for monitoring pain and edema, post-operative rehabilitation of a hand that has experienced trauma involves different timings for immobilization. Several protocols have been used to reduce immobilization time, and various techniques and methods are adopted, depending on the structures involved. Objective: To measure the effects of mirror neurons-based rehabilitation techniques in hand injuries throughout a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: The protocol was accepted in PROSPERO database. A literature search was conducted in Cinahl, Scopus, Medline, PEDro, OTseeker. Two authors independently identified eligible studies, based on predefined inclusion criteria, and extracted the data. RCT quality was assessed using the JADAD scale. Results: Seventy-nine suitable studies were screened, and only eleven were included for qualitative synthesis, while four studies were selected for quantitative analysis. Four studies were case reports/series, and seven were RCTs. Nine investigate the effect of Mirror Therapy and two the effect of Motor Imagery. Quantitative analyses revealed Mirror Therapy as effective for hand function recovery (mean difference = -14.80 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = -17.22, -12.38) (p < 0.00001) in the short term, as well as in long follow-up groups (mean difference = -13.11 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = -17.53, -8.69) (p < 0.00001). Clinical, but not statistical, efficacy was found for manual dexterity (p = 0.15), while no benefit was reported for range of motion. Conclusions: Mirror neurons-based rehabilitation techniques, combined with conventional occupational and physical therapy, can be a useful approach in hand trauma. Mirror therapy seems to be effective for hand function recovery, but, for motor imagery and action observation, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend its use. Further research on the efficacy of the mirror neurons-based technique in hand injury is recommended.

AB  - Peer education and peer counselling for health and wellbeing have been recognized as complementary approaches to professional intervention for over 50 years, but it is relatively recently that research into effects has become adequate. Potentially, they have advantages in reaching where professionals cannot, but it has not been clear if that potential is fulfilled, although the measurement of effects is difficult. The present paper examines 58 narrative and systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the topic. In peer education, there were many reviews of sexual health and of HIV/AIDS interventions, followed by reviews of various medical conditions and in the context of prisons. More general reviews covered a wider field. In peer counselling, there were several reviews of breast-feeding and mental health. Many early reviews complained of the lack of evaluation; then, later reviews found knowledge gains but not behavior gains; then, still later reviews found both knowledge and behavior gains. Thus, peer education and counselling appear effective but only if organizational factors are well managed and the cultural context of the country respected. The implications for future practice, policy and research were outlined.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to 1) identify transition programs for school reintegration after youth psychiatric hospitalization, and 2) assess these programs using criteria established by Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development. Method: Principles outlined by the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating Centre were used to systematically search 15 electronic databases up to October 2021 for both published and unpublished reports of transition programs. Reports meeting inclusion criteria were examined through three steps: 1) coding of available information, 2) synthesis of programs and 3) assessment of intervention specificity. Results: Thirteen reports met the inclusion criteria and identified eight transition programs. Program theories were rarely explicit about the causal mechanisms and outcomes of their interventions. Nevertheless, areas of consensus emerge as to core components of these programs including: 1) the involvement of a multidisciplinary team, 2) the implementation of a multicomponent intervention, 3) the development of a reintegration plan, 4) the need for gradual transitions, and 5) extended support through frequent contact. Conclusion: School reintegration programs following psychiatric hospitalization are still rare. They can be hard to implement due to the challenges they impose for inter-professional and intersectoral collaborations. Despite this, four of the eight programs are in a good position for an evaluation of their promising standing. Nevertheless, well-designed controlled trials and cohort studies are needed.

AB  - Objective: The prevalence of sleep disorders during the perinatal period is high and large health administrative database surveys have shown that the use of exogenous melatonin in pregnant populations is quite common, about 4%. Much of the concern about using melatonin during pregnancy and breastfeeding stems from animal research. Thus, the objective of this article is to provide a critical review of human studies related to exogenous melatonin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
   Methods: The electronic databases Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched using terms and keywords related to melatonin, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
   Results: Fifteen studies were included in this review. Eight focused on melatonin use during pregnancy and seven focused on melatonin use during breastfeeding. There was a variety of study designs, including case reports, cohort studies, and clinical trials. There is a lack of randomized, controlled trials examining the efficacy and safety of melatonin as a treatment for sleep disorders during pregnancy or breastfeeding and, notably, insomnia was not the primary outcome measure in any of the studies included in this review. Clinical trials that used exogenous melatonin during pregnancy and breastfeeding for other clinical conditions have not suggested major safety concerns or adverse events.
   Conclusion: Contrary to what animal studies have suggested, evidence from clinical studies to date suggests that melatonin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is probably safe in humans. This review further emphasizes the need for clinical studies on sleep disorders, including exogenous melatonin, during pregnancy and lactation.

AB  - Hypnosis is a commonly used therapy option in dentistry and medicine for fear and pain reduction. Nevertheless, it is viewed very critically, as there is still insufficient evidence for a treatment effect. Specific phobia of dental treatment and dental anxiety are prevalent conditions that can cause an oral health impairment. This paper critically reviews 19 clinical trials aimed at reducing dental anxiety and fear avoidance in adults, published in peer-reviewed journals between 1979 and 2021. The search identified 257 papers; 223 were selected after removing duplicates. A total of 188 articles were excluded after title and abstract evaluation; 35 full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Another 10 papers were discharged after full text evaluation, as these were case reports and questionnaires. Six papers were discharged due to the lack of a comparable scale to measure dental anxiety. The following treatment techniques were reviewed: various forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation training, benzodiazepine premedication, self-hypnosis by audio therapy, hypnotherapy, hypnosis, and nitrous oxide sedation. CBT delivered in a variety of formats, including one-session treatment, showed the most evidence for the efficacy of reducing anxiety. A wide heterogeneity of methods allowed only the inclusion of five studies to the performed meta-analysis, showing contrasting results for the application of hypnosis. The main reason for this issue is the great variety in methods used, making a distinct assessment of hypnotic interventions difficult. However, the results of the systematic review are promising in that hypnosis can also be regarded as powerful and successful method for anxiety reduction, while there are also studies with a small or even slightly negative effect. Therefore, further research is needed. Within the limitations of the current study, a more consistent use of methods to examine anxiety for hypnosis research is recommended.

AB  - The worldwide rising trend of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) calls for innovative and efficacious techniques for assessment and treatment. Virtual reality (VR) technology gains theoretical support from rehabilitation and pedagogical theories and offers a variety of capabilities in educational and interventional contexts with affordable products. VR is attracting increasing attention in the medical and healthcare industry, as it provides fully interactive three-dimensional simulations of real-world settings and social situations, which are particularly suitable for cognitive and performance training, including social and interaction skills. This review article offers a summary of current perspectives and evidence-based VR applications for children with ASD, with a primary focus on social communication, including social functioning, emotion recognition, and speech and language. Technology- and design-related limitations, as well as disputes over the application of VR to autism research and therapy, are discussed, and future directions of this emerging field are highlighted with regards to application expansion and improvement, technology enhancement, linguistic diversity, and the development of theoretical models and brain-based research.

AB  - Caregiving dyads (i.e., an informal caregiver and a care recipient) work as an interdependent emotional system, whereby it is assumed that what happens to one member of the dyad essentially happens to the other. For example, both members of the dyad are involved in care giving and care receiving experiences and therefore major life events, such as a serious illness affect the dyad and not only the individual. Consequently, informal caregiving may be considered an example of dyadic interdependence, which is "the process by which interacting people influence one another's experience. " This systematic review aimed to synthesize studies of dyadic interdependence, specifically in non-spousal caregiving dyads (e.g., adult children-parents, siblings, other relatives, or friends). Electronic databases (PsycINFO, Pubmed, and CINAHL) were systematically searched for dyadic studies reporting on interdependence in the emotional and relational wellbeing of non-spousal caregiving dyads. A total of 239 full-text studies were reviewed, of which 14 quantitative and qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria with a majority of dyads consisting of adult daughters caring for their older mothers. A narrative synthesis suggested mutual influences between non-spousal caregiving dyad members based on: (1) associations between intrapersonal (e.g., psychological functioning) and interpersonal (e.g., relationship processes) variables and emotional and relational wellbeing of the dyad; (2) associations between care context variables (e.g., socio-demographics and care tasks) and emotional and relational wellbeing of the dyad; and (3) patterns of covariation between caregivers' and care recipients' wellbeing. Evidence supporting dyadic interdependence among non-spousal caregiving dyads shed light on the ways dyad members influence each other's wellbeing while providing and receiving care (e.g., via the exchange of support). Future studies investigating mutual influences in dyads, should differentiate subsamples of caregivers based on relationship type, and adopt dyadic and longitudinal designs.Systematic Review Registration[https;//www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#recordDetails.], identifier [CRD42021213147].

AB  - Background:& nbsp;Aging and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are important risk factors for the development of cognitive deterioration and dementia. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of an exercise intervention on cognitive function in older T2DM patients.& nbsp;Methods:& nbsp;Eight literature databases (PubMed, EBSCO, Scopus, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Ovid, and ProQuest) were searched from inception to 20 January 2022. The researchers examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the impact of exercise on the cognitive performance of older T2DM patients. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs was used to assess each study. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations) approach. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Modified MMSE (3MSE), and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were used to evaluate the cognitive outcomes. We performed a subgroup analysis with stratification according to exercise intervention modality, duration, and cognitive impairment.& nbsp;Results:& nbsp;Five trials were eligible, with a total of 738 T2DM patients. The combined findings revealed that exercise improved global cognitive function significantly (standardized mean difference: 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.23-2.44, p < 0.01). The effect of exercise on global cognitive performance was not significantly influenced by intervention modality, intervention duration, or cognitive impairment in the sub-group analysis (p > 0.05). In the studies that were included, no relevant adverse events were reported.& nbsp;Conclusion:& nbsp;Exercise is beneficial in improving global cognitive function in older adults with T2DM. Studies with bigger sample sizes and higher quality are additionally expected to draw more definite conclusions.Systematic Review Registration[], identifier [CRD42022296049].

AB  - Objective: The Staff Attitude to Coercion Scale (SACS) was developed to assess mental health care staff's attitudes to the use of coercion in treatment. The staff's attitudes to the use of coercion may also influence their willingness to engage in professional development projects aimed at reducing use of coercion. This study systematically reviews the existing evidence related to the measurement properties of the SACS in papers published since the publication of SACS in 2008. Methods: Seven databases were searched for studies published until October 2021 assessing the measurement properties of SACS or using SACS. All original studies reporting data relevant for the assessment of measurement properties of the SACS were eligible for inclusion. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed and rated using the COnsensus-based Standard for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN). Results: Of the 81 identified publications, 13 studies with a total of 2,675 respondents met the inclusion criteria. Most studies reported data on structural validity and internal consistency, with highmethodological quality, but there were almost no data on any other measurement properties. Conclusion: We found evidence for adequate structural validity and internal consistency of the SACS, while other importantmeasurement properties were not addressed in any of the reviewed studies. Caution is needed when interpreting results of the SACS in terms of aspects such as reliability, criterion validity and measurement error. The relationship between staff attitudes to coercion and the actual use of coercion also remains unclear and needs to be further investigated.

Method: The databases of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from the establishment to June 2021. All randomized controlled trials about rTMS treatment for PSD were enrolled. Dysphagia Grade (DG) and Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) were applied as the major dysphagia severity rating scales to evaluate the outcomes. Results: A total of 12 clinical randomized controlled studies were included in our study. The summary effect size indicated that rTMS had a positive effect on PSD (SMD = -0.67, p < 0.001). The subgroup analysis for treatment duration and different stroke stages showed significant differences (treatment duration >5 days: SMD = -0.80, p < 0.001; subacute phase after stroke: SMD = -0.60, p < 0.001). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed among the other stimulation parameter subgroups (including stimulation frequency, location, and a single stimulation time) ( p > 0.05). Conclusion: rTMS is beneficial to the recovery of PSD patients, while an intervention of more than 5 days and in the subacute phase after stroke might bring new strategies and rational therapeutics to the treatment of PSD.

AB  - Objectives: Globally, female workers workforce in Oil, Gas, and Mining (OGM) industry have increased significantly. The complexities of the OGM operations and the extensive exposure to workplace hazards potentially affect the health status of workers, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes of female workers. Yet, the current state of knowledge on SRH issues in OGM contexts seems to be limited and fragmented. This scoping review aims to identify the occupational factors that influence women's SRH outcomes in OGM industry.
   Methods: This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute's guidelines (PRISMA) and was conducted in five databases, including the citation chaining via Google Scholar and manual search through relevant organisations and Government websites. Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria and were analysed.
   Results: Despite the scarcity of evidence, chemical and physical are found to be the predominant factors greatly influencing women workers' SRH outcomes in OGM. Most studies showed menstrual and cycle disorders, and risky pregnancy as key SRH issues. However, menstruation disorder was considerably linked with psychological and organisational factors.
   Conclusion: This review suggests further empirical research on the relationship between OGM occupational hazards and women workers' SRH. This will contribute to improvements in workplace safety legislations, measures, policies, and management systems taking into account women's needs.

AB  - BackgroundDeep brain stimulation (DBS) has been proposed as a last-resort treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) and has shown potential antidepressant effects in multiple clinical trials. However, the clinical effects of DBS for MDD are inconsistent and suboptimal, with 30-70% responder rates. The currently used DBS targets for MDD are not individualized, which may account for suboptimal effect. ObjectiveWe aim to review and summarize currently used DBS targets for MDD and relevant diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies. MethodsA literature search of the currently used DBS targets for MDD, including clinical trials, case reports and anatomy, was performed. We also performed a literature search on DTI studies in MDD. ResultsA total of 95 studies are eligible for our review, including 51 DBS studies, and 44 DTI studies. There are 7 brain structures targeted for MDD DBS, and 9 white matter tracts with microstructural abnormalities reported in MDD. These DBS targets modulate different brain regions implicated in distinguished dysfunctional brain circuits, consistent with DTI findings in MDD. ConclusionsIn this review, we propose a taxonomy of DBS targets for MDD. These results imply that clinical characteristics and white matter tracts abnormalities may serve as valuable supplements in future personalized DBS for MDD.

KW  - Survey fatigue
KW  - Research quality
KW  - MENTAL-HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: Concerns have been raised about the quantity and quality of research conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly related to the mental health and wellbeing of health care workers (HCWs). For understanding the volume, source, methodological rigour and degree of overlap in COVID-19, studies were conducted among HCWs in the United Kingdom (UK). Study design: Mixed methods approach, literature review and audit. Methods: First, a literature review of published research studies and second, an audit of studies HCWs have been invited to complete. For the literature review, we searched Medline, PsycINFO and Nexis, webpages of three medical organisations (Royal Society of Medicine, Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association), and the YouGov website. For the audit, a non-random purposive sample of six HCWs from different London NHS Trusts reviewed email, WhatsApp and SMS messages they received for study invitations. Results: The literature review identified 27 studies; the audit identified 70 study invitations. Studies identified by the literature review were largely of poor methodological rigour: only eight studies (30%) provided response rate, one study (4%) reported having ethical approval, and one study (4%) reported funding details. There was substantial overlap in the topics measured. In the audit, volunteers received a median of 12 invitations. The largest number of study invitations were for national surveys (n = 23), followed by local surveys (n = 16) and research surveys (n = 8). Conclusion: HCWs have been asked to complete numerous surveys that frequently have methodological shortcomings and overlapping aims. Many studies do not follow scientific good-practice and generate questionable, non-generalisable results. (c) 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To carry out a quasi-systematic review of the use of serious video games for health as a cognitive rehabilitative tool in patients diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.& nbsp;Method: A quasi-systematic review of serious video games used as an evaluative and rehabilitative tool in patients with ADHD was conducted. It included behavioral patterns in the use of video games and addiction problems in this population. For its elaboration the PRISMA GUIDES were followed. The search was carried out in three PubMed databases, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo using the keywords: [game OR serious game OR computer game) AND (psychotherapy OR rehabilitation OR intervention OR mental disorders) AND (adhd)], [(adhd) AND (Video game addiction)]. All articles written in English, Spanish, or Portuguese from January 1970 to June 2021 were included: those in which reference was made to the use of video games and/or new technologies as a therapeutic and evaluative tool in children and adults diagnosed with ADHD, as well as those that referred to behavioral and clinical patterns in the use of video games.& nbsp;Results: We found 605 articles of which 128 were reviewed (44 observational studies, 26 quasi-experimental studies, 26 experimental studies, 8 systematic reviews, 9 narrative texts, 6 case reports, 7 pilot studies, 8 systematic reviews, and 2 meta-analyses). Serious video games can be used to ameliorate ADHD symptoms while improving adherence to treatment. Some serious video games show high accuracy properties assessing ADHD features.& nbsp;Conclusion: Serious video games for health are increasingly being used as a cognitive rehabilitation tool in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).& nbsp;

AB  - Parent-infant EEG is a novel hyperscanning paradigm to measure social interaction simultaneously in the brains of parents and infants. The number of studies using parent-infant dual-EEG as a theoretical framework to measure brain-to-brain synchrony during interaction is rapidly growing, while the methodology for measuring synchrony is not yet uniform. While adult dual-EEG methodology is quickly improving, open databases, tutorials, and methodological validations for dual-EEG with infants are largely missing. In this practical guide, we provide a step-by-step manual on how to implement and run parent-infant EEG paradigms in a neurodevelopmental laboratory in naturalistic settings (e.g., free interactions). Next, we highlight insights on the variety of choices that can be made during (pre)processing dual-EEG data, including recommendations on interpersonal neural coupling metrics and interpretations of the results. Moreover, we provide an exemplar dataset of two mother-infant dyads during free interactions ("free play") that may serve as practice material. Instead of providing a critical note, we would like to move the field of parent-infant EEG forward and be transparent about the challenges that come along with the exciting opportunity to study the development of our social brain within the naturalistic context of dual-EEG.

AB  - The standard participant in cognitive research on the bilingual mental lexicon is literate in English and some other European language written in the same (Latin) script, i.e., in a shared alphabetic orthography. Why should this matter? It matters because research conducted with monoscriptal users of European languages has been taken to have broader applicability. This is problematic because most bilinguals who are literate in two languages are likely to be biscriptal-not monoscriptal-and their languages are likely to be written in orthographies that are not alphabetic. In this essay I reflect on the theoretical and ethical implications of this disconnect between the typical bilingual research participant and the typical bilingual. I argue that an implicit construction of monoscriptal bilingualism as the standard form of bilingualism and the centering of characteristics of alphabetic writing systems in bilingual word recognition research has led to a serious gap in our understanding of the bilingual mental lexicon, as we know very little about the majority of the world's bilingual language users, whose writing systems are very different from the (alphabetic) standard promoted in existing research. If our understanding of bilingual lexical representation is to move beyond its monoscriptal focus the field will have to become more reflexive about its epistemic exclusionary practices and create space for crosslinguistic research that centers biscriptal language users of other-than-alphabetic writing systems and studies them in their own right, not just for how they might corroborate claims based on a less representative population.

AB  - Objective: Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) has become a social problem. Literature suggests that negative life events can cause numerous problematic behaviors and part of them will result in IAD. However, there is a lack of evidence that elucidates the association between negative life events and IAD. Thereby, we performed a comprehensive analysis to further document the relationship between negative life events and IAD among adolescents and college students in China.
   Methods: We searched ten electronic databases for relevant articles. We extracted correlation coefficient (r) values from each study and calculated 95% confidence interval (95% CI) after applying Fisher's z. A random-effect or fixed-effect model was applied to analyze the data. Heterogeneity was examined using I-2 statistics and the Cochran's Q statistics.
   Results: A total of 31 studies were involved in this meta-analysis. Positive correlation was observed between negative life events and IAD. The subtype interpersonal relationship of negative life events was closely associationed with IAD.
   Conclusion: There were significant positive association between negative life events and IAD. The findings can be used to guide IAD interventions.

AB  - Background and objective: To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis conducted about the association between congenital heart disease (CHD) and the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorders (ASD) based on observational studies.
   Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched from the earliest possible year to December 2020. Heterogeneity was conducted using the chi-square test and its quantity was measured using the I-2 statistic. The publication bias was assessed using Egger's and Begg's line regression tests. The results were reported using the odds ratio (OR) estimated with its 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model.
   Results: In total, 812 citations were included in the search initial until December 2020 with 467,164 children. Based on the random effect model, the estimated OR of the risk of ASD associated with CHD was OR=1.35 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.52; 6 studies; I-2=0.0%) and the risk of ADHD associated with CHD was OR=3.04 (95% CI: 1.58, 4.49; 15 studies; I-2 =88.1%).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggested that CHD is a risk factor for ASD and ADHD. Therefore, Screening for ASD and ADHD should be considered among young children with CHD.

AB  - There has been a historic lack of psychosocially geared treatment studies for congenital and neonatal conditions that impact brain development, despite well-established knowledge that these conditions impact cognitive development, quality of life (QoL), mental health, and academic success. Objective The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate the research literature focusing on the effects of interventions in psychosocially geared programs for children with neonatal brain injury on school and psychological outcomes. Methods Psychosocially geared programs broadly refer to interventions to improve parenting and school functioning, or child behavior, as well as other interventions that have a psychological component but may be more physically oriented, such as goal-directed physiotherapy. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, PsychINFO, and Embase was completed between June and July 2020. The methodological quality of included articles was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB-2). Results and Conclusion Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria and demonstrated adequate risk of bias (i.e., low risk of bias or some concerns). The studies included family (n = 2), parenting (n = 7), and child (n = 10) interventions. There is some evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for children with neonatal brain injury and their families on academic outcomes, behavior, and QoL, indicated by positive intervention effects in 65% (n = 13) of studies.

AB  - Background Several investigations were carried out during the pandemic, demonstrating a number of neurological symptoms linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Objectives The goal of this review is to discuss COVID-19 disease's neurological signs and squeals. Methodology From December 2019 to May 2020, data were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect, as well as a manual search using Google Scholar. COVID-19, neurological symptoms, cranial nerves, motor system were among the key phrases utilized in the search. Results The intensity of respiratory involvement increases the likelihood of neurological symptoms and consequences. According to some research, it might range from 34% to 80%. The central and peripheral neural systems are both affected, resulting in cranial nerve palsies and limb paralysis. Conclusion COVID-19 neurologic complications are key drivers of patient severity and mortality. Headache, convulsions, mental and psychic disorders, delirium, and insomnia are just some of the symptoms that the virus can cause. The olfactory nerve is the most commonly damaged cranial nerve, resulting in anosmia. Stroke (mostly infarction), encephalitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, relapse of multiple sclerosis, and transverse myelitis are all symptoms and squeals.

AB  - BackgroundForensic psychiatry is a subspecialty dealing with the diagnosis and treatment of mentally ill offenders. However, forensic treatment standards vary. Differences arise among forensic treatment standards, due to variations in either the legal framework, the general psychiatric treatment standards, or the forensic training standards. Thus, to date there is no evidence-based pattern for how forensic services should be organized and provided. AimsThe aim of this article is to compare forensic services in various countries in order to contribute to the current debate on international forensic treatment standards, by informing about existing differences in available policies. MethodsThis scoping review was conducted by reviewing the academic literature regarding forensic treatment around the world. Studies were identified from Pub-Med and Google-Scholar. Keywords for the search included "forensic psychiatry," "mentally ill offenders," "legal framework," "jurisdiction," and the names of geographical regions. ResultsForensic treatment admission varies significantly around the world. There are countries that do not recognize forensic psychiatry as a subspecialty, whereas other countries apply insufficient forensic training. Most countries provide inpatient treatment for mentally ill offenders. However, service organization varies, including where the services are delivered (prisons, high-security hospitals, and general psychiatric departments). Forensic services are mainly centralized, although the need for outpatient care is emerging. DiscussionDifferences may originate mainly from variations in the legal tradition. These differences combined with the limited evidence on the effectiveness of the intervention imply the need for the optimization of forensic treatment standards on an international level. Therefore, further follow-up studies are needed.

AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is one of the most dangerous invasive species in the world. Females bite mammalian hosts, including humans, to obtain blood for egg development. The ancestral range of Ae. albopictus likely spanned from India to Japan and this species has since invaded a substantial portion of the globe. Ae. albopictus can be broadly categorized into temperate and tropical populations. One key to their ability to invade diverse ecological spaces is the capacity of females to detect seasonal changes and produce stress-resistant eggs that survive harsh winters. Females living in temperate regions respond to cues that predict the onset of unfavorable environmental conditions by producing eggs that enter maternally instigated embryonic diapause, a developmentally arrested state, which allows species survival by protecting the embryos until favorable conditions return. To appropriately produce diapause eggs, the female must integrate environmental cues and internal physiological state (blood feeding and reproductive status) to allocate nutrients and regulate reproduction. There is variation in reproductive responses to environmental cues between interfertile tropical and temperate populations depending on whether females are actively producing diapause vs. non-diapause eggs and whether they originate from populations that are capable of diapause. Although diapause-inducing environmental cues and diapause eggs have been extensively characterized, little is known about how the female detects gradual environmental changes and coordinates her reproductive status with seasonal dynamics to lay diapause eggs in order to maximize offspring survival. Previous studies suggest that the circadian system is involved in detecting daylength as a critical cue. However, it is unknown which clock network components are important, how these connect to reproductive physiology, and how they may differ between behavioral states or across populations with variable diapause competence. In this review, we showcase Ae. albopictus as an emerging species for neurogenetics to study how the nervous system combines environmental conditions and internal state to optimize reproductive behavior. We review environmental cues for diapause induction, downstream pathways that control female metabolic changes and reproductive capacity, as well as diapause heterogeneity between populations with different evolutionary histories. We highlight genetic tools that can be implemented in Ae. albopictus to identify signaling molecules and cellular circuits that control diapause. The tools and discoveries made in this species could translate to a broader understanding of how environmental cues are interpreted to alter reproductive physiology in other species and how populations with similar genetic and circuit organizations diversify behavioral patterns. These approaches may yield new targets to interfere with mosquito reproductive capacity, which could be exploited to reduce mosquito populations and the burden of the pathogens they transmit.

AB  - Childhood maltreatment is a known risk factor for the development of suicidal behavior. Possible mediators of the association between childhood maltreatment and suicide have been analyzed. Some studies have considered impulsivity as one of these mediators, but there are no previous reviews on this topic. We, therefore, present a systematic review and mediation meta-analysis of the literature summarizing the evidence on impulsivity as a mediator of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and lifetime suicidal behavior. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review was registered in the PROSPERO database. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, WebOfScience, and EMBASE databases up to February 2021 to identify studies exploring the association between childhood maltreatment and suicide through impulsivity. Fourteen articles met the selection criteria and were included in the review. Seven articles could be included in the mediation meta-analysis. Impulsivity was a significant mediator of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and suicidal behavior in ten of the fourteen included studies. This result was confirmed using mediation meta-analysis (beta = .06, 95% CI 0.03-0.10). Studies suggest that exposure to traumatic situations in childhood affects the proper neurobiological, cognitive, and affective development of individuals. This may increase impulsivity, which in turn would be related to an increased risk of suicide. The effects of childhood maltreatment and impulsivity may be both therapeutic targets of interest to reduce suicide rates.

AB  - In addition to the well-known degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, enteric neurons can also be affected in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Dopaminergic neurons have recently been identified in the enteric nervous system (ENS). While ENS dopaminergic neurons have been shown to degenerate in genetic mouse models of PD, analyses of their survival in enteric biopsies of PD patients have provided inconsistent results to date. In this context, this review seeks to highlight the distinctive and shared factors and properties that control the evolution of these two sets of dopaminergic neurons from neuronal precursors to aging neurons. Although their cellular sources and developmental times of origin differ, midbrain and ENS dopaminergic neurons express many transcription factors in common and their respective environments express similar neurotrophic molecules. For example, Foxa2 and Sox6 are expressed by both populations to promote the specification, differentiation, and long-term maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype. Both populations exhibit sustained patterns of excitability that drive intrinsic vulnerability over time. In disorders such as PD, colon biopsies have revealed aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the submucosal plexus where dopaminergic neurons reside and lack blood barrier protection. Thus, these enteric neurons may be more susceptible to neurotoxic insults and aggregation of alpha-synuclein that spreads from gut to midbrain. Under sustained stress, inefficient autophagy leads to neurodegeneration, GI motility dysfunction, and PD symptoms. Recent findings suggest that novel neurotrophic factors such as CDNF have the potential to be used as neuroprotective agents to prevent and treat ENS symptoms of PD.

AB  - Biological organisms display remarkably flexible behaviours. This is an area of active investigation, in particular in the fields of artificial intelligence, computational and cognitive neuroscience. While inductive biases and broader cognitive functions are undoubtedly important, the ability to monitor and evaluate one's performance or oneself - metacognition - strikes as a powerful resource for efficient learning. Often measured as decision con-fidence in neuroscience and psychology experiments, metacognition appears to reflect a broad range of abstraction levels and downstream behavioural effects. Within this context, the formal investigation of how metacognition interacts with learning processes is a recent endeavour. Of special interest are the neural and computational underpinnings of confidence and reinforcement learning modules. This review discusses a general hierarchy of confidence functions and their neuro-computational relevance for adaptive behaviours. It then in-troduces novel ways to study the formation and use of meta-representations and nonconscious mental repre-sentations related to learning and confidence, and concludes with a discussion on outstanding questions and wider perspectives.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising treatment modality for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is widely used for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases, such as depression, motor stroke, and neuropathic pain. However, the underlying mechanisms of rTMS-mediated neuronal modulation are not fully understood. In this respect, concurrent or simultaneous TMS-fMRI, in which TMS is applied during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is a viable tool to gain insights, as it enables an investigation of the immediate effects of TMS. Concurrent application of TMS during neuroimaging usually causes severe artifacts due to magnetic field inhomogeneities induced by TMS. However, by carefully interleaving the TMS pulses with MR signal acquisition in the way that these are far enough apart, we can avoid any image distortions. While the very first feasibility studies date back to the 1990s, recent developments in coil hardware and acquisition techniques have boosted the number of TMS-fMRI applications. As such, a concurrent application requires expertise in both TMS and MRI mechanisms and sequencing, and the hurdle of initial technical set up and maintenance remains high. This review gives a comprehensive overview of concurrent TMS-fMRI techniques by collecting (1) basic information, (2) technical challenges and developments, (3) an overview of findings reported so far using concurrent TMS-fMRI, and (4) current limitations and our suggestions for improvement. By sharing this review, we hope to attract the interest of researchers from various backgrounds and create an educational knowledge base.

AB  - Parenting and family environment have significant impact on child development, including development of executive function, attention, and self-regulation, and may affect the risk of developmental disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This paper examines the relationship of parenting and family environment factors with ADHD. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in 2014 and identified 52 longitudinal studies. A follow-up search in 2021 identified 7 additional articles, for a total of 59 studies that examined the association of parenting factors with ADHD outcomes: ADHD overall (diagnosis or symptoms), ADHD diagnosis specifically, or presence of the specific ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. For parenting factors that were present in three or more studies, pooled effect sizes were calculated separately for dichotomous or continuous ADHD outcomes, accounting for each study's conditional variance. Factors with sufficient information for analysis were parenting interaction quality (sensitivity/warmth, intrusiveness/reactivity, and negativity/harsh discipline), maltreatment (general maltreatment and physical abuse), parental relationship status (divorce, single parenting), parental incarceration, and child media exposure. All factors showed a significant direct association with ADHD outcomes, except sensitivity/warmth which had an inverse association. Parenting factors predicted diagnosis and overall symptoms as well as inattentive and hyperactive symptoms when measured, but multiple factors showed significant heterogeneity across studies. These findings support the possibility that parenting and family environment influences ADHD symptoms and may affect a child's likelihood of being diagnosed with ADHD. Prevention strategies that support parents, such as decreasing parenting challenges and increasing access to parent training in behavior management, may improve children's long-term developmental health.

AB  - Objectives This review investigates the efficacy and safety of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) combined with psychosocial intervention on depressive symptoms. Materials and methods We systematically searched five electronic databases from their inception to June 2021: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Medline. Randomized or non-randomized clinical trials in which NIBS plus psychosocial intervention was compared to control conditions in people with depressive symptoms were included. Results A total of 17 eligible studies with 660 participants were included. The meta-analysis results showed that NIBS combined with psychosocial therapy had a positive effect on moderate to severe depression ([SMD = - 0.46, 95%CI (- 0.90, - 0.02), I-2 = 73%, p < .01]), but did not significantly improve minimal to mild depression ([SMD = - 0.12, 95%CI (- 0.42, 0.18), I-2 = 0%, p = .63]). Compared with NIBS alone, the combination treatment had a significantly greater effect in alleviating depressive symptoms ([SMD = - 0.84, 95%CI (- 1.25, - 0.42), I-2 = 0%, p = .93]). However, our results suggested that the pooled effect size of ameliorating depression of NIBS plus psychosocial intervention had no significant difference compared with the combination of sham NIBS [SMD = - 0.12, 95%CI (- 0.31, 0.07), I-2 = 0%, p = .60] and psychosocial intervention alone [SMD = - 0.97, 95%CI (- 2.32, 0.38), I-2 = 72%, p = .01]. Conclusion NIBS when combined with psychosocial intervention has a significant positive effect in alleviating moderately to severely depressive symptoms. Further well-designed studies of NIBS combined with psychosocial intervention on depression should be carried out to consolidate the conclusions and explore the in-depth underlying mechanism.

AB  - Strategic interactions, where an individual's payoff depends on the decisions of multiple intelligent agents, are ubiquitous among social animals. They span a variety of important social behaviors such as competition, cooperation, coordination, and communication, and often involve complex, intertwining cognitive operations ranging from basic reward processing to higher-order mentalization. Here, we review the progress and challenges in probing the neural and cognitive mechanisms of strategic behavior of interacting individuals, drawing an analogy to recent developments in studies of reward-seeking behavior, in particular, how research focuses in the field of strategic behavior have been expanded from adaptive behavior based on trial-and-error to flexible decisions based on limited prior experience. We highlight two important research questions in the field of strategic behavior: (i) How does the brain exploit past experience for learning to behave strategically? and (ii) How does the brain decide what to do in novel strategic situations in the absence of direct experience? For the former, we discuss the utility of learning models that have effectively connected various types of neural data with strategic learning behavior and helped elucidate the interplay among multiple learning processes. For the latter, we review the recent evidence and propose a neural generative mechanism by which the brain makes novel strategic choices through simulating others' goal-directed actions according to rational or bounded-rational principles obtained through indirect social knowledge.

AB  - Background: Needle-related pain, fear, and anxiety can be a deterrent to treatments in children and adolescents. Virtual reality (VR) can be used to manage the poor experience of needle procedures. Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of VR on pain, fear, and anxiety related to needle procedures in children and adolescents. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for potentially eligible studies published up to June 2021. The outcomes were pain assessed by the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale (WBS) or Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), fear assessed by Children's Fear Scale (CFS), and anxiety assessed by Children's Anxiety Meter (CAM), VAS, or CFS. Because of expected heterogeneity among studies, all analyses were conducted using the random-effects model. Results: Ten studies were included (571 children in the VR group and 575 in the control group). Based on the WBS, VR reduced pain, either self-reported (WMD = -2.17, 95%CI: -3.37, -0.97), parent-reported (WMD = -3.52, 95%CI: -4.62, -2.42), nurse-reported (WMD = -3.29, 95%CI: -5.59, -0.99), and physician/investigator-reported (WMD = -3.48, 95%CI: -5.93, -1.04). Using the FPS-R, VR reduced needle-related pain compared with controls (WMD = -0.85, 95%CI: -1.64, -0.06). Similar results were observed for fear (children/adolescents: WMD = -1.52, 95%CI: -2.18, -0.86; parents: WMD = -1.71, 95%CI: -2.30, -1.13; nurses: WMD = -1.55, 95%CI: -2.47, -0.63; physicians/investigators: WMD = -0.59, 95%CI: -1.00, -0.18) and anxiety (self-reported: WMD = -2.79, 95%CI: -4.07, -1.54; parent-reported: WMD = -3.87, 95%CI: -5.58, -2.15; nurse-reported: WMD = -4.64, 95%CI: -6.56, -2.71; physician/investigator-reported: WMD = -2.06, 95%CI: -4.13, -0.00). Conclusion: A VR-based intervention could reduce needle-related pain, fear, and anxiety in children and adolescents.

AB  - Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) are represented by several compounds used to ameliorate the image, the appearance, or an athletic or non-athletic performance. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an endogenous molecule first used as anesthetic and then marketed as a nutritional supplement with a wide diffusion in the bodybuilding community. The aim of the present work is to provide a toxicological characterization of the use of GHB as a PED, including the scientific basis for its use, the patterns of use/abuse, and the health risks arising from its consumption in this peculiar recreative setting. A literature search was performed on multiple databases including experimental studies on humans and animals as well as epidemiological reports and forensic case reports/series. Experimental studies demonstrated that the use of GHB as a PED is motivated by the release of growth hormone and the induction of sleep. However, the panel of desired performance-related effects was much wider in real cases and epidemiological studies. Even though the use of GHB among bodybuilders has decreased, its use to enhance some kind of performance, particularly sexual ones or social-communicative ones, as well as means to increase mood and perceived energy, is still common.

AB  - This literature Review had the purpose of inspecting how the use of active learning methodologies in higher education can impact students' Well-being. Considering the Heads of State meeting at United Nations Headquarters on September 2015, in which the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by all United Nations Member states, this literature review is limbered to the time period between September 2015 and September 2021. A Previous research focused on reviews was made to support the conceptual framework. The search was done in two databases - Web of Science main collection and Scopus - by two researchers autonomously, using the following search criteria: "higher education AND active learning AND student AND wellness OR well-being OR wellbeing." The studies section attended the following inclusion criteria: (i) published in peer-reviewed journals; (ii) empirical studies; (iii) written in English, French, Portuguese or Spanish; (iv) open access full text; (v) Higher education context; and (vi) focused on the topic under study. The search provided 10 articles which were submitted to an inductive thematic analysis attending to the purpose of this review, resulting in two themes: (i) students' well-being during confinement; (ii) methodological solutions for students' well-being. Data show that the use of active methodologies, as digital technologies, and the incorporation of some practice as physical activity and volunteering seems to benefit students' well-being, namely in their academic achievement, physical, emotional, and social life, and empower them to the professional future with multi-competencies. Higher education institutions need to understand the value of active learning methodologies in sustained education and promote them in their practices.

AB  - Background Autistic students are reported to move schools at a high rate, but little is understood about why this is happening. What is known is that the effects of school mobility can negatively impact both short- and long-term outcomes, particularly the child's learning, behaviours, mental health and school retention. Aims The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the research on factors and experiences which influence the family's decision to move their autistic child to another school. Methods A protocol was registered with PROPERO (ID: CRD4202120794). Searches were conducted with ERIC, Scopus and Web of Science and seven studies were identified. Results The studies focused on three main types of mobility: mainstream-to-mainstream school moves, moving between mainstream and segregated schools, and moving between mainstream and homeschool. Parents' concerns for their child's learning, social experiences and mental health, as well as their own interactions with their child's school, influenced the decision to leave. Whilst there were similarities across the studies for reasons to move, there were also differences based upon the settings between which students moved. Conclusion The findings highlight the need for further research across all school mobility types to better understand the reasons underpinning high rates of school mobility for autistic students.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction, results from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although the precise causes of PD are still unknown, several risk factors for PD have been determined, including aging, genetic mutations, environmental factors, and gender. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying risk factor-related neurodegeneration in PD remain elusive. Endoplasmic reticulum stress, excessive reactive oxygen species production, and impaired autophagy have been implicated in neuronal death in the SNc in PD. Considering that these pathological processes are tightly associated with intracellular Ca2+, it is reasonable to hypothesize that dysregulation of Ca2+ handling may mediate risk factors-related PD pathogenesis. We review the recent findings on how risk factors cause Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and how aberrant Ca2+ handling triggers dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the SNc in PD, thus putting forward the possibility that manipulation of specific Ca2+ handling proteins and subcellular Ca2+ homeostasis may lead to new promising strategies for PD treatment.

AB  - Background: Social cognition is significantly associated with daily functioning in patients with schizophrenia. Its neural basis remains unknown.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed. Studies using imaging to measure theory of mind (ToM) in schizophrenia were identified. Imaging data were synthesized using the seed-based d mapping approach. Potential neuropathways were hypothesized based on the identified brain regions activated during ToM tasks.
   Results: A total of 25 studies were included in the present study. Compared with healthy people, patients with schizophrenia showed hyperactivations in superior longitudinal fasciculus II and hypoactivations in superior frontal gyrus, precuneus and cuneus, and precentral gyrus during ToM tasks. The primary brain regions involved in the potential neuropathways in schizophrenia were the middle temporal gyrus, superior and inferior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor areas.
   Conclusion: Deactivated brain regions in schizophrenia overlapped with the default mode and salience networks. Our findings shed light on how to develop a diagnostic tool for deficits in social cognition using neuroimaging techniques and effective therapeutic interventions to rectify dysfunction in schizophrenia.

AB  - The presence of microplastics in the aquatic environment poses a serious threat not only to aquatic organisms but also to human beings that consume them. The uptake and effects of microplastics have been studied in almost all groups of aquatic organisms. This review details the different aspects of microplastics exposure in an ecologically and economically important group of crustaceans, the Decapods. A majority of Decapod crustaceans such as prawns, shrimp, crabs, lobsters and crayfish are consumed as seafood and play important roles in food chains and food webs. Numerous studies are available on the accumulation of microplastics in tissues such as the gills, hepatopancreas and gastrointestinal tract in these organisms. Experimental studies have also highlighted the toxic effects of microplastics such as oxidative stress, immunotoxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity in them. This review also summarizes the ecological impacts and implications in human beings as well as lacunae with regard to microplastic uptake in Decapods.

AB  - Conventionally, therapeutic assessments, interventions, and treatments have focussed on death-related "losses and grief" responses. It is purported that the COVID-19 aftermath has resulted in losses that cannot always be encapsulated using this method. In search of reasoning, models and theories that explain the sweeping mass destruction that COVID-19 has caused, key concepts arise in terms of how we should deal with losses and in turn support patients in the health and social care sector, (notwithstanding formal therapeutic services). There is a crucial need to embrace ambiguous loss and disenfranchised grief into everyday terminology and be acquainted with these issues, thereby adapting how services/clinicians now embrace loss and grief work. Integral to this process is to recognize that there has been a disproportionate impact on Black and minority ethnic communities, and we now need to ensure services are "seriously culturally competent." Primary Care services/IAPT/health and social care/voluntary sector are all likely to be at the forefront of delivering these interventions and are already established gatekeepers. So, this article discusses the prognostic therapeutic response to non-death related losses and grief, not restricted to the formal echelons of therapeutic provision.

AB  - A diagnosis of dementia often comes with difficulties in understanding a conversational context and expressing how one feels. So far, research on how to facilitate advance care planning (ACP) for people with dementia focused on defining relevant themes and topics for conversations, or on how to formalize decisions made by surrogate decision makers, e.g., family members. The aim of this review is to provide a better scope of the existing research on practical communication aspects related to dementia in ACP conversations. In November 2020, seven databases were searched to select papers for inclusion (Proquest, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Psycinfo, Amed, and Cinahl). This search was updated in December 2021. The search strategy consisted of three tiers (related terms to "dementia, " "communication " and "ACP "), intersected by using the Boolean term "AND, " and resulted in 787 studies. Two researchers followed explicit criteria for two sequential levels of screening, based on titles and abstracts and full papers. A total of 22 studies were included for data analysis. Seven topics (i.e., importance of having ACP conversations, knowledge gap, inclusion of people with dementia in ACP conversations, policy vs. practice, adapting to cognitive changes, adapting to psychosocial changes, and adapting to emotional changes) emerged clustered around two themes (i.e., communicating with people with dementia in ACP, and changes in communication due to dementia). This scoping review provides practical suggestions for healthcare professionals to improve ACP communication and uncovered gaps in research on communication aspects related to dementia in ACP conversations, such as non-verbal behavior, timing and implementation, and personal preferences.

AB  - Models of local adaptation to spatially varying selection predict that maximum rates of evolution are determined by the interaction between increased adaptive potential owing to increased genetic variation, and the cost genetic variation brings by reducing population fitness. We discuss existing and new results from our laboratory assays and field transplants of rainforest Drosophila and UK butterflies along environmental gradients, which try to test these predictions in natural populations. Our data suggest that: (i) local adaptation along ecological gradients is not consistently observed in time and space, especially where biotic and abiotic interactions affect both gradient steepness and genetic variation in fitness; (ii) genetic variation in fitness observed in the laboratory is only sometimes visible to selection in the field, suggesting that demographic costs can remain high without increasing adaptive potential; and (iii) antagonistic interactions between species reduce local productivity, especially at ecological margins. Such antagonistic interactions steepen gradients and may increase the cost of adaptation by increasing its dimensionality. However, where biotic interactions do evolve, rapid range expansion can follow. Future research should test how the environmental sensitivity of genotypes determines their ecological exposure, and its effects on genetic variation in fitness, to predict the probability of evolutionary rescue at ecological margins.

AB  - Species' range limits are ubiquitous. This suggests that the evolution of the ecological niche is constrained in general and at the edges of distributions in particular. While there may be many ecological and genetic reasons for this phenomenon, here we focus on the potential role of trade-offs. We performed a literature search on evidence for trade-offs associated with geographical or elevational range limits. The majority of trade-offs were reported as relevant at either the cold end of species' distribution (n = 19), the warm or dry end (n = 19) or both together (n = 14). One common type of trade-off involved accelerating growth or development (27%), often at the cost of small size. Another common type involved resistance to or tolerance of climatic extremes that occur at certain periods of the year (64%), often at the cost of small size or reduced growth. Trade-offs overlapped with some of the classic trade-offs reported in life-history evolution or thermal adaptation. The results highlight several general insights about species' niches and ranges, and we outline how future research should better integrate the ecological context and test for the presence of microevolutionary trade-offs.

AB  - Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are frequently prescribed in case of non-response to first-line antidepressants in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Treatment of MDD often entails a trial-and-error process of finding a suitable antidepressant and its appropriate dose. Nowadays, a shift is seen towards a more personalized treatment strategy in MDD to increase treatment efficacy. One of these strategies involves the use of biomarkers for the prediction of antidepressant treatment response. We aimed to summarize biomarkers for prediction of TCA specific (i.e. per agent, not for the TCA as a drug class) treatment response in unipolar nonpsychotic MDD. We performed a systematic search in PubMed and MEDLINE. After full-text screening, 36 papers were included. Seven genetic biomarkers were identified for nortriptyline treatment response. For desipramine, we identified two biomarkers; one genetic and one nongenetic. Three nongenetic biomarkers were identified for imipramine. None of these biomarkers were replicated. Quality assessment demonstrated that biomarker studies vary in endpoint definitions and frequently lack power calculations. None of the biomarkers can be confirmed as a predictor for TCA treatment response. Despite the necessity for TCA treatment optimization, biomarker studies reporting drug-specific results for TCAs are limited and adequate replication studies are lacking. Moreover, biomarker studies generally use small sample sizes. To move forward, larger cohorts, pooled data or biomarkers combined with other clinical characteristics should be used to improve predictive power.

AB  - Several trials have shown preliminary evidence for the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a treatment for negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Here, we synthesize this literature in a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials of TMS in patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched for sham-controlled, randomized trials of TMS among patients with schizophrenia. The effect of TMS vs. sham on negative symptoms in each study was quantified by the standardized mean difference (SMD, Cohen's d) with 95% confidence intervals (95 degrees/0C1) and pooled across studies using an inverse variance random effects model. We identified 57 studies with a total of 2633 participants that were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed statistically significant superiority of TMS (SMD = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.26; 0.56, p-value < 0.001), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 5. Furthermore, stratified analyses suggested that TMS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and using a stimulation frequency >1 Hz was most efficacious. There was, however, substantial heterogeneity and high risk of bias among the included studies. In conclusion, TMS appears to be an efficacious treatment option for patients with schizophrenia suffering from negative symptoms, but the optimal TMS parameters are yet to be established.

AB  - A very high proportion of cases of intellectual disability are genetic in origin and are associated with the occurrence of epileptic seizures during childhood. These two disorders together effect more than 5% of the world's population. One feature linking the two diseases is that learning and memory require the synthesis of new synaptic components and ion channels, while maintenance of overall excitability also requires synthesis of similar proteins in response to altered neuronal stimulation. Many of these disorders result from mutations in proteins that regulate mRNA processing, translation initiation, translation elongation, mRNA stability or upstream translation modulators. One theme that emerges on reviewing this field is that mutations in proteins that regulate changes in translation following neuronal stimulation are more likely to result in epilepsy with intellectual disability than general translation regulators with no known role in activity-dependent changes. This is consistent with the notion that activity-dependent translation in neurons differs from that in other cells types in that the changes in local cellular composition, morphology and connectivity that occur generally in response to stimuli are directly coupled to local synaptic activity and persist for months or years after the original stimulus.

AB  - As an academic pursuit, neuroscience is enjoying a golden age. From a clinical perspective, our field is failing. Conventional 20th century drugs and devices are not well-matched to the heterogeneity, scale, and connectivity of neural circuits that produce aberrant mental states and behavior. Laboratory-based methods for editing neural genomes and sculpting activity patterns are exciting, but their applications for hundreds of millions of people with mental health disorders is uncertain. We argue that mechanisms for regulating adult brain plasticity and remodeling pathological activity are substantially pre-wired, and we suggest new minimally invasive strategies to harness and direct these endogenous systems. Drawing from studies across the neuroscience literature, we describe approaches that identify neural biomarkers more closely linked to upstream causes-rather than downstream consequences-of disordered behavioral states. We highlight the potential for innovation and discovery in reverse engineering approaches that refine bespoke behavioral "agonists" to drive upstream neural biomarkers in normative directions and reduce clinical symptoms for select classes of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - IntroductionElectroencephalography (EEG) represents a powerful tool to detect abnormal neural dynamics in child and adolescent psychiatry. Feeding and Eating Disorders (FEDs), such as anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) onset in childhood and adolescence. EEG has rarely been used to examine cortical brain activity in children and adolescents with FEDs. This review aims to summarize EEG findings in FEDs amongst children and adolescents, and to highlight areas deserving further research. MethodsWe searched the literature for EEG studies on children and adolescents with FEDs using Google Scholar, PsycINFO, Medline, and PubMed. ResultsTwelve studies were identified, the majority focusing on AN (N = 10). The identified studies suggest reduced action monitoring control (preparatory waves, N200, P300), specific perceptual-cognitive styles to body/face perception (late positive potentials/early posterior negativity), as well as fundamental changes in posterior theta oscillations in AN. Behavioral traits of BN/BED (i.e., loss of control eating, emotional eating), and AN seem to be associated with an increased attentional reactivity (P300) to visual food stimuli. ConclusionElectroencephalography research in children and adolescents with FEDs is limited and mostly focused on AN. While EEG abnormalities seem consistent with a reduced top-down control and attentional allocation deficits in AN, altered attention specific to food cues emerges across FEDs. Overcoming conventional EEG analyses, and investigating spatial properties (i.e., electrical neuroimaging), will enhance our understanding of FEDs neurobiology.

AB  - As conventional therapeutics can only treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), major focus of research in recent times is to slow down or prevent the progression of neuronal degeneration in PD. Non-targeted antioxidants have been an integral part of the conventional therapeutics regimen; however, their importance have lessened over time because of their controversial outcomes in clinical PD trials. Inability to permeate and localize within the mitochondria remains the main drawback on the part of non-targeted antioxidants inspite of possessing free radical scavenging properties. In contrast, mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants (MTAs), a special class of compounds have emerged having high advantages over non-targeted antioxidants by virtue of efficient pharmacokinetics and better absorption rate with capability to localize many fold inside the mitochondrial matrix. Preclinical experimentations indicate that MTAs have the potential to act as better alternatives compared to conventional non-targeted antioxidants in treating PD; however, sufficient clinical trials have not been conducted to investigate the efficacies of MTAs in treating PD. Controversial clinical outcomes on the part of non-targeted antioxidants and lack of clinical trials involving MTAs have made it difficult to go ahead with a direct comparison and in turn have slowed down the progress of development of safer and better alternate strategies in treating PD. This review provides an insight on the roles MTAs and non-targeted antioxidants have played in the treatment of PD till date in preclinical and clinical settings and discusses about the limitations of mitochondria-targeted and non-targeted antioxidants that can be resolved for developing effective strategies in treating Parkinsonism.

AB  - Lactation is a critical time in mammalian development, where maternal factors shape offspring outcomes. In this scoping review, we discuss current literature concerning maternal factors that influence lactation biology and highlight important associations between changes in milk composition and offspring outcomes. Specifically, we explore maternal nutritional, psychosocial, and environmental exposures that influence non-nutritive bioactive components in milk and their links to offspring growth, development, metabolic, and behavioral outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Predetermined eligibility criteria were used to analyze 3,275 papers, and the final review included 40 primary research articles. Outcomes of this review identify maternal obesity to be a leading maternal factor influencing the non-nutritive bioactive composition of milk with notable links to offspring outcomes. Offspring growth and development are the most common modes of programming associated with changes in non-nutritive milk composition due to maternal factors in early life. In addition to discussing studies investigating these key associations, we also identify knowledge gaps in the current literature and suggest opportunities and considerations for future studies.

AB  - A wide diversity of plant protection products (PPP) is used for crop protection leading to the contamination of soil, water, and air, which can have ecotoxicological impacts on living organisms. It is inconceivable to study the effects of each compound on each species from each compartment, experimental studies being time consuming and cost prohibitive, and animal testing having to be avoided. Therefore, numerous models are developed to assess PPP ecotoxicological effects. Our objective was to provide an overview of the modeling approaches enabling the assessment of PPP effects (including biopesticides) on the biota. Six categories of models were inventoried: (Q)SAR, DR and TK ID, population, multi-species, landscape, and mixture models. They were developed for various species (terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates, primary producers, micro-organisms) belonging to diverse environmental compartments, to address different goals (e.g., species sensitivity or PPP bioaccumulation assessment, ecosystem services protection). Among them, mechanistic models are increasingly recognized by EFSA for PPP regulatory risk assessment but, to date, remain not considered in notified guidance documents. The strengths and limits of the reviewed models are discussed together with improvement avenues (multigenerational effects, multiple biotic and abiotic stressors). This review also underlines a lack of model testing by means of field data and of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Accurate and robust modeling of PPP effects and other stressors on living organisms, from their application in the field to their functional consequences on the ecosystems at different scales of time and space, would help going toward a more sustainable management of the environment.

AB  - This opinion review explores the microbiology of tellurite, TeO32- and selenite, SeO32- oxyanions, two similar Group 16 chalcogen elements, but with slightly different physicochemical properties that lead to intriguing biological differences. Selenium, Se, is a required trace element compared to tellurium, Te, which is not. Here, the challenges around understanding the uptake transport mechanisms of these anions, as reflected in the model organisms used by different groups, are described. This leads to a discussion around how these oxyanions are subsequently reduced to nanomaterials, which mechanistically, has controversies between ideas around the molecule chemistry, chemical reactions involving reduced glutathione and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production along with the bioenergetics at the membrane versus the cytoplasm. Of particular interest is the linkage of glutathione and thioredoxin chemistry from the cytoplasm through the membrane electron transport chain (ETC) system/quinones to the periplasm. Throughout the opinion review we identify open and unanswered questions about the microbial physiology under selenite and tellurite exposure. Thus, demonstrating how far we have come, yet the exciting research directions that are still possible. The review is written in a conversational manner from three long-term researchers in the field, through which to play homage to the late Professor Claudio Vasquez.

AB  - Over the past 150 years of neuroscientific research, the field has undergone a tremendous evolution. Starting out with lesion-based inference of brain function, functional neuroimaging, introduced in the late 1980s, and increasingly fine-grained and sophisticated methods and analyses now allow us to study the live neural correlates of complex behaviors in individuals and multiple agents simultaneously. Classically, brain-behavior coupling has been studied as an association of a specific area in the brain and a certain behavioral outcome. This has been a crucial first step in understanding brain organization. Social cognitive processes, as well as their neural correlates, have typically been regarded and studied as isolated functions and blobs of neural activation. However, as our understanding of the social brain as an inherently dynamic organ grows, research in the field of social neuroscience is slowly undergoing the necessary evolution from studying individual elements to how these elements interact and their embedding within the overall brain architecture. In this article, we review recent studies that investigate the neural representation of social cognition as interacting, complex, and flexible networks. We discuss studies that identify individual brain networks associated with social affect and cognition, interaction of these networks, and their relevance for disorders of social affect and cognition. This perspective on social cognitive neuroscience can highlight how a more fine-grained understanding of complex network (re-)configurations could improve our understanding of social cognitive deficits in mental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, thereby providing new impulses for methods of interventions.

AB  - The contribution of organelles to neural development has received increasing attention. Studies have shown that organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomes, and endosomes play important roles in neurogenesis. Specifically, metabolic switching, reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, and the interaction between mitochondria and the ER all have roles in neurogenesis. Lysosomes and endosomes can regulate neurite growth and extension. Moreover, metabolic reprogramming represents a novel strategy for generating functional neurons. Accordingly, the exploration and application of mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming will be beneficial for neural conversion and regenerative medicine. There is adequate evidence implicating the dysfunction of cellular organelles-especially mitochondria-in neurodegenerative disorders, and that improvement of mitochondrial function may reverse the progression of these diseases through the reinforcement of adult neurogenesis. Therefore, these organelles have potential as therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the function of these organelles, especially mitochondria, in neural development, focusing on their potential as therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the impact of virtual reality on pain management during normal labor.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed in September 2021 through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ISI web of science. We selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared virtual reality in the intervention group versus placebo or no intervention in the control group among laboring women during their normal delivery. Revman software was used for performing our meta-analysis. Our primary outcome was the pain score evaluated during the labor process by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Our secondary outcomes were anxiety and satisfaction scores during childbirth in addition to the duration of the first and second stages of labor.
   Results: Eight RCTs met our inclusion criteria with a total number of 466 patients. We found virtual reality was linked to a significant reduction in the VAS pain score during labor compared to the control group (MD =-1.40, 95% CI [-1.83,-0.96], p < 0.001). The anxiety score during labor was significantly reduced among the virtual reality group (SMD =-1.15, 95% CI [-2.18,-0.12], p = 0.03). Moreover, virtual reality significantly improved the satisfaction score during labor (MD = 15.58, 95% CI [4.93, 26.22], p = 0.004). However, there were no significant differences between virtual reality and control groups regarding the duration of the first and second stages of labor.
   Conclusions: Virtual reality is an effective technique for reducing anxiety, increasing satisfaction, and improving pain management during normal labor.

AB  - Introduction: Heat stress is a physical hazard and a potential health risk which can result in various conditions ranging from discomfort, headaches, psychological disorders, heat stroke and even death in extreme cases. Factors which cause heat stress include high ambient temperature, limited air movement, strenuous physical work and direct exposure to the heat of the engine/sun. Continuous heat stress, exacerbated by dehydration, can lead to kidney disease. This study is a literature review conducted to explore factors that influence heat stress and the relationship of heat stress with acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease.
   Methods: Literature search was conducted in September 2021. Research sources were taken from several databases, namely Science Direct, ProQuest, PubMed, and Google Scholar. From the databases, 23,316 articles were from Science Direct, 140,319 articles were from ProQuest, 670 articles were from PubMed, and 288,000 articles were from Google Scholars. Out of the total database only 24 articles met the inclusion criteria. The variables in this study were heat stress, acute kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease.
   Results: This literature review shows that several factors which can affect heat stress are heat exposure, workload, rehydration, and rest period arrangements. Heat stress experienced by workers can cause decreased kidney function and chronic kidney disease. Heat stress conditions that are continuously experienced by workers can cause chronic kidney disease.
   Conclusion: Heat stress can be experienced by workers due to heat exposure, heavy workload, poor rehydration, and poor rest period arrangements. Heat stress can cause acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Background. Estimates of depression in suicidal behavior in South Asia would help to formulate suicide prevention strategies in the region that hasn't been assessed yet.
   Objectives. We aimed to systematically assess the prevalence of depression in fatal and non-fatal attempts of suicide in eight South Asian countries.
   Methods. We searched Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO by specific search terms to identify articles assessing depression in fatal and non-fatal attempts of suicide in South Asian countries published between 2001 and 2020. Two separate meta-analyses were conducted for fatal and non-fatal attempts. Due to the high heterogeneity of studies (96-98%), random-effects models were used to calculate pooled prevalence rates.
   Results. A total of 38 studies was identified from five south Asian countries (India [27], Pakistan [6], Sri Lanka [3], Nepal [1], and Bangladesh [1]). The majority of studies (n = 27) were published after 2010. Twenty-two studies reported non-fatal attempts, and sixteen reported suicide. The prevalence of depression among non-fatal attempts ranged from 14% to 78% where the pooled prevalence rate was 32.7% [95% CI 26-39.3%]. The prevalence of depression among suicides ranged from 8% to 79% where the pooled prevalence estimate was 37.3% [95% CI 26.9-47.6%].
   Conclusions. This review revealed the pooled prevalence of depression among fatal and non-fatal suicidal attempts in South Asian countries, which seems to be lower when compared to the Western countries. However, a cautious interpretation is warranted due to the heterogeneity of study methods, sample size, and measurement of depression.

AB  - This article explores adverse and unintended consequences (AUCs) of setting-based public health interventions to prevent illicit drug use, including the mechanisms leading to these AUCs. Additionally, the reporting of AUCs in systematic reviews was assessed. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of reviews and searched four big databases were searched. We included systematic reviews concerned with setting-based interventions to prevent illicit drug use. We used AMSTAR 2 to rate the overall confidence of the results presented in the reviews. Data on study characteristics, types and mechanisms of AUCs were extracted. An a priori categorisation of consequences drew on the WHO-INTEGRATE framework, and the categorisation of mechanisms on the Behaviour Change Wheel. For reviews reporting AUCs, the same information was also retrieved from relevant primary studies. Findings were synthesised narratively and in tables. Finally, we included 72 reviews, of which 18 reported on AUCs. From these, 11 primary studies were identified. Most of the reviews and primary studies were conducted in educational settings. The most prevalent AUCs reported in systematic reviews and primary studies were paradoxical health effects (i.e. increase of drug use). Potential mechanisms discussed primarily focussed on the change though social norms and practices. Changes of knowledge and perception were also mentioned. Concluding, the identified reviews and primary studies paid insufficient attention to AUCs of public health interventions to prevent illicit drug use. Where reported, it was mostly as an afterthought and narrowly framed as health related. No mentions of potential broader social consequences were found.

AB  - Relocation of residents within or between long-term care facilities occurs regularly. To mitigate potential negative consequences, supportive relocation initiatives have been developed. This scoping review addresses types, aspects, and impact of relocation initiatives developed to relocate residents between or within long-term care facilities. A total of 704 articles were identified in a systematic literature search of 11 databases between April and July 2021. Using predefined eligibility criteria, two researchers independently screened titles and abstracts, resulting in 36 articles for full-text screening. Finally, six articles were included. Analysis was performed using thematic coding. Three types of relocation initiatives were identified, namely, interventions (n = 3), guidelines (n = 2), and a plan (n = 1). These initiatives described specific aspects of relocation, namely, spatial orientation (n = 3), practical assistance (n = 3), psychological support (n = 3), staff preparation (n = 2), and client engagement (n = 2). Only three intervention studies reported the impact of relocation initiatives on residents, namely, improved mental health (n = 3), spatial orientation (n = 2), self-reliance (n = 2), and social behavior (n = 1). The scope of the found relocation initiatives was often limited as they focused on specific designs, aspects, and residents. Therefore, the complexity of relocation processes is often overlooked, and more comprehensive relocation initiatives should be developed.

AB  - Patients with delusional disorder (DD) are at an increased risk for the development of depressive symptoms. We aimed to examine the literature dealing with assessment tools to assess depressive symptoms in DD. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Scopus and clinicaltrials.gov databases from inception until June 2021 (PRISMA guidelines). From 1863 initial retrieved records, 11 studies were included (N = 715 DD patients). Depressive comorbidity ranged from 20.9% to 53.5%. Seven studies used semistructured/structured interviews: OPCRIT 4.0 (n = 1), Manual for Assessment and Documentation of Psychopathology in Psychiatry (AMDP System) (n = 2), the MINI interview (n = 1), DSM-IV (n = 1), ICD-10 (n = 1); and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS-R) (n = 1). Seven studies used at least one observer-rated scale: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-depressive component (n = 2), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD, n = 3), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS, n = 1), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI, n = 1) and the Bipolar Affective Disorder Dimension Scale (BADDS, n = 1). Assessment scales administered in depressive disorders and schizophrenia are applied to DD. This is the first systematic review exploring the use of assessment tools for depressive symptoms in DD. The use of the MADRS to assess depressive symptoms can be recommended in combination with other clinical scales, for instance, the CGI.

AB  - Background: Recent studies report that the health benefits of physical activity differ depending on whether the activity is performed in the morning, afternoon or evening. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine whether the timing of physical activity within the 24-hour day is associated with health.
   Methods: Five databases were searched for English or French language peer-reviewed studies that examined whether the timing of physical activity within the day is associated with health. No limits were placed on publication year, study population, study design or health outcomes. Studies that examined acute effects of physical activity or timing of physical activity around food intake were excluded.
   Results: This systematic review examined 35 studies, with 17 259 participants, and the following health outcomes: measures of sleep health, adiposity, fat-free mass and muscle size, cardiometabolic biomarkers, physical function and mobility, mental health, and risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality. Heterogeneity across studies precluded meta-analyses, and we present our findings using narrative syntheses. Of the 35 studies, 11 reported that morning physical activity provides greater health benefits than afternoon/evening physical activity, while 12 found that morning physical activity provides fewer health benefits than afternoon/evening physical. In the remaining 12 studies, there was no clear difference in health benefits based on the timing of physical activity. The quality of evidence for the different health outcomes across study designs was very low.
   Conclusion: There is no consistent evidence that physical activity at one time of day provides more favourable health benefits than physical activity at a different time of day.

AB  - Breast cancer treatments can trigger respiratory sequelae. Respiratory physiotherapy helps to eliminate or mitigate the sequelae by optimizing respiratory function. This systematic review aims to synthesize the scientific evidence and assess its quality regarding the use of respiratory physiotherapy in the sequelae of breast cancer. The Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, PubMed, Web of Science, Scientific Electronic Library Online, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Literature Complete, and Scopus were searched. Study quality was determined using the PEDro scale, STROBE Statement, and Single-Case Experimental Design Scale. Ten studies, six clinical trials, one case study, and three observational studies were selected. The mean methodological quality of the clinical trials was 5.6, that of the case study was 7, and that of the observational studies was 56%. Respiratory physiotherapy has been observed to improve respiratory capacity, lung function, respiratory muscle strength, effort tolerance, dyspnea, fatigue, thoracic mobility, upper limb volume, sleep quality and quality of life, as well as sensitivity to adverse physiological reactions, nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. However, it is not effective for vasomotor symptoms. More clinical trials are needed. These studies should homogenize the techniques used, as well as improve their methodological quality.

KW  - self-harm
KW  - suicide
AB  - Background and Objectives: Globally, suicide is a pertinent public health crisis that affects almost all nations cross-culturally. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in many countries, even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit worldwide. India, a nation developing rapidly, is also not free from the leashes of suicide deaths. COVID-19 augmented the rate of suicide due to multifaceted determinants. Adequate empirical evidence about data on suicide is also scarce. Materials and Methods: This review synthesizes determinants, available demographic correlates, and reported rates of suicide published in the Indian context. The authors conducted a thorough literature search to find published English free full-text scientific articles related to suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Indian context. Databases relied on for literature were PubMed, Google scholar, and PLOS one databases using comprehensive search strategies to avail the maximum number of studies. Results: Ten out of 76 studies available in the initial search were analyzed thoroughly for ruling out determinants, rates, and sociodemographic correlates of suicide. Fear of COVID-19 infection, financial crisis, mental breakdown, and job loss are cardinal reasons attributed for suicide, and male suicides are more prevalent in this arena. Interpretation and Conclusions: Findings portray factors such as fear of COVID-19 diagnosis, apprehension to become infected, financial crisis, loss of job, and isolation are some of the significant determinants quoted out. The study points out the need for multifaceted policies in preventing this public health crisis.

AB  - The current systematic review examines whether there is an association between the genetic 5-HTTPLR polymorphism and parenting, and the mechanisms by which this association operates. The literature was searched in various databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. In line with our inclusion criteria, nine articles were eligible out of 22. Most of the studies analysed in this review found an association between 5HTTLPR and parenting. Four studies found a direct association between 5-HTTLPR and parenting with conflicting findings: two studies found that mothers carrying the short variant were more sensitive to their infants, while two studies found that parents carrying the S allele were less sensitive. In addition, several studies found strong interaction between genetic and environmental factors, such as childhood stress and disruptive child behaviour, quality of early care experiences, poor parenting environment, and quality of the environment. Only one study found an association between children's 5HTTLPR and parenting. Parenting can be described as a highly complex construct influenced by multiple factors, including the environment, as well as parent and child characteristics. According to the studies, maternal 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is most likely to be associated with sensitive parenting.

AB  - Objectives Depression screening tool accuracy studies should be conducted with large enough sample sizes to generate precise accuracy estimates. We assessed the proportion of recently published depression screening tool diagnostic accuracy studies that reported sample size calculations; the proportion that provided confidence intervals (CIs); and precision, based on the width and lower bounds of 95% CIs for sensitivity and specificity. In addition, we assessed whether these results have improved since a previous review of studies published in 2013-2015. Methods MEDLINE was searched from January 1, 2018, through May 21, 2021. Results Twelve of 106 primary studies (11%) described a viable sample size calculation, which represented an improvement of 8% since the last review. Thirty-six studies (34%) provided reasonably accurate CIs. Of 103 studies where 95% CIs were provided or could be calculated, seven (7%) had sensitivity CI widths of <= 10%, whereas 58 (56%) had widths of >= 21%. Eighty-four studies (82%) had lower bounds of CIs <80% for sensitivity and 77 studies (75%) for specificity. These results were similar to those reported previously. Conclusion Few studies reported sample size calculations, and the number of included individuals in most studies was too small to generate reasonably precise accuracy estimates.

TI  - Intervention-based mental health training for community level workers in India -A systematic review
KW  - Community-based training
KW  - community-level workers
KW  - mental health intervention
KW  - PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Community-level workers (CLWs) are frontline workers who function as mediators between the government and the community. They effectively and efficiently distribute government policies and welfare schemes directly to the public, especially health aspects. They play a vital role in primary care access and quality. Many recent studies demonstrate that physical health training of CLWs is indeed effective and increases access to services. However, there are no recent reviews that systematically understand the training of CLWs concerning mental health interventions, and reviews on CLW's understanding about mental health issues and implementation at the community level is inadequate. CLWs are underutilized in aspects of mental health interventions despite having more potential for the same. They are the ones who need to know much about mental health issues and treatment availabilities. To understand this gap, a systematic review on training on mental health interventions to the CLWs in India, the method and content of mental health training in such studies was done. Our systematic search following the PRISMA guidelines included eight studies that met the eligibility criteria. The review of the studies that satisfied inclusion criteria suggests that training on mental health interventions with CLWs sounds effective. The researcher also provides recommendations to strengthen the CLWs mental health knowledge and discusses implications of mental health interventions through trained CLWs for the community. Based on the review findings, the researcher recommends ideas about how CLWs can be utilized accordingly in mental health aspects during the current pandemic.

AB  - In this work, we evaluate the status of both theory and empirical evidence in the field of experimental rest-break research based on a framework that combines mental-chronometry and psychometric-measurement theory. To this end, we (1) provide a taxonomy of rest breaks according to which empirical studies can be classified (e.g., by differentiating between long, short, and micro-rest breaks based on context and temporal properties). Then, we (2) evaluate the theorizing in both the basic and applied fields of research and explain how popular concepts (e.g., ego depletion model, opportunity cost theory, attention restoration theory, action readiness, etc.) relate to each other in contemporary theoretical debates. Here, we highlight differences between all these models in the light of two symbolic categories, termed the resource-based and satiation-based model, including aspects related to the dynamics and the control (strategic or non-strategic) mechanisms at work. Based on a critical assessment of existing methodological and theoretical approaches, we finally (3) provide a set of guidelines for both theory building and future empirical approaches to the experimental study of rest breaks. We conclude that a psychometrically advanced and theoretically focused research of rest and recovery has the potential to finally provide a sound scientific basis to eventually mitigate the adverse effects of ever increasing task demands on performance and well-being in a multitasking world at work and leisure.

AB  - Background: Subjective cognitive complaints represent a leading reason for suboptimal prescription of electroconvulsive therapy, the most acutely effective treatment for depression. However, research findings regarding their presentation are conflicting. Objective: To describe, quantify and explain the variability in subjective cognitive complaints and subjective cognition following electroconvulsive therapy for depression. Methods: We searched systematically PubMed, Embase, PsycARTICLES, CINAHL and relevant reviews for research published from 1 January 1972 to 31 August 2020. We included all independent studies of patients whose subjective cognition was assessed following brief-pulse electroconvulsive therapy for depression. Three meta-analyses were conducted to quantify: (1) the prevalence of patients presenting with cognitive complaints following electroconvulsive therapy; (2) the pre-post electroconvulsive therapy change in subjective cognition and (3) the association between change in depressive symptoms and change in cognitive complaints. Effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models. Eight prespecified demographic and clinical moderators of between-study variability were assessed using sub-group analyses and meta-regressions. Results: Data from 72 studies including 5699 participants were meta-analysed. Weighted mean prevalence of patients with cognitive complaints was 48.1% (95% confidence interval = [42.3%, 53.9%]). The type of subjective measure used significantly impacted the pre-post electroconvulsive therapy change in subjective cognition, showing, respectively, large improvement (g = 0.81; 95% confidence interval = [0.59, 1.03]) after electroconvulsive therapy with the Squire Self-Rating Scale of Memory and small worsening (g = -0.48; 95% confidence interval = [-0.70, -0.26]) with 1-item memory scales. The strongest predictors of improved post-electroconvulsive therapy subjective cognition were increased age and larger post-electroconvulsive therapy decrease in depressive symptoms. The weighted mean correlation between pre-post electroconvulsive therapy decrease in depressive symptoms and pre-post electroconvulsive therapy decrease in cognitive complaints was 0.46 (95% confidence interval = [0.39, 0.53]). Conclusion: Variability in subjective cognition following electroconvulsive therapy is mostly explained by the degree of post-treatment persisting depression and by the subjective assessment used. Scales measuring exclusively subjective worsening present limited clinical utility and instruments allowing the detection of both improvement and worsening in subjective cognition should be preferred.

AB  - Qualitative literature reports the sensory experiences of autistic individuals in the first person. Following a thematic synthesis procedure, this metasynthesis aimed to explore specifically the lived experience of these sensory features. Four databases were systematically searched for qualitative studies describing sensory issues reported by autistic individuals. Article quality was assessed with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Thematic analysis was used to identify and synthesise key themes. The 32 articles included reported data from 430 participants. Data analysis produced two themes structuring the sensory experiences of autistic people: (1) the everyday experience through body, thoughts and emotions, and (2) the relational experience, relationships being experienced as both a problem and a solution. Four dimensions are found in our results: physical, emotional, relational and social. Whereas a scientific approach to the sensory experience of autistic people is based on a cause-effect model, our results suggest that autistic people experience these dimensions holistically, as inseparable, and not in terms of cause and effect. This original finding brings new research perspectives, beyond the dichotomy between sensory features and social communications issues, and concrete implications within the health care system to provide more effective and respectful care to autistic people. Lay abstract Sensory atypicalities are very common among autistic people and are integrated in several theories and explanatory models of autism. Qualitative studies have explored these singular sensory experiences from the perspectives of autistic people themselves. This article gathers all these qualitative studies and provides original findings regarding the everyday sensory experience of autistic people, that is, around four dimensions - physical, emotional, relational and social - experienced holistically, as inseparable, and not hierarchically or in terms of cause and effect. Adopting this holistic view could improve the adaptation of the sensory environment in health care facilities and the training of professionals around this specific issue.

AB  - Introduction: Domestic violence is a threat to human dignity and public health. Mounting evidence shows that domestic violence erodes personal and public health, spawning issues such as lifelong mental health challenges. To further compound the situation, COVID-19 and societies' poor response to the pandemic have not only worsened the domestic violence crisis but also disrupted mental health services for domestic violence victims. While technology-based health solutions can overcome physical constraints posed by the pandemic and offer timely support to address domestic violence victims' mental health issues, there is a dearth of research in the literature. To bridge the research gap, in this study, we aim to examine technology-based mental health solutions for domestic violence victims amid COVID-19. Methods: A literature review was conducted to examine solutions that domestic violence victims can utilize to safeguard and improve their mental health amid COVID-19. Databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus were utilized for the literature search. The search was focused on four themes: domestic violence, mental health, technology-based interventions, and COVID-19. A reverse search of pertinent references was conducted in Google Scholar. The social ecological model was utilized to systematically structure the review findings. Results: The findings show that a wide array of technology-based solutions has been proposed to address mental health challenges faced by domestic violence victims amid COVID-19. However, none of these proposals is based on empirical evidence amid COVID-19. In terms of social and ecological levels of influence, most of the interventions were developed on the individual level, as opposed to the community level or social level, effectively placing the healthcare responsibility on the victims rather than government and health officials. Furthermore, most of the articles failed to address risks associated with utilizing technology-based interventions (e.g., privacy issues) or navigating the online environment (e.g., cyberstalking). Conclusion: Overall, our findings highlight the need for greater research endeavors on the research topic. Although technology-based interventions have great potential in resolving domestic violence victims' mental health issues, risks associated with these health solutions should be comprehensively acknowledged and addressed.

AB  - Introduction Gender lens application is pertinent in addressing inequities that underlie morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations, including mothers and children. While gender inequities may result in greater vulnerabilities for mothers and children, synthesising evidence on the constraints and opportunities is a step in accelerating reduction in poor outcomes and building resilience in individuals and across communities and health systems. Methods We conducted a scoping review that examined vulnerability and resilience in maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) through a gender lens to characterise gender roles, relationships and differences in maternal and child health. We conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and grey literature in popular scholarly databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar. We identified and analysed 17 published studies that met the inclusion criteria for key gendered themes in maternal and child health vulnerability and resilience in low-income and middle-income countries. Results Six key gendered dimensions of vulnerability and resilience emerged from our analysis: (1) restricted maternal access to financial and economic resources; (2) limited economic contribution of women as a result of motherhood; (3) social norms, ideologies, beliefs and perceptions inhibiting women's access to maternal healthcare services; (4) restricted maternal agency and contribution to reproductive decisions; (5) power dynamics and experience of intimate partner violence contributing to adverse health for women, children and their families; (6) partner emotional or affective support being crucial for maternal health and well-being prenatal and postnatal. Conclusion This review highlights six domains that merit attention in addressing maternal and child health vulnerabilities. Recognising and understanding the gendered dynamics of vulnerability and resilience can help develop meaningful strategies that will guide the design and implementation of MNCH programmes in low-income and middle-income countries.

AB  - Background: Disaster and mental health preparedness are inseparable domains highlighted during all the major disasters in India. To build Disaster-Mental health Preparedness (Disaster MHP), one has to understand the existing strategies, systemic efforts, and ground-level implementation. In this scoping review, we have analyzed the mental health preparedness efforts during major disasters in India. Methodology: We followed the Peters MDJ et al framework for scoping review named ` Guidance for conducting systematic scoping reviews. This included the searching relevant articles on PubMed and google Scholar, and concept-context of the review. Results: The review identified major efforts taken during ten disasters in past 40 years and mapping of the potential areas for development of sustainable efforts towards Disaster MHP. Conclusion: This is the first systematic scoping review from India that provides insight into strength and sustainability of disaster mental health preparedness in India. The mapping of the review focuses on the models emerged from Bhopal, Odisha, Tamilnadu and NIMHANS for the future infrastructure, capacity building, and environment required for Disaster-MHP in India.

AB  - Evidence on the effectiveness of workplace interventions for improving working conditions on the health and wellbeing of fathers is scarce. We reviewed studies on the effectiveness of various workplace interventions designed to improve working conditions for the health and wellbeing of employed fathers and their families. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials of workplace interventions applied to employees with the aim of improving working conditions of employed parents, compared with no intervention, other active arms, placebo, wait list, or usual practice were included. Studies involving only women were excluded. An electronic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC and SSCI was done for eligible studies. Studies were screened against predetermined criteria and assessment of risk of bias done using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for RCTs and the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies for non-RCTs. Of the 8229 records identified, 19 reports were included in this review: 14 reports from five RCTs and five reports from two quasi-RCT studies. The studies were conducted in four different countries among working populations from various sectors. Studies addressing issues related to improving working conditions of fathers alone were lacking. All included studies assessed intervention effects on various health-related outcomes, the most common being sleep disturbances and mental health outcomes. Interventions administered yielded positive effects on various health outcomes across all seven studies. All included studies had methodological limitations, while study designs and methodologies lacked comparability. Consequently, a narrative synthesis of evidence is provided. Based on our findings, providing workplace interventions for improving working conditions may improve some aspects of the health and wellbeing of employed parents, including fathers.

AB  - Simple Summary Cardiolaminopathies portend an augmented risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, ventricular dysfunction, and mortality. A high level of evidence on the clinical management of cardiac involvement in this setting is still lacking, and strong recommendations cannot be formulated. Our systematic review reported the incidence rates for the main cardiovascular outcomes in 1070 LMNA mutation carriers and 40 EMD mutation carriers, with a minimum follow-up of one-year. Our results stressed the importance of a structured follow-up aiming at the early recognition of atrial arrhythmias and the prevention of thromboembolic events. In patients with a need for pacing, cardioverter-defibrillator implantation should be considered due to the high burden of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiolaminopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders which are due to mutations in the genes encoding for nuclear lamins or their binding proteins. The whole spectrum of cardiac manifestations encompasses atrial arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, progressive systolic dysfunction, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Despite the prognostic significance of cardiac involvement in this setting, the current recommendations lack strong evidence. The aim of our work was to systematically review the current data on the main cardiovascular outcomes in cardiolaminopathies. We searched PubMed/Embase for studies focusing on cardiovascular outcomes in LMNA mutation carriers (atrial arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, conduction disturbances, thromboembolic events, systolic dysfunction, heart transplantation, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality). In total, 11 studies were included (1070 patients, mean age between 26-45 years, with follow-up periods ranging from 2.5 years up to 45 +/- 12). When available, data on the EMD-mutated population were separately reported (40 patients). The incidence rates (IR) were individually assessed for the outcomes of interest. The IR for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia ranged between 6.1 and 13.9 events/100 pts-year. The IR of atrial standstill ranged between 0 and 2 events/100 pts-year. The IR for malignant ventricular arrhythmias reached 10.2 events/100 pts-year and 15.6 events/100 pts-year for appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions. The IR for advanced conduction disturbances ranged between 3.2 and 7.7 events/100 pts-year. The IR of thromboembolic events reached up to 8.9 events/100 pts-year. Our results strengthen the need for periodic cardiological evaluation focusing on the early recognition of atrial arrhythmias, and possibly for the choice of preventive strategies for thromboembolic events. The frequent need for cardiac pacing due to advanced conduction disturbances should be counterbalanced with the high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias that would justify ICD over pacemaker implantation.

AB  - Background: Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is a global issue that has resulted in a slew of physical and emotional consequences. Studies have indicated that health risk behaviors might be the risk factors for IAD. The published literature on the correlation between the two is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand better the link between IAD and health risk behaviors among adolescents and young adults.
   Methods: We searched ten electronic databases for relevant articles. Data were extracted based on IAD and health risk behaviors ( alcohol, smoking, suicidal, gambling and drug abuse). We calculated odds ratios (ORs), a pooled correlation coefficient (r) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A fixed-effect model was applied to summarize the pooled effects. Heterogeneity was examined using I-2 statistics and Cochran's Q statistics. All analyses were conducted by using Stata version 15.0.
   Results: A total of 16 studies and 61,823 participants were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed that IAD was positively correlated with drinking (r = 0.35; 95% CI 0.32-0.37) and smoking (r = 0.12; 95%CI 0.10-0.15), and was associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior (OR= 1.95; 95% CI 1.65-2.30), drinking (OR= 1.75; 95% CI 1.65-1.85), and smoking (OR= 1.63; 95% CI 1.54-1.72) among adolescents.
   Conclusion: We found significantly increased risks of suicidal behavior, drinking, and smoking in adolescents and young adults with IAD. These findings are important to expand our understanding of IAD and have great guiding significance for preventing health risk behaviors of adolescents and young adults.

AB  - Background: The occupational demands of professional airline pilots such as shift work, work schedule irregularities, sleep disruption, fatigue, physical inactivity, and psychological stress may promote adverse outcomes to cardiometabolic health. This review investigates the prevalence of cardiometabolic health risk factors for airline pilots. Methods: An electronic search was conducted utilizing PubMed, MEDLINE (via OvidSP), CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, CENTRAL, and Web of Science for publications between 1990 and February 2022. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using two quality assessment tools for cross-sectional and clinical trial studies. The prevalence of physiological, behavioral, and psychological risk factors was reported using descriptive analysis. Results: A total of 48 studies derived from 20 different countries, reviewing a total pooled sample of 36,958 airline pilots. Compared with general population estimates, pilots had a similar prevalence for health risk factors, yet higher sleep duration, lower smoking and obesity rates, less physical activity, and a higher overall rate of body mass index >25. Conclusions: The research reported substantial prevalence >50% for overweight and obesity, insufficient physical activity, elevated fatigue, and regular alcohol intake among pilots. However, the heterogeneity in methodology and the lack of quality and quantity in the current literature limit the strength of conclusions that can be established. Enhanced monitoring and future research are essential to inform aviation health practices and policies (Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO CRD42022308287).

AB  - Background An international systematic review concluded that individuals with poor social health (social isolation, lack of social support or loneliness) are 30% more likely to develop coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. Notably, the two included Australian papers reported no association between social health and CHD or stroke. Objective We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between social isolation, lack of social support and loneliness and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence among people living in Australia and New Zealand. Methods Four electronic databases were systematically searched for longitudinal studies published until June 2020. Two reviewers undertook title/abstract screen and one reviewer undertook full-text screen and data extraction. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle - Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Results Of the 725 unique records retrieved, five papers met our inclusion criteria. These papers reported data from three Australian longitudinal datasets, with a total of 2137 CHD and 590 stroke events recorded over follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 16 years. Reports of two CHD and two stroke outcomes were suitable for meta-analysis. The included papers reported no association between social health and incidence of CVD in all fully adjusted models and most unadjusted models. Conclusions Our systematic review is inconclusive as it identified only a few studies, which relied heavily on self-reported CVD. Further studies using medical diagnosis of CVD, and assessing the potential influence of residential remoteness, are needed to better understand the relationship between social health and CVD incidence in Australia and New Zealand.

AB  - Background:& nbsp;Nowadays, in an informational society, digital technologies are present in most areas of life, including school education fields. Students encounter risks or threats during online experiences. Digital resilience helps individuals recognize and manage the risks and threats they come across when they socialize, explore, or work online and plays an important role in the digital technology challenges. However, so far, the concept of digital resilience among individuals in the educational field has not been analyzed in detail.& nbsp;Objectives:& nbsp;The purpose of this study is to clarify the concept of digital resilience among students in a school education context, describe antecedents and consequences, and suggest a conceptual model for health educators.& nbsp;Methods:& nbsp;Walker and Avants' concept analysis method and standards of the scoping review were used to clarify the attributes, antecedents, and consequences from the included articles. A thematic analysis approach of literature was utilized to describe the study findings. No date limitations were applied.& nbsp;Results:& nbsp;A total of 22 included articles provided data for digital resilience conceptualization. Five defining attributes for the concept were identified as follows: (1) understanding online threats; (2) knowing solutions; (3) learning knowledge and skills; (4) recovering from stress; and (5) moving forward through self-efficacy. Antecedents included digital technology-related threats influenced by individual external and internal factors. Consequences were divided into two categories: behavioral performance and psychosocial functioning.& nbsp;Conclusion:& nbsp;Based on the results of the concept analysis, a preliminary conceptual model of digital resilience was described as a circular process toward greater performance and function in the form of understanding, knowing, learning, recovering, and moving forward, when facing stressors, challenges, or adversity. The conceptual model of digital resilience can be further tested and may inform the enhancement of digital-specific resilience measures and interventions for students.

AB  - Aims Lower parental education has been linked to adverse youth mental health outcomes. However, the relationship between parental education and youth suicidal behaviours remains unclear. We explored the association between parental education and youth suicidal ideation and attempts, and examined whether sociocultural contexts moderate such associations. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with a systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline and Embase from 1900 to December 2020 for studies with participants aged 0-18, and provided quantitative data on the association between parental education and youth suicidal ideation and attempts (death included). Only articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals were considered. Two authors independently assessed eligibility of the articles. One author extracted data [e.g. number of cases and non-cases in each parental education level, effect sizes in forms of odds ratios (ORs) or beta coefficients]. We then calculated pooled ORs using a random-effects model and used moderator analysis to investigate heterogeneity. Results We included a total of 59 articles (63 study samples, totalling 2 738 374 subjects) in the meta-analysis. Lower parental education was associated with youth suicidal attempts [OR = 1.12, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.04-1.21] but not with suicidal ideation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.98-1.12). Geographical region and country income level moderated the associations. Lower parental education was associated with an increased risk of youth suicidal attempts in Northern America (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.45), but with a decreased risk in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.54-0.96). An association of lower parental education and increased risk of youth suicidal ideation was present in high- income countries (HICs) (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.05-1.25), and absent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.77-1.08). Conclusions The association between youth suicidal behaviours and parental education seems to differ across geographical and economical contexts, suggesting that cultural, psychosocial or biological factors may play a role in explaining this association. Although there was high heterogeneity in the studies reviewed, this evidence suggests that the role of familial sociodemographic characteristics in youth suicidality may not be universal. This highlights the need to consider cultural, as well as familial factors in the clinical assessment and management of youth's suicidal behaviours in our increasingly multicultural societies, as well as in developing prevention and intervention strategies for youth suicide.

AB  - Introduction: Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) have poor physical wellbeing, leading essentially shorter lives, compared with the general population. Routine metabolic monitoring is proposed as a strategy for recognizing risk factors for metabolic variations in this population. This narrative review aimed to identify interventions at enhancing uptake of metabolic monitoring parameters in adult prescribed second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) for patients with SMI.Method: A literature search was performed through SCOPUS, PubMed, and CINAHL databases using a combination of keywords. We included primary studies published in the English language until December 2021 that provided evidence on interventions to increase the rate of SGAs related metabolic monitoring in patients with SMI. Results: A total of 21 studies were identified among which in 13 studies frequency of metabolic monitoring ranged between 40% and 80% after implementation of various strategies. These include multi-layer intervention model such as: (A) Reminders (e.g., paper-based prompts, invitation letter); (B) Electronic system of documentation (computer-based intervention, electronic medical records); (C) Healthcare practitioner specific role (Nurse-led intervention, pharmacist-led intervention, barrier focused strategies) and (D) Physical-mental health awareness (Education, quality improvement programme).Conclusion: This review provides evidence that studies involving the reminders such as paper based prompts and education to the patients as well as healthcare professionals could help in enhancing the rate of metabolic monitoring in patients prescribed SGAs.

AB  - Background Home care is a rapidly growing industry. Violence towards home care workers is common, while also likely underreported. This violence adversely affects the physical and mental health of both workers and care recipients. The current study aims to identify and appraise recent evidence on the determinants of violence towards care workers working in the home setting. Methods Six electronic databases: the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, Informit, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, were systematically searched. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute manual for evidence synthesis. Results A total of 18 papers met the inclusion criteria. All were cross-sectional surveys. The majority of studies were from the United States. The most commonly investigated associations were those between the medical history of clients, workers' apprehension of violence, worker-client relationship, or care plans, and any form of violence or verbal abuse. Conclusion Violence was common in clients with cognitive disorders, substance abuse disorder, and limited mobility; toward workers who feared that violence might happen; toward those who had very close or very distant worker-client relationships; and when care plans were not inclusive of clients' needs. The current review highlights a gap in evidence on determinants of violence towards care workers working in the home setting, and suggests potential areas to be addressed to reduce such violence.

AB  - Introduction: Over the last decades, our understanding of the cognitive, motivational, and neural processes involved in addictive behavior has increased enormously. A plethora of laboratory-based and cross-sectional studies has linked cognitive-behavioral measures to between-subject differences in drinking behavior. However, such laboratory-based studies inevitably suffer from small sample sizes and the inability to link temporal fluctuations in task measures to fluctuations in real-life substance use. To overcome these problems, several existing behavioral tasks have been transferred to smartphones to allow studying cognition in the field. Method: In this narrative review, we first summarize studies that used existing behavioral tasks in the laboratory and self-reports of substance use with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in the field. Next, we review studies on psychometric properties of smartphone-based behavioral tasks. Finally, we review studies that used both smartphone-based tasks and self-reports with EMA in the field. Results: Overall, studies were scarce and heterogenous both in tasks and in study outcomes. Nevertheless, existing findings are promising and point toward several methodological recommendations: concerning psychometrics, studies show that - although more systematic studies are necessary - task validity and reliability can be improved, for example, by analyzing several measurement sessions at once rather than analyzing sessions separately. Studies that use tasks in the field, moreover, show that power can be improved by choosing sampling schemes that combine time-based with event-based sampling, rather than relying on time-based sampling alone. Increasing sampling frequency can further increase power. However, as this also increases the burden to participants, more research is necessary to determine the ideal sampling frequency for each task. Conclusion: Although more research is necessary to systematically study both the psychometrics of smartphone-based tasks and the frequency at which task measures fluctuate, existing studies are promising and reveal important methodological recommendations useful for researchers interested in implementing behavioral tasks in EMA studies.

AB  - Background The retina, as part of the central nervous system (CNS) with limited capacity for self-reparation and regeneration in mammals, is under cumulative environmental stress due to high-energy demands and rapid protein turnover. These stressors disrupt the cellular protein and metabolic homeostasis, which, if not alleviated, can lead to dysfunction and cell death of retinal neurons. One primary cellular stress response is the highly conserved unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR acts through three main signaling pathways in an attempt to restore the protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by various means, including but not limited to, reducing protein translation, increasing protein-folding capacity, and promoting misfolded protein degradation. Moreover, recent work has identified a novel function of the UPR in regulation of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function, disturbance of which contributes to neuronal degeneration and dysfunction. The role of the UPR in retinal neurons during aging and under disease conditions in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been explored over the past two decades. Each of the disease conditions and their corresponding animal models provide distinct challenges and unique opportunities to gain a better understanding of the role of the UPR in the maintenance of retinal health and function. Method We performed an extensive literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar using the following keywords: unfolded protein response, metabolism, ER stress, retinal degeneration, aging, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy. Results and conclusion We summarize recent advances in understanding cellular stress response, in particular the UPR, in retinal diseases, highlighting the potential roles of UPR pathways in regulation of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function in retinal neurons. Further, we provide perspective on the promise and challenges for targeting the UPR pathways as a new therapeutic approach in age- and disease-related retinal degeneration.

AB  - Introduction: Face coverings and distancing as preventative measures against the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 may impact communication in several ways that may disproportionately affect people with hearing loss. A scoping review was conducted to examine existing literature on the impact of preventative measures on communication and to characterize the clinical implications.
   Method: A systematic search of three electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL) was conducted yielding 2,158 articles. After removing duplicates and screening to determine inclusion eligibility, key data were extracted from the 50 included articles. Findings are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews, including the PRISMA-ScR checklist.
   Results: Studies fell into three categories: Studies addressing the impacts of personal protective equipment (PPE) and/or distancing on communication in healthcare contexts (n = 20); studies examining the impact of preventative measures on communication in everyday life (n = 13), and studies measuring the impact of face coverings on speech using acoustic and/or behavioral measures (n = 29). The review revealed that masks disrupt verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as emotional and social wellbeing and they impact people with hearing loss more than those without. These findings are presumably because opaque masks attenuate sound at frequencies above 1 kHz, and conceal the mouth and lips making lipreading impossible, and limit visibility of facial expressions. While surgical masks cause relatively little sound attenuation, transparent masks and face shields are highly attenuating. However, they are preferred by people with hearing loss because they give access to visual cues.
   Conclusion: Face coverings and social distancing has detrimental effects that extend well beyond verbal and non-verbal communication, by affecting wellbeing and quality of life. As these measures will likely be part of everyday life for the foreseeable future, we propose that it is necessary to support effective communication, especially in healthcare settings and for people with hearing loss.

AB  - The main objective of the present meta-analysis was to analyze associations between security of attachment to parents and self-esteem. Studies were included if they assessed bivariate associations between self-esteem and attachment security with mothers and/or fathers, or with both parents in general. A systematic search in the electronic databases PSYCINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PSYNDEX identified 202 studies with 81,485 participants that were included in this multilevel meta-analysis. Criteria from the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool were used for assessing the quality of the individual studies. Most studies assessed security with verbal measures (190 studies), and the mean age of participants was 16.5 years. We found a moderate positive concurrent correlation of attachment security to parents with self-esteem (r = .34; 95% confidence interval [CI], .33-.36), with associations being stronger when assessing attachment to parents in general (r = .37; CI, .35 to .40) rather than to mothers (r = .33; CI, .31 to .35) or fathers (r = .32; CI, .30 to .34) in particular. Cross-lagged effects indicate that higher initial attachment security predicts an increase in self-esteem over time (r = .19; CI, .09 to .28), while initial self-esteem predicts change in security (r = .08; CI, .02 to .14). Correlations of attachment security with self-esteem were weaker in older participants and stronger in studies with validated attachment measures. As most of the included studies have been conducted with adolescents and young adults, knowledge about associations of secure attachment to parents and self-esteem in the first years of life is still limited. Nonetheless, it is concluded that the available results support suggestions of attachment theory on the role of secure attachment for self-esteem, although causal effects could only be tested in experimental studies.

AB  - Substance and behavioral addiction is a global health problem related to cognitive functioning and emotional responses like top-down control and craving. The present review discusses the role of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as evidence-based treatments for addiction disorders. The discussion spans between several evidence for both therapies, also considering the difference and heterogeneity among clinical protocols. Nowadays, literature is consistent in indicating the neurostimulation of the prefrontal cortex as effective for different kinds of addiction, corroborating the evidence that they rely on a common network in the brain. Likewise, within the CBT studies it is possible to observe a wide range of interventions that are overall effective in regulating the executive functions associated with addiction disorders. Nevertheless, the integration of NIBS and CBT in addictions has been scarcely considered in literature so far. For this reason, the present article is meant to foster empirical research in this field by highlighting the findings supporting these evidence-based interventions, both as stand-alone and integrated treatments. To this aim, psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms of NIBS and CBT in addictions are reviewed, and the rationale of their integration discussed. In particular, as evidence suggest these treatments affect top-down and bottom-up processes in different ways, with NIBS reducing craving and CBT boosting motivation and coping, we suggest their combination might better target the different components of addiction to promote abstinence.

AB  - Marine mammals are vulnerable to a variety of acute and chronic anthropogenic stressors, potentially experiencing these in isolation, successively and/or simultaneously. Formal assessment of the likely impact(s) of the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on a defined population is carried out through a Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA), which is a mandatory component of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process in many countries. However, for marine mammals, the information required to feed into CEA, such as thresholds for disturbance, frequency of multiple (and simultaneous) exposures, interactions between stressors, and individual variation in response, is extremely limited, though our understanding is slowly improving. The gaps in knowledge make it challenging to effectively quantify and subsequently assess the risk of individual and population consequences of multiple disturbances in the form of a CEA. To assess the current state of practice for assessing cumulative effects on marine mammals within UK waters, 93 CEAs were reviewed across eleven maritime industries. An objective framework of thirteen evaluative criteria was used to score each assessment on a scale of 13-52 (weak - strong). Scores varied significantly by industry. On average, the aquaculture industry produced the lowest scoring CEAs, whilst the large offshore windfarm industry (>= 20 turbines) scored highest, according to the scoring criteria used. There was a significant increase in scores over the sample period (2009-2019), though this was mostly attributed to five industries (cable, large and small offshore wind farms, tidal and wave energy). There was inconsistency in the language used to define and describe cumulative effects and a lack of routinely applied methodology. We use the findings presented here, along with a wider review of the literature, to provide recommendations and discussion points aimed at supporting the standardisation and improvement of CEA practice. Although this research focused on how marine mammals were considered within UK CEAs, recommendations made are broadly applicable to assessments conducted for other receptors, countries and/or environments. Adoption of these proposals would help to ensure a more consistent approach, and would aid decision-makers and practitioners in mitigating any potential impacts, to ensure conservation objectives of marine mammal populations are not compromised.

AB  - Research evidence has consistently documented a higher risk of suicidality in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, and Queer (LGBTIQ) population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to report a detailed description of research data regarding the risk of Attempted Suicide (SA), Suicide Ideation (SI), and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) behaviours for LGBTIQ people and their subgroups. Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting a comparative estimation of SA, SI, and NSSI rates among LGBTIQ population and the general population (i.e. heterosexual/cisgender), without restrictions on participants' age and setting for the enrolment. Pooled analyses were based on odds ratios (ORs, with 95% CIs), estimated through inverse variance models with random effects. Fifty studies were selected for the quantitative synthesis and included fifty samples involving 3.735.601 controls and 87.252 LGBTIQ people. LGBTIQ people reported an increased risk of SA (OR:4.36[95%CI:3.32;5.71]), SI (OR:3.76[95%CI:3.02;4.69]), and NSSI (OR:4.24[95%CI:3.23;5.55]). Among LGBTIQ subgroups, the Bisexual group has shown the highest risk of suicidality (SA, OR:6.71; SI, OR:5.04; NSSI, OR: 5.03), followed by the Lesbian-Gay for attempted suicide (SA, OR:6.03), and the Transgender-Intersex-Queer for suicide ideation and non-suicidal self-injury (SI and NSSI, OR:3.42). The quality of the evidence ranged from low to moderate. Our findings have shown that LGBTIQ people report a higher risk of suicidality compared with their cisgender/heterosexual peers. This evidence may contribute to the public awareness on LGBTQI mental health needs and suggest supportive strategies as well as preventive interventions (e.g. supportive programs, counselling, and destigmatizing efforts) as parts of a tailored health-care planning aimed to reduce psychiatric morbidity and mortality in this at-risk population.

AB  - Objective: The consensus is that psychological first aid is a practical, early psychosocial intervention to mitigate the distress caused by disasters. This review aimed to investigate PFA training's efficacy in the existing studies and evaluate these programs' impact on trainees. Methods: MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), EMBASE (Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands), PsycInfo (American Psychological Association, Washington, DC), and Cochrane Library (John Wiley & Sons, Hobken, NJ, USA) were searched on August 1, 2020 without language and date limitation. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) (Cochrane, London, UK) were used to assess the quality of the studies included. SPSS (IBM Corp., Endicott, NY, USA) was used for descriptive, comparative, and correlational summaries. Results: From 376 articles, only 9 studies met the criteria and were included after screening. The most common outcome was knowledge improvement, followed by increased confidence, and competence. Other outcomes encompassed Attitude, preparedness, and therapeutic engagement. Conclusion: PFA is the most suggested early intervention aftermath and could be acquired by professionals and non-professionals in the mental health area. Nonetheless, to obtain the desired outcome, PFA training programs' quality is vital. This review revealed that most training programs' duration was short, without scenario-based interactions and post-training supervisions. More controlled trials are required to measure the effectiveness of PFA training on the providers.

AB  - Objective: Prior research indicates PTSD is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease. A number of different treatments for PTSD can be effective in reducing PTSD symptoms. The aim of this study is to systematically review studies which determine whether treatment for PTSD is associated with better cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. Method: Five different databases were searched in a systematic manner, and 11 relevant studies were recovered and analyzed. Findings: Treatments associated with PTSD improvement and found to be effective in improving cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes among individuals with PTSD include cognitive behavioral therapy (heart rate variability and blood pressure), prolonged exposure (heart rate and heart rate variability) and SSRIs (blood pressure). Conclusions: Multiple PTSD treatment modalities were associated with improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of cardiovascular-related mortality. Given the small sample sizes, lack of follow-up studies and the extensive use of military populations in studies on PTSD and chronic diseases, these results should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed that assess and verify whether PTSD treatments mitigate the risk for metabolic, diabetic and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Background Psychotic disorders are commonly accompanied by intense psychological burden, and psychological interventions are usually needed in order to reduce the symptoms and help in maintaining or improving the level of psychological and social functioning after the onset of psychosis. The evidence-base for treating young people at risk for psychosis and adults with psychotic disorders is accumulating. Yet, pervasive systematic literature reviews that would include patients from the full age range being the most essential period for the risk of developing a psychotic disorder, a wide range of psychological interventions, and various types of clinical trials, have been lacking. The aim of this systematic review is to fill the gap by presenting the current research evidence from clinical trials on the effectiveness of psychological interventions for treating young people (12-30) with psychotic disorders.& nbsp;Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and PsycINFO followed by a 3-step screening process based on the PICOS strategy. Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed by the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Extracted data from the included studies is reported using a narrative synthesis.& nbsp;Results Of the 1,449 publications screened, 40 from 25 studies were included in the review. Of these, 10 studies reported results from cognitive or behavioral therapy, nine from cognitive remediation therapy (CRT), and six from other types of therapies (i.e., integrative interventions combining psychoeducation and family/group interventions). All but one study found the target interventions to be effective, but the results mostly did not differ significantly from the control conditions in reducing symptoms and improving functioning, preventing relapses and hospitalization, or improving psychological or family variables. The most consistent findings were from CRT, showing more improvement in cognitive functioning compared to control conditions while not being superior in reducing symptom severity. Integrative interventions might be effective in treating young people suffering from psychotic disorders.& nbsp;Conclusion There is some evidence that psychological interventions are effective for young people with psychotic disorders. However, with regard to symptom severity, psychotherapy does not outperform control conditions, and the results do not strongly favor any specific type of treatment.& nbsp;

AB  - Ocean acidification has emerged as a major concern in the last fifteen years and studies on the impacts of seawater acidification on marine organisms have multiplied accordingly. This review aimed at synthesizing the literature on the effects of seawater acidification on tropical scleractinians under laboratory-controlled conditions. We identified 141 articles (published between 1999 and 2021) and separated endpoints into 22 biological categories to identify global trends for mitigation and gaps in knowledge and research priorities for future investigators. The relative number of affected endpoints increased with pH intensity (particularly for endpoints associated to calcification and reproduction). When exposed to pH 7.6-7.8 (compared to higher pH), 49% of endpoints were affected. The diversity in experimental designs prevented deciphering the modulating role of coral life stages, genera or duration of exposure. Finally, important bias in research efforts included most experiments on adult corals (68.5%), in 27 out of 150 (18%) coral ecoregions and exclusively from shallow-waters.

AB  - Adaptive approach and avoidance in responses to reward and threat are fundamental to prevent harm and to ensure well-being. In contrast, maladaptive approach or avoidance behavior likely contributes to anxiety or substance abuse disorders, respectively. Therefore, there is a need to assess such behavior in humans objectively. Conditioned place preference (CPP) is a well-established animal paradigm investigating approach-avoidance mechanisms, i.e., context-associated appetitive/aversive effects of unconditioned stimuli. Recently, the retranslation of this paradigm for human research started. This meta-analysis provides the first systematic overview of this developing field. A total of 17 studies published before June 2020 fulfil our inclusion criteria: (1) Usage of a rewarding agent, (2) implementation of either virtual or real environments, (3) human subjects, and (4) report of standardized outcome measures. These studies were evaluated and analyzed following the DIAD model and the PRISMA guidelines, respectively, and specific subanalyses were preformed to identify modulating factors of CPP effects (e.g., Virtual Reality applications, biased/unbiased). Overall, a significant medium effect size for the behavioral measure of dwell time (g = .62, p < .001, 95%-CI = .43-.81) and a significant small effect size for verbal self-ratings (g = .33, p < .001, 95%-CI = .04-.63) were observed, although across-study results were characterized by substantial heterogeneity (l(2) > 65%). These results indicate great potential for CPP to study approach-avoidance behavior in humans, directly in analogy to animal studies. We provide guidelines for future CPP research to improve comparability of studies and to facilitate new insights into anxiety disorders and drug abuse.

AB  - The innate immune system primarily gets triggered by microbe infiltration, injury, stress, aging, and brain disorders. The hyperactivation of the innate immune system and neuroinflammatory reactions contributes to chronic age-related neurodegeneration. The mechanism for activation of the immune pathway is conserved between Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) and human being. Thus, D. melanogaster can serve as a model organism to decipher the cellular and molecular mechanism between infection and neurodegenerative diseases. In D. melanogaster, prolonged protective, excessive neuroinflammatory responses in the brain lead to neurodegeneration through antimicrobial peptides mediated neurotoxicity. The prolonged inflammation in the microglial cells helps in the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, the connection between inflammatory mechanisms in the brain and neurodegeneration pathogenesis in D. melanogaster is systematically reviewed.

AB  - Background: At present, tic disorder has attracted the attention of medical researchers in many countries. More clinicians choose non-drug therapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) because of the cognitive side effects of drug therapy. However, few studies had assessed its efficacy. It is necessary to have a more comprehensive understanding of the literature quality of CBT and its intervention effect. Methods: In this study, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane were searched from the beginning to June 15, 2021 to study the efficacy of -CBT on tic disorder. Only studies using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the control group were included. Results: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including 536 patients with tic disorders, were identified. The results showed that the effect of CBT was better than that of the control group. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was -0.34 (95% CI: -0.61, -0.07). The effect size of CBT differs from different intervention conditions. In seven studies, the subjects' motor tic scores were counted. The sample size of the experimental group was 224 and that of the control group was 218. The pooled SMD was -0.43 (95% CI: -0.75, -0.11). Seven studies counted the vocal tic scores of subjects, 224 in the experimental group and 218 in the control group. The pooled SMD was -0.22 (95% CI: -0.54, -0.11). Seven studies counted the tic impairment scores of subjects, 220 in the experimental group and 214 in the control group. The pooled SMD was -0.48 (95% CI: -0.73, -0.23). Conclusion: The literature shows that different CBTs can significantly reduce the total score of tic disorder and the score of motor tic, but cannot significantly reduce the score of vocal tic. In the future, more new interventions were needed to improve the symptoms of different patients, especially vocal tic.

AB  - During the last decade, there has been an increase in awareness of how anthropogenic pollution can alter behavioural traits of diverse aquatic organisms. Apart from understanding profound ecological implications, alterations in neurobehavioural indices have emerged as sensitive and physiologically integrative endpoints in chemical risk assessment. Accordingly, behavioural ecotoxicology and broader eco-neurotoxicology are becoming increasingly popular fields of research that span a plethora of fundamental laboratory experimentations as well as applied field-based studies. Despite mounting interest in aquatic behavioural ecotoxicology studies, there is, however, a considerable paucity in deciphering the mechanistic foundations underlying behavioural alterations upon exposure to pollutants. The behavioural phenotype is indeed the highest-level integrative neurobiological phenomenon, but at its core lie myriads of intertwined biochemical, cellular, and physiological processes. Therefore, the mechanisms that underlie changes in behavioural phenotypes can stem among others from dysregulation of neurotransmitter pathways, electrical signalling, and cell death of discrete cell populations in the central and peripheral nervous systems. They can, however, also be a result of toxicity to sensory organs and even metabolic dysfunctions. In this critical review, we outline why behavioural phenotyping should be the starting point that leads to actual discovery of fundamental mechanisms underlying actions of neurotoxic and neuromodulating contaminants. We highlight potential applications of the currently existing and emerging neurobiology and neurophysiology analytical strategies that should be embraced and more broadly adopted in behavioural ecotoxicology. Such strategies can provide new mechanistic discoveries instead of only observing the end sum phenotypic effects.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to review the articles dealing with the mutual impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the recent earthquakes to elicit the various scopes of the lessons learned including the challenges, the successful measures, and the recommendations.
   Methods: To detect the relevant studies published between February 1, 2020, and June 9, 2021, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched. Having considered specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, 18 studies were included.
   Results: Seven major earthquakes have occurred concurrently or before the pandemic era in Albania, Croatia, Haiti, Great East Japan, Mexico, Nepal, and Utah. Thematic analysis revealed 5 themes for the "challenges" (management inefficiency, increased life-threatening, economic, socially related, and dual psychological challenges); 4 themes for the "efficient response measures" (health-care services measures, government measures, community-based cooperative activities, and disaster management response); and 3 major themes with 7 sub-themes for the "recommendations" including "the mitigation phase" (identifying probable natural disasters), "the preparedness phase" (preparing necessary equipment), and "the response phase" (mental care response measures, healthcare-related COVID-19 measures, economic improvement measures, recognizing community-based capabilities, and government-related boosting measures).
   Conclusions: It is suggested that these scopes of the mutual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the earthquakes be studied in systematic reviews.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is one of the major psychiatric disorders that is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and mania (or hypomania), leading to seriously adverse outcomes with unclear pathogenesis. There is an underlying relationship between bacterial communities residing in the gut and brain function, which together form the gut-brain axis (GBA). Recent studies have shown that changes in the gut microbiota have been observed in a large number of BD patients, so the axis may play a role in the pathogenesis of BD. This review summarizes briefly the relationship between the GBA and brain function, the composition and changes of gut microbiota in patients with BD, and further explores the potential role of GBA-related pathway in the pathogenesis of BD as well as the limitations in this field at present in order to provide new ideas for the future etiology research and drug development.

AB  - Synucleinopathies are a group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases known for the accumulation of insoluble aggregates containing the protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn). Recently, it has been assumed that pathology spreads in the brain during disease progression, implying that, at some point in the process, aSyn may exist outside of cells. In this context, extracellular-aSyn (e-aSyn) might transduce signals to the inside of the cells it interacts with, and/or be internalized by different types of cells through the extracellular matrix. Both negatively charged lipids and membrane receptors have been hypothesized as modulators of the loss of cellular homeostasis and cytotoxicity, and of the internalization of e-aSyn. Internalized e-aSyn causes the disruption of multiple cellular processes such as the autophagy lysosomal pathway (ALP), mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress, UPR activation, or vesicular transport. These processes happen not only in neurons but also in glial cells, activating inflammatory or anti-inflammatory pathways that can affect both neuronal function and survival, thereby affecting disease progression.
   In this review, we explore possible effects e-aSyn, all the way from the extracellular matrix to the nucleus. In particular, we highlight the glial-neuronal relationship as this is particularly relevant in the context of the spreading of aSyn pathology in synucleinopathies.

AB  - Heavy metals (HMs) are not destroyable or degradable and persist in the environment for a long duration. Thus, eliminating and counteracting the HMs pollution of the soil environment is an urgent task to develop a safe and sustainable environment. Plants are in close contact with the soil and can play an important role in soil clean-up, and the process is known as phytoremediation. However, under HM contaminated conditions, plants suffer from several complications, like nutrient and mineral deficiencies, alteration of various physiological and biological processes, which reduces the plant's growth rate. On the other hand, the bioavailability of HMs is another factor for reduced phytoremediation, as most of the HMs are not bioavailable to plants for efficient phytoremediation. The altered plant growth and reduced bioavailability of HMs could be overcome and enhance the phytoremediation efficiency by incorporating either nanotechnology, i.e., nanoparticles (NPs) or plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) along with phytoremediation. Single incorporation of NPs and PGPR might improve the growth rate in plants by enhancing nutrient availability and uptake and also by regulating plant growth regulators under HM contaminated conditions. However, there are certain limitations, like a high dose of NPs that might have toxic effects on plants. Thus, the combination of two techniques such as PGPR and NPs-based remediation can conquer the limitations of individual techniques and consequently enhance phytoremediation efficiency. Considering the negative impacts of HMs on the environment and living organisms, this review is aimed at highlighting the concept of phytoremediation, the single or combined integration of NPs and PGPR to help plants deal with HMs and their basic mechanisms involved in the process of phytoremediation. Additionally, the complications of using NPs and PGPR in the phytoremediation process are discussed to determine future research questions and this will assist to stimulate further research in this field and increase its effectiveness in practical application.

Depression screening has been proposed to identify previously unrecognized depression cases. Including individuals already diagnosed or treated for depression in screening test accuracy studies could exaggerate accuracy and the yield of new cases from screening. The present study investigated (1) the proportion of depression screening tool accuracy primary studies published in 2018-2021 that excluded individuals with a confirmed depression diagnosis or who were already undergoing treatment; and (2) whether this has improved since the last review of studies published in 2013-2015, which found that five of 89 (5.6%) primary studies appropriately excluded such individuals.Methods: MEDLINE was searched from January 1, 2018 through May 21, 2021 for primary studies on depression screening tool accuracy.Results: Eighteen of 106 (17.0%; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 11.0% to 25.3%) primary studies excluded currently diagnosed or treated individuals. This was 11.4% (95% CI, 2.8% to 20.0%) greater than in similar studies published in 2013-2015.Conclusion: There has been an improvement since 2015, but the proportion of studies that exclude individuals already known to have depression remains low. This may bias research findings intended to inform clinical practice.

AB  - Neurotransmission is critically dependent on the number, position, and composition of receptor proteins on the postsynaptic neuron. Of these, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are responsible for the majority of postsynaptic depolarization at excitatory mammalian synapses following glutamate release. AMPARs are continually trafficked to and from the cell surface, and once at the surface, AMPARs laterally diffuse in and out of synaptic domains. Moreover, the subcellular distribution of AMPARs is shaped by patterns of activity, as classically demonstrated by the synaptic insertion or removal of AMPARs following the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), respectively. Crucially, there are many subtleties in the regulation of AMPARs, and exactly how local and global synaptic activity drives the trafficking and retention of synaptic AMPARs of different subtypes continues to attract attention. Here we will review how activity can have differential effects on AMPAR distribution and trafficking along with its subunit composition and phosphorylation state, and we highlight some of the controversies and remaining questions. As the AMPAR field is extensive, to say the least, this review will focus primarily on cellular and molecular studies in the hippocampus. We apologise to authors whose work could not be cited directly owing to space limitations.

AB  - People with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) often experience persistent social cognitive impairments, associated with poor functional outcome. There are currently no approved treatment options for these debilitating symptoms, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Work to date has elucidated differential social processes and underlying neural circuitry affected in SSDs, which may be amenable to modulation using neurostimulation. Further, advances in functional connectivity mapping and electric field modeling may be used to identify individualized treatment targets to maximize the impact of brain stimulation on social cognitive networks. Here, we review literature supporting a roadmap for translating functional connectivity biomarker discovery to individualized treatment development for social cognitive impairments in SSDs. First, we outline the relevance of social cognitive impairments in SSDs. We review machine learning approaches for dimensional brain-behavior biomarker discovery, emphasizing the importance of individual differences. We synthesize research showing that brain stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, can be used to target relevant networks. Further, functional connectivity-based individualized targeting may enhance treatment response. We then outline recent approaches to account for neuroanatomical variability and optimize coil positioning to individually maximize target engagement. Overall, the synthesized literature provides support for the utility and feasibility of this translational approach to precision treatment. The proposed roadmap to translate biomarkers of social cognitive impairments to individualized treatment is currently under evaluation in precision-guided trials. Such a translational approach may also be applicable across conditions and generalizable for the development of individualized neurostimulation targeting other behavioral deficits.

AB  - Introduction: Internet addiction is characterized by excessive and uncontrolled use of the internet affecting everyday life. Adolescents are the primary risk group for internet addiction. Data on internet addiction is lacking in Africa. Thus, this review aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of internet addiction and its associated factors among high school and university students in Africa. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of science, Hinari, and Google scholar) to locate potential studies. Heterogeneity between studies was checked using Cochrane Q test statistics and I-2 test statistics and small-study effects were checked using Egger's statistical test at a 5% significance level. A sensitivity analysis was performed. A random-effects model was employed to estimate the pooled prevalence and associated factors of internet addiction among students. The primary outcome of measure of this review was the prevalence of internet addiction and the secondary outcome of measures are the factors associated with internet addiction. Results: A total of 5,562 studies were identified among the five databases. Of these, 28 studies from 10 countries with 14,946 high school and university students were included in this review. The overall pooled prevalence of internet addiction among the students was 34.53% [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 26.83, 42.23, I-2 = 99.20%]. Male sex [Pooled Odds Ratio (POR) = 1.92, 95% CI:1.43, 2.57 I-2 = 0.00], urban residence (POR = 2.32, 95% CI:1.19, 4.53, I-2 = 59.39%), and duration of daily internet use for more than 4 h (POR = 2.25, 95% CI:1.20, 4.21, I-2 = 0.00%, were significantly associated with internet addiction among adolescents. Conclusion: Almost one-third of university and high school students in Africa are addicted to the internet. Male students, those from urban areas, and those who use the internet for more than 4 h per day have higher odds of internet addiction. Thus, we recommend that health planners and policymakers pay attention to the use of the internet and internet addiction in Africa.

AB  - Previous studies have shown mixed results on the relationship between prenatal, birth, and postnatal ("pregnancy-related") risk factors and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We conducted meta-analyses to identify potentially modifiable pregnancy-related factors associated with ADHD. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE in 2014, followed by an updated search in January 2021, identified 69 articles published in English on pregnancy-related risk factors and ADHD for inclusion. Risk factors were included in the meta-analysis if at least three effect sizes with clear pregnancy-related risk factor exposure were identified. Pooled effect sizes were calculated for ADHD overall, ADHD diagnosis, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous measures and correlation coefficients (CC) for continuous measures. Prenatal factors (pre-pregnancy weight, preeclampsia, pregnancy complications, elevated testosterone exposure), and postnatal factors (Apgar score, neonatal illness, no breastfeeding) were positively associated with ADHD overall; the findings for ADHD diagnosis were similar with the exception that there were too few effect sizes available to examine pre-pregnancy weight and lack of breastfeeding. Prenatal testosterone was significantly associated with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Effect sizes were generally small (range 1.1-1.6 ORs, -0.16-0.11 CCs). Risk factors occurring at the time of birth (perinatal asphyxia, labor complications, mode of delivery) were not significantly associated with ADHD. A better understanding of factors that are consistently associated with ADHD may inform future prevention strategies. The findings reported here suggest that prenatal and postnatal factors may serve as potential targets for preventing or mitigating the symptoms of ADHD.

AB  - Despite stereotypes of video games as isolating technologies, video gaming can be a highly social activity that contributes to well-being. Advances in computing technology and greater social acceptance of video gaming have led to overall increases in gameplay in social scenarios. Our review focuses on three areas of research relevant to understanding social gaming and well-being: social play in video games (both past and present social play, and forms of tandem play), social gaming and psychological recovery (both short-term recovery and long-term resilience), and the use of emerging technologies to connect via gaming (such as game streaming and augmented/virtual reality). Throughout the article, we also highlight deficiencies in extant research and offer suggestions for how social scholarship on video games can move forward with well-being in mind. While existing research generally demonstrates the social dynamics of gaming and demonstrates the role of games for wellbeing, a robust and directed merging of these two complimentary lines of research is currently lacking.

AB  - Many countries offer different pathways through which migrants can enter a new country. In Canada, there are three main immigrant admission classes: economic, family, and refugee. Previous research suggests that there are differences in health outcomes among various subgroups of migrants. A scoping review was conducted to characterize the role of immigrant admission classes on the health and well-being of immigrants and refugees in Canada. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and EconLit databases were searched for quantitative studies published in English after 1990. The screening and selection process identified 27 relevant studies. Studies were categorized into four key reported outcomes: health care and services utilization, self-rated health and mental health, medical conditions and chronic illnesses, and social integration and satisfaction. Findings confirm that certain subgroups have worse health outcomes after arrival, particularly refugees, family class and other dependent immigrants. Health outcomes vary significantly across immigrant subgroups defined by the admission class through which they entered Canada.

AB  - Uncontrollable anger is common following an acquired brain injury (ABI), with impaired emotion regulation (ER) being one of the main contributors. Existing psychological interventions appear moderately effective, though studies typically include limitations such as small sample sizes, issues of long-term efficacy, and standardization of content. While ER has been a popular research field, the study of ER for anger management after ABI is less well investigated, and contains few interventions based on the widely used Process Model of ER. This review surveys the efficacy of ER strategies in individuals with ABI, and proposes a novel research design for future interventions. Recommendations are made about: strategy number and type, shared decision-making, approaches to data analysis, and mode of delivery.

AB  - Various biological, social, psychological, and environmental factors impact children and youth living with mental health problems across their lifespan. To meet the wide-ranging challenges of mental illness, service system integration is needed to improve efficiencies and reduce fragmentation. Unfortunately, the mental health system has been plagued by the lack of coordination across services. There is a general consensus that mental health service delivery must ensure a child or youth's needs are addressed in a collaborative, coordinated, and seamless manner. A key element to successful integration is the development of a comprehensive standardized screening and assessment system. Numerous assessments have been developed to assess child mental health and functioning, but they typically have a very narrow focus with limited use and utility. Not only does this reduce the ability to take a life course perspective to mental health, but this uncoordinated approach also results in redundancies in information collected, additional resources, and increased assessor burden for children, youth, and their families. The interRAI child and youth mental health assessment suite was developed in response to the need for an integrated mental health system for young persons. This suite includes screening and assessment instruments for in-patient and community settings, emergency departments, educational settings, and youth justice custodial facilities. The instruments form a mental health information system intentionally designed to work in an integrated fashion beginning in infancy, and incorporate key applications such as care planning, outcome measurement, resource allocation, and quality improvement. The design of these assessment tools and their psychometric properties are reviewed. Data is then presented using examples related to interpersonal trauma, illustrating the use and utility of the integrated suite, along with the various applications of these assessment systems.

AB  - Purpose of Review Menstrual bleeding is a regular, common occurrence in a substantial portion of the population. Menstruators may use more than 10,000 menstrual products over the lifetime. Given the potential for environmental chemicals in menstrual products to be absorbed by the vulvar and vaginal epithelium into systemic circulation, we reviewed the available data on menstrual products as a source of environmental chemical exposure. Recent Findings Nearly two dozen studies have been conducted measuring environmental contaminants in menstrual products; all have detected environmental chemicals but had discrepant conclusions on exposure risks. Only three human studies have investigated menstrual product use and environmental chemical concentrations and all observed associations. Detection of environmental chemicals in menstrual products, in combination with challenges of exposure assessment, scarcity of human studies, and the exceedingly common occurrence of menstrual bleeding, motivates the need for further research. We provide recommendations to move this field forward.

AB  - BackgroundInnovative technologies, such as machine learning, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) are approaches adopted for personalized medicine, and psychological interventions and diagnosis are facing huge paradigm shifts. In this literature review, we aim to highlight potential applications of AI on psychological interventions and diagnosis. MethodsThis literature review manifest studies that discuss how innovative technology as deep learning (DL) and AI is affecting psychological assessment and psychotherapy, we performed a search on PUBMED, and Web of Science using the terms "psychological interventions," "diagnosis on mental health disorders," "artificial intelligence," and "deep learning." Only studies considering patients' datasets are considered. ResultsNine studies met the inclusion criteria. Beneficial effects on clinical symptoms or prediction were shown in these studies, but future study is needed to determine the long-term effects. LimitationsThe major limitation for the current study is the small sample size, and lies in the lack of long-term follow-up-controlled studies for a certain symptom. ConclusionsAI such as DL applications showed promising results on clinical practice, which could lead to profound impact on personalized medicine for mental health conditions. Future studies can improve furthermore by increasing sample sizes and focusing on ethical approvals and adherence for online-therapy.

AB  - NOVELTY STATEMENT The physio-biochemical and molecular responses and mechanism of B uptake under its toxic condition have been illustrated. The spatial distribution of boron under its toxic condition and its accumulation in the plant might be regulated with sugar alcohols (polyols). This review throws light on the elevated level of B in the soil-plant system and provides management strategies for alleviating B toxicity in the plant.
   Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient, crucial for the growth and development of crop plants. However, the essential to a toxic range of B in the plant is exceptionally narrow, and symptoms develop with a slight change in its concentration in soil. The morphological and anatomical response, such as leaf chlorosis, stunted growth, and impairment in the xylem and phloem development occurs under B-toxicity. The transport of B in the plant occurs via transpiration stream with the involvement of B-channels and transporter in the roots. The higher accumulation of B in source and sink tissue tends to have lower photosynthetic, chlorophyll content, infertility, failure of pollen tube formation and germination, impairment of cell wall formation, and disruption of membrane systems. Excess B in the plant hinders the uptake of other micronutrients, hormone transport, and metabolite partitioning. B-mediated reactive oxygen species production leads to the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes which help to scavenge these molecules and prevent the plant from further oxidative damage. This review highlights morpho-anatomical, physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of the plant under B toxicity and thereby might help the researchers to understand the related mechanism and design strategies to develop B tolerant cultivars.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are regarded as a global issue due to their toxicity effects on fish and humans. Fish is a vital origin of human protein, which is necessary for body growth. Contamination of fish by MPs is a major hazard that requires special focus. After exposure to MPs alone or in combination with other pollutants, fish may experience a variety of health issues. MPs can cause tissue damage, oxidative stress, and changes in immune-related gene expression as well as antioxidant status in fish. After being exposed to MPs, fish suffer from neurotoxicity, growth retardation, and behavioral abnormalities. The consequences of MPs on human health are poorly understood. Due to the abundance of MPs in environment, exposure may occur via consumption, inhalation, and skin contact. Humans may experience oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, neurotoxicity, immune system disruption, and transfer of MPs to other tissues after being exposed to them. The toxic effects of MPs in both fish and human are still unknown. This detailed review has the potential to add to existing knowledge about the ecotoxicity effects of MPs in both fish and humans, which will be useful for the forthcoming study.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, and motor dysfunction has been attributed to loss of dopaminergic neurons. However, motor dysfunction is only one of many symptoms experienced by patients. A neuropathological hallmark of PD is intraneuronal protein aggregates called Lewy pathology (LP). Neuropathological staging studies have shown that dopaminergic neurons are only one of the many cell types prone to manifest LP. Progressive appearance of LP in multiple brain regions, as well as pe-ripheral nerves, has led to the popular hypothesis that LP and misfolded forms of one of its major components - alpha-synuclein (aSYN) - can spread through synaptically connected circuits. However, not all brain regions or neurons within connected circuits develop LP, suggesting that cell autonomous factors modulate the develop-ment of pathology. Here, we review studies about how LP develops and progressively engages additional brain regions. We focus on how connectivity constrains progression and discuss cell autonomous factors that drive pathology development. We propose a mixed model of cell autonomous factors and trans-synaptic spread as mediators of pathology progression and put forward this model as a framework for future experiments exploring PD pathophysiology.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the effects of physical exercise intervention on the cardinal symptoms, motor skills and executive function among children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Methods: Literature searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed in PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, CBM, VIP and Wanfang databases from the time of database construction to March 28, 2021. Screening was conducted based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tools were used to evaluate methodological quality. Relevant data were analyzed with RevMan5.3.5 software, and Stata16.0 was used for publication bias tests.
   Results: A total of 15 RCTs with 734 subjects were included. The meta-analysis showed that physical exercise can improve the attention of ADHD children (standardized mean difference [SMD] =-0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.10, -0.11], p < 0.01), executive function (SMD = 1.22, 95% CI [0.61, 1.82], p < 0.01), and motor skills (SMD = 0.67, 95% CI [0.22, 1.12], p < 0.01). There were no significant effects on hyperactivity (SMD = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.26, 0.37], p = 0.72), depression (SMD =-0.72, 95% CI [-1.55, 0.11], p = 0.09), social problems (SMD =-0.27, 95% CI [-0.64, 0.09], p = 0.14), or aggressive behavior (SMD=-0.24, 95% CI [-0.69,-0.21], p = 0.30). Intervention duration and frequency might be the source of heterogeneity.
   Conclusion: Physical exercise can help alleviate the symptoms of ADHD in children. Specifically, it can improve attention, executive function, and motor skills.

AB  - Background: Advancements in science and various technologies have resulted in people having access to better health care, a good quality of life, and better economic situations, enabling humans to live longer than ever before. Research shows that the problems of loneliness and social isolation are common among older adults, affecting psychological and physical health. Information and communication technology (ICT) plays an important role in alleviating social isolation and loneliness.
   Objective: The aim of this review is to explore ICT solutions for reducing social isolation or loneliness among older adults, the purpose of ICT solutions, and the evaluation focus of these solutions. This study particularly focuses on customized ICT solutions that either are designed from scratch or are modifications of existing off-the-shelf products that cater to the needs of older adults.
   Methods: A scoping literature review was conducted. A search across 7 databases, including ScienceDirect, Association for Computing Machinery, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science, was performed, targeting ICT solutions for reducing and managing social isolation and loneliness among older adults. Articles published in English from 2010 to 2020 were extracted and analyzed.
   Results: From the review of 39 articles, we identified 5 different purposes of customized ICT solutions focusing on reducing social isolation and loneliness. These were social communication, social participation, a sense of belonging, companionship, and feelings of being seen. The mapping of purposes of ICT solutions with problems found among older adults indicates that increasing social communication and social participation can help reduce social isolation problems, whereas fulfilling emotional relationships and feeling valued can reduce feelings of loneliness. In terms of customized ICT solution types, we found the following seven different categories: social network, messaging services, video chat, virtual spaces or classrooms with messaging capabilities, robotics, games, and content creation and management. Most of the included studies (30/39, 77%) evaluated the usability and acceptance aspects, and few studies (11/39, 28%) focused on loneliness or social isolation outcomes.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the importance of discussing and managing social isolation and loneliness as different but related concepts and emphasizes the need for future research to use suitable outcome measures for evaluating ICT solutions based on the problem. Even though a wide range of customized ICT solutions have been developed, future studies need to explore the recent emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things and augmented or virtual reality, to tackle social isolation and loneliness among older adults. Furthermore, future studies should consider evaluating social isolation or loneliness while developing customized ICT solutions to provide more robust data on the effectiveness of the solutions.

AB  - Introduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is among the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this, AUD is often not detected in health care settings, which contributes to a wide treatment gap. Integrating services for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in general health care settings is among the recommended strategies to narrow this treatment gap. This scoping review aimed to map the available evidence on integration of AUD interventions in general health care settings in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods: We searched four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Africa Wide Information) for publications up to December 2020. The search strategy focused on terms for alcohol use, alcohol interventions, and sub-Saharan African countries. Studies that reported AUD interventions in general health care settings in sub-Saharan Africa were eligible for inclusion. Over 3,817 potentially eligible articles were identified. After the removal of duplicates and screening of abstracts, 56 articles were included for full article review. Of these, 24 papers reporting on 22 studies were eligible and included in a narrative review.
   Results: Of the 24 eligible articles, 19 (80%) described AUD interventions that were being delivered in general health care settings, 3 (12%) described plans or programs for integrating AUD interventions at different levels of care, including in health facilities, and 2 (8%) studies reported on AUD interventions integrated into general health care settings.
   Conclusions: This review shows that there is limited evidence on the integration of AUD interventions in health care settings in sub-Saharan Africa. There is an urgent need for studies that report systematically on the development, adaptation, implementation, and evaluation of integrated AUD interventions in health care settings in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Background Patients with bipolar disorder experience impairments in their occupational functioning, despite remission of symptoms. Previous research has shown that neurocognitive deficits, especially deficits in executive functions, may persist during euthymia and are associated with diminished occupational functioning. Objectives The aim of this scoping review was to identify published studies that report on the relationships between executive functions and occupational functioning in BD to review current knowledge and identify knowledge gaps. In addition to traditional neuropsychological approaches, we aimed to describe executive functioning from a self-regulation perspective, including emotion regulation. Methods We applied the methodological framework as described by Arksey and O'Malley (Int J Soc Res Methodol Theory Pract 8:19-32, 2005) and Levac et al. (Implement Sci 5:1-9, 2010). We searched PubMed and psycINFO for literature up to November 2021, after which we screened papers based on inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently performed the screening process, data charting process, and synthesis of results. Results The search yielded 1202 references after deduplication, of which 222 remained after initial screening. The screening and inclusion process yielded 82 eligible papers in which relationships between executive functions and occupational functioning are examined. Conclusion Neurocognitive deficits, including in executive functions and self-regulation, are associated with and predictive of diminished occupational functioning. Definitions and measurements for neurocognitive functions and occupational functioning differ greatly between studies, which complicates comparisons. Studies on functional remediation show promising results for improving occupational functioning in patients with BD. In research and clinical practice more attention is needed towards the quality of work functioning and the various contexts in which patients with BD experience deficits.

AB  - Aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are gradually becoming the primary burden of society and cause significant health-care concerns. Aging is a critical independent risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. The pathological alterations of neurodegenerative diseases are tightly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress, which in turn stimulates the further progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Given the potential research value, lncRNAs have attracted considerable attention. LncRNAs play complex and dynamic roles in multiple signal transduction axis of neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs exert crucial regulatory effects in the initiation and development of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. This review compiles the underlying pathological mechanisms of aging and related neurodegenerative diseases. Besides, we discuss the roles of lncRNAs in aging. In addition, the crosstalk and network of lncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases are also explored.

AB  - Frailty is a complex geriatric syndrome with multifactorial associated mechanisms that need to be examined more deeply to help reverse the adverse health-related outcomes. Specific inflammatory and physical health markers have been associated with the onset of frailty, but the associations between these factors and psycho-social health outcomes seem less studied. This systematic review aimed to identify, in the same study design, the potential associations between frailty and markers of inflammation, and physical or psycho-social health. A literature search was performed from inception until March 2021 using Medline, Psycinfo, and EMBASE. Three raters evaluated the articles and selected 22 studies, using inclusion and exclusion criteria (n = 17,373; 91.6% from community-dwelling samples). Regarding biomarkers, 95% of the included studies showed significant links between inflammation [especially the higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)], and frailty status. Approximately 86% of the included studies showed strong links between physical health decline (such as lower levels of hemoglobin, presence of comorbidities, or lower physical performance), and frailty status. At most, 13 studies among the 22 included ones evaluated psycho-social variables and mixed results were observed regarding the relationships with frailty. Results are discussed in terms of questioning the medical perception of global health, centering mostly on the physical dimension. Therefore, the development of future research studies involving a more exhaustive view of frailty and global (bio-psycho-social) health is strongly encouraged.

AB  - The assessment of the impact of meteorological factors on the epidemiology of various diseases and on human pathophysiology and physiology requires a comprehensive approach and new tools independent of currently occurring climate change. The thermal comfort index, i.e., Universal Climate Thermal Index (UTCI), is gaining more and more recognition from researchers interested in such assessments. This index facilitates the evaluation of the impact of cold stress and heat stress on the human organism and the assessment of the incidence of weather-related diseases. This work aims at identifying those areas of medical science for which the UTCI was applied for scientific research as well as its popularization among clinicians, epidemiologists, and specialists in public health management. This is a systematic review of literature found in Pubmed, Sciencedirect and Web of Science databases from which, consistent with PRISMA guidelines, original papers employing the UTCI in studies related to health, physiological parameters, and epidemiologic applications were extracted.
   Out of the total number of 367 papers identified in the databases, 33 original works were included in the analysis. The selected publications were analyzed in terms of determining the areas of medical science in which the UTCI was applied. The majority of studies were devoted to the broadly understood mortality, cardiac events, and emergency medicine. A significant disproportion between publications discussing heat stress and those utilizing the UTCI for its assessment was revealed.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), are pervasive, often lifelong disorders, lacking evidence-based interventions for core symptoms. With no established biological markers, diagnoses are defined by behavioral criteria. Thus, preclinical in vivo animal models of NDDs must be optimally utilized. For this reason, experts in the field of behavioral neuroscience convened a workshop with the goals of reviewing current behavioral studies, reports, and assessments in rodent models. Goals included: (a) identifying the maximal utility and limitations of behavior in animal models with construct validity; (b) providing recommendations for phenotyping animal models; and (c) guidelines on how in vivo models should be used and reported reliably and rigorously while acknowledging their limitations. We concluded by recommending minimal criteria for reporting in manuscripts going forward. The workshop elucidated a consensus of potential solutions to several problems, including revisiting claims made about animal model links to ASD (and related conditions). Specific conclusions included: mice (or other rodent or preclinical models) are models of the neurodevelopmental insult, not specifically any disorder (e.g., ASD); a model that perfectly recapitulates a disorder such as ASD is untenable; and greater attention needs be given to validation of behavioral testing methods, data analysis, and critical interpretation.

AB  - Green consumption (GC), as one of the important initiatives to achieve the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, has attracted widespread attention from scholars in environmental and economic fields. This article reviews the literature on GC, asking two main questions: how can GC research be analyzed from macro, meso, and micro perspectives? How have the research topics in the field of GC evolved in international and Chinese academia? This study makes a visual analysis of knowledge domain based on the literature of Web of Science Core Collection and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, so as to reveal hot topics, stage division, and research trend of GC research. The results revealed the following: GC research is in a period of rapid growth, and it is mainly distributed in developed countries dominated by the USA and in developing countries dominated by China. There is a trend of interdisciplinary research on GC, such as ecology, psychology, health, systematics, politics, and economics, which indicates that GC research has become increasingly inseparable from human survival and health, psychological acceptance, and social development. For the international academia, GC research pays more attention to the transformation of consumer psychology, while the Chinese academia is more concerned with the regulation of consumer behavior and the activation of green emotions. Considering the focus and characteristics of GC supervision, this study proposes GC 3.0 with a consumer-oriented and emphasizing green emotions and proposes future application scenarios from four aspects: government supervision, social self-regulation, enterprise demonstration, and personal self-monitoring.

AB  - There is a confidence crisis in many scientific disciplines, in particular disciplines researching human behavior, as many effects of original experiments have not been replicated successfully in large-scale replication studies. While human-robot interaction (HRI) is an interdisciplinary research field, the study of human behavior, cognition and emotion in HRI plays also a vital part. Are HRI user studies facing the same problems as other fields and if so, what can be done to overcome them? In this article, we first give a short overview of the replicability crisis in behavioral sciences and its causes. In a second step, we estimate the replicability of HRI user studies mainly 1) by structural comparison of HRI research processes and practices with those of other disciplines with replicability issues, 2) by systematically reviewing meta-analyses of HRI user studies to identify parameters that are known to affect replicability, and 3) by summarizing first replication studies in HRI as direct evidence. Our findings suggest that HRI user studies often exhibit the same problems that caused the replicability crisis in many behavioral sciences, such as small sample sizes, lack of theory, or missing information in reported data. In order to improve the stability of future HRI research, we propose some statistical, methodological and social reforms. This article aims to provide a basis for further discussion and a potential outline for improvements in the field.

AB  - The striatum is densely innervated by mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons that modulate acquisition and vigor of goal-directed actions and habits. This innervation is progressively lost in Parkinson's disease (PD), contributing to the defining movement deficits of the disease. Although boosting dopaminergic signaling with levodopa early in the course of the disease alleviates these deficits, later this strategy leads to the emergence of debilitating dyskinesia. Here, recent advances in our understanding of how striatal cells and circuits adapt to this progressive de-innervation and to levodopa therapy are discussed. First, we discuss how dopamine (DA) depletion triggers cell type-specific, homeostatic changes in spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that tend to normalize striatal activity but also lead to disruption of the synaptic architecture sculpted by experience. Second, we discuss the roles played by cholinergic and nitric oxide-releasing interneurons in these adaptations. Third, we examine recent work in freely moving mice suggesting that alterations in the spatiotemporal dynamics of striatal ensembles contributes to PD movement deficits. Lastly, we discuss recently published evidence from a progressive model of PD suggesting that contrary to the classical model, striatal pathway imbalance is necessary but not sufficient to produce frank parkinsonism.

AB  - Climate change is the largest threat to human health of the twenty-first century. Women are disproportionately affected by climate change. While the physical health impacts of climate change are an active area of research, works related to the mental health impacts are less developed. Furthermore, the mental health impacts of climate change on women are a particular area of interest due to women's disproportionately negative experiences with climate change and climate change-related events. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is to understand what is known from the existing literature regarding the mental health impacts of climate change on women. The methods for this review follow the Arksey and O'Malley framework for a scoping review. By searching databases for publications that discuss women, mental health, and climate change, and screening for relevant work, 20 studies that met inclusion criteria were included in the review. Themes derived from the reviewed studies include negative mental health outcomes, gender-based violence, burdens of care and responsibility, attachment to land and traditions, and the importance of intersectionality. From these findings, there is a clear need for climate policies on adaptation and mitigation to reflect women's unique needs to ensure their health and safety.

AB  - There is evidence that universal school-based mindfulness training (SBMT) can have positive effects for young people. However, it is unknown who benefits most from such training, how training exerts effects, and how implementation impacts effects. This study aimed to provide an overview of the evidence on the mediators, moderators, and implementation factors of SBMT, and propose a conceptual model that can be used both to summarize the evidence and provide a framework for future research. A scoping review was performed, and six databases and grey literature were searched. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select relevant material. Quantitative and qualitative information was extracted from eligible articles and reported in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The search produced 5479 articles, of which 31 were eligible and included in the review. Eleven studies assessed moderators of SBMT on pupil outcomes, with mixed findings for all variables tested. Five studies examined the mediating effect of specific variables on pupil outcomes, with evidence that increases in mindfulness skills and decreases in cognitive reactivity and self-criticism post-intervention are related to better pupil outcomes at follow-up. Twenty-five studies assessed implementation factors. We discuss key methodological shortcomings of included studies and integrate our findings with existing implementation frameworks to propose a conceptual model. Widespread interest in universal SBMT has led to increased research over recent years, exploring who SBMT works for and how it might work, but the current evidence is limited. We make recommendations for future research and provide a conceptual model to guide theory-led developments.

AB  - Plastic pollution is a fast-rising environmental catastrophe. Microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) are ubiquitous components of most aquatic environments, and their burgeoning prevalence is endangering aquatic organisms. Recent studies have documented the entanglement of marine and freshwater biota by plastic litters, particularly ghost fishing gear, resulting in suffocation, drowning, or starving to death. Numerous reports have shown that aquatic organisms readily ingest and accumulate these emerging contaminants in their digestive systems. Given experimental evidence that contaminants-laden MNPs can persist in the gastrointestinal tract for considerable durations, investigations have documented a high probability of lethal and sublethal toxicological effects associated with direct and indirect MNPs ingestions. These include chronic protein modulation, DNA damage, embryotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, genotoxicity, growth inhibition toxicity, histopathotoxicity, liver toxicity, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, reproductive toxicity, and tissue damage. Today, reports have proven the transfer of MNPs across the aquatic food web to humans. However, the mechanisms of multiple contaminants-laden MNPs-induced toxicities, size-dependent toxicity, and the comprehensive mode-of-action and alterations of digestive, reproductive, and neurological systems' functionality in marine organisms are still unclear. Thus, this review mainly addresses the prevalence, food web interactions, and toxicity assessment of micro(nano) plastics in marine and freshwater organisms. It summarizes documented studies based on the following broad objectives: (1) the occurrence and prevalence of micro(nano) plastic particles in marine and freshwater environments; (2) the ingestion of MNPs by aquatic biota and the food web exposure routes and bioaccumulation of contaminated MNPs by higher trophic entities; (3) the adsorption and desorption of persistent organic pollutants, metals, and chemical additives on/from micro(nano)plastics; and (4) the probable ecotoxicological effects of micro(nano)plastics ingestion on aquatic biota.

AB  - How do affect and cognition interact in managerial decision making? Over the last decades, scholars have investigated how managers make decisions. However, what remains largely unknown is the interplay of affective states and cognition during the decision-making process. We offer a systematization of the contributions produced on the role of affect and cognition in managerial decision making by considering the recent cross-fertilization of management studies with the neuroscience domain. We implement a Systematic Literature Review of 23 selected contributions dealing with the role of affect and cognition in managerial decisions that adopted neuroscience techniques/points of view. Collected papers have been analyzed by considering the so-called reflexive (X-) and reflective (C-) systems in social cognitive neuroscience and the type of decisions investigated in the literature. Results obtained help to support an emerging "unified " mind processing theory for which the two systems of our mind are not in conflict and for which affective states have a driving role toward cognition. A research agenda for future studies is provided to scholars who are interested in advancing the investigation of affect and cognition in managerial decision making, also through neuroscience techniques - with the consideration that these works should be at the service of the behavioral strategy field.

AB  - Sprint interval training (SIT) is characterized by intensity of "all-out " effort and superior time-efficiency compared to traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and has been proposed as one viable solution to address the commonly reported barrier of lack of time for physical activity. While substantial physiological benefits of participation in SIT have been well-documented, the psychological responses to SIT are less clear. No systematic review has been conducted thus far to respond to the assumption that its supramaximal intensity will induce adverse feelings. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to synthesize studies analyzing affective and enjoyment responses to SIT and to compare the responses to SIT with MICT and other high intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols with lower intensities. After searching relevant databases up until 22nd March 2021, twenty-five studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the present review. Random effect meta-analysis using the pooled data demonstrated that SIT induced similar post-exercise affective valences during the training compared to MICT and HIIT, but lower affective valences immediately post-exercise compared to MICT. Moreover, affective responses during SIT decreased to negative valences according to the results from most included studies, while low-volume SIT protocols with shorter sprint duration and repetitions induced more positive affective responses. Level of enjoyment after SIT were positive and were comparable to MICT or HIIT. Overall, the results from the existing literature indicate that SIT might cause unpleasant feelings during the training and be perceived less pleasurable than MICT immediately post training but could be a comparably enjoyable modality for healthy individuals in relation to MICT or HIIT, despite its supramaximal intensity. Low-volume SIT may be a realistic option for individuals seeking a time-efficient workout with comparable affective responses to MICT or HIIT.

AB  - Behavioral parameters are reliable and useful operational welfare indicators that yield information on fish health and welfare status in aquaculture. However, aquatic environment is still constraining for some solutions based on underwater cameras or echo sounder transmitters. Thus, the use of bio-loggers internally or externally attached to sentinel fish emerges as a solution for fish welfare monitoring in tanks- and sea cages-rearing systems. This review is focused on the recently developed AEFishBIT, a small and light data storage tag designed to be externally attached to fish operculum for individual and simultaneous monitoring of swimming activity and ventilation rates under steady and unsteady swimming conditions for short-term periods. AEFishBIT is a tri-axial accelerometer with a frequency sampling of 50-100 Hz that is able to provide proxy measurements of physical and metabolic activities validated by video recording, exercise tests in swim tunnel respirometers, and differential operculum and body tail movements across fish species with differences in swimming capabilities. Tagging procedures based on tag piercing and surgery procedures are adapted to species anatomical head and operculum features, which allowed trained operators to quickly complete the tagging procedure with a fast post-tagging recovery of just 2.5-7 h in both salmonid (rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon) and non-salmonid (gilthead sea bream, European sea bass) farmed fish. Dual recorded data are processed by on-board algorithms, providing valuable information on adaptive behavior through the productive cycle with the changing environment and genetics. Such biosensing approach also provides valuable information on social behavior in terms of adaptive capacities or changes in daily or seasonal activity, linking respiratory rates with changes in metabolic rates and energy partitioning between growth and physical activity. At short-term, upcoming improvements in device design and accompanying software are envisaged, including energy-harvesting techniques aimed to prolong the battery life and the addition of a gyroscope for the estimation of the spatial distribution of fish movements. Altogether, the measured features of AEFishBIT will assist researchers, fish farmers and breeders to establish stricter welfare criteria, suitable feeding strategies, and to produce more robust and efficient fish in a changing environment, helping to improve fish management and aquaculture profitability.

AB  - Objective To provide a comprehensive analysis of cytokine perturbations in antipsychotic-naive first-episode psychosis (FEP) populations and assess the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and negative symptom severity. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines were conducted. A total of 1042 records were identified via systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE and APA PsycInfo databases. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for inclusion in the review. Ten of these studies had sufficient data for inclusion in a random effects, pooled-effect meta-analysis. Results A significant and large effect size was reported for IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IL-12, and a moderate effect size reported for IL-17 (p = <0.05) in people with antipsychotic naive first episode psychosis, compared to healthy controls, suggesting a significant elevation in proinflammatory cytokine concentration. Non-significant effect sizes were reported for TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-10 (p = >0.05). Regarding proinflammatory cytokines and relationships to negative symptomology, moderate positive relationships were reported for negative symptoms and IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, across four studies. For anti-inflammatory cytokines, one strong and one weak-to-moderate negative relationship was described for IL-10 and negative symptoms. Contrastingly, a strong positive relationship was reported for IL-4 and negative symptoms. Conclusion There is evidence of significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines in antipsychotic-naive FEP populations, alongside promising findings from cohort data suggesting an interaction between inflammation and primary negative symptomology. Future studies should seek to come to a consensus on a panel of cytokines that relate most specifically to negative symptoms, and consider longitudinal studies to investigate how cytokine fluctuations may relate to exacerbation of symptoms.

AB  - Mediterranean coastal wetlands are considered biodiversity hot-spots and contain a high number of endemic species. The biodiversity of these ecosystems is endangered by several pressures resulting from agricultural and urban expansion, climate change, and the alteration of their hydrological cycle. In this study we assess the state-of-the-art regarding the impact of several stressor groups on the biodiversity of Mediterranean coastal wetlands (i.e., lagoons, marshes, estuaries). Particularly, we describe the impacts of eutrophication, chemical pollution, invasive species, salinization, and temperature rise, and analyze the existing literature regarding the impact of multiple stressors on these ecosystems. Our study denotes a clear asymmetry both in terms of study areas and stressors evaluated. The majority of studies focus on lagoons and estuaries of the north-west parts of the Mediterranean basin, while the African and the Asian coast have been less represented. Eutrophication and chemical pollution were the most studied stressors compared to others like temperature rise or species invasions. Most studies evaluating these stressors individually show direct or indirect effects on the biodiversity of primary producers and invertebrate communities, and changes in species dominance patterns that contribute to a decline of endemic populations. The few available studies addressing stressor interactions have shown non-additive responses, which are important to define appropriate ecosystem management and restoration measures. Finally, we propose research needs to advance our understanding on the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on Mediterranean coastal wetlands and to guide future interventions to protect biodiversity.

   Method and Material: A comprehensive search of the literature through PubMed, Scopus, Embase, google scholar and Cochrane databases was conducted. Such keywords as COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, bruxism, adult, and adolescent were used.
   Results: In the initial search 818 articles were obtained; 68 cases were duplicates and excluded. By reviewing the article title, 714 articles were removed because they were not relevant to the topic. The remaining articles were reviewed, and studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, as well as letter to editors and expert opinions were excluded. Finally, 11 articles were allowed to enter the study. Out of 11 related articles, 5 studies were excluded from the present study due to mismatch of the target population; and finally 6 articles were thoroughly reviewed.
   Conclusion: Studies have shown that stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic increases detrimental oral habits such as bruxism as well as temporomandibular disorders in adults and adolescents; In general, young single women are at high risk and more exposed to these harmful oral habits.

AB  - There are 400-500 thousand dopaminergic cells within each side of the human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) making them a minuscule portion of total brain mass. These tiny clusters of cells have an outsized impact on motor output and behavior as seen in disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). SNpc dopaminergic neurons are more vulnerable to oxidative stress compared to other brain cell types, but the reasons for this are not precisely known. Here we provide evidence to support the hypothesis that this selective vulnerability is because SNpc neurons sustain high metabolic rates compared to other neurons. A higher baseline requirement for ATP production may lead to a selective vulnerability to impairments in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) or genetic insults that impair Complex I of the electron transport chain. We suggest that the energy demands of the unique morphological and electrophysiological properties of SNpc neurons may be one reason these cells produce more ATP than other cells. We further provide evidence to support the hypothesis that transcription factors (TFs) required to drive induction, differentiation, and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neural progenitor cells which give rise to terminally differentiated SNpc neurons are uniquely involved in both developmental patterning and metabolism, a dual function unlike other TFs that program neurons in other brain regions. The use of these TFs during induction and differentiation may program ventral midbrain progenitor cells metabolically to higher ATP levels, allowing for the development of those specialized cell processes seen in terminally differentiated cells. This paper provides a cellular and developmental framework for understanding the selective vulnerability of SNpc dopaminergic cells to oxidative stress.

AB  - Introduction: There is an increasing interest in understanding whether air pollutants modify the quantitative relationships between temperature and health outcomes. The results of available studies were, however, inconsistent. This study aims to sum up the current evidence and provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic. Methods: We conducted an electronic search in PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The modified Navigation Guide was applied to evaluate the quality and strength of evidence. We calculated pooled temperature-related mortality at low and high pollutant levels respectively, using the random-effects model.Results: We identified 22 eligible studies, eleven of which were included in the meta-analysis. Significant effect modification was observed on heat effects for all-cause and non-accidental mortality by particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 mu m (PM10) and ozone (O3) (p < 0.05). The excess risks (ERs) for all-cause and non-accidental mortality were 5.4% (4.4%, 6.4%) and 6.3% (4.8%, 7.8%) at the low PM10 level, 8.8% (7.5%, 10.1%) and 11.4% (8.7%, 14.2%) at the high PM10 level, respectively. As for O3, the ERs for all-cause and nonaccidental mortality were 5.1% (3.9%, 6.3%) and 3.6% (0.1%, 7.2%) at the low O3 level, 7.6% (6.3%, 9.0%) and 12.5% (4.7%, 20.9%) at the high O3 level, respectively. Surprisingly, the heat effects on cardiovascular mortality were found to be lower at high carbon monoxide (CO) levels [ERs = 5.4% (3.9%, 6.9%)] than that at low levels [ERs = 9.4% (7.0%, 11.9%)]. The heterogeneity varied, but the results of sensitivity analyses were generally robust. Significant effect modification by air pollutants was not observed for heatwave or cold effects.Conclusions: PM10 and O3 modify the heat-related all-cause and non-accidental mortality, indicating that policymakers should consider air pollutants when establishing heat-health warning systems. Future studies with comparable designs and settings are needed.

AB  - Although anxiety is commonly researched in autism, the focus has predominantly been on anxiety disorders and not upon general levels of anxiousness or trait anxiety. This review summarises research investigating trait anxiety in autism. Systematic searches yielded 1099 records, with 23 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Study participants were mainly males from Western countries, with no representation of older adults or individuals with intellectual disability. All articles used self-report questionnaire trait anxiety measures. Anxiety measure psychometric details were absent in most studies, with 21 using subjective measures that are not validated for use in autism. Results showed higher trait anxiety scores in autism versus control groups, and correlations between trait anxiety scores and other study outcomes.

AB  - Introduction Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death, and there is evidence that work exposures could be associated with their development. This study aimed to systematically review observational studies of adults exposed to job strain, effort-reward imbalance, long working hours, job insecurity, shift work, and occupational noise, and assess the association of those work exposures with CVDs. Methods The Navigation Guide framework was applied. The population were adults of working age (18-65), and cohort and case-control studies were included. The work exposures were job strain, effort-reward imbalance, long working hours, job insecurity, shift work, and occupational noise. The outcomes were cerebrovascular diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and hypertensive diseases. The selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and quality assessment were carried out by two reviewers independently and disagreements were solved by a third reviewer or by consensus. The synthesis of the results was done by applying the 'vote counting based on direction' method, and the results were summarized in an effect direction plot. The strength of the evidence for every risk factor and CVD was defined by consensus. Results A total of 17 643 papers were initially identified in the literature search, but after applying the filters by title and abstract, and full text, 86 studies were finally included. From the included studies, sufficient evidence was found of the harmfulness of job strain for cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart disease. Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence of the harmfulness of shift work for ischemic heart disease. Evidence of no relationship was found between long working hours and shift work with ischaemic heart disease and hypertensive disease, respectively. The other associations of work exposures and CVDs had limited or inadequate evidence of harmfulness. Conclusions In this comprehensive review, there was sufficient evidence of a harmful relationship between job strain, shift work, and CVDs. For the other work exposures, more high-quality studies are needed. In order to improve current prevention strategies for CVDs, the findings of this review imply that job strain and shift work are work exposures that constitute additional risk factors that could be approached as targets for worksite interventions.

AB  - Background: Parental reflective functioning (PRF) refers to parents' mental capacity to understand their own and their children's behaviors in terms of envisioned mental states. As part of a broader concept of parental mentalization, PRF has been identified as one of the central predictors for sensitive parenting. However, the unique contribution of PRF to the quality of various parenting behaviors has not yet been addressed systematically. Thus, the present article provides a systematic overview of current research on the associations between PRF or its sub-dimensions and observed parenting behaviors in infancy and early childhood, while considering the influence of contextual factors. Methods: The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Systematic searches were carried out in five electronic databases. The eligibility and methodological quality of the identified studies were assessed using pre-defined criteria and a standardized checklist. Results: Sixteen studies with moderate to high quality on a total of 15 parenting behaviors were included, the majority of which examined positive parenting behaviors, while negative parenting behaviors were rarely investigated. Most of the associations indicated a positive effect of PRF on parenting behavior, with mostly small-sized effects. The strength and direction of the associations varied depending on the dimensionality of PRF, observation settings, sample types, socioeconomic factors, and cultural background. Moreover, five assessment instruments for PRF and 10 observation instruments for parenting behaviors were identified. Conclusion: In summary, PRF has shown a positive association with parenting quality. However, its complex interaction with further contextual factors emphasizes the need for differentiation of PRF dimensions and the consideration of the observation settings, assessment time points, psychosocial risks, and sample types in observational as well as intervention studies. Further high-quality studies with multivariate analyses and diverse study settings are required.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to investigate what is currently known about autistic adults' participation in physical activity and sedentary behaviour and explore any associated correlates of these behaviours. The databases EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus were searched for relevant literature. The review was registered with PROSPERO (No. 189187). The search identified 2834 papers, with 12 meeting the criteria for inclusion. Correlates of physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour were reported in eight included studies. The limited evidence identified suggest that autistic adults are unlikely to meet Australia's physical activity guidelines. Future research should use device-derived measurement to more accurately quantify activity levels within the autistic adult population.

AB  - Thymoquinone is a naturally occurring compound and is the major component of Nigella sativa, also known as black seed or black cumin. For centuries thymoquinone has been used especially in the Middle East traditionally to treat wounds, asthma, allergies, fever, headache, cough, hypertension, and diabetes. Studies have suggested beneficial effects of thymoquinone to be attributed to its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in thymoquinone as a treatment for neurodegeneration in the brain, such as that seen in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD). In vitro and in vivo studies on animal models of AD and PD suggest the main neuroprotective mechanisms are based on the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of thymoquinone. Neurodegenerative conditions of the eye, such as Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma share at least in part similar mechanisms of neuronal cell death with those occurring in AD and PD. This review aims to summarize and critically analyze the evidence to date of the effects and potential neuroprotective actions of thymoquinone in the eye and ocular neurodegenerations.

AB  - Cognitive resources contribute to balance control. There is evidence that mental fatigue reduces cognitive resources and impairs balance performance, particularly in older adults and when balance tasks are complex, for example when trying to walk or stand while concurrently performing a secondary cognitive task.& nbsp;We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Google Scholar to identify eligible studies and performed a random effects meta-analysis to quantify the effects of experimentally induced mental fatigue on balance performance in healthy adults. Subgroup analyses were computed for age (healthy young vs. healthy older adults) and balance task complexity (balance tasks with high complexity vs. balance tasks with low complexity) to examine the moderating effects of these factors on fatigue-mediated balance performance.& nbsp;We identified 7 eligible studies with 9 study groups and 206 participants. Analysis revealed that performing a prolonged cognitive task had a small but significant effect (SMDwm =-0.38) on subsequent balance performance in healthy young and older adults. However, age-and task-related differences in balance responses to fatigue could not be confirmed statistically.& nbsp;Overall, aggregation of the available literature indicates that mental fatigue generally reduces balance in healthy adults. However, interactions between cognitive resource reduction, aging and balance task complexity remain elusive.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the literature focusing on obstetric and perinatal outcomes in women with previous or current eating disorders (EDs) and on the consequences of maternal EDs for the offspring. Methods: The study was performed following the systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. PubMed, SciELO, and Cochrane databases were searched for non-interventional studies published in English or Portuguese from January 1980 to December 2020. Risk of bias was assessed using the Methods guide for effectiveness and comparative effectiveness reviews (American Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). Results: The search yielded 441 records, and 30 articles were included. The psychiatric outcome associated with EDs in women was mainly perinatal depression. The most prevalent obstetric outcomes observed in women with EDs were vomiting, hyperemesis, bleeding, and anemia. Most studies found maternal anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa to be associated with low birth weight and slow fetal growth. Women with binge EDs delivered children with increased birth weight. Of the 30 studies included, methodological quality was good in seven, fair in eight, and poor in 15 studies. Conclusion: A considerable body of evidence was reviewed to assess obstetric and perinatal outcomes in EDs. Acute and lifetime EDs, especially if severe, correlated with poor perinatal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes. Obstetricians and general practitioners should be vigilant and screen for EDs during pregnancy.

AB  - Aim: This systematic review aimed to provide new insights into how pharmacy spaces, or the architecture of pharmacies, are experienced by pharmacy service users and staff. The review sought to identify environmental factors which may influence service users' and staff participation in community-based pharmacy health services. Method: Ten databases were searched for English language publications, using a combination of search terms relating to pharmacy service users and staff; pharmacy spaces; and health and social care outcomes. Data from the final selected studies were extracted, thematically analysed using a narrative approach and the quality of each study assessed using the Integrated quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study designs (ICROMS). Results: 80 articles reporting 80 studies published between 1994 and 2020 were identified; they were from 28 countries, involving around 3234 community pharmacies, 13,615 pharmacy service users, 5056 pharmacists and 78 pharmacy health staff. Most studies (94%) met the ICROMS minimum score, and half did not meet the mandatory quality criteria. Four themes likely to influence service users' and staff experiences of pharmacy health services were identified: (1) privacy; (2) experience of the physical environment; (3) professional image; and (4) risk of error. Conclusion: To optimise the delivery and experience of pharmacy health services, these spaces should be made more engaging. Future applied research could focus on optimising inclusive pharmacy design features.

AB  - Men's Sheds are a community-based health promotion concept which brings men together to engage in joint activities. Prior research reported beneficial effects on health and well-being of the participants; however, evidence is limited. The main objective of this systematic review is to provide an extensive overview of current research on the effectiveness of Men's Sheds on self-rated health, social isolation, and well-being by applying a mixed-methods approach. In addition, this review aims to identify how to successfully transfer and implement the concept. Eligible for inclusion were all studies published in English, German, or French that specifically referred to the concept of Men's Sheds. Four databases were searched for eligible studies, followed by a hand search on websites and reference lists. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using checklists developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Following the convergent integrated approach, quantitative data were transformed and merged with qualitative data to conduct a thematic analysis. Overall, 35 qualitative, nine quantitative, and eight mixed-methods studies were included. We found evidence regarding benefits of shed participation on self-rated health, social isolation, and well-being. We identified three key characteristics of a successful Men's Shed, including appropriate shed facilities, sufficient funding as well as a participant-driven management and organization of the shed. This mixed-methods systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence base concerning Men's Sheds and highlights the need for longitudinal studies investigating causal relationships and gathering sufficient information on how to successfully transfer and implement the concept of Men's Sheds in other countries.

AB  - Background: Post-psychotic depression (PPD) is an important and frequent clinical phenomenon featuring controversial complexity in its nosological and aetiopathogenic cataloguing. Objectives: The main objective of this research was to review the published literature on PPD. The second objective was to indicate its clinical importance, either comorbid or as an entity of its own. To answer these questions, a historical review of the term is made and a search about the clinical, evolutionary, predisposal, and prognostic variables that characterize the PPD. Methods: The international recommendations were followed according to the Preferred Items for Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The databases used were Web of Science and PubMed, with the deadline for the inclusion of articles in November 2019. The MeSH used were the following: "post " AND "psych * " AND "psich " AND "depr. " Results: The search resulted in 64 articles. Only 19 of these met the pre-specified inclusion criteria and were finally included in the review. One article found that reading this literature was added due to its relevance. Despite its high prevalence (around 30%), there is little research about the term PPD. Nevertheless, results show data to improve the description of the syndrome, revealing differential characteristics from other depressive symptoms in chronic psychosis due to its clinical implications. Conclusions: Coinciding with the latest classification manuals that do not include the term, there appears to be an abandonment of its use despite its high prevalence. Data suggest that PPD is a nosological entity different from a secondary effect to antipsychotics, the negative symptoms of psychosis, and other clinical disorders that combine psychotic and depressive symptoms such as bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or depression with psychotic symptoms. PPD also has differential characteristics concerning further depressive symptoms, especially important clinical implications such as higher suicide risk and poorer quality of life. (c) 2022 S.

AB  - Context: Schizophrenia is one of the most severe mental disorders that affect all aspects of a patient's lives. Telemedicine can be helpful for this population.
   Objectives: This study aimed to review the studies for investigating the applications and outcomes of telemedicine in providing healthcare services for patients with schizophrenia.
   Evidence Acquisition: We searched PubMed and Scopus databases to find relevant studies in July 2020. The combination of two "Schizophrenia" AND "Telemedicine" keywords were used to search databases. Original observational and interventional studies, which have used a telemedicine service in schizophrenia disease, were included in this review.
   Results: Of 309 gathered studies, 26 studies were entered into this research. The synchronous modality (58%) and videoconference communication (38.5%) were used in most studies. Most studies (84.5%) have shown that telemedicine was a beneficial method. More than half of the studies (58%) had therapeutic goals. The rest of the studies were for diagnostic (19%), educational (11.5%), and both therapeutic and educational (11.5%) purposes. Only one study (4%) showed that telemedicine was not cost-effective. In nine studies (34.5%), users were satisfied with the use of telemedicine services.
   Conclusions: Telemedicine is a useful method for the management of patients with schizophrenia, especially to improve treatment adherence and prevent relapse. It would be better to pay more attention to the educational issues because of the positive impact on adherence to treatment and prevent relapse.

AB  - Context: The demand for remote psychologist services increased during the COVID-19 outbreak due to the emergence of multiple mental health problems. Many countries have applied telemental health approaches to managing and treating mental disorders. This review study aimed to investigate the role of information technology, especially telemental health, in managing psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Evidence Acquisition: This study was conducted in four phases: Identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. Keywords were selected from MeSH to search the principal medical databases. Finally, important information was extracted from nine selected papers, including the author names, study setting, purpose, technology, method, intervention, and results.
   Results: Some studies provided telepsychiatry to people whose mental problems developed during COVID-19. Another study explained the telepsychological service for patients with mental illness before the epidemic. Most articles signified the influential role of telehealth in screening and reducing social contacts. Besides, this technology played a significant role in providing mental health services.
   Conclusions: The study showed that telemental health and telepsychiatry approaches effectively promote the mental health and well-being of participants with various mental problems. In implementing these approaches, some items such as allocating sufficient funds, preparing appropriate infrastructure, providing training for users, defining suitable evaluation methods, and considering confidentiality and privacy need to be considered.

AB  - Help-seeking behavior (HSB) is vital for older people to sustain their health. As people in aging societies increasingly demand management of their multiple symptoms, communities should encourage HSBs. In rural communities, insufficient healthcare and human resources influence older people's health. However, no related comprehensive evidence exists so far. This study investigates the present condition of older people's HSBs in rural contexts in aging societies. We conducted a systematic review by searching six databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline, and Web of Science) for original studies regarding HSBs of older people in rural contexts published until January 2022. Extracted articles were analyzed based on participants, settings, HSB causes and contents, and older people's HSB outcomes in rural contexts. Sixteen studies were included in the systematic review: seven investigated the associations between HSBs and participants' backgrounds, and three the quality of life. Six studies investigated HSB perception, diagnosis, clarifying HSB contents, professional care trend, self-rated health, and mortality. Unlike few studies investigating the association between HSBs and health-related outcomes, this systematic review explains the current evidence regarding rural older people's HSBs. Due to insufficient evidence from longitudinal studies in clarifying interventions for effective HSBs, future studies should use observational and interventional designs.

AB  - Hypothermia is an emergency caused by the lowering of the central body temperature with a slowdown of basic vital functions. Reduced mobility, old age, psychiatric or metabolic disorders are relevant risk factors. Diagnosis of death from hypothermia is a challenge, as there are no pathognomonic signs, and supportive findings can be inconstant. Wischnewsky Spots (WS) are blackish lesions of gastric mucosa, typically associated with hypothermic death. The pathophysiology of these lesions is still uncertain. The aim of this paper is to investigate the pathological mechanisms determining the appearance of WS by analyzing the current scientific knowledge in this area. We performed a narrative review of the literature published in the last 20 years, comparing the results with three cases of hypothermia reported from our experience. The review proved that WS show a multifactorial etiology, i.e., not only body temperature decrease, but also various extrinsic and intrinsic factors, such as physical and psychological stress, agony, causa mortis and metabolic comorbidities. The review summarizes the current knowledge in the field of incidence, pathology and morphology of WS by proposing some scientific and technical points for clinical and forensic analysis of this phenomenon.

AB  - Background: Ongoing primary care during adolescence is recommended by best practice guidelines for adolescents and young adults (AYAs; ages 12-25) with chronic conditions. A synthesis of the evidence on the roles of Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) and benefits of primary care is needed to support existing guidelines. Methods: We used Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, and searched databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL) for studies that (i) were published in English between 2004 and 2019, (ii) focused on AYAs with a chronic condition(s) who had received specialist pediatric services, and (iii) included relevant findings about PCPs. An extraction tool was developed to organize data items across studies (eg, study design, participant demographics, outcomes). Results: Findings from 58 studies were synthesized; 29 (50%) studies focused exclusively on AYAs with chronic health conditions (eg, diabetes, cancer), while 19 (33%) focused exclusively on AYAs with mental health conditions. Roles of PCPs included managing medications, "non-complex" mental health conditions, referrals, and care coordination, etc. Frequency of PCP involvement varied by AYAs; however, female, non-Black, and older AYAs, and those with severe/complex conditions appeared more likely to visit a PCP. Positive outcomes were reported for shared-care models targeting various conditions (eg, cancer, concussion, mental health). Conclusion: Our findings drew attention to the importance of effective collaboration among multi-disciplinary specialists, PCPs, and AYAs for overcoming multiple barriers to optimal transitional care. Highlighting the need for further study of the implementation of shared care models to design strategies for care delivery during transitions to adult care.

AB  - Objective: The association between illicit substance use by third-level education students and their mental and physical health is well documented. The aim of this scoping review was to determine factors that contribute to student motivations to reduce or stop their use of illicit substances, and to elaborate on factors that may be pertinent for student-focused behaviour change interventions for substance use. Method: We searched eight databases in March 2021 using search terms based on 'students', 'illicit substance use', and 'motivations'. We identified 86 research articles that reported on third-level education students' illicit substance use and included reasons or motives for their use. Results: After full-text screening, three studies were eligible for inclusion in the qualitative synthesis. The majority of studies described motives for abstention but did not describe motivation for reducing or stopping current patterns of use of illicit substances. Conclusion: Few studies have examined motivations of third-level education students to decrease or cease substance use. Promising avenues for research on motivations to change substance use behaviour include the social contextual factors, perceived effects on social relationships, and actions of friends and family to prompt contemplations of change.

AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury ( TBI) can precipitate new-onset psychiatric symptoms or worsen existing psychiatric conditions. To elucidate speqfic mechanisms for this interaction, neuroimaging is often used to study both psychiatric conditions and TBI. This systematic review aims to synthesize the existing literature of neuroimaging findings among patients with anxiety after TBI. Methods: We conducted a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses-compliant literature search via PubMed ( MEDLINE), PsychINFO, EMBASE, and Scopus databases before May, 2019. We included studies that clearly defined TBI, measured syndromal anxiety as a primary outcome, and statistically analyzed the relationship between neuroimaging findings and anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 5982 articles were retrieved from the systematic search, of which 65 studied anxiety and 13 met eligibility criteria. These studies were published between 2004 and 2017, collectively analyzing 764 participants comprised of 470 patients with TBI and 294 non-TBI controls. Imaging modalities used included magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance spectrometry, and magnetoencephalography. Eight of 13 studies presented at least one signOcant finding and together reflect a complex set of changes that lead to anxiety in the setting of TM The left cingulate gyrus in particular was found to be significant in 2 studies using different imaging modalities. Two studies also revealed perturbances in functional connectivity within the default mode network Conclusions: This is the first systemic review of neuroimaging changes associated with anxiety after TBI, which implicated multiple brain structures and circuits, such as the default mode network. Future research with consistent, rigorous measurements of TBI and syndromal anxiety, as well as attention to control groups, previous TBIs, and time interval between TBI and neuroimaging, are warranted. By understanding neuroimaging correlates of psychiatric symptoms, this work could inform future post-TBI screening and surveillance, preventative efforts, and early interventions to improve neuropsychiatric outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To summarize the application of non-targeted metabolomics in epidemiological studies that assessed metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure.
   Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), nonpregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems.
   Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors.

AB  - Introduction Access to skilled birth attendance has been prioritised as an intervention to minimise burden of maternal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, poor experience of care (EoC) is impeding progress. We conducted a systematic review to holistically explore EoC patterns of facility-based childbirth in SSA. Methods PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases were searched to identify SSA EoC studies conducted between January 2000 and December 2019. Studies meeting our pre-defined inclusion criteria were quality assessed and relevant data extracted. We utilised the EoC quality standards (defined by the World Health Organization) to summarise and analyse findings while highlighting patterns. Results Twenty-two studies of varying quality from 11 SSA countries were included for review. Overall, at least one study from all included countries reported negative EoC in one or more domains of the WHO framework. Across SSA, 'respect and preservation of dignity' was the most reported domain of EoC. While most women deemed the pervasive disrespect as unacceptable, studies in West Africa suggest a "normalisation" of disrespect, if the intent is to save their lives. Women often experienced sub-optimal communication and emotional support with providers in public facilities compared to non-public ones in the region. These experiences had an influence on future institutional deliveries. Discussion Sub-optimal EoC is widespread in SSA, more so in public facilities. As SSA heath systems explore approaches make progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal 3, emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring women in the region have access to both high-quality provision and experience of care.

AB  - Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is a high-density protein in the brain mainly found on outer mitochondrial membranes, primarily in astroglia, but additionally in serotonergic neurons and in the substantia nigra in the midbrain. It is an enzyme that participates in the oxidative metabolism of important monoamines including dopamine, norepinephrine, benzylamine, and phenylethylamine. Elevated MAO-B density may be associated with astrogliosis and inhibiting MAO-B may reduce astrogliosis. MAO-B density is elevated in postmortem sampling of pathology for many neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and alcohol use disorder. Initial development of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents focused on analogs of [C-11]L-deprenyl, with the most commonly applied being the deuterium substituted [C-11]L-deprenyl-D2. This latter radiotracer was modeled with an irreversible trapping compartment reflecting its irreversible binding to MAO-B. Subsequently, [C-11]SL25.1188, a reversible binding MAO-B radioligand with outstanding properties including high specific binding and excellent reversibility was developed. [C-11]SL25.1188 PET was applied to discover a substantive elevation of MAO-B binding in the prefrontal cortex in major depressive disorder (MDD) with an effect size of more than 1.5. Longer duration of MDD was associated with greater MAO-B binding throughout most gray matter regions in the brain, suggesting progressive astrogliosis. Important applications of [C-11]L-deprenyl-D2 PET are detecting a 40% loss in radiotracer accumulation in cigarette smokers, and substantial occupancy of novel therapeutics like EVT301 and sembragiline. Given the number of diseases with elevations of MAO-B density and astrogliosis, and the advance of [C-11]SL25.1188, clinical applications of MAO-B imaging are still at an early stage.

AB  - The association between gestational weight gain (GWG) and postpartum depression (PPD) is still controversial. The present study aimed to assess the association between GWG and the risk of developing PPD by means of a meta-analysis. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disk, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Weipu, and Wanfang database were searched up to May 19, 2021 to identify relevant studies that evaluated the association between GWG and PPD. Meta-analysis was conducted by using RevMan software and Stata software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out to explore the potential heterogeneity source, and Begg's funnel plots and Begg's linear regression test were performed to assess the potential publication bias. A total of sixteen studies involving 100,438 participants were identified in this study. Overall, the total, excessive and inadequate GWG was significantly associated with a higher risk of developing PPD. These results emphasize the necessity of strengthening the prevention and intervention of excessive and inadequate weight gain during pregnancy to promote maternal and infant health. However, further studies on the association between GWG at different stages of pregnancy and the risk of developing PPD are warranted.

AB  - Purpose The rate of female committals to prison has grown rapidly in recent years. Women in prison are likely to have trauma histories and difficulties with their mental health. This paper aims to synthesise the findings of qualitative literature to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of women in the context of prison-based mental health care. Design/methodology/approach A systematic search of five academic databases, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), Excerpta Medica DataBASE (EMBASE) and Medline, was completed in December 2020. This study's search strategy identified 4,615 citations, and seven studies were included for review. Thomas and Harden's (2008) framework for thematic synthesis was used to analyse data. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Qualitative Research (Lockwood et al., 2015). Findings Four analytic themes were identified that detail women's experiences of prison-based mental health care: the type of services accessed and challenges encountered; a reduction in capacity to self-manage mental well-being; the erosion of privacy and dignity; and strained relationships with prison staff. There is a paucity of research conducted with women in the context of prison-based mental health care. The findings suggest there is a need for greater mental health support, including the need to enhance relationships between women and prison staff to promote positive mental health. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review conducted on the experiences of women in the context of prison-based mental health care.

AB  - Objective Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) in pediatric psychology form the foundation for evidence-based treatment and best practices in the field. Relying heavily on continuous outcome measures and group comparisons, questions concerning meaningful clinical change and treatment response rates remain open. This targeted review aimed to provide an initial description of the current state of intervention research in pediatric psychology in terms of attention to meaningful clinical change and efforts to assess and characterize participants in terms of treatment responsivity; Methods Online databases were used to identify a sample of RCT published in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology from 2010 to 2021 using the term "randomized" in the title. Using predefined eligibility and exclusion criteria, 43 studies were identified and analyzed with regard to characteristics of intervention, population, measurement, data reporting, and reference to indicators of clinical significance, meaningful change, treatment responsivity rates, and predictors; Results 26 studies (60%) made no reference at all to meaningful clinical change, treatment response criteria and rates, or characteristics of treatment responders. 15 studies (35%) reported measures of meaningful change in their interpretation of group differences, to calculate sample size, in relation to baseline data only, or in describing a measure. 2 studies (5%) reported criteria for assessing meaningful change to determine individual response rates and characteristics of responders; Conclusions These findings highlight the need for greater emphasis on defining standards and analyzing treatment outcome research in terms of metrics of meaningful change and treatment response in order to better target intervention and optimize limited resources.

AB  - Background: Positive psychosocial factors can play an important role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among them, psychological resilience (PR) is defined as the capacity of responding positively to stressful events. Our aim was to assess whether PR is associated with CVD or metabolic disturbances through a systematic review.
   Methods: We gathered articles from PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar up to October 28, 2021. We included articles that were in English, were observational, and had PR examined as exposure. The CVD outcomes were either clinical or metabolic outcomes (i.e., dyslipidemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and diabetes).
   Results: Our literature search identified 3,800 studies, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria. Of them, seven were longitudinal and 10 cross-sectional, and 13 were on adults and four on children. The exposure assessment was heterogeneous, i.e., 12 studies used different kinds of self-administered questionnaires and five used interviews with a psychologist. Regarding outcomes, five studies investigated CVD, seven obesity, one metabolic syndrome, two hypertension, four dyslipidemia, and four diabetes. In longitudinal studies, PR was found to have an inverse association with included outcomes in five studies from the Swedish military conscription cohort but had no association with CVD in a study on African-American women and was associated with slower progression of diabetes in a general population. The cross-sectional studies showed that the prevalence of disease was not associated with PR in many cases but the progression of disease was associated with PR.
   Conclusion: PR seems to have a possibly favorable association with CVD and metabolic disturbances that differs according to the type of outcome and population. Our study limitations are given by the small number of studies available and the heterogeneity in PR measurement.

AB  - Adolescence and emerging adulthood are often referred to as youth. Transitional psychiatry addresses this target group, which considers patients between 15 and 25 years of age. Substance use usually begins and peaks at this stage of life. Psychiatric disorders, foremost attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and affective disorders, conduct disorders, and first-episodes psychosis frequently appear in early life stages. This review aims to provide a broad overview of transitional-aged youth's most common psychiatric comorbidities with substance use disorders. A literature search was conducted in Embase and Pubmed, and the main findings are described narratively. We present main findings for the following comorbidities: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, personality disorders, affective disorders, psychotic disorders, and the phenomena of overdose and suicidality. In conclusion, co-occurring mental health disorders are common and appear to facilitate the development of substance use disorders and exacerbate their overall course. Substance use also affects the severity and course of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Overall, data on transition-age youth with substance use disorders are highly inconsistent. Universal screening and treatment guidelines do not yet exist but should be aimed for in the future.

AB  - Background Despite the widespread use of psychotropic medications in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there is limited evidence to suggest that psychotropic medications including mood stabilisers are effective in individuals with ASD. Aims To carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of mood stabilisers in people with ASD. Method We searched the following databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, DARE, and ClinicalTrials.gov. In addition, we hand-searched 12 relevant journals. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias and Jadad scores to assess the quality of included RCTs. We carried out a meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Results We included eight RCTs (four on valproate, two on levetiracetam, and one each on lamotrigine and topiramate) that included a total of 310 people with ASD, primarily children. Outcomes were based on core and associated ASD symptoms including irritability and aggression but not bipolar disorder. Only two small studies (25%) from the same group showed definite superiority over placebo and one over psychoeducation alone. Meta-analysis of pooled data on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-irritability, Clinical Global Impression Scale-improvement, and Overt Aggression Scale (OAS)/OAS-modified did not show any significant inter-group difference. The rates of adverse effects did not show any significant inter-group difference. Conclusions Given the methodological flaws in the included studies and the contradictory findings, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusion about the effectiveness of mood stabilisers to treat either ASD core symptoms or associated behaviours. Robust large-scale RCTs are needed in the future to address this issue. PROSPERO registration: CRD42021255467 on 18 May 2021.

AB  - In this review of the central tenets of hope theory, we examine the meta-theoretical, theoretical, and methodological foundations of the literature base. Our analysis moves from a broad examination of the research landscape in hope theory across disciplines, to a deeper investigation of the empirical literature in university students. This review highlights the significant impact of this body of research in advancing our understanding of aspects of thriving characterized by hope. However, we also evidence several limitations that may impede the advancement of the next wave of growth in this field. To address these limitations, we argue for an interdisciplinary approach to expanding the meta-theoretical, theoretical, and methodological horizons, enabling a more dynamic systems approach to the study of hope. Drawing on the intersection of positive psychology with systems thinking, we describe a methodological approach that enables a deeper examination of the processes and interactions through which hope emerges, using an analysis of the lived experience of young people. It is proposed that this research agenda will bring to life an alternate story about the resourcefulness of our youth through their own voice, enabling us to leverage this in the design of more effective strategies to facilitate hope in the future. This research agenda provides a roadmap that will provide alternative methodologies that address the current limitations in the field of hope research and, importantly, can provide fuel to spur on the acceleration of the next wave of research and practice in the field of positive psychology more broadly.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to discuss the European Commission's proposal for a pilot regime for market infrastructures to experiment with the distributed ledger technology (DLT). In this respect, the study comments on the purpose, scope, requirements and attention points for market operators, investment firms and central securities depositories (CSDs) that are considering using this technology. Design/methodology/approach This paper focuses on the proposed rules surrounding the DLT pilot regime. The study is based on an analysis of the proposal, compares it with existing literature and presents the purpose and scope of the regime, followed by a detailed analysis of the proposed requirements. Findings The proposed requirements aim to provide legal certainty, ensure investor protection, support innovation and protect financial stability. The European Commission attempts to reach these goals by establishing uniform requirements for the DLT market infrastructures by means of a European sandbox approach. This study stresses that a level playing field between the various market participants using the technology should be warranted and provides arguments for why the proposal is incomplete in this respect. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, there are no other articles that provide a holistic overview of the proposed regulation and describe the choices that legislators have made so far. This paper will be of interest to all market operators, investment firms and CSDs that have interest in DLT. The study is also of value to their stakeholders, such as their regulators, market participants and their clients, as well as to other linked financial market infrastructures.

AB  - The aim of this integrative review was to examine the impact of past viral epidemics on staff mental health interventional responses, with a specific focus on healthcare provider response in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following PRISMA methodology, databases were searched for relevant articles. A total of 55 articles with a range of methodologies (e.g., commentary papers, cohort studies, qualitative studies) were included to ensure broad coverage of this rapidly emerging research area. The literature showed that many healthcare providers implemented a variety of wellbeing initiatives to support their staff during a viral outbreak. Most of these interventions, however, were not formally evaluated. Interventions included leadership/team support; online psychoeducational resources and updated information on the pandemic; respite spaces; peer support outreach; staff resilience training; telephone hotline support; staff support groups; and individual counseling. Staff were generally supportive of the initiatives offered by hospital and health services, with certain interventions being more appreciated (e.g., staff respite areas). Rapid, locally, and culturally appropriate workplace-based responses may counter the negative mental health impact on staff; but a stepped response is required for a smaller number of staff at risk of mental illness, or those with pre-existing mental illness.

AB  - BackgroundUnemployed persons are at high risk for low health literacy. Most studies addressing health literacy of unemployed persons focus on risk factors for low health literacy or correlates of health literacy, but studies on needs of unemployed persons regarding health literacy are scarce. We aimed to obtain better understanding of health literacy needs of unemployed adults by triangulating the results from a scoping review on health literacy needs in unemployed adults and additional in-depth qualitative interviews. MethodsScoping review: We searched six databases up to January 2021 as well as gray literature for relevant studies following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened independently by two researchers. Qualitative study: Ten participants of a job-reintegration program in Germany were interviewed following a guideline covering topics including health issues of interest to the participants, their sources of health-related information and the barriers/facilitators they experience when accessing health services. ResultsScoping review: After screening 2,966 titles and abstracts, 36 full texts were considered, and five articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four focused on mental health literacy and outcomes, while the fifth assessed information-seeking practices. One additional report on health literacy was identified via the gray literature search. Awareness of one's condition was identified as a facilitator for mental health help-seeking, while fear of harmful effects of medication prevented help-seeking. Qualitative study: Participants were interested in and were generally well-informed about health topics such as nutrition and physical activity. The main challenge perceived was translating the knowledge into practice in daily life. GPs and the social services providers played an important role as a source of health information and advice. Regarding mental health, similar barriers, facilitators and needs were identified through triangulation of findings of the scoping review with those of the interviews. ConclusionsThere is need to address health literacy needs of long-term unemployed persons that go beyond mental health literacy. Public health interventions should not only aim at improving health literacy scores, but also focus on how to help participants translate health literacy into practice. Population groups of interest should also be involved in all processes of designing interventions.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as a therapeutic tool to alleviate symptoms for neurological and psychiatric diseases such as chronic pain, stroke, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, and others. Although the therapeutic potential of rTMS has been widely explored, the neurological basis of its effects is still not fully understood. Fortunately, the continuous development of imaging techniques has advanced our understanding of rTMS neurobiological underpinnings on the healthy and diseased brain. The objective of the current work is to summarize relevant findings from positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques evaluating rTMS effects. We included studies that investigated the modulation of neurotransmission (evaluated with PET and magnetic resonance spectroscopy), brain activity (evaluated with PET), resting-state connectivity (evaluated with resting-state functional MRI), and microstructure (diffusion tensor imaging). Overall, results from imaging studies suggest that the effects of rTMS are complex and involve multiple neurotransmission systems, regions, and networks. The effects of stimulation seem to not only be dependent in the frequency used, but also in the participants characteristics such as disease progression. In patient populations, pre-stimulation evaluation was reported to predict responsiveness to stimulation, while post-stimulation neuroimaging measurements showed to be correlated with symptomatic improvement. These studies demonstrate the complexity of rTMS effects and highlight the relevance of imaging techniques.

AB  - The seagrass phyllosphere consists of a dynamic mosaic of physico-chemical microgradients that modulate light harvesting, gas and nutrient exchange between the photosynthetic leaves and the surrounding water-column. The phyllosphere is thus of vital importance for seagrass growth and fitness. However, unfavorable environmental conditions such as water-column hypoxia, increasing temperature and high nutrient inputs that are predicted to increase in frequency and severity in the Anthropocene, can render the leaf microenvironment into a hostile microhabitat that is challenging or even harmful for the plants-especially if leaves are covered by epiphytic biofilms. Here we summarize effects of epiphytic biofilms on seagrass leaves and discuss how they change and affect the biogeochemical processes and chemical conditions in the seagrass phyllosphere. During night-time, water-column hypoxia can lead to anoxic conditions at the leaf/epiphyte interface, reducing diffusive O-2 supply and thus O-2 availability for plant respiration and transport to below-ground tissues. Furthermore, anoxia in epiphytic biofilms can also enable anaerobic microbial processes that can lead to harmful nitric oxide production via denitrification. Such microenvironmental stress conditions at night-time are exacerbated by increasing temperatures. In the light, the leaf epiphytic biofilm community often results in lower leaf photosynthetic activity and efficiency due to epiphyte-induced shading and a combination of O-2 build-up and CO2 reduction in the phyllosphere owing to thicker total diffusional pathways, phyllosphere basification and epiphytic carbon fixation. Furthermore, absorbed light energy in the epiphytic biofilm can also drive an increase in the leaf surface temperature relative to the surrounding seawater potentially aggravating heating events in the surrounding seawater. In combination, all these above-mentioned diurnal effects of epiphytes result in higher compensation photon irradiance of epiphyte-covered leaves and thus higher light requirements of seagrasses.

AB  - Background There is increasing research examining excess mortality in people with bipolar disorder using life expectancy and related measures, which quantify the disease impact on survival. However, there has been no meta-analysis to date summarising existing data on life expectancy in those with bipolar disorder. Aims To systematically review and quantitatively synthesise estimates of life expectancy and years of potential life lost (YPLL) in people with bipolar disorder. Method We searched Embase, Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases up to 31 March 2021. We generated pooled life expectancy using random-effects models, and derived YPLL summary estimate by calculating averaged values weighted by sample size of individual studies. Subgroup analyses were conducted for gender, geographical region, study period, a given age (set-age) for lifespan estimation and causes of death. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021241705). Results Eleven and 13 studies were included in the review for life expectancy (n = 96 601) and YPLL (n = 128 989), respectively. Pooled life expectancy was 66.88 years (95% CI 64.47-69.28; I-2 = 99.9%, P < 0.001), was higher in women than men (70.51 (95% CI 68.61-72.41) v. 64.59 (95% CI 61.16-68.03); z = 2.00, P = 0.003) and was lowest in Africa. Weighted average YPLL was 12.89 years (95% CI 12.72-13.07), and was greatest in Africa. More YPLL was observed when lifespan was estimated at birth than at other set-age. YPLLs attributable to natural and unnatural deaths were 5.94 years (95% CI 5.81-6.07) and 5.69 years (95% CI 5.59-5.79), respectively. Conclusions Bipolar disorder is associated with substantially shortened life expectancy. Implementation of multilevel, targeted interventions is urgently needed to reduce this mortality gap.

AB  - Background Postpartum anaemia remains a persistent and severe public health issue in many parts of the world. Studies have reported mixed findings on the effects of anaemia during the postpartum period on maternal health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We conducted this systematic review to summarise available evidence to inform public health practitioners on whether 1) anaemia negatively impact maternal health-related quality of life and 2) whether iron supplementation in anaemic women can improve maternal HRQoL during the postpartum period. Methods This review's protocol was registered online with PROSPERO (CRD42020206618). We extensively searched Embase, PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus through the HINARI website to identify studies that reported either association or effect of postpartum anaemia on fatigue, depression and mother-child interaction. We restricted our search to studies of human females published in English language from databases inception until August 2020. We followed a Cochrane guideline for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis to synthesise data. Results Twenty-seven studies were included in this systematic review, with some reporting all three domains (fatigue, depression and mother-child interaction) of HRQoL. Seven observational studies with pooled dichotomous outcomes showed that iron deficient or anaemic women were 1.66 times more likely to experience symptoms of depression than non-anaemic or iron-replete women [RR = 1.66 (95% CI: 1.28; 2.16), I-2 = 67.0%, P < 0.01]. In three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), pooled continuous data showed statistically significant reduction in fatigue scores in women who received iron supplementation than the control group [MD: -1.85 (95% CI: -3.04; -0.67), I-2 = 65.0%, p < 0.06]. Two of the four included studies showed that anaemic mothers were less responsive and had negative feelings towards their children than non-anaemic mothers. Conclusion Evidence from this review suggests that postpartum anaemia negatively affects health-related quality of life and that iron replenishment improves both symptoms of fatigue and depression. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether postpartum anaemia affects mother-child interaction.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease usually caused by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and other etiologies. Recent studies have found that the cannabinoid system present in the basal ganglia has a strong influence on the progression of PD. Altering the cannabinoid receptor activation status by modulating endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) levels can exert an anti-movement disorder effect. Therefore, the development of drugs that modulate the endocannabinoid system may be a novel strategy for the treatment of PD. However, eCB regulation is complex, with diverse cannabinoid receptor functions and the presence of dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and gamma-aminobutyric signals interacting with cannabinoid signaling in the basal ganglia region. Therefore, the study of eCB is challenging. Here, we have described the function of the cannabinoid system in the basal ganglia and its association with PD in three parts (eCBs, cannabinoid receptors, and factors regulating the cannabinoid metabolism) and summarized the mechanisms of action related to the cannabinoid analogs currently aimed at treating PD. The shortcomings identified from previous studies and the directions that should be explored in the future will provide insights into new approaches and ideas for the future development of cannabinoid-based drugs and the treatment of PD.

AB  - BACKGROUND Catatonia is a complex psychomotor syndrome that often goes unrecognized and untreated, even though its classification has evolved in recent years. Prompt and correct identification of catatonia allows for highly effective treatment and prevention of possible complications. The underrecognition of catatonia in older patients is also frequent, and research in this population is scarce. AIM To conduct a systematic review of the literature on catatonia in older people to ascertain its clinical characteristics across settings. METHODS Following the PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to December 2021, with a strategy aimed at identifying all articles published on catatonia in older adults. Titles and abstracts were scanned and selected independently by two authors. Papers investigating issues related to catatonia and/or catatonic symptoms in older people, with English abstracts available, were included. References of selected articles were revised to identify other relevant studies. RESULTS In total, 1355 articles were retrieved. After removing duplicates, 879 remained. Of the 879 identified abstracts, 669 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 210 articles underwent full text review, and 51 were eliminated for various reasons. Fourteen more articles were selected from the references. Overall, 173 articles were reviewed: 108 case reports, 35 case series, 11 prospective cohort studies, 6 case-control studies, 3 retrospective cohort studies and 10 reviews. We found several particular aspects of catatonia in this population. Catatonia in older patients is highly prevalent and tends to have a multifactorial etiology. Older patients, compared to younger patients, have a higher risk of developing catatonia with benzodiazepine (BZD) withdrawal, in bipolar disorder, and in the general hospital. Age, together with other risk factors, was significantly associated with the incidence of deep venous thrombosis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome poor outcome, other complications and mortality. Treatment with BZDs and electrocon-vulsive therapy is safe and effective. Prompt treatment of its cause is essential to ensure a good prognosis. CONCLUSION Catatonia in older patients is highly prevalent and tends to have a multifactorial etiology. The risk of developing catatonia in some settings and conditions, as well as of developing complications, is high in this population. Symptomatic treatment is safe and effective, and timely etiologic treatment is fundamental

AB  - The major challenge facing Sfax, the second-largest city in Tunisia, is how to shift successfully and smoothly toward green and innovative sustainable development. Indeed, Sfax is traumatized by more than a half-century of irrelevant environmental choices and, at the same time, it aspires to take advantage of the national circumstances in multiple transitions, driven by a real desire to get rid of a stressful environmental heritage. Therefore, its struggle with the transition to an efficient and ecofriendly economy will not be simple. Within this context, a group of researchers from various scientific backgrounds from Sfax University have joined their efforts and went through more than 270 previously published documents over the past three decades aiming to revive the concept of environmental integration in Sfax. These scholars, although belonging to different scientific fields, succeeded in synthesizing the latest scientific works related to the region dealing with local environmental components and threats, water resources, wastewater handling, solid waste management, urban development, and infrastructure. An outcome on the current status of this modern traumatized city and an assessment of several local technological advances of the region, as well as a thorough investigation of the various dedicated reconciliation plans were drawn. Further, it was possible to sketch a double entry matrix showing the various affected zones and potential environmental risks that should be considered. Scores were assigned to the affected zones to assess the incurred danger and propose possible remedies. This paper provides a holistic view of the complex environmental systems in Sfax, and demonstrates how efforts of local, regional, and national authorities can address the environmental challenges. This review is intended to fairly highlight the environmental problems in the city, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the re-conversion of the city into a competitive and sustainable Mediterranean metropolis city, in accordance with the Barcelona Convention.

AB  - Human faces are one of the most prominent stimuli in the visual environment of young infants and convey critical information for the development of social cognition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mask wearing has become a common practice outside the home environment. With masks covering nose and mouth regions, the facial cues available to the infant are impoverished. The impact of these changes on development is unknown but is critical to debates around mask mandates in early childhood settings. As infants grow, they increasingly interact with a broader range of familiar and unfamiliar people outside the home; in these settings, mask wearing could possibly influence social development. In order to generate hypotheses about the effects of mask wearing on infant social development, in the present work, we systematically review N = 129 studies selected based on the most recent PRISMA guidelines providing a state-of-the-art framework of behavioral studies investigating face processing in early infancy. We focused on identifying sensitive periods during which being exposed to specific facial features or to the entire face configuration has been found to be important for the development of perceptive and socio-communicative skills. For perceptive skills, infants gradually learn to analyze the eyes or the gaze direction within the context of the entire face configuration. This contributes to identity recognition as well as emotional expression discrimination. For socio-communicative skills, direct gaze and emotional facial expressions are crucial for attention engagement while eye-gaze cuing is important for joint attention. Moreover, attention to the mouth is particularly relevant for speech learning. We discuss possible implications of the exposure to masked faces for developmental needs and functions. Providing groundwork for further research, we encourage the investigation of the consequences of mask wearing for infants' perceptive and socio-communicative development, suggesting new directions within the research field.

AB  - Recent conceptualizations of interoception suggest several facets to this construct, including "interoceptive sensibility" and "self-report interoceptive scales", both of which are assessed with questionnaires. Although these conceptual efforts have helped move the field forward, uncertainty remains regarding whether current measures converge on their measurement of a common construct. To address this question, we first identified -via a systematic review- the most cited questionnaires of interoceptive sensibility. Then, we examined their correlations, their overall factorial structure, and their network structure in a large community sample (n = 1003). The results indicate that these questionnaires tap onto distinct constructs, with low overall convergence and interrelationships between questionnaire items. This observation mitigates the interpretation and replicability of findings in self-report interoception research. We call for a better match between constructs and measures.

AB  - Stigma can have devastating health and wellbeing impacts, not just on people with mental health problems, but on people associated with the stigmatized person. This is called stigma-by-association. Children whose parents have mental health problems are a particularly vulnerable group, and stigma acts as a mechanism, contributing to the transgenerational transmission of mental disorders. The current study is a systematic mixed studies review, synthesizing knowledge about how this group of children experience stigma-by-association. Overall, 32 studies were included, after a systematic search including quantitative, qualitatative, and mixed methods studies. The methodological quality was assessed and qualitative content analysis undertaken. We grouped children's stigma experiences into four dimensions, i.e., experienced stigma, anticipated stigma, internalized stigma, and structural discrimination. Results show that stigma is an important factor in those children's lives, and needs further investigation in qualitative and quantitative research. The current study emphasizes the importance of anti-stigma interventions and campaigns.

AB  - This article reviews the nano-effects and applications of different crystalline nano-titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2), iden-tifies their discharge, distribution, behavior, and toxicity to aquatic organisms (focusing on microbial aggregates) in sewage and surface-water, summarizes related toxicity mechanisms, and critically proposes future perspectives. The results show that: 1) based on crystal type, application boundaries of nano-TiO2 have become clear, extending from traditional manufacturing to high-tech fields; 2) concentration of nano-TiO2 in water is as high as hundreds of thou-sands of mu g/L (sewage) or several to dozens of mu g/L (surface-water) due to direct application or indirect release; 3) water environmental behaviors of nano-TiO2 are mainly controlled by hydration conditions and particle character-istics; 4) aquatic toxicities of nano-TiO2 are closely related to their water environmental behavior, in which crystal type and tested species (such as single species and microbial aggregates) also play the key role. Going forward, the explo-ration of the toxicity mechanism will surely become a hot topic in the aquatic-toxicology of nano-TiO2, because most of the research so far has focused on the responses of biological indicators (such as metabolism and damage), while little is known about the stress imprint caused by the crystal structures of nano-TiO2 in water environments. Additionally, the aging of nano-TiO2 in a water environment should be heeded to because the continuously changing surface structure is bound to have a significant impact on its behavior and toxicity. Moreover, for microbial aggregates, comprehensive response analysis should be conducted in terms of the functional activity, surface features, composition structure, internal microenvironment, cellular and molecular level changes, etc., to find the key point of the interaction between nano-TiO2 and microbial aggregates, and to take mitigation or beneficial measures to deal with the aquatic-toxicity of nano-TiO2. In short, this article contributes by 1) reviewing the research status of nano-TiO2 in all aspects: application and discharge, distribution and behavior, and its aquatic toxicity; 2) suggesting the response mechanism of microbial aggregates and putting forward the toxigenic mechanism of nanomaterial structure; 3) pointing out the fu-ture research direction of nano-TiO2 in water environment.

AB  - Background By explaining the development of health inequalities, eco-social theories highlight the importance of social environments that children are embedded in. The most important environment during early childhood is the family, as it profoundly influences children's health through various characteristics. These include family processes, family structure/size, and living conditions, and are closely linked to the socioeconomic position (SEP) of the family. Although it is known that the SEP contributes to health inequalities in early childhood, the effects of family characteristics on health inequalities remain unclear. The objective of this scoping review is to synthesise existing research on the mediating and moderating effects of family characteristics on socioeconomic health inequalities (HI) during early childhood in high-income countries. Methods This review followed the methodology of "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews". To identify German and English scientific peer-reviewed literature published from January 1(st), 2000, to December 19(th), 2019, the following search term blocks were linked with the logical operator "AND": (1) family structure/size, processes, living conditions, (2) inequalities, disparities, diversities, (3) income, education, occupation, (4) health and (5) young children. The search covered the electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Results The search yielded 7,089 records. After title/abstract and full-text screening, only ten peer-reviewed articles were included in the synthesis, which analysed the effects of family characteristics on HI in early childhood. Family processes (i.e., rules /descriptive norms, stress, parental screen time, parent-child conflicts) are identified to have mediating or moderating effects. While families' living conditions (i.e., TVs in children's bedrooms) are suggested as mediating factors, family structure/size (i.e., single parenthood, number of children in the household) appear to moderate health inequalities. Conclusion Family characteristics contribute to health inequalities in early childhood. The results provide overall support of models of family stress and family investment. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the role of family health literacy, regarding a wide range of children's health outcomes (e.g., oral health, inflammation parameters, weight, and height), and the development of health inequalities over the life course starting at birth.

AB  - Surgical expertise does not have a clear definition and is often culturally associated with power, authority, prestige, and case number rather than more objective proxies of excellence. Multiple models of expertise progression have been proposed including the Dreyfus model, however, they all currently require subjective evaluation of skill. Recently, efforts have been made to improve the ways in which surgical excellence is measured and expertise is defined using artificial intelligence, video recordings, and accelerometers. However, these aforementioned methods of assessment are still subjective or indirect proxies of expertise, thus uncovering the neural mechanisms that differentiate expert surgeons from trainees may enhance the objectivity of surgical expertise validation. In fact, some researchers have already suggested that their neural imaging-based expertise classification methods outperform currently used methods of surgical skill certification such as the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) scores. Such imaging biomarkers would not only help better identify the highest performing surgeons, but could also improve residency programs by providing more objective, evidence-based feedback and developmental milestones for those in training and perhaps act as a marker of surgical potential in medical students. Despite the potential advantages of using neural imaging in the assessment of surgical expertise, this field of research remains in its infancy. This systematic review identifies studies that have applied neuromonitoring in assessing surgical skill across levels of expertise. The goals of this review are to identify (1) the strongest neural indicators of surgical expertise, (2) the limitations of the current literature on this subject, (3) the most sensible future directions for further study. We found substantial evidence that surgical expertise can be delineated by differential activation and connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) across multiple task and neuroimaging modalities. Specifically, novices tend to have greater PFC activation than experts under standard conditions in bimanual and decision-making tasks. However, under high temporal demand tasks, experts had increased PFC activation whereas novices had decreased PFC activation. Common limitations uncovered in this review were that task difficulty was often insufficient to delineate between residents and attending. Moreover, attending level involvement was also low in multiple studies which may also have contributed to this issue. Most studies did not analyze the ability of their neuromonitoring findings to accurately classify subjects by level of expertise. Finally, the predominance of fNIRS as the neuromonitoring modality limits our ability to uncover the neural correlates of surgical expertise in non-cortical brain regions. Future studies should first strive to address these limitations. In the longer term, longitudinal within-subjects design over the course of a residency or even a career will also advance the field. Although logistically arduous, such studies would likely be most beneficial in demonstrating effects of increasing surgical expertise on regional brain activation and inter-region connectivity.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Combining antidepressants is frequently done in the treatment of acute depression, but studies have yielded conflicting results.
   OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy. Combinations using presynaptic alpha 2-autoreceptor antagonists or bupropion were investigated separately.
   DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from each database inception through January 2020.
   STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing combinations of antidepressants with antidepressant monotherapy in adult patients with acute depression were included.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Following guidelines from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and recommendations from the Cochrane Handbook, 2 reviewers independently performed a literature search, study selection, data extraction, and evaluation of risk of bias. Data were pooled in random-effects analyses.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was efficacy measured as standardized mean difference (SMD); secondary outcomes were response, remission, change from baseline in rating scale scores, number of dropouts, and number of dropouts due to adverse events.
   RESULTS Thirty-nine RCTs including 6751 patients were eligible. Combination treatment was statistically significantly associated with superior treatment outcomes relative to monotherapy (SMD = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.19-0.44). Combining a reuptake inhibitor with an antagonist of presynaptic a2-autoreceptors was superior to other combinations (SMD = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.55). Bupropion combinations were not superior to monotherapy (SMD = 0.10; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.27). Numbers of dropouts and dropouts due to adverse events did not differ between treatments. Studies were heterogeneous, and there was indication of publication bias (Egger test result was positive; P = .007, df = 36), but results remained robust across prespecified secondary outcomes and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including analyses restricted to studies with low risk of bias.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis of RCTs comparing combinations of antidepressants with antidepressant monotherapy, combining antidepressants was associated with superior treatment outcomes but not with more patients dropping out of treatment. Combinations using an antagonist of presynaptic alpha 2-autoreceptors may be preferable and may be applied as a first-line treatment in severe cases of depression and for patients considered nonresponders.

AB  - Electromagnetic field oscillations produced by the brain are increasingly being viewed as causal drivers of consciousness. Recent research has highlighted the importance of the body's various endogenous rhythms in organizing these brain-generated fields through various types of entrainment. We expand this approach by examining evidence of extracerebral shared oscillations between the brain and other parts of the body, in both humans and animals. We then examine the degree to which these data support one of General Resonance Theory's (GRT) principles: the Slowest Shared Resonance (SSR) principle, which states that the combination of micro- to macro-consciousness in coupled field systems is a function of the slowest common denominator frequency or resonance. This principle may be utilized to develop a spatiotemporal hierarchy of brain-body shared resonance systems. It is predicted that a system's SSR decreases with distance between the brain and various resonating structures in the body. The various resonance relationships examined, including between the brain and gastric neurons, brain and sensory organs, and brain and spinal cord, generally match the predicted SSR relationships, empirically supporting this principle of GRT.

AB  - The etiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) is multifactorial, and both genetics and environmental exposures are risk factors. While mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) that are associated with increased kinase activity are the most common cause of autosomal dominant PD, the role of LRRK2 in iPD, independent of mutations, remains uncertain. In this review, we discuss how the architecture of LRRK2 influences kinase activation and how enhanced LRRK2 substrate phosphorylation might contribute to pathogenesis. We describe how oxidative stress and endolysosomal dysfunction, both of which occur in iPD, can activate non-mutated LRRK2 to a similar degree as pathogenic mutations. Similarly, environmental toxicants that are linked epidemiologically to iPD risk can also activate LRRK2. In aggregate, current evidence suggests an important role for LRRK2 in iPD.

AB  - The intensity of marine heatwaves is increasing due to climate change. Heatwaves may affect macroinvertebrates' bioturbating behavior in intertidal areas, thereby altering the deposition-erosion balance at tidal flats. Moreover, small-scale topographic features on tidal flats can create tidal pools during the low tide, thus changing the heat capacity of tidal flats. These pools could then potentially operate as refuge environments during marine heatwaves. We studied behavior responses to heat waves using the well-known bioturbating cockle Cerastoderma edule as a model species. Different temperature regimes (i.e., fluctuating between 20 and 40 degrees C) and micro-topographies (i.e., presence vs. absence of tidal water pools) were mimicked in a mesocosm experiment with regular tidal regimes. Our results demonstrate that behavioral responses to heat stress strongly depend on the site-specific morphological features. Cockles covered by shallow water pools moved up when exposed to thermal stress, while burrowing deeper into the sediment in the absence of water pools. But in both cases, their migratory behavior increased under heat stress compared to regular ambient treatments. Moreover, long-term cumulative heat stress increased cockles' respiration rates and decreased their health conditions, causing mass mortality after four weeks of gradually increasing heat exposure. Overall, the present findings provide the first insights into how bioturbating behavior on tidal flats may change in response to global warming.

AB  - In the field of adolescent development, the language, theoretical frameworks, methods for collecting and analyzing data, and ways of interpretation that researchers use may advance notions of white supremacy and perpetuate racist ideas. Understanding how researchers study Black girls and women, in particular, is a critical step in working toward the production of science and knowledge that promotes an anti-racist and anti-sexist agenda and centers the voices of historically marginalized adolescents. Accordingly, we engaged in a systematic review (k = 48) with the goal of taking a critical look at how researchers study Black girls and women. Our synthesis of empirical articles from four prominent adolescent research journals published between 2010 and 2020 revealed themes related to (a) a dearth of critical theoretical frameworks, (b) a lack of acknowledgment of the intersectional experiences of Black girls and women, (c) differences in how researchers incorporate ethnic/racial information, (d) the use of a deficit perspective, and (e) the dominance of quantitative designs. We discuss these themes and conclude with recommendations for incorporating critical frameworks and more varied methodologies, issuing a call for adolescent development scholars to take a deeper, asset-based, and more critical approach to studying Black girls and their development.

AB  - Approximately a third of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience significant irritability; despite this, no study has reviewed whether interventions for youth with ADHD can improve irritability. This mini review sought to address this gap in the literature by discussing existing pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for irritability among children and adolescents with ADHD. A literature search was conducted in April 2021, with a total of 12 intervention articles identified (six pharmacological, one psychosocial, five combined). Studies were excluded if they did not involve an intervention, a measure of irritability, or the population was not youth with ADHD. Of these articles, two were with an ADHD only sample; seven included ADHD with comorbid disruptive behavior, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), or severe mood dysregulation (SMD); and three included ADHD with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Findings suggest that central nervous system stimulants used alone or in combination with behavior therapy are effective at reducing irritability in youth with ADHD only or comorbid ADHD and DMDD/SMD. Less evidence was found for the efficacy of guanfacine and atomoxetine for youth with ADHD only or comorbid ADHD and ASD. Parent training alone or in combination with atomoxetine was found to be effective at reducing irritability in youth with comorbid ADHD and ASD. Future research assessing the efficacy of other psychosocial interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy is necessary, as are randomized trials assessing intervention sequencing and intensity among youth with ADHD. Researchers are advised to utilize well-validated measures of irritability in future research.

AB  - Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) are one of the most frequent genetic causes of both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Mounting evidence has demonstrated pathological similarities between LRRK2-associated PD (LRRK2-PD) and sporadic PD, suggesting that LRRK2 is a potential disease modulator and a therapeutic target in PD. LRRK2 mutant knock-in (KI) mouse models display subtle alterations in pathological aspects that mirror early-stage PD, including increased susceptibility of nigrostriatal neurotransmission, development of motor and non-motor symptoms, mitochondrial and autophagy-lysosomal defects and synucleinopathies. This review provides a rationale for the use of LRRK2 KI mice to investigate the LRRK2-mediated pathogenesis of PD and implications from current findings from different LRRK2 KI mouse models, and ultimately discusses the therapeutic potentials against LRRK2-associated pathologies in PD.

AB  - Background: Child marriage, defined as marriage before 18 years of age, is a violation of human rights and a marker of gender inequality. Growing attention to this issue on the global development agenda also reflects concerns that it may negatively impact health. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize existing research on the consequences of child marriage on health and to assess the risk of bias in this body of literature.
   Methods and findings: We searched databases focused on biomedicine and global health for studies that estimated the effect of marrying before the age of 18 on any physical or mental health outcome or health behaviour. We identified 58 eligible articles, nearly all of which relied on cross-sectional data sources from sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia. The most studied health outcomes were indicators of fertility and fertility control, maternal health care, and intimate partner violence. All studies were at serious to critical risk of bias. Research consistently found that women who marry before the age of 18 begin having children at earlier ages and give birth to a larger number of children when compared to those who marry at 18 or later, but whether these outcomes were desired was not considered. Across studies, women who married as children were also consistently less likely to give birth in health care facilities or with assistance from skilled providers. Studies also uniformly concluded that child marriage increases the likelihood of experiencing physical violence from an intimate partner. However, research in many other domains, including use of contraception, unwanted pregnancy, and sexual violence came to divergent conclusions and challenge some common narratives regarding child marriage.
   Conclusions: There are many reasons to be concerned about child marriage. However, evidence that child marriage causes the health outcomes described in this review is severely limited. There is more heterogeneity in the results of these studies than is often recognized. For these reasons, greater caution is warranted when discussing the potential impact of child marriage on health. We provide suggestions for avoiding common biases and improving the strength of the evidence on this subject.

AB  - With the ever-increasing global population and industrialization, it has become a call of the hour to start taking care of the environment to balance the ecosystem. For this, effective monitoring and assessment are required, which involves collecting and measuring environmental details, temporal and spatial readings of environmental data, and parameters. However, assessment of the environment is very tedious as it includes monitoring target analytes, identifying their sources, and reporting, which invariably implies that detailed environmental moni-toring would be an intricate and expensive process. The traditional protocols in environmental measures are often manual and time demanding, which makes it further difficult. Moreover, several changes also occur within the environment, which could be chemical, physical, or biological, and since these environmental impacts are often cumulative, it becomes difficult to measure an isolated system. Furthermore, the chances of skipping significant results and trends become high. Also, experimental data obtained from the environmental analysis are usually non-linear and multi-variant due to different associations among various contributing variables. Therefore, it is implied that accurate measurements and environment monitoring are not using traditional analytical protocols. Thus, the need for a chemometric approach in environmental pollution analysis becomes paramount due to the inherent limitations associated with the conventional approach of analyzing environ-mental datasets. Chemometrics has appeared as a potential technique, which enhances the particulars of the chemical datasets by using statistical and mathematical analysis methods to analyze chemical data beyond univariate analysis. Utilizing chemometrics to study the environmental data is a revolutionary idea as it helps identify the relationship between sources of contaminations, environmental drivers, and their impact on the environment. Hence, this review critically explores the concept of chemometrics and its application in envi-ronmental pollution analysis by briefly highlighting the idea of chemometrics, its types, applications, advantages, and limitations in the environmental domain. An attempt is also made to present future trends in applications of chemometrics in environmental pollution analysis.

AB  - In contrast to marine ecosystems, the toxicity impact of microplastics in freshwater environments is poorly understood. This contribution reviews the literature on the range of effects of microplastics across and between trophic levels within the freshwater environment, including biofilms, macrophytes, phytoplankton, invertebrates, fish and amphibians. While there is supporting evidence for toxicity in some species e.g. growth reduction for photoautotrophs, increased mortality for some invertebrates, genetic changes in amphibians, and cell internalization of microplastics and nanoplastics in fish; other studies show that it is uncertain whether microplastics can have detrimental long-term impacts on ecosystems. Some taxa have yet to be studied e.g. benthic diatoms, while only 12% of publications on microplastics in freshwater, demonstrate trophic transfer in foodwebs. The fact that just 2% of publications focus on microplastics colonized by biofilms is hugely concerning given the cascading detrimental effects this could have on freshwater ecosystem function. Multiple additional stressors including environmental change (temperature rises and invasive species) and contaminants of anthropogenic origin (antibiotics, metals, pesticides and endocrine disruptors) will likely exacerbate negative interactions between microplastics and freshwater organisms, with potentially significant damaging consequences to freshwater ecosystems and foodwebs.

The research was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, CINHAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science, without restrictions of language and year of publication. The search process identified 833 publications matching the search criteria, and after the review process, 40 articles were included. Family is a central aspect of Confucianism, and it seems to affect participation in medical decisions, taking care of relatives, ethical dilemmas and mental health problems. Although most Confucianist influence seems to be positive, some ways of thinking could increase suffering, burnout and a delay in healthcare seeking. Understanding these values could help health professionals to deal with the growing contingent of patients with different cultures and religious beliefs.

AB  - With increasing technological developments, exposure to non-ionizing radiations has become unavoidable as people cannot escape from electromagnetic field sources, such as Wi-Fi, electric wires, microwave oven, radio, telecommunication, bluetooth devices, etc. These radiations can be associated with increased health problems of the users. This review aims to determine the effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiations on female fertility. To date, several in vitro and in vivo studies unveiled that exposure to non-ionizing radiations brings about harmful effects on oocytes, ovarian follicles, endometrial tissue, estrous cycle, reproductive endocrine hormones, developing embryo, and fetal development in animal models. Non-ionizing radiation also upsurges the free radical load in the uterus and ovary, which leads to inhibition of cell growth and DNA disruptions. In conclusion, non-ionizing electromagnetic radiations can cause alterations in both germ cells as well as in their nourishing environment and also affect other female reproductive parameters that might lead to infertility.

It is one of the most effective in-store marketing tactics which can directly influence customer decisions to boost store sales and profitability. The recent development of Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially with its sub-fields in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, has enabled retail stores to take advantage of existing CCTV infrastructure to extract in-store customer and business insights. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive review on existing approaches in store layout design and modern AI techniques that can be utilized in the layout design task. Based on this review, we propose an AI-powered store layout design framework. This framework applies advanced AI and data analysis techniques on top of existing CCTV video surveillance infrastructure to understand, predict and suggest a better store layout.

AB  - As life expectancy increases for Indigenous populations, so does the number of older adults with complex, chronic health conditions and age-related geriatric syndromes. Many of these conditions are associated with modifiable lifestyle factors that, if addressed, may improve the health and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples as they age. If models of healthy aging are to be promoted within health services, a clearer understanding of what aging well means for Indigenous peoples is needed. Indigenous peoples hold a holistic worldview of health and aging that likely differs from Western models. The aims of this review were to: investigate the literature that exists and where the gaps are, on aging well for Indigenous peoples; assess the quality of the existing literature on Indigenous aging; identify the domains of aging well for Indigenous peoples; and identify the enablers and barriers to aging well for Indigenous peoples. A systematic search of online databases, book chapters, gray literature, and websites identified 32 eligible publications on Indigenous aging. Reflexive thematic analysis identified four major themes on aging well: (1) achieving holistic health and wellbeing; (2) maintaining connections; (3) revealing resilience, humor, and a positive attitude; and (4) facing the challenges. Findings revealed that aging well is a holistic concept enabled by spiritual, physical, and mental wellbeing and where reliance on connections to person, place, and culture is central. Participants who demonstrated aging well took personal responsibility, adapted to change, took a positive attitude to life, and showed resilience. Conversely, barriers to aging well arose from the social determinants of health such as lack of access to housing, transport, and adequate nutrition. Furthermore, the impacts of colonization such as loss of language and culture and ongoing grief and trauma all challenged the ability to age well. Knowing what aging well means for Indigenous communities can facilitate health services to provide culturally appropriate and effective care.

AB  - Background Floods have affected 2.3 billion people worldwide in the last 20 years, and are associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes. Climate change is projected to increase the number of people exposed to floods due to more variable precipitation and rising sea levels. Vulnerability to floods is highly dependent on economic wellbeing and other societal factors. Therefore, this systematic review synthesizes the evidence on health effects of flood exposure among the population of sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We systematically searched two databases, Web of Science and PubMed, to find published articles. We included studies that (1) were published in English from 2010 onwards, (2) presented associations between flood exposure and health indicators, (3) focused on sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) relied on a controlled study design, such as cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, or quasi-experimental approaches with a suitable comparator, for instance individuals who were not exposed to or affected by floods or individuals prior to experiencing a flood. Results Out of 2306 screened records, ten studies met our eligibility criteria. We included studies that reported the impact of floods on water-borne diseases (n = 1), vector-borne diseases (n = 8) and zoonotic diseases (n = 1). Five of the ten studies assessed the connection between flood exposure and malaria. One of these five evaluated the impact of flood exposure on malaria co-infections. The five non-malaria studies focused on cholera, scabies, taeniasis, Rhodesian sleeping sickness, alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Nine of the ten studies reported significant increases in disease susceptibility after flood exposure. Conclusion The majority of included studies of the aftermath of floods pointed to an increased risk of infection with cholera, scabies, taeniasis, Rhodesian sleeping sickness, malaria, alphaviruses and flaviviruses. However, long-term health effects, specifically on mental health, non-communicable diseases and pregnancy, remain understudied. Further research is urgently needed to improve our understanding of the health risks associated with floods, which will inform public policies to prevent and reduce flood-related health risks.

Tooth loss can also accelerate nerve damage and neurodegeneration. However, the associated mechanisms remain poorly understood.Objective:& nbsp;To conduct a systematic review of animal experiments on cognitive decline caused by the loss of occlusal support performed over the past 10 years and summarize the possible underlying mechanisms.Methods:& nbsp; "Tooth Loss, " "Edentulous, " "Tooth Extraction and Memory Loss, " "Cognition Impairment, " and "Dementia " were used as keywords to search PubMed, Embase, SCI, ScienceDirect, and OpenGrey. A total of 1,317 related articles from 2010 to 2021 were retrieved, 26 of which were included in the review after screening according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Comprehensiveness was evaluated using ARRIVE guidelines and the risk of bias was assessed using SYCLE'S risk of bias tool.Results:& nbsp;The putative mechanisms underlying the cognitive impairment resulting from the loss of occlusal support are as follows: (1) The mechanical pathway, whereby tooth loss leads to masticatory motor system functional disorders. Masticatory organ activity and cerebral blood flow decrease. With reduced afferent stimulation of peripheral receptors (such as in the periodontal membrane) the strength of the connections between neural pathways is decreased, and the corresponding brain regions degenerate; (2) the aggravation pathway, in which tooth loss aggravates existing neurodegenerative changes. Tooth loss can accelerates nerve damage through apoptosis and mitochondrial autophagy, increases amyloid deposition in the brain; and (3) the long-term inflammatory stress pathway, which involves metabolic disorders, microbial-gut-brain axis, the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and inflammatory cascade effect in central nervous system.Conclusion:& nbsp;The loss of occlusal support may lead to cognitive dysfunction through the reduction of chewing-related stimuli, aggravation of nerve damage, and long-term inflammatory stress.

AB  - Objectives. - Sociocultural factors in the aftermath of any pandemic can play a role in increasing suicidal behavior like suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, or suicide. The authors discuss the risk and predisposing factors for suicidal ideation among mental health patients in four developing countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India and Pakistan), this aims to grasp the heterogeneity of these motivators and to elaborate specific interventions regarding suicide in the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods. - We searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar through March, 2021 for articles using a combination of the keywords and generic terms for suicide, suicide ideation, COVID-19, developing countries, low-middle-income countries, Sociocultural factors, Suicidal behavior, predisposing factors and predictive factors, for articles in English language only, and without publication time restriction.
   Results. - This narrative review summarizes the sociocultural risk and predisposing factors for suicidal behavior in developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings reveal those factors such as fear of being infected, growing economic pressure, lack of resources due to lockdown are mostly responsible in the four countries for the current increase in suicides. There are a few cultural differences that are specified in the narrative.
   Conclusion. - The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health challenge, in which prevention and intervention of suicidal behavior have been suboptimal, especially in low-middle-income countries. Based on literature results, we provide practical suggestions (e.g., reducing infodemic, specialized helplines, improving mental health services availability) in order to tackle main challenges of suicide prevention, such as lack of adequate manpower, fragile health system and poverty.

AB  - Background: Investigations have revealed the association between inflammation and post-stroke depression (PSD). However, whether the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, a biomarker of inflammation, would affect the development of PSD is still controversial. Methods: A systematic search of databases was performed for eligible studies. Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) with 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) was used to assess the association between the CRP level in the acute phase of stroke and the risk of PSD. Results: 13 cohort studies that involved 3536 participants were included. Combined results showed that compared with non-PSD patients, the CRP level of PSD patients was significantly higher on admission (SMD = 0.19, 95 % CI: 0.12-0.27). A subgroup analysis by classifying the assessment time of depression showed obvious differences of the CRP levels between the PSD patients who were diagnosed more than 1 month after stroke and the non-PSD (1-3 months: SMD = 0.16, 95 % CI: 0.06-0.25; >3months: SMD = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.18-0.51). Conclusion: A higher level of CRP in the acute phase of stroke suggests an increased risk for PSD.

AB  - More than thirty years of medical treatment with the use of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has shown that this therapeutic procedure works in a number of homeostatic disturbances. Although the clinical usage of VNS has a long history, our knowledge about the central mechanisms underlying this treatment is still limited. In the present paper we review the effects of VNS on brain oscillations as a possible electrophysiological bio-marker of VNS efficacy. The review was prepared mainly on the basis of data delivered from clinical observa-tions and the outcomes of electrophysiological experiments conducted on laboratory animals that are available in PubMed. We consciously did not focus on epileptiform activity understood as a pathologic oscillatory activity, which was widely discussed in the numerous previously published reviews. The main conclusion of the present paper is that further, well-designed experiments on laboratory animals are absolutely necessary to address the electrophysiological issues. These will fill a number of gaps in our present knowledge of the central mechanisms underlying VNS therapy. (c) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The contents of this review are thus arranged into the following sections. First, we describe basic research findings that have been made using CLNS. Next, we provide an overview of the application, rationale, and therapeutic aspects of CLNM for clinical purposes. Finally, we summarize methodological concerns and critics in clinical practice of neurofeedback and novel applications of closed-loop perspective and techniques to improve and optimize its experiments. Moreover, we outline the theoretical explanations and experimental ideas to test animal models of neurofeedback and discuss technical issues and challenges associated with implementing closed-loop systems. We hope this review is helpful for both basic neuroscientists and clinical/ translationally-oriented scientists interested in applying closed-loop methods to improve mental health and well-being.

AB  - Background During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, states were called upon by the World Health Organization to introduce and prioritise the collection of sex-disaggregated data. The collection of sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19 testing, infection rates, hospital admissions, and deaths, when available, has informed our understanding of the biology of the infectious disease. The collection of sex-disaggregated data should also better inform our understanding of the gendered impacts that contribute to risk of exposure to COVID-19. In China, the country with the longest history of fighting the COVID-19 infection, what research was available on the gender-differential impacts of COVID-19 in the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic? Methods In this scoping review, we examine the first 6 months (January-June 2020) of peer-reviewed publications (n = 451) on sex and gender experiences related to COVID-19 in China. We conducted an exhaustive search of published Chinese and English language research papers on COVID-19 in mainland China. We used a COVID-19 Gender Matrix informed by the JPHIEGO gender analysis toolkit to examine and illuminate research into the gendered impacts of COVID-19 within China. Results In China, only a small portion of the COVID-19-related research focused on gender experiences and differences. Near the end of the six-month literature review period, a small number of research items emerged on women healthcare workers, women's mental health, and pregnant women's access to care. There was an absence of research on the gendered impact of COVID-19 amongst populations. There was minimal consideration of the economic, social and security factors, including gender stereotypes and expectations, that affected different populations' experiences of infection, treatment, and lockdown during the period of review. Conclusion At the outset of health emergencies in China, gender research needs to be prioritised during the first stage of an outbreak to assist with evaluation of the most effective public health measures, identifying access to healthcare and social welfare barriers amongst priority communities. Gender stereotypes and gendered differences lead to different patterns of exposure and treatment. The exclusion of this knowledge in real time affects the design of effective prevention and recovery.

AB  - Results from longitudinal studies on involuntary retirement and depression remain controversial. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, Wanfang, and VIP updated on 4 January 2022 were searched for eligible publications. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. Eight published articles with 14,604 participants for the effect of involuntary retirement on depression incidence and 26,822 participants for the relationship between depression and involuntary retirement were included. Compared with working, the pooled RR for depression was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.13-1.51; I-2 = 37.7%) for the involuntary retirement overall. For involuntary retirement, the pooled RR was 1.70 (95% CI, 1.28-2.25; I-2 = 84.2%). The associations between involuntary retirement and depression did not substantially change in sensitivity and subgroup analyses. No evidence of publication bias was found. This meta-analysis indicates that there might be mutual causal relationship between involuntary retirement and depression. More large longitudinal studies with different gender and income levels are needed.

AB  - TAR DNA-binding protein 43, mostly referred to as TDP-43 (encoded by the TARDBP gene) is strongly linked to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). From the identification of TDP-43 positive aggregates in the brains and spinal cords of ALS/FTD patients, to a genetic link between TARBDP mutations and the development of TDP-43 pathology in ALS, there is strong evidence indicating that TDP-43 plays a pivotal role in the process of neuronal degeneration. What this role is, however, remains to be determined with evidence ranging from gain of toxic properties through the formation of cytotoxic aggregates, to an inability to perform its normal functions due to nuclear depletion. To add to an already complex subject, recent studies highlight a role for TDP-43 in muscle physiology and disease. We here review the biophysical, biochemical, cellular and tissue-specific properties of TDP-43 in the context of neurodegeneration and have a look at the nascent stream of evidence that positions TDP-43 in a myogenic context. By integrating the neurogenic and myogenic pathological roles of TDP-43 we provide a more comprehensive and encompassing view of the role and mechanisms associated with TDP-43 across the various cell types of the motor system, all the way from brain to limbs.

AB  - Introduction: Mentalizing is a key aspect of social cognition. Several researchers assume that mentalization has two systems, an explicit one (conscious, relatively slow, flexible, verbal, inferential) and an implicit one (unconscious, automatic, fast, non-verbal, intuitive). In schizophrenia, several studies have confirmed the deficit of explicit mentalizing, but little data are available on non-explicit mentalizing. However, increasing research activity can be detected recently in implicit mentalizing. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize the existing results of implicit mentalizing in schizophreniaMethods: A systematic search was performed in four major databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science. Eleven publications were selected. Five studies were found to be eligible for quantitative synthesis, and 9 studies were included in qualitative synthesis.Results: The meta-analysis revealed significantly lower accuracy, slower reaction time during implicit mentalizing in patients with schizophrenia. The systematic review found different brain activation pattern, further alterations in visual scanning, cue fixation, face looking time, and difficulties in perspective taking.Discussion: Overall, in addition to the deficit of explicit mentalization, implicit mentalization performance is also affected in schizophrenia, if not to the same extent. It seems likely that some elements of implicit mentalization might be relatively unaffected (e.g., detection of intentionality), but the effectiveness is limited by certain neurocognitive deficits. These alterations in implicit mentalizing can also have potential therapeutic consequences.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) among people suffering from psychotic disorders is a public health issue. Most suicide attempts (SAs) occur before or during the early phases of first episode psychosis (FEP). Improving knowledge about the suicide risk in the early stages is essential to develop therapeutic and prevention strategies. We conducted a systematic review to investigate an association between neurocognitive impairments or a history of impulsive behavior and SI or SB among patients with FEP. Method: PRISMA guidelines were followed. Ten databases were searched using MeSH terms or key-words related to FEP, impulsivity or cognitive functioning measures and SI or SB, without restrictions for study design or length of follow-up. Included studies evaluated at least one cognitive function with neuropsychological tests or validated questionnaires, or provided records of impulsive behavior. Results: Twenty one research papers were included from databases, bibliographic references or expert opinions. Among patients with FEP, seven studies showed more pronounced neuropsychological impairments, especially regarding attention, processing speed, executive functioning and theory of mind in patients that had attempted suicide. No association was found between cognitive impairments on neuropsychological tests and SI. Previous non-suicidal impulsive behaviors were associated with SAs and suicide. Conclusion: Our review suggests an association between neurocognitive impairments and SAs among patients with FEP. Records of impulsive behavior are also associated with SB in that population. Further research on the neuropsychology of FEP is necessary to identify how these impairments facilitate SB and evaluate their potential utility as therapeutic targets.

AB  - In order to understand how global warming effects on ecosystem primary production may change depending on nutrient enrichment, a new classification is proposed to disentangle and recognize the combination of interactions among several factors, based on the effect direction (positive, negative, or neutral) and its changes induced in it by the other factor (synergizing, antagonizing, inducing no change, or changing it in some other way). Marine macroalgae were chosen (as primary producers for which there is the most experimental information available) to review the relevant studies on which this new classification can be tested. It was observed the positive effects of elevated temperature and nutrient enrichment often synergized each other within the temperature range between relatively low and optimal growth levels. However, the negative effect of further temperature elevation from optimal to higher levels was antagonized by nutrient enrichment in some studies but was synergized in others, depending on the range of temperature elevation. The positive effect of nutrient enrichment was antagonized (but still positive) by temperature increase above the optimum in many cases, although the effect sometimes switched to a negative effect depending on the magnitude of nutrient enrichment. These results predict that global warming will enhance bottom-up effects on primary production in cold seasons and areas, and there will be a negative warming effect on production in hot seasons and areas, but it may be possible to mitigate this effect by appropriate levels of nutrient enrichment.

AB  - Elite athletes use high-intensity training to maintain their fitness level. However, intense training can harm the immune system, making athletes suspectable to COVID-19 and negatively affecting their performance. In addition, the diet of athletes should be appreciated more as it is another influencer of the immune system, especially during the COVID 19 pandemic. The other important issue elite athletes face currently is vaccination and its possible intervention with their training. The present study attempts to discuss the impact of different training intensities, nutritional strategies, and vaccination on the immune system function in elite athletes. To this end, Scopus, ISC, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched from 1988 to 2021 using the related keywords. The results of our review showed that although high-intensity exercise can suppress the immune system, elite athletes should not stop training in the time of infection but use low- and moderate-intensity training. Moderate-intensity exercise can improve immune function and maintain physical fitness. In addition, it is also better for athletes not to undertake high-intensity training at the time of vaccination, but instead perform moderate to low-intensity training. Furthermore, nutritional strategies can be employed to improve immune function during high-intensity training periods.

AB  - Aim and Method To determine the effect on decisional-related and clinical outcomes of decision aids for depression treatment in adults in randomised clinical trials. In January 2019, a systematic search was conducted in five databases. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Meta-analyses were performed, and standardised and weighted mean differences were calculated, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated with GRADE methodology.
   Results Six randomised clinical trials were included. The pooled estimates showed that decision aids for depression treatment had a beneficial effect on patients' decisional conflict, patient knowledge and information exchange between patient and health professional. However, no statistically significant effect was found for doctor facilitation, treatment adherence or depressive symptoms. The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes.
   Clinical implications Using decision aids to choose treatment in patients with depression may have a a beneficial effect on decisional-related outcomes, but it may not translate into an improvement in clinical outcomes.

AB  - Aims and Method The purpose of this review was to establish whether the prescription of antipsychotic medication in HMP Low Newton was safe, rational and consistent with current best practice. A search of the electronic healthcare records was performed on 14 March 2018 to identify all the women in the prison who were prescribed antipsychotic medication, and then data were collected from the records.
   Results A total of 46 out of 336 prisoners (13.7%) had been prescribed antipsychotic medications; 29 of the 46 patients (84.8%) were also prescribed other psychotropic medications at the same time. Quetiapine was the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic and was also the most likely to be prescribed for off-label indications. Less than one-third of all antipsychotic prescriptions were for psychotic disorders.
   Clinical implications The rationale for prescribing all antipsychotic medication, especially for off-label indications, should be clearly documented and reviewed regularly within the prison by the mental health team and psychiatrist.

A random-effect meta-analysis using professional categories as subgroups and a meta-regression were conducted. In total, 89 stud-ies were included, with a total of 56,278 workers from 26 professional categories. The overall pooled prevalence of CMD was 0.30 (95%CI: 0.27-0.34), varying from 0.07 to 0.58. Professional categories that presented higher prevalences of CMD were: Prostitutes 0.58 (95%CI: 0.51-0.65), Social Edu-cators 0.54 (95%CI: 0.50-0.59), Banking Work -ers 0.45 (95%CI: 0.44-0.47), Ragpickers 0.45 (95%CI: 0.40-0.49), and Teachers 0.40 (95%CI: 0.32-0.48). No other variable in addition to pro-fession was associated with prevalence of CMD in the meta-regression analysis. Workers from the most affected professional categories should be monitored to prevent social, occupational, and health impairment from CMD.

AB  - The salinization process in agricultural soils is extensive and has a negative impact on ecosystems and economic activities. The effects and causes of salinity are multifactorial, which must be evaluated to value and propose alternatives for sustained and environmentally friendly recovery. This paper seeks to integrate updated and reliable information on biological research and evaluation methods where organisms are used to mobilize, metabolize or compartmentalize salts through bioremediation processes, for situations where anthropogenic activities contribute to accelerate the salinization processes in soils. It is emphasized in biological models where there are associations of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria with halotolerant plants. Also, plant physiology is explained during the saline stress period; mobility, physical and chemical properties of ions related to salinity. Projections of oxidation mechanisms and genetic expression as resistance strategies in cells of halotolerant plants are addressed. The biochemical, phylogenetic relationship of molecular analyzes in associations between microorganisms of different genera with vegetative species is exposed. In addition, the application of biotechnological tools as a rapid and specific identification strategy. Finally, it is pointed out how statistical models are accompanied by biological bioremediation models to relate and select the response variables that explain and verify the results in a reliable way. Therefore, it is shown that bioremediation of saline soils can be achieved through synergy processes between the rhizosphere and the diversification of the native microbiota.

AB  - The prevalence of precarious employment has increased in recent decades and aspects such as employment insecurity and income inadequacy have intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify, appraise, and synthesise existing evidence pertaining to implemented initiatives addressing precarious employment that have evaluated and reported health and well-being outcomes. We used the PRISMA framework to guide this review and identified 11 relevant initiatives through searches in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and three sources of grey literature. We found very few evaluated interventions addressing precarious employment and its impact on the health and well-being of workers globally. Ten out of 11 initiatives were not purposefully designed to address precarious employment in general, nor specific dimensions of it. Seven out of 11 initiatives evaluated outcomes related to the occupational health and safety of precariously employed workers and six out of 11 evaluated worker health and well-being outcomes. Most initiatives showed the potential to improve the health of workers, although the evaluation component was often described with less detail than the initiative itself. Given the heterogeneity of the 11 initiatives regarding study design, sample size, implementation, evaluation, economic and political contexts, and target population, we found insufficient evidence to compare outcomes across types of initiatives, generalize findings, or make specific recommendations for the adoption of initiatives.

AB  - This study consisted in undertaking a bibliographical search within the Web of Science Core Collection from January 1900 to December 2020. A total of 637 publications were identified and divided into 9 sections tackling successively the relevance of independence referendums, the biased authorship, the definition of the phenomenon, the technical features of referendums, the elaboration of comparative datasets, the legitimacy of these consultations, the drivers leading to the organisation of independence referendums, the impact of referendums on settling ethnic violence and their capacity to favour state recognition. We affirm that those publications have advanced our knowledge about independence referendums. We also stress the persistence of a high fragmentation of authorship and approaches limiting the adoption of a common vocabulary, validation methods and consistent datasets allowing the accumulation and replication of analyses for establishing robust theories. In conclusion, we indicate some theoretical blind spots which could constitute a future research agenda.

AB  - Objective: The United States is in the midst of rapidly changing laws regarding cannabis. The increasing availability of cannabis for recreational and medical use requires that mental health clinicians be knowledgeable about evidence to be considered when counseling both patients and colleagues. In this review, the authors outline the evidence from randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials for therapeutic use of cannabinoids for specific medical conditions and the potential side effects associated with acute and chronic cannabis use. Methods: Searches of PubMed and PsycInfo were conducted for articles published through July 2021 reporting on "cannabis" or "cannabinoids" or "medicinal cannabis." Additional articles were identified from the reference lists of published reviews. Articles that did not contain the terms "clinical trial" or "therapy" in the title or abstract were not reviewed. A total of 4,431 articles were screened, and 841 articles that met criteria for inclusion were reviewed by two or more authors. Results: There are currently no psychiatric indications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cannabinoids, and there is limited evidence supporting the therapeutic use of cannabinoids for treatment of psychiatric disorders. To date, evidence supporting cannabinoid prescription beyond the FDA indications is strongest for the management of pain and spasticity. Conclusions: As cannabinoids become more available, the need for an evidence base adequately evaluating their safety and efficacy is increasingly important. There is considerable evidence that cannabinoids have a potential for harm in vulnerable populations such as adolescents and those with psychotic disorders. The current evidence base is insufficient to support the prescription of cannabinoids for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Despite the importance of user engagement in mHealth system efficacy, many such interventions fail to engage their users effectively. This paper provides a systematic review of 10 years of research (32 articles) on mHealth design interventions conducted between 2011 and 2020. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) model was used for this review with the IEEE, Medline EBSCO Host, ACM, and Springer databases searched for English language papers with the published range. The goal of this review was to find out which design process improves user engagement with mHealth in order to guide the development of future mHealth interventions. We discovered that the following six analytical themes influence user engagement: design goal, design target population, design method, design approach, socio-technical aspects, and design evaluation. These six analytical themes, as well as 16 other specific implementations derived from the reviewed articles, were included in a checklist designed to make designing, developing, and implementing mHealth systems easier. This study closes a gap in the literature by identifying a lack of consideration of socio-cultural contexts in the design of mHealth interventions and recommends that such socio-cultural contexts be considered and addressed in a systematic manner by identifying a design process for engaging users in mHealth interventions. Based on this, our systematic literature review recommends that a framework that captures the socio-cultural context of any mHealth implementation be refined or developed to support user engagement for mHealth.

AB  - Background: The aims of this review were to describe exercise interventions, facilitators, and barriers to physical activity for parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: A systematic review of the literature, appraising the validity of each article with Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt's level of evidence, from different databases CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Science between 2000 and 2020 was conducted. As the initial search revealed no articles on exercise interventions and only 2 articles with children with autism spectrum disorder, the aim was widened to all parents of children. Results: Forty-five articles were identified on barriers to physical activity including being the primary caregiving parent, perception of guilt and selfishness, and adhering to exercise programs they do as part of research, once research ends. Facilitators for physical activity including parents being more likely to exercise if they can bring their child with them and parents preferring exercise that is a lifelong habit, such as walking. Conclusions: Due to the lack of research on parents of children with autism spectrum disorder, recommendations include development and testing of interventions for parents of children with this condition including family-based exercise interventions where children and parents have a choice to exercise together.

AB  - The Internet has become an essential tool for adolescents. It is part of their social integration within peers and supports their identity construction. The Internet can also become a source of addiction, especially when used as a coping strategy towards unpleasant life situations. Addiction to the Internet is often linked with an increase in the feeling of loneliness. The feeling of loneliness is an emotion present during adolescence. However, in excess, it can lead to suicidal ideation. Addiction to the Internet is also linked to an increased suicide risk. We questioned ourselves on the impact of the feeling of loneliness on the link between an excessive use of the Internet by adolescents and the risks of suicidal ideation. We attempted to find an answer to this question by performing a systematic review of the literature. We found no result matching our search criteria. We noted the absence of studies with regards to the interaction between the feeling of loneliness, addiction to the Internet and the risk of suicidal ideation amongst adolescents. We established a theoretical model which could be used as a lead for future research. We insist on the importance that studies need to be conducted in this domain, in order to enable us to establish efficient preventive measures for the risks of suicidal ideation amongst adolescents.

AB  - People living with severe mental illness (SMI) are one of the most marginalized groups in society. Interventions which aim to improve their social and economic participation are of crucial importance to clinicians, policy-makers and people with SMI themselves. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on social interventions for people with SMI published since 2016 and collated our findings through narrative synthesis. We found an encouragingly large amount of research in this field, and 72 papers met our inclusion criteria. Over half reported on the effectiveness of interventions delivered at the service level (supported accommodation, education or employment), while the remainder targeted individuals directly (community participation, family interventions, peer-led/supported interventions, social skills training). We identified good evidence for the Housing First model of supported accommodation, for the Individual Placement and Support model of supported employment, and for family psychoeducation, with the caveat that a range of models are nonetheless required to meet the varied housing, employment and family-related needs of individuals. Our findings also highlighted the importance of contextual factors and the need to make local adaptations when "importing" interventions from elsewhere. We found that augmentation strategies to enhance the effectiveness of social interventions (particularly supported employment and social skills training) by addressing cognitive impairments did not lead to transferable "real life" skills despite improvements in cognitive function. We also identified an emerging evidence base for peer-led/supported interventions, recovery colleges and other interventions to support community participation. We concluded that social interventions have considerable benefits but are arguably the most complex in the mental health field, and require multi-level stakeholder commitment and investment for successful implementation.

AB  - Suicide is a critical public-health issue that remains the leading cause of death among young adults aged 15 to 24. In lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) populations the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions is significantly higher. The effect of natal sex vs. gender identity has not been studied enough as yet. In this study the PubMed-database was searched systematically for articles on the association between gender/sex differences and suicidality. Included were: meta-analyses, systematic and narrative reviews, firsthand observational studies and qualitative studies, published prior to 1 January 2021. Twenty-nine publications were found relevant, the majority on self-harm and suicide attempts and only few on death by suicide. Sexual (29.68%-lifetime) and gender (46.65%) minorities seem more likely to die by suicide than heterosexual/cisgender (14.57%) people. At greatest risk are transgender (56.65%) and bisexual (41.47%) individuals. Most studies reported natal males to be more affected than natal females. The "gender paradox in suicide" does not exist among sex and gender minorities (SGMs), but differences in suicidal behavior exist between the various SGM groups. More research on suicidal behavior among these groups, especially longitudinal research, is necessary.

AB  - Objective Robust program evaluations can identify effective promotion strategies. This scoping review aimed to analyze review articles (including systematic reviews, meta-analysis, meta-synthesis, scoping review, narrative review, rapid review, critical review, and integrative reviews) to systematically map and describe physical activity program evaluations published between January 2014 and July 2020 to summarize key characteristics of the published literature and suggest opportunities to strengthen current evaluations. Data Source We conducted a systematic search of the following databases: Medline, Scopus, Sportdiscus, Eric, PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Abstracts were screened for inclusion based on the following criteria: review article, English language, human subjects, primary prevention focus, physical activity evaluation, and evaluations conducted in North America. Extraction Our initial search yielded 3193 articles; 211 review articles met the inclusion criteria. Synthesis We describe review characteristics, evaluation measures, and "good practice characteristics" to inform evaluation strategies. Results Many reviews (72%) did not assess or describe the use of an evaluation framework or theory in the primary articles that they reviewed. Among those that did, there was significant variability in terminology making comparisons difficult. Process indicators were more common than outcome indicators (63.5% vs 46.0%). There is a lack of attention to participant characteristics with 29.4% capturing participant characteristics such as race, income, and neighborhood. Negative consequences from program participation and program efficiency were infrequently considered (9.3% and 13.7%). Conclusion Contextual factors, negative outcomes, the use of evaluation frameworks, and measures of program sustainability would strengthen evaluations and provide an evidence-base for physical activity programming, policy, and funding.

AB  - ContextEye tracking is a technology to measure and determine the eye movements and eye positions of an individual. The eye data can be collected and recorded using an eye tracker. Eye-tracking data offer unprecedented insights into human actions and environments, digitizing how people communicate with computers, and providing novel opportunities to conduct passive biometric-based classification such as emotion prediction. The objective of this article is to review what specific machine learning features can be obtained from eye-tracking data for the classification task. MethodsWe performed a systematic literature review (SLR) covering the eye-tracking studies in classification published from 2016 to the present. In the search process, we used four independent electronic databases which were the IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and the ScienceDirect repositories as well as the Google Scholar. The selection process was performed by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search strategy. We followed the processes indicated in the PRISMA to choose the appropriate relevant articles. ResultsOut of the initial 420 articles that were returned from our initial search query, 37 articles were finally identified and used in the qualitative synthesis, which were deemed to be directly relevant to our research question based on our methodology. ConclusionThe features that could be extracted from eye-tracking data included pupil size, saccade, fixations, velocity, blink, pupil position, electrooculogram (EOG), and gaze point. Fixation was the most commonly used feature among the studies found.

AB  - Disasters can cause long-lasting damage to survivors and rescue workers. Some rescue workers suffer negative physical and psychological consequences, while others do not. Thus, it is of value to fully understand the characteristics of rescuers who have not been affected by rescue activities. Resilience refers to the ability or capacity to cope with adversity. The aim of this review is to explore and identify the characteristics of resilience among rescue workers. A systematic literature search was conducted of seven electronic databases from inception to May 2019, using keywords and medical subject heading terms related to the resilience of rescuers. Hand searches and searches of leading authors were also performed. A total of 31 articles were eligible for review. Six domains were identified to characterize the resilience of rescuers namely, demographic and physical characteristics, personality traits, coping strategies, perceived resources, being equipped with special skills for disaster rescue, and having less adverse consequences from exposure to disaster. Researchers and disaster managers can take note of these characteristics to comprehensively understand the 'positive concept' of resilience. This enhanced understanding of 'positive resilience' can in turn be used to develop a framework to assess and establish interventions, and consequently to improve the psychological wellbeing of rescuers after disaster rescue efforts.

AB  - Supporting parents through the delivery of evidence-based parenting interventions (EBPI) is a way of promoting children's rights, given the known benefits to child development and family wellbeing. Group Triple P (GTP) is an EBPI suitable for parents of children aged 2-12 years, who experience parenting difficulties, and/or child behavior problems. Even though GTP has been intensively studied, information lacks on the magnitude of its effects, considering the risk of bias within and across prior research. To address this, a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration CRD42019085360) to evaluate the effects of GTP on child and parent outcomes at short- and longer-term was performed. Through a systematic search of a set of databases, 737 research papers were identified, and 11 trials were selected. The risk of bias within and across studies was evaluated. Significant positive effects of GTP were found immediately after the intervention for child behavior problems, dysfunctional parenting practices, parenting sense of competence, psychological adjustment, parental stress levels, conflict, and relationship quality. Six months after the intervention, positive effects were found only for child behavior problems. Data suggest that GTP might be an effective EBPI leading to positive family outcomes. Substantial risk of bias was found, highlighting the importance of improving the quality of research.

AB  - The environment in healthcare facilities can influence health and recovery of service users and furthermore contribute to healthy workplaces for staff. The concept of therapeutic landscapes seems to be a promising approach in this context. The aim of this qualitative meta-analysis is to review the effects of therapeutic landscapes for different stakeholders in psychiatric care facilities. A systematic literature search was conducted in the four data bases PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Thirteen predominately qualitative studies were included in this qualitative meta-analysis. The methodological quality of these qualitative studies was assessed, using an adapted version of the Journal Article Reporting Standards for Qualitative Research, and a thematic analysis was conducted. The results were categorised into the three main themes of the physical (built and natural), social, and symbolic dimensions of the therapeutic landscape. Given the heterogeneity of the summarised data and an overall methodological quality of the included studies that can be rated as medium, the results should be interpreted with caution. Current findings are based almost exclusively on qualitative studies. Therefore, there is a need for quantitative study designs that investigate the relationship between specific environmental elements and mental health outcomes for different stakeholders in psychiatric facilities.

AB  - Regular participation in physical activity is essential for children's physical, mental, and cognitive health. Neighborhood environments may be especially important for children who are more likely to spend time in the environment proximal to home. This article provides an update of evidence for associations between children's physical activity behaviors and objectively assessed environmental characteristics derived using geographical information system (GIS)-based approaches. A systematic scoping review yielded 36 relevant articles of varying study quality. Most studies were conducted in the USA. Findings highlight the need for neighborhoods that are well connected, have higher population densities, and have a variety of destinations in the proximal neighborhood to support children's physical activity behaviors. A shorter distance to school and safe traffic environments were significant factors in supporting children's active travel behaviors. Areas for improvement in the field include the consideration of neighborhood self-selection bias, including more diverse population groups, ground-truthing GIS databases, utilising data-driven approaches to derive environmental indices, and improving the temporal alignment of GIS datasets with behavioral outcomes.

AB  - With the outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 19 (Covid-19) in late 2019, governments increasingly imposed containment strategies, including social distancing as well as restricted population movement, potentially having negative impacts on mental and physical health. A growing number of studies have examined the impact of the pandemic on different facets of physical activity (PA); an overview combining these (mixed) results, however, is missing. Thus, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate whether and to which extent PA changed from before to during the Covid-19 pandemic, taking age, gender, and measurement method into account. The literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Results of the main characteristics were descriptively synthesized and analyzed in a meta-analysis quantifying effects of the pandemic on PA divided by age groups, with additional subgroup analyses of the characteristics age, gender, and measurement method being narratively synthesized. Overall, 57 studies with a total sample size of 119,094 participants (N between 10 and 60,560 subjects) from 14 countries worldwide with participants aged between four and 93 years were included. Thirty-two studies revealed a significant decline in PA, whereas only five studies found a significant increase in PA during the Covid-19 pandemic. Fourteen studies revealed mixed results. PA decreased in all age groups, independent of gender. Most self-reported and all device-based measurement methods showed a reduction in PA. However, effects were not found to be significant in all age groups. Nevertheless, the declining trend should be noted and governments should strive to enable PA within periods of pandemic restrictions, or promote alternatives such as digital training to avoid negative health consequences within the population.

AB  - Background: Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a specific learning disorder concerning reading acquisition that may has a lifelong negative impact on individuals. A reliable estimate of the prevalence of DD serves as the basis for diagnosis, intervention, and evidence-based health resource allocation and policy-making. Hence, the present meta-analysis aims to generate a reliable prevalence estimate of DD worldwide in primary school children and explore the potential variables related to that prevalence. Methods: Studies from the 1950s to June 2021 were collated using a combination of search terms related to DD and prevalence. Study quality was assessed using the STROBE guidelines according to the study design, with study heterogeneity assessed using the I-2 statistic, and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Variations in the prevalence of DD in different subgroups were assessed via subgroup meta-analysis and meta-regression. Results: The pooled prevalence of DD was 7.10% (95% CI: 6.27-7.97%). The prevalence in boys was significantly higher than that in girls (boys: 9.22%, 95%CI, 8.07-10.44%; girls: 4.66%, 95% CI, 3.84-5.54%; p < 0.001), but no significant difference was found in the prevalence across different writing systems (alphabetic scripts: 7.26%, 95%CI, 5.94-8.71%; logographic scripts: 6.97%, 95%CI, 5.86-8.16%; p > 0.05) or across different orthographic depths (shallow: 7.13%, 95% CI, 5.23-9.30%; deep: 7.55%, 95% CI, 4.66-11.04%; p > 0.05). It is worth noting that most articles had small sample sizes with diverse operational definitions, making comparisons challenging. Conclusions: This study provides an estimation of worldwide DD prevalence in primary school children. The prevalence was higher in boys than in girls but was not significantly different across different writing systems.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (SARS-CoV-2) is the most severe manifestation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Accruing evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic may have profound deleterious neurological, psychiatric, and psychological outcomes. The number of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) on this topic has grown exponentially. This protocol aims to synthesize all evidence from SRs and MAs on the associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and neuropsychiatric outcomes. The following electronic databases will be systematically searched from inception up to 15 January 2022: PubMed, Embase, APA PsycINFO, and Cochrane Reviews. An umbrella review (UR) of SRs and MAs of observational studies will be conducted. SRs and/or MAs of observational studies examining any direct or indirect association of COVID-19 with the neuropsychiatric outcomes will be deemed eligible for potential inclusion in this UR. The direct associations include the impact on the (1) prognosis of COVID-19 and (2) neuropsychiatric sequelae after COVID-19 infection. The indirect associations include the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the (1) treatments and (2) outcomes of neurological and psychiatric conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In recent years, people's acceptance of online shopping has increased markedly with the gradual maturing of e-commerce. The furniture industry in China, along with many other countries, is paying increased attention to the online retail business. The furniture online consumption experience has attracted attention both in academic and industrial fields. The purpose of this paper is to provide a literature review of the furniture online consumption with an aim to extend the concept of consumer experience to the context of online furniture consumption. The paper offers three important contributions for both academics and practitioners. First, it analyzes the main influencing factors of the consumer experience concerning wood furniture online consumption in China. And secondly, it proposes a conceptual framework of furniture online consumer experience (FOCE), which divides online consumption experience into three dimensions: perceived risk experience, emotional experience, and new technology interactive experience. Finally, from a managerial perspective, the authors put forward constructive strategies in terms of furniture online sales. The findings of this study afford practical implications for the improvement of the online shopping experience of consumers for furniture companies.

AB  - People with a severe mental illness often have less social support than other people, yet these people need social support to face the challenges in their lives. Increasing social support could benefit the person's recovery, but it is not clear whether interventions that aim to improve social support in people with a severe mental illness are effective. A systematic literature search and review in MEDLINE (PubMed), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, JSTOR, IBSS, and Embase was performed. Studies were included if they had a control group and they were aimed at improving social support in people with a severe mental illness who were receiving outpatient treatment. Summary data were extracted from the research papers and compared in a meta-analysis by converting outcomes to effect sizes (Hedges's g). Eight studies (total n = 1538) that evaluated ten different interventions met the inclusion criteria. All but one of these studies was of sufficient quality to be included in the review. The studies that were included in the meta-analysis had a combined effect size of 0.17 (confidence interval: 0.02 to 0.32), indicating a small or no effect for the interventions that were evaluated. A subgroup analysis of more personalized studies showed a combined effect size of 0.35 (CI = 0.27 to 0.44), indicating a noteworthy effect for these more personalized studies. This evaluation of interventions aimed at improving social support in people with a severe mental illness suggests that these interventions in general have little or no clinical benefit. However, in a subgroup analysis the more personalized interventions have a larger effect on improving social support and merit further research.

KW  - Co-production
KW  - Recovery college
KW  - Thematic synthesis
KW  - MENTAL-HEALTH
AB  - Purpose Recovery colleges have expanded over the last decade, providing educational courses and workshops on topics of mental health and well-being, co-delivered by peer workers and clinicians. This review aims to synthesise findings from the qualitative literature to explore the impact of recovery colleges on student well-being. Design/Methodology/Approach A systematic search of the qualitative literature was conducted in December 2021. Four databases were searched: Emerald, PubMed, ProQuest and Scopus. In total, 11 studies met the criteria for review and were subject to thematic synthesis. Findings Five themes were generated including "A shift in power", "Being connected", "Personal growth", "Adopting the role of a student" and "Meeting expectations". Research Limitations Implications These findings were consistent with previous literature, which suggest that much of the recovery college's impact lies in its ethos, which promotes empowerment and inclusivity. However, the review also drew attention to lesser explored areas of the recovery college such as how students understand the support on offer from the recovery college and manage their expectations around this. Practical Implications Several studies lacked methodological and analytical rigour and may well suffer from self-selecting samples leading to an overwhelmingly positive experience. Evaluation by independent researchers is paramount. Originality/value It is nearly eight years since this area was previously reviewed during which time considerable growth in the literature has resulted.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of organic compounds, found ubiquitously in all environmental compartments. PAHs are considered hazardous pollutants, being of concern to both the environmental and human health. In the aquatic environment, PAHs tend to accumulate in the sediment due to their high hydrophobicity, and thus sediments can be considered their ultimate sink. Concurrently, sediments comprise important habitats for benthic species. This raises concern over the toxic effects of PAHs to benthic communities. Despite PAHs have been the subject of several reviews, their toxicity to freshwater benthic species has not been comprehensively discussed. This review aimed to provide an overview on PAHs distribution in freshwater environments and on their toxicity to benthic fauna species. The distribution of PAHs between sediments and the overlying water column, given by the sediment water partition coefficient, revealed that PAHs concentrations were 2 to 4 orders of magnitude higher in sediments than in water. The sediment-water partition coefficient was positively correlated to PAHs hydrophobicity. Toxicity of PAHs to benthic fauna was addressed through Species Sensitivity Distributions. The derived hazardous concentration for 5% of the species (HC5) decreased as follows: NAP (376 mu g L-1) > PHE > PYR > FLT > ANT (0.854 mu g L-1), varying by 3 orders of magnitude. The hazardous concentrations (HC5) to benthic species were inversely correlated to the hydrophobicity of the individual PAHs. These findings are pertinent for environmental risk assessment of these compounds. This review also identified future challenges regarding the environmental toxicity of PAHs to freshwater benthic communities, namely the need for updating the PAHs priority list and the importance of compre-hensively and more realistically assess the toxicity of PAHs in combination with other stressors, both chemical and climate-related.

AB  - Regarding the epidemiological studies, neurological dysfunctions caused by cerebral ischemia or neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) have been considered a pointed matter. Mount-up shreds of evidence support that both autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the commencement and progression of neurological diseases. Remarkably, oxidative stress prompted by an increase of ROS threatens cerebral integrity and improves the severity of other pathogenic agents such as mitochondrial damage in neuronal disturbances. Autophagy is anticipated as a cellular defending mode to combat cytotoxic substances and damage. The recent document proposes that the interrelation of autophagy and ROS creates a crucial function in controlling neuronal homeostasis. This review aims to overview the cross-talk among autophagy and oxidative stress and its molecular mechanisms in various neurological diseases to prepare new perceptions into a new treatment for neurological disorders. Furthermore, natural/synthetic agents entailed in modulation/regulation of this ambitious cross-talk are described.

AB  - Aims Stigma related to mental disorders is a barrier to quality mental healthcare. This scoping review aimed to synthesise literature on stigma related to mental disorders in Nepal to understand stigma processes. The anthropological concept of 'what matters most' to understand culture and stigma was used to frame the literature on explanatory models, manifestations, consequences, structural facilitators and mitigators, and interventions. Methods We conducted a scoping review with screening guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A structured search was done using three international databases (PsycINFO, Medline and Web of Science), one Nepali database (NepJol) and cross-referencing for publications from 1 January 2000 through 24 June 2020. The search was repeated to include structural stigma-related terms. Quality of quantitative studies was assessed using the Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR) tool. The review was registered through the Open Science Framework (OSF) (osf.io/u8jhn). Results The searches yielded 57 studies over a 20-year period: 19 quantitative, 19 qualitative, nine mixed methods, five review articles, two ethnographies and three other types of studies. The review identified nine stigma measures used in Nepal, one stigma intervention, and no studies focused on adolescent and child mental health stigma. The findings suggest that 'what matters most' in Nepali culture for service users, caregivers, community members and health workers include prestige, productivity, privacy, acceptance, marriage and resources. Cultural values related to 'what matters most' are reflected in structural barriers and facilitators including lack of policies, programme planning and resources. Most studies using quantitative tools to assess stigma did not describe cultural adaptation or validation processes, and 15 out of the 18 quantitative studies were 'low-quality' on the SAQOR quality rating. The review revealed clear gaps in implementation and evaluation of stigma interventions in Nepal with only one intervention reported, and most stigma measures not culturally adapted for use. Conclusion As stigma processes are complex and interlinked in their influence on 'what matters most' and structural barriers and facilitators, more studies are required to understand this complexity and establish effective interventions targeting multiple domains. We suggest that stigma researchers should clarify conceptual models to inform study design and interpretations. There is a need to develop procedures for the systematic cultural adaptation of stigma assessment tools. Research should be conducted to understand the forms and drivers of structural stigma and to expand intervention research to evaluate strategies for stigma reduction.

AB  - Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability world-widely. The incidence rate of stroke has been increasing due to the aging population and lifestyle changes. At present, the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ischemic stroke is tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), but its clinical application is greatly limited because of its narrow time window and bleeding risk. Natural products have a long history of being used in traditional medicine with good safety, making them an important resource for the development of new drugs. Indeed, some natural products can target a variety of pathophysiological processes related to stroke, including oxidative stress, inflammation and neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, the development of high-efficiency, low-toxicity, safe and cheap active substances from natural products is of great significance for improving the treatment alternatives of patients with stroke. This article reviews the neuroprotective effects of 33 natural compounds by searching recent related literature. Among them, puerarin, pinocembrin, quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and resveratrol have great potential in the clinical treatment of ischemic stroke. This review will provide a powerful reference for screening natural compounds with potential clinical application value in ischemic stroke or synthesizing new neuroprotective agents with natural compounds as lead compounds.

AB  - Background: Helplines worldwide have frequent callers who may occupy a large proportion of call volume. Therapeutic gain from frequent calling has been questioned. We conducted this review to identify the characteristics of frequent callers and to compile recommendations about how best to help them. Method: Using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) standards, we searched for all empirical research in English and French from inception to May, 2020 in PubMed, PsycInfo, and the CRISE library. Results: We identified 738 manuscripts and retained 27 for analyses. Nine provided no definition of frequent callers; nine mixed frequent callers with repeat callers (>1 calls); nine concerned frequent callers (>= 8 calls/month). The limited data suggest frequent callers are similar to other callers and often experience mental health problems, loneliness, and suicide risk. From recommendations in all 27 studies, we identified 10 suggestions to better manage and help frequent callers that merit validation. Limitations: The small number of empirical investigations and the diversity of their goals and methodologies limit generalizations. Although recommendations for helping callers may have face validity, empirical data on their effectiveness are scarce. Conclusion: Rather than focusing on reducing call frequency, we should empirically evaluate the benefits of interventions for frequent callers with different calling patterns, characteristics, and reasons for calling.

AB  - Coral reefs in the western Atlantic and Caribbean are deteriorating primarily from disease outbreaks, increasing seawater temperatures, and stress due to land-based sources of pollutants including sediments associated with land use and dredging. Sediments affect corals in numerous ways including smothering, abrasion, shading, and inhibition of coral recruitment. Sediment delivery resulting in deposition and water quality deterioration can cause degradation at the spatial scale of corals or entire reefs. We still lack rigorous long-term studies of coral cover and community composition before, during and after major sediment stress, and evidence of recovery after watershed management actions. Here we present an overview of the effects of terrestrial sediments on corals and coral reefs, with recent advances in approaches to watershed assessment relevant to the delivery of sediments to these ecosystems. We present case studies of northeastern Caribbean watersheds to illustrate challenges and possible solutions and to draw conclusions about the current state of knowledge of sediment effects on coral reefs. With a better understanding of erosion and the pathways of sediment discharge to nearshore reefs, there is the increased potential for management interventions.

AB  - Background Evidence on risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD) are fragmented and inconsistent. Aims To assess the strength and credibility of evidence on risk factors of PPD, ranking them based on the umbrella review methodology. Method Databases were searched until 1 December 2020, for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies. Two reviewers assessed quality, credibility of associations according to umbrella review criteria (URC) and evidence certainty according to Grading of Recommendations-Assessment-Development-Evaluations criteria. Results Including 185 observational studies (n = 3 272 093) from 11 systematic reviews, the association between premenstrual syndrome and PPD was the strongest (highly suggestive: odds ratio 2.20, 95%CI 1.81-2.68), followed by violent experiences (highly suggestive: odds ratio (OR) = 2.07, 95%CI 1.70-2.50) and unintended pregnancy (highly suggestive: OR=1.53, 95%CI 1.35-1.75). Following URC, the association was suggestive for Caesarean section (OR = 1.29, 95%CI 1.17-1.43), gestational diabetes (OR = 1.60, 95%CI 1.25-2.06) and 5-HTTPRL polymorphism (OR = 0.70, 95%CI 0.57-0.86); and weak for preterm delivery (OR = 2.12, 95%CI 1.43-3.14), anaemia during pregnancy (OR = 1.47, 95%CI 1.17-1.84), vitamin D deficiency (OR = 3.67, 95%CI 1.72-7.85) and postpartum anaemia (OR = 1.75, 95%CI 1.18-2.60). No significant associations were found for medically assisted conception and intra-labour epidural analgesia. No association was rated as 'convincing evidence'. According to GRADE, the certainty of the evidence was low for Caesarean section, preterm delivery, 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and anaemia during pregnancy, and 'very low' for remaining factors. Conclusions The most robust risk factors of PDD were premenstrual syndrome, violent experiences and unintended pregnancy. These results should be integrated in clinical algorithms to assess the risk of PPD.

KW  - systematic review
AB  - Anonymous reporting systems (ARS) have been widely implemented in schools across the United States as a violence prevention strategy. The current study systematically reviewed the published literature on ARS in U.S. schools (including public and private k-12 schools, colleges, and universities) over the past 25 years to examine the effectiveness of ARS as a school safety and violence prevention strategy. We conducted a comprehensive literature search which identified just four studies pertaining to ARS in schools. Of note, only one of these studies was published in a peer-reviewed journal. Results from this systematic review point to the need for more empirical studies on the effectiveness of ARS as a violence prevention strategy. Findings from this review also highlight the wide variation across schools in the type of ARS used, the mode of implementation, and associated educational and training components. This review is a first step in documenting an evidence-base for ARS which will be useful in guiding educators and policymakers about best practices for the use of ARS in schools. Impact Statement Anonymous reporting systems (ARS) have been used as a violence prevention strategy in schools by providing a means for individuals within a school community to safely and securely report information about potential violence or concerns about mental health, for example, through an anonymous hotline or reporting app. Despite widespread implementation of ARS in schools, as well as mandates for reporting systems in schools in 21 states, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of ARS for school violence prevention, and information about best practices for ARS implementation is lacking. This systematic review aims to summarize the current research on the effectiveness of ARS as a school safety and violence prevention strategy, which is an important step in building an evidence-base to guide schools and policymakers about best practices.

We performed a selective review of the available literature of ANS assays related to risk for suicide. Recent Findings We searched PubMed and Web of Science with the strategy: "suicide OR suicidal" AND "electrodermal OR heart rate variability OR pupillometry OR pupillography." The search produced 119 items, 21 of which provided original data regarding ANS methods and suicide. These 21 studies included 6 for electrodermal activity, 14 for heart rate variability, and 1 for the pupillary light reflex. The 21 papers showed associations between ANS assays and suicide risk in a direction suggesting underlying hyperarousal in patients at risk for suicide. Summary ANS assays show promise for future development as POC tests to supplement clinical decision making in estimating risk for suicide.

AB  - Developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases are challenging because of the presence of blood-brain barrier and Alzheimer being one of the commonest and uprising neurodegenerative disorders possess the need for developing novel therapies. Alzheimer's is attributed to be the sixth leading cause of death in the USA and the number of cases is estimated to be increased from 58 million in 2021 to 88 million by 2050. Natural drugs have benefits of being cost-effective, widely available, fewer side effects, and immuno-booster can be useful in managing Alzheimer. Flavonoids can slow the neuronal degeneration as they have shown activity in central nervous system and are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. These can be easily extracted from fruits, vegetable, and plants. In Alzheimer disease, flavonoids scavenges the reactive oxygen species and reduces the production of amyloid beta protein. Agents from sub-classes of flavonoids such as flavanones, flavanols, flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins, and isoflavones having pharmacological action in treating Alzheimer disease are discussed in this review.

AB  - As an ancient science, hypnosis has been used by humans since the primitive societies during theocratic times. By the 20th century, scientists and psychologists had re-recognized and studied hypnosis and explored its applications in fields such as medicine, education, and military uses. A local form of traditional Chinese "hypnosis" appeared in Huangdi Neijing, but it has not received enough attention from Chinese people; China's modern hypnosis development is later than that of American and European countries. Therefore, people's understanding and applications of hypnosis remain inadequate. With the development of China's economy and state power in the last decades, Chinese people were beginning to attach importance to the investment and development of the sports industry and realized that the psychological quality of the athletes is often a decisive factor in the success or failure of the competition. Meanwhile, hypnosis is an effective psychological training method to be used in daily training and competitions. In light of this, this essay firstly reviews the history of hypnosis before carrying out the methods of a literature review and a logical analysis to explore the applications of hypnosis in sports. Thus, evidence is provided in favor of the use of hypnosis in the sports industry.

AB  - Social determinants of mental and physical health that influence young peoples' trajectories into adulthood are often remediable through law. To address inequalities, including those exacerbated since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to better understand young people's need for and uptake of advice for social welfare legal problems. This scoping review aimed to review available evidence and identify gaps to inform further research. To identify studies relevant to social welfare legal advice among young adults we conducted searches of eight bibliographic databases (compiled between January 1998 and June 2020), hand searches of included article reference lists and targeted grey literature searches. 35 peer reviewed and grey literature studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria including evaluations of interventions to promote access to advice, general population surveys, observational studies, and audits of charity data or targeted surveys. Evidence suggests considerable and inequitable need for social welfare legal advice among young adults with adverse consequences for health and wellbeing. Needs among higher risk groups are likely underestimated. Evidence for interventions to enhance access/uptake of advice is limited and methodologically weak. We identify several gaps in the literature to inform research and to enable systematic reviews around more specific questions to inform practice.

AB  - Free radical or oxidative stress may be a fundamental mechanism underlying several human neurologic diseases. Therapy using free radical scavengers (antioxidants) has the potential to prevent, delay, or ameliorate many neurologic disorders. However, the biochemistry of oxidative pathobiology is complex, and optimum antioxidant therapeutic options may vary and need to be tailored to individual diseases. In vitro and animal model studies support the potential beneficial role of various antioxidant compounds in neurological disease. Antioxidants generally play an important role in reducing or preventing the cell damage and other changes which occur in the cells like mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA mutations, and lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane. Based on their mechanism of action, antioxidants can be used to treat various neurological disorders like Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Vitamin E has a scavenging action for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also prevents the lipid peroxidation. Creatine generally reduces the mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Various metal chelators are used in PD for the prevention of accumulation of the metals. Superoxidase dismutase (SOD), lipases, and proteases act as repair enzymes in patients with AD. Accordingly, the antioxidant defense system is found to be most useful for treating various neurological disorders.

AB  - The protein kinase, GSK-3, participates in diverse biological processes and is now recognized a promising drug discovery target in treating multiple pathological conditions. Over the last decade, a range of newly developed GSK-3 inhibitors of diverse chemotypes and inhibition modes has been developed. Even more conspicuous is the dramatic increase in the indications that were tested from mood and behavior disorders, autism and cognitive disabilities, to neurodegeneration, brain injury and pain. Indeed, clinical and pre-clinical studies were largely expanded uncovering new mechanisms and novel insights into the contribution of GSK-3 to neurodegeneration and central nerve system (CNS)-related disorders. In this review we summarize new developments in the field and describe the use of GSK-3 inhibitors in the variety of CNS disorders. This remarkable volume of information being generated undoubtedly reflects the great interest, as well as the intense hope, in developing potent and safe GSK-3 inhibitors in clinical practice.

AB  - Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the leading causes of dementia. These neurological disorders are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-ss (Ass), tau protein and alpha-synuclein, contributing to mitochondrial fragmentation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Misfolded proteins activate microglia, which induces neuroinflammation, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequently facilitates synaptic damage and neuronal loss. So far, all the proposed drugs were based on the inhibition of protein aggregation and were failed in clinical trials. Therefore, the treatment options of dementia are still a challenging issue. Thus, it is worthwhile to study alternative therapeutic strategies. In this context, there is increasing data on the pivotal role of transcription factor NF- E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) on the redox homeostasis and anti-inflammatory functions in neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, Nrf2 signaling pathway has shown upregulation of antioxidant genes, inhibition of microglia-mediated inflammation, and improved mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting Nrf2 activation could be a novel therapeutic approach to target pathogenesis. The present review will examine the correlation between Nrf2 signaling with neuroinflammation in AD and PD.

AB  - This review explored whether trauma exposure is associated with poorer response to antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia patients. A systematic search identified eight studies, of which five reported an association between trauma and non-remission of psychotic symptoms (n = 4) or treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS, n = 1). Although evidence supporting the link between trauma and resistance to antipsychotic treatment is scarce, trauma history should be systematically investigated in all persons with TRS, as there is a growing body of evidence showing that schizophrenia patients benefit from therapies for post-traumatic symptoms.

AB  - Background: Substance use disorder (SUD), mental health disorders (MHD), and co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders are common among criminal justice populations. Digital health interventions (DHI) represent an opportunity to expand co-occurring disorder treatment for justice involved populations, but efficacy data are lacking.Objectives: The current scoping review aims to address this gap via following objectives: (1) Describe trends involving DHIs for MHD, SUD, or co-occurring disorders studied in criminal justice settings; and (2) review available evidence for the impact of DHIs on criminal justice-, substance-, and mental health-related outcomes.Methods: PubMed was searched for relevant articles that met the follow inclusion criteria: (1) focus on criminal justice-involved individuals; (2) description of an intervention focused on SUD, MHD, or co-occurring disorders; and (3) use of DHI. Articles were assessed using standardized data abstraction and quality assessment tools.Results: Four-hundred unique articles were identified on initial search, and 19 were included in the final review. The most common focus of the intervention was SUDs. The most common modalities were telehealth and computer assisted interventions, with most utilized as an adjunct to treatment as usual. No DHIs used wearable devices, and one included justice involved youth. Feasibility and acceptability were high, and the studies that measured substance and mental health-related outcomes reported equivocal or positive results. No studies focused on long-term justice-related outcomes.Conclusions: Literature on DHIs for criminal justice involved populations diagnosed with SUD, MHD and co-occurring disorders is limited, and largely focuses on telehealth or eHealth, with less data on mHealth approaches. Future research should focus on the inclusion of diverse populations and include objective monitoring tools.

AB  - Orexins (also known as hypocretins) are neuropeptides that participate in the regulation of energy metabolism, homeostasis, sleep, feeding, stress responses, arousal, and reward. Particularly relevant to the scope of the present review is the involvement of the orexin system in brain mechanisms that regulate motivation, especially highly motivated behavior, arousal, and stress, making it an ideal target for studying addiction and discovering treatments. Drug abuse and misuse are thought to induce maladaptive changes in the orexin system, and these changes might promote and maintain uncontrolled drug intake and contribute to relapse. Dysfunctional changes in this neuropeptidergic system that are caused by drug use might also be responsible for alterations of feeding behavior and the sleep-wake cycle that are commonly disrupted in subjects with substance use disorder. Drug addiction has often been associated with an increase in activity of the orexin system, suggesting that orexin receptor antagonists may be a promising pharmacological treatment for substance use disorder. Substantial evidence has shown that single orexin receptor antagonists that are specific to either orexin receptor 1 or 2 can be beneficial against drug intake and relapse. Interest in the efficacy of dual orexin receptor antagonists, which were primarily developed to treat insomnia, has grown in the field of drug addiction. Treatments that target the orexin system may be a promising strategy to reduce drug intake, mitigate relapse vulnerability, and restore "normal" physiological functions, including feeding and sleep. The present review discusses preclinical and clinical evidence of the involvement of orexins in drug addiction and possible beneficial pharmacotherapeutic effects of orexin receptor antagonists to treat substance use disorder.

AB  - This article reviews literature in composition studies since affective science's emergence in the 1980s. It focuses on composition studies' history of adopting findings and theories from affective science, and distinguishes trends in how the field applies those elements in theoretical versus pedagogical contexts. While composition studies' adoption of affective science in its theorizing has helped the field progress toward a "complete psychology of writing," affective science's influence on classroom practices has not been so clear cut or direct. However, affective science is a fast-growing, liberal, and multidisciplinary field. As it progresses, composition studies continues to embrace its concepts and theories. This review notes the expectations and limitations developing through this dynamic interdisciplinary relationship.

AB  - Environmental chromium exposure may cause impaired development of children. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and CINAHL were searched to identify case-control studies that reported childhood Cr exposure and cognitive development. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to ensure the quality of the included studies. Cr levels were compared in cases and controls, and a random effect meta-analysis was performed using Stata version 16. Twelve of 61 studies identified in the literature search were eligible for this analysis. Hair, serum and urine Cr measurements were reported by seven, two and one studies, respectively. In addition, one study reported both serum and hair Cr exposure and another reported urine and hair Cr exposure. The pooled standard mean differences (SMD) showed that hair Cr levels were non-significantly lower among children with cognitive defects (-0.01 mu g/g, 95% CI:-0.04, 00, p = 0.27). In serum and urine, the pooled SMD was higher in children with cognitive deficits compared with healthy control children (0.32 mu g/g, 95% CI:-0.78, 1.42, p = 0.56 and 0.64 mu g/g, CI: -0.07,1.36, p = 0.08; respectively). In summary, this systematic review found no significant differences in hair, serum and urine Cr levels between children with cognitive deficits and healthy control children when all study data were pooled in the meta-analysis. Larger studies using standardized criteria and longitudinal assessment of cognitive development are needed to determine whether there is a dose response effect of childhood Cr exposure on cognitive development of children.

AB  - Background: Many studies have found associations between early life air pollution exposure and subsequent onset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, characteristics that affect susceptibility remain unclear.
   Objective: This systematic review examined epidemiologic studies on the modifying roles of social, child, genetic and maternal characteristics in associations between prenatal and early postnatal air pollution exposure and ASD.
   Methods: A systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase was conducted. Studies that examined modifiers of the association between air pollution and ASD were included.
   Results: A total of 19 publications examined modifiers of the associations between early life air pollution exposures and ASD. In general, estimates of effects on risk of ASD in boys were larger than in girls (based on 11 studies). Results from studies of effects of family education (2 studies) and neighborhood deprivation (2 studies) on air pollution-ASD associations were inconsistent. Limited data (1 study) suggest pregnant women with insufficient folic acid intake might be more susceptible to ambient particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and 10 mu m (PM10) in aerodynamic diameter, and to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Children of mothers with gestational diabetes had increased risk of ozone-associated ASD (1 study). Two genetic studies reported that copy number variations may amplify the effect of ozone, and MET rs1858830 CC genotype may augment effects of PM and near-roadway pollutants on ASD.
   Conclusions: Child's sex, maternal nutrition or diabetes, socioeconomic factors, and child risk genotypes were reported to modify the effect of early-life air pollutants on ASD risk in the epidemiologic literature. However, the sparsity of studies on comparable modifying hypotheses precludes conclusive findings. Further research is needed to identify susceptible populations and potential targets for preventive intervention.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that hippocampal neurotrophy may be related to the development of major depressive disorders. Neurogenesis, which can be regulated by neurotrophic factors, is also involved in antidepressant efficacy. This paper reviewed literature on neurotrophic signaling and cell proliferation after electroconvulsive shock (ECS) treatment. All articles were from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases between 2000 and 2020. The keywords used in the literature search are: "ECS," "ECT," "electroconvulsive seizure," "electroconvulsive shock," "electroconvulsive therapy," "neurotrophic factor," "nerve growth factor," "neurotrophins," "neurogenesis," and "cell proliferation." Eighty-two articles were included in the final analysis. It was shown that compared with acute ECS, repeated ECS increased neurotrophin expression in more brain regions at higher levels and was maintained for a longer time. Similarly, ECS increased cell proliferation in a dose-and time-dependent manner. The increase in cell proliferation was positively correlated with the amount of ECS administered and the newly born cells survived for a long time. The effects of ECS in inducing increases in neurotrophin levels and neurogenesis may contribute to brain function changes and antidepressant effects. Future research may focus on optimal sessions of ECT treatment to obtain the best therapeutic effect.

Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. Meta-analysis was then performed using STATA 15.1 software.Results: A total of eight articles involving 566 patients were included. The meta-analysis results showed that the suicidal ideation scores of the group who received TMS treatment were significantly lower [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.415, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.741 to -0.090, P = 0.012] than those of the control group. Subgroup analysis showed that age, TMS pattern, frequency of intervention, and stimulation threshold altered the TMS efficacy.Conclusions: Evidence showed that TMS achieved superior results in reducing suicidal ideation. Because of the limited quality and quantity of the included studies, more high-quality studies are required to verify the conclusions.

AB  - Background Many people who have self-harmed prefer informal sources of support or support from those with lived experience. However, little is known about whether peer support improves outcomes for people who have self-harmed or about the risks of peer support interventions in non-clinical settings. Aims The aims of this review were to examine the effectiveness, acceptability and potential risks of peer support for self-harm, and how these risks might be mitigated. Method We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature for papers published since 2000. We included peer support for self-harm that occurred in voluntary-sector organisations providing one-to-one or group support, or via moderated online peer support forums. Results Eight of the ten papers included focused on peer support that was delivered through online media. No study compared peer support with other treatments or a control group, so limited conclusions could be made about its effectiveness. Peer support for self-harm was found to be acceptable and was viewed as having a range of benefits including a sense of community, empowerment, and access to information and support. The most commonly perceived risk associated with peer support was the potential for triggering self-harm. Conclusions Our findings highlighted a range of benefits of being part of a group with very specific shared experiences. Mitigations for potential risks include organisations using professional facilitators for groups, trigger warnings for online forums, and providing regular supervision and training so that peers are prepared and feel confident to support vulnerable people while maintaining their own emotional health.

AB  - Objectives: Efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic should take into account worsening health inequities. While many public health experts have commented on inequities, no analysis has yet synthesized recommendations into a guideline for practitioners. The objective of this rapid review was to identify the areas of greatest concern and synthesize recommendations.Methods: We conducted a rapid systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020178131). We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from December 1, 2019 to April 27, 2020. We included English language peer-reviewed commentaries, editorials, and opinion pieces that addressed the social determinants of health in the context of COVID-19.Results: 338 articles met our criteria. Authors represented 81 countries. Income, housing, mental health, age and occupation were the most discussed social determinants of health. We categorized recommendations into primordial, primary, secondary and tertiary prevention that spoke to the social determinants of COVID-19 and equity.Conclusion: These recommendations can assist efforts to contain COVID-19 and reduce health inequities during the pandemic. Using these recommendations, public health practitioners could support a more equitable pandemic response.

AB  - Mental health services are frequently scrutinized following mass school shootings. Subsequently, national, federal, state, and local commissions convene to identify preventative measures including implications for mental health. In order to address the question of what recommendations were offered to mental health professionals, a systematic review of commission reports covering multiple school shootings was conducted. After a comprehensive database search, 16 qualifying reports covering incidents from 1974 through 2018 were identified and reviewed. Several themes emerged, which are pertinent to mental health providers. Suggestions included expanding access to counseling, increasing training of school personnel on threat assessment and mental illness, using interdisciplinary threat assessment teams, monitoring and following up on treatment plans, expanding involuntary treatment, implementing bullying prevention, and increasing interdisciplinary communication.

AB  - Recent genetic approaches have demonstrated that genetic factors contribute to the pathologic origins of neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the exact pathophysiological mechanism for most cases remains unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated alterations in pathways of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and identified several proteins that are misfolded and/or aggregated in the brains of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, thus providing early evidence that disrupted proteostasis may be a contributing factor to their pathophysiology. Unlike neurodegenerative disorders in which massive neuronal and synaptic losses are observed, proteostasis impairments in neuropsychiatric disorders do not lead to robust neuronal death, but rather likely act via loss- and gain-of-function effects to disrupt neuronal and synaptic functions. Furthermore, abnormal activation of or overwhelmed endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial quality control pathways may exacerbate the pathophysiological changes initiated by impaired proteostasis, as these organelles are critical for proper neuronal functions and involved in the maintenance of proteostasis. This perspective article reviews recent findings implicating proteostasis impairments in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and explores how neuronal and synaptic functions may be impacted by disruptions in protein homeostasis. A greater understanding of the contributions by proteostasis impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders will help guide future studies to identify additional candidate proteins and new targets for therapeutic development.

AB  - Background Sleep difficulties are often reported in practice, and are part of the diagnostic criteria for depression and bipolar disorder. Aims To inform the understanding of the relationship between sleep and both depression and bipolar disorder. Method We conducted a narrative literature review of affective disorders and sleep difficulties in children and young people. Results Specific sleep disorders, such as parasomnias, narcolepsy and sleep-related movement disorders, are associated with depression, whereas insomnia, obstructive sleep apnoea and circadian rhythm disorders are associated with both depression and bipolar disorder in children and young people. Conversely, children and young people with depression can present with a number of sleep difficulties, and these are associated with higher depression severity and greater fatigue, suicidal ideation, physical complaints, pain and decreased concentration. Sleep disturbances among adolescents with bipolar disorder can affect the severity of depressive and manic symptoms, are a poor prognostic indicator and have been associated with social and academic impairment. Antidepressants and antipsychotics can directly affect sleep architecture, which clinicians need to be aware of. Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep problems could prevent and/or minimise the risk of relapse in affective disorders. Conclusions Sleep difficulties can occur before, during and after an episode of depression or bipolar disorder, and have a higher prevalence in affective disorders compared with the general population. A multi-modal approach would include the treatment of both the affective and specific sleep disorder. Further research is needed in this field to understand the impact of combined interventions on clinical outcomes.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematization of the evidence regarding preschool years. This is a two-part systematic review. In this first part, we aim to examine the effects of BOI on preschoolers' social-emotional competence outcomes.Data Sources: Searches were conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, PsycInfo, ERIC, Web of Science, Portal Regional da BVS and CINAHL.Eligibility Criteria: English, French and Portuguese language articles published between January 2000 and October 2020, that evaluated the effects of BOI implemented in educational contexts on social-emotional competence of preschool children. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT) or quasi-RCT were included.Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently completed data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment. The level of scientific evidence was measured through the Best Evidence Synthesis.Results: Nineteen studies were included. There was strong evidence that BOI do not improve anger/aggression, delay of gratification and altruism. Nevertheless, there was moderate evidence that BOI effectively improve other social-emotional outcomes, such as empathy, social interaction, social independence, general internalizing behaviors, and general externalizing behaviors. The lack of scientific evidence was compromised by the methodological quality of the studies.Conclusion: BOI effectively improve specific social-emotional competences of preschool children.

AB  - Background: Externalising behaviours are becoming a remarkably prevalent problem during adolescence, often precipitating both externalising and internalising disorders in later adulthood. Psychological treatments aim to increase the social functioning of adolescents in order for them to live a more balanced life and prevent these negative trajectories. However, little is known of the intervening variables and mediators involved in these treatments' change mechanisms. We conducted a systematic review, exploring the available evidence on mediators of psychological treatments for externalising behaviours and symptoms amongst adolescents (10 to 19 years old).Methods: A systematic search was performed on Medline and PsycINFO databases, which identified studies from inception to February 23, 2020. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials that enrolled adolescents with externalising symptoms and behaviours as, at least, one of the primary outcomes. A group of 20 reviewers from the COST-Action TREATme (CA16102) were divided into 10 pairs. Each pair independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted information from the included studies, and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies and the requirements for mediators, following Kazdin's criteria. Risk of bias of RCTs was assessed by the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Extracted data from the included studies were reported using a narrative synthesis.Results: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA), after removing duplicates, 3,660 articles were screened. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. In a second stage, 965 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. A total of 14 studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. The majority were related to systemic psychological treatment approaches. Two types of mediators were identified as potentially being involved in the mechanisms of change for better social improvements of adolescents: to increase healthier parent-adolescent relationships and parental discipline. However, there were significant and non-significant results amongst the same mediators, which led to discussing the results tentatively.Conclusions: Family variables were found to be the largest group of investigated mediators, followed by relational, behavioural, and emotional variables. No cognitive or treatment-specific mediators were identified. Both adequate behavioural control of adolescents' peer behaviour and a better positive balance in their relationships with their parents seemed to buffer the effects of externalising behaviours in adolescents. Several methodological limitations concerning mediation testing design, outcome measures, and mediator selection have been identified.

AB  - Objective: Early intervention for psychosis services have been established worldwide and consist of specialist services for those with the At-Risk Mental State (ARMS) and a first episode of psychosis (FEP). This systematic review identified the literature on the outcomes of people who initially presented via an ARMS clinic and later transitioned to a psychotic disorder (UHR-T), compared to those who presented directly to an EI service with a FEP (FEP-D). The outcomes examined were (i) symptomatic (ii) functional, (iii) morbidity and mortality (including physical health) and (iv) service-usage. Method: A systematic search strategy was employed using three databases: MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and EMBASE. Studies published in English and that compared any of the above outcomes in a cohort of people with a first episode of psychosis who initially presented via an ARMS clinic to those who presented directly to a FEP service were included. Meta-analysis was performed for any outcome data from at least two studies. Results: A total of 988 unique articles were identified and of these, three studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and these included a total of 78 UHR-T and 253 FEP-D individuals. In the one study examining remission rates, there was no difference observed after one year in the UHR-T and FEP-D groups. In the one study that examined neurocognition, no differences were observed in any of the neurocognitive domains between groups after one year. Two studies examined psychiatric admission rates within one year and one of these found that UHR-T individuals were less likely to have any psychiatric admission (46% vs 68%) and admissions were less likely to be involuntary (30% vs 74%), while the other study found no difference in admission rates. In the metaanalysis, UHR-T individuals had lower odds for any psychiatric hospital admission within one year compared to FEP-D individuals (OR = 0.54, 95% C.I. 0.32 - 0.94, p = .03). No studies examined functional outcomes or mortality and morbidity between the groups. Conclusion: The limited research indicates similar or superior outcomes for people with a FEP who present initially via an ARMS clinic. The reduced psychiatric admission rate is an important potential benefit of ARMS clinics that requires replication.

AB  - There is a need for more knowledge of valid and standardized measures of mental health problems among children and adolescents with intellectual disability (ID). In this study, we systematically reviewed and evaluated the psychometric properties of instruments used to assess general mental health problems in this population. Following PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed empirical research published from 1980 through February 2020 with an updated search in March 2021 in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Health and Psychological Instruments, CINAHL, ERIC, and Web of Science databases. Forty-nine empirical articles were included in this review. Overall, the review indicated consistently better documentation of the reliability and validity of instruments designed for the ID population compared to instruments developed for the general child population.

AB  - Objective: Self-harm is closely associated with suicide in older adults and may provide opportunity to intervene to prevent suicide. This study aimed to systematically review recent evidence for three components of aftercare for older adults: (1) referral pathways, (2) assessment tools and safety planning approaches and (3) engagement and intervention strategies. Methods: Databases PubMed, Medline, PsychINFO, Embase and CINAHL were searched from January 2010 to 10 July 2021 by two reviewers. Empirical studies reporting aftercare interventions for older adults (aged 60+) following self-harm (including with suicidal intent) were included. Full text of articles with abstracts meeting inclusion criteria were obtained and independently reviewed by three authors to determine final studies for review. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed level of evidence (Oxford) and quality ratings (Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for quantitative and Attree and Milton checklist for qualitative studies), working independently. Results: Twenty studies were reviewed (15 quantitative; 5 qualitative). Levels of evidence were low (3, 4), and quality ratings of quantitative studies variable, although qualitative studies rated highly. Most studies of referral pathways were observational and demonstrated marked variation with no clear guidelines or imperatives for community psychiatric follow-up. Of four screening tools evaluated, three were suicide-specific and one screened for depression. An evidence-informed approach to safety planning was described using cases. Strategies for aftercare engagement and intervention included two multifaceted approaches, psychotherapy and qualitative insights from older people who self-harmed, carers and clinicians. The qualitative studies identified targets for improved aftercare engagement, focused on individual context, experiences and needs. Conclusion: Dedicated older-adult aftercare interventions with a multifaceted, assertive follow-up approach accompanied by systemic change show promise but require further evaluation. Research is needed to explore the utility of needs assessment compared to screening and evaluate efficacy of safety planning and psychotherapeutic approaches.

AB  - There have been a large number of reports about glial cell dysfunction being related to major psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). In this review, we provide an overview of postmortem studies analyzing the structural changes of glial cells in these three major psychiatric diseases, including the density, number and size of glial cells, and the expression of related markers. Up to May 1, 2021, 108 articles that met the inclusion criteria were identified by searching PubMed and Web of Science. Although most studies evaluating total glial cells did not show abnormalities in the brains of postmortem patients, astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes seem to have specific patterns of changes in each disease. For example, out of 20 studies that evaluated astrocyte markers in MDD, 11 studies found decreased astrocyte marker expression in MDD patients. Similarly, out of 25 studies evaluating oligodendrocyte markers in SCZ, 15 studies showed decreased expression of oligodendrocyte markers in different brain regions of SCZ patients. In addition, activated microglial cells were observed in patients with SCZ, BD, and MDD, but suicide may be a confounding factor for the observed effects. Although the data from the included studies were heterogeneous and this cannot be fully explained at present, it is likely that there are a variety of contributing factors, including the measured brain regions, methods of measurement, gender, age at time of death, and medications.

AB  - Background Relapse and recurrence of depression are common, contributing to the overall burden of depression globally. Accurate prediction of relapse or recurrence while patients are well would allow the identification of high-risk individuals and may effectively guide the allocation of interventions to prevent relapse and recurrence. Aims To review prognostic models developed to predict the risk of relapse, recurrence, sustained remission, or recovery in adults with remitted major depressive disorder. Method We searched the Cochrane Library (current issue); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards); Ovid Embase (1980 onwards); Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards); and Web of Science (1900 onwards) up to May 2021. We included development and external validation studies of multivariable prognostic models. We assessed risk of bias of included studies using the Prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). Results We identified 12 eligible prognostic model studies (11 unique prognostic models): 8 model development-only studies, 3 model development and external validation studies and 1 external validation-only study. Multiple estimates of performance measures were not available and meta-analysis was therefore not necessary. Eleven out of the 12 included studies were assessed as being at high overall risk of bias and none examined clinical utility. Conclusions Due to high risk of bias of the included studies, poor predictive performance and limited external validation of the models identified, presently available clinical prediction models for relapse and recurrence of depression are not yet sufficiently developed for deploying in clinical settings. There is a need for improved prognosis research in this clinical area and future studies should conform to best practice methodological and reporting guidelines.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, age-related, neurodegenerative disease whose etiology, pathology, and clinical manifestations remain incompletely understood. As a result, care focuses primarily on symptoms relief. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large class of mostly noncoding RNAs that accumulate with aging in the brain and are increasingly shown to regulate all aspects of neuronal and glial development and function. They are generated by the spliceosome through the backsplicing of linear RNA. Although their biological role remains largely unknown, they have been shown to regulate transcription and splicing, act as decoys for microRNAs and RNA binding proteins, used as templates for translation, and serve as scaffolding platforms for signaling components. Considering that they are stable, diverse, and detectable in easily accessible biofluids, they are deemed promising biomarkers for diagnosing diseases. CircRNAs are differentially expressed in the brain of patients with PD, and growing evidence suggests that they regulate PD pathogenetic processes. Here, the biogenesis, expression, degradation, and detection of circRNAs, as well as their proposed functions, are reviewed. Thereafter, research linking circRNAs to PD-related processes, including aging, alpha-synuclein dysregulation, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress is highlighted, followed by recent evidence for their use as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for PD.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly described as a disorder of communication and socialization. However, motor abnormalities are also common in ASD. New technologies may offer quantitative and automatic metrics to measure movement difficulties. We sought to identify computational methods to automatize the assessment of motor impairments in ASD. We systematically searched for the terms 'autism', 'movement', 'automatic', 'computational' and 'engineering' in IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), Medline and Scopus databases and reviewed the literature from inception to 2018. We included all articles discussing: (1) automatic assessment/new technologies, (2) motor behaviours and (3) children with ASD. We excluded studies that included patient's or parent's reported outcomes as online questionnaires that focused on computational models of movement, but also eye tracking, facial emotion or sleep. In total, we found 53 relevant articles that explored static and kinetic equilibrium, like posture, walking, fine motor skills, motor synchrony and movements during social interaction that can be impaired in individuals with autism. Several devices were used to capture relevant motor information such as cameras, 3D cameras, motion capture systems, accelerometers. Interestingly, since 2012, the number of studies increased dramatically as technologies became less invasive, more precise and more affordable. Open-source software has enabled the extraction of relevant data. In a few cases, these technologies have been implemented in serious games, like "Pictogram Room", to measure the motor status and the progress of children with ASD. Movement computing opens new perspectives for patient assessment in ASD research, enabling precise characterizations in experimental and at-home settings, and a better understanding of the role of sensorimotor disturbances in the development of social cognition and ASD. These methods would likely enable researchers and clinicians to better distinguish ASD from other motors disorders while facilitating an improved monitoring of children's progress in more ecological settings (i.e. at home or school).

AB  - Background: Patients with functional somatic syndromes (FSS) experience stigma which arguably affects their health.
   Aim: To determine the presence of perceived stigma and its effects on physical and mental health in patients with FSS compared to patients with comparable explained conditions.
   Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Library was performed to select studies focusing on stigma perceived by patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), fibmmyalgia (FM) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), comparing these patients to patients with comparable but explained conditions.
   Results: We identified 1931 studies after duplicate removal. After screening we included eight studies: one study about all three FSS, one about IBS, five about FM and one about CFS. We found that patients with IBS did not consistently experience higher levels of stigma than those with a comparable explained condition. Patients with CFS and FM experienced higher levels of stigma compared to patients with comparable explained conditions. All studies showed a correlation between stigma and negative health outcomes.
   Discussion: Patients with FSS experience stigma and negative health outcomes. However, experiencing stigma is not restricted to patients with FSS, as many patients with explained health conditions also experience stigma. Whether stigma has more negative health consequences in patients with FSS compared to patients with explained health conditions remains unclear and should be assessed in future research.

AB  - Objective: The efficacy and safety of adjunctive magnetic seizure therapy (MST) for patients with schizophrenia are unclear. This systematic review was conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of adjunctive MST for schizophrenia.Methods: Chinese (WanFang and Chinese Journal Net) and English (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library) databases were systematically searched.Results: Two open-label self-controlled studies (n = 16) were included and analyzed in this review. In these studies, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores significantly decreased from baseline to post-MST (all Ps < 0.05), without serious adverse neurocognitive effects. Mixed findings on the neurocognitive effects of adjunctive MST for schizophrenia were reported in the two studies. A discontinuation rate of treatment of up to 50% (4/8) was reported in both studies. The rate of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was evaluated in only one study, where the most common ADRs were found to be dizziness (25%, 2/8) and subjective memory loss (12.5%, 1/8).Conclusion: There is inconsistent evidence for MST-related adverse neurocognitive effects and preliminary evidence for the alleviation of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.

AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading inherited cause of autism and intellectual disability, resulting from a mutation in the FMR1 gene and subsequent loss of its protein product FMRP. Despite this simple genetic origin, FXS is a phenotypically complex disorder with a range of physical and neurocognitive disruptions. While numerous molecular and cellular pathways are affected by FMRP loss, there is growing evidence that circuit hyperexcitability may be a common convergence point that can account for many of the wide-ranging phenotypes seen in FXS. The mechanisms for hyperexcitability in FXS include alterations to excitatory synaptic function and connectivity, reduced inhibitory neuron activity, as well as changes to ion channel expression and conductance. However, understanding the impact of FMR1 mutation on circuit function is complicated by the inherent plasticity in neural circuits, which display an array of homeostatic mechanisms to maintain activity near set levels. FMRP is also an important regulator of activity-dependent plasticity in the brain, meaning that dysregulated plasticity can be both a cause and consequence of hyperexcitable networks in FXS. This makes it difficult to separate the direct effects of FMR1 mutation from the myriad and pleiotropic compensatory changes associated with it, both of which are likely to contribute to FXS pathophysiology. Here we will: (1) review evidence for hyperexcitability and homeostatic plasticity phenotypes in FXS models, focusing on similarities/differences across brain regions, cell-types, and developmental time points; (2) examine how excitability and plasticity disruptions interact with each other to ultimately contribute to circuit dysfunction in FXS; and (3) discuss how these synaptic and circuit deficits contribute to disease-relevant behavioral phenotypes like epilepsy and sensory hypersensitivity. Through this discussion of where the current field stands, we aim to introduce perspectives moving forward in FXS research.

KW  - RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL
KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Objective: Stress and burnout are serious problems that impair the well-being and academic performance of medical students. Published systematic reviews and meta-analyses on interventions to reduce the stress experienced by medical students did not conclude which interventions are the most effective due to the heterogeneity of the studies. To enhance the hierarchy of evidence, our study selected only randomized controlled studies. The aims were to obtain more reliable outcomes and to precisely summarize the specific interventions which effectively reduce the stress levels and burnout of medical students.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. Medical databases (Embase, Ovid, and CINAHL) were searched for relevant randomized controlled studies published up to December 2019. Two treatment timepoints (postintervention, and the 6-month follow-up) were chosen. Stress measure outcomes were the main outcomes. A random effects model was used. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.
   Results: Six high-quality studies were found. They compared the efficacies of mindfulness-based interventions and clerkship as usual (N = 689). The stress measurement scores of each mindfulness-based intervention at postintervention were significantly better than those of the control groups, with medium effect size and low heterogeneity (95% CI 0.07-0.51; p = 0.01; I-squared index = 45%). At the 6-month follow-up, the mindfulness groups had significantly better results than the control groups, with medium effect size and negligible heterogeneity (95% CI 0.06-0.55; p = 0.02; I-squared index = 0%).
   Discussion: The results indicate that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in reducing subjective stress in medical students at both the short- and long-term intervention timepoints.

AB  - Purpose To reduce rates of homelessness, recent efforts have been directed toward developing non-conditional supported housing programs that prioritize the delivery of housing support and individual services, without tenancy conditions (i.e. maintaining sobriety and adhering to mental health treatment). As promising as these programs are, findings generally show that while housing stability is improved, other individual outcomes remain largely unchanged. No review to date has synthesized the collective evidence base of non-conditional housing programs, rather the focus has been on specific programs of delivery (e.g. Housing First) or on specific population groups (e.g. those with mental illness). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the extent to which non-conditional housing interventions improve housing and well-being outcomes for all persons. Design/methodology/approach A systematic search of the literature was conducted for randomized controlled studies that evaluated the effectiveness of a non-conditional housing intervention in improving housing and health outcomes among any participant group. Findings A total of 31 studies were included in this review. Non-conditional supported housing programs were found to be most effective in improving housing stability as compared to health and well-being outcomes. Policymakers should consider this when developing non-conditional supported housing programs and ensure that housing and other health-related outcomes are also mutually supported. Originality/value This is the first review, to the authors' knowledge, to synthesize the collective impact of all non-conditional supported housing programs. The current findings may inform the (re)design and implementation of supported housing models to prioritize the health and well-being of residents.

AB  - Recent advances in second-person neuroscience have allowed the underlying neural mechanisms involved in teaching-learning interactions to be better understood. Teaching is not merely a one-way transfer of information from teacher to student; it is a complex interaction that requires metacognitive and mentalizing skills to understand others' intentions and integrate information regarding oneself and others. Physiotherapy involving therapists instructing patients on how to improve their motor skills is a clinical field in which teaching-learning interactions play a central role. Accumulating evidence suggests that non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) modulates cognitive functions; however, NIBS approaches to teaching-learning interactions are yet to be utilized in rehabilitation. In this review, I evaluate the present research into NIBS and its role in enhancing metacognitive and mentalizing abilities; I then review hyperscanning studies of teaching-learning interactions and explore the potential clinical applications of NIBS in rehabilitation. Dual-brain stimulation using NIBS has been developed based on findings of brain-to-brain synchrony in hyperscanning studies, and it is delivered simultaneously to two individuals to increase inter-brain synchronized oscillations at the stimulated frequency. Artificial induction of brain-to-brain synchrony has the potential to promote instruction-based learning. The brain-to-brain interface, which induces inter-brain synchronization by adjusting the patient's brain activity, using NIBS, to the therapist's brain activity, could have a positive effect on both therapist-patient interactions and rehabilitation outcomes. NIBS based on second-person neuroscience has the potential to serve as a useful addition to the current neuroscientific methods used in complementary interventions for rehabilitation.

AB  - Background: Lifestyle Medicine (LM) aims to address six main behavioral domains: diet/nutrition, substance use (SU), physical activity (PA), social relationships, stress management, and sleep. Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) have been used to improve these domains. However, there is no consensus on how to measure lifestyle and its intermediate outcomes aside from measuring each behavior separately. We aimed to describe (1) the most frequent lifestyle domains addressed by DHIs, (2) the most frequent outcomes used to measure lifestyle changes, and (3) the most frequent DHI delivery methods.Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-ScR) Extension for Scoping Reviews. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science for publications since 2010. We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials using DHI to promote health, behavioral, or lifestyle change.Results: Overall, 954 records were identified, and 72 systematic reviews were included. Of those, 35 conducted meta-analyses, 58 addressed diet/nutrition, and 60 focused on PA. Only one systematic review evaluated all six lifestyle domains simultaneously; 1 systematic review evaluated five lifestyle domains; 5 systematic reviews evaluated 4 lifestyle domains; 14 systematic reviews evaluated 3 lifestyle domains; and the remaining 52 systematic reviews evaluated only one or two domains. The most frequently evaluated domains were diet/nutrition and PA. The most frequent DHI delivery methods were smartphone apps and websites.Discussion: The concept of lifestyle is still unclear and fragmented, making it hard to evaluate the complex interconnections of unhealthy behaviors, and their impact on health. Clarifying this concept, refining its operationalization, and defining the reporting guidelines should be considered as the current research priorities. DHIs have the potential to improve lifestyle at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of prevention-but most of them are targeting clinical populations. Although important advances have been made to evaluate DHIs, some of their characteristics, such as the rate at which they become obsolete, will require innovative research designs to evaluate long-term outcomes in health.

AB  - Background Gender discrimination (GD) has been frequently linked to mental health. The heterogeneity of how GD is defined has led to variation around the analysis of GD. This might affect the study of the association between GD and health outcomes. The main goal of this systematic scoping review is to operationalize the definition of the GD construct. Methods Three search strategies were set in Pubmed, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The first strategy obtained results mainly about women, while the second focused on men. The third strategy focused on the identification of GD questionnaires. The prevalence of GD, factors and consequences associated with GD perception, and forms of discrimination were the principal variables collected. Risk of bias was assessed (PROSPERO:CRD42019120719). Results Of the 925 studies obtained, 84 were finally included. 60 GD questionnaires were identified. GD prevalence varied between 3.4 and 67 %. Female gender and a younger age were the factors most frequently related to GD. Poorer mental health was the most frequent consequence. Two components of the GD construct were identified: undervaluation (different recognition, opportunities in access, evaluation standards and expectations) and different treatment (verbal abuse and behaviour). Conclusions Two-component GD definition can add order and precision to the measurement, increase response rates and reported GD.

TI  - Examining the evidence for best practice guidelines in supportive supervision of lay health care providers in humanitarian emergencies: A systematic scoping review
KW  - WORKERS
KW  - MIDDLE
AB  - Background Supervision is widely recognised as an important form of support for lay health service providers. However, guidance in appropriate supervision practices for task-shifting health interventions within the unique context of humanitarian emergencies is lacking. This review set out to identify empirically supported features of supervisory practices for lay health care providers in humanitarian emergencies, towards a stronger evidential basis for best practice in supportive supervision. Methods In January 2021, six databases and five non-governmental organizations' web sites were searched for articles examining the effectiveness of supervision for health care interventions delivered by lay providers in humanitarian settings. The inclusion criteria for study selection were qualitative or quantitative primary studies, articles published in peer reviewed journals or technical reports and the availability of the studies in English. The outcomes of interest were client clinical outcomes, health service efficiency and sustainability, and lay health care providers well-being. All articles were independently reviewed by the first and last authors. Results A total of 3371 articles were initially identified, with a total of 11 articles retained following the systematic screening process (two quantitative, four mixed methods and five qualitative studies). All studies generally reported positive impacts of supportive supervision on client outcomes, service sustainability, staff well-being and staff performance. Only four studies offered emotional support as part of supportive supervision. No studies evaluated the effect of supportive supervision on service efficiency. The narrative synthesis suggests significant challenges with providing supportive supervision, including excessive workloads, difficult supervisory relationships, geographic dispersion of lay providers, safety concerns, poorly trained supervisors, and lack of supervisory guidelines. Conclusions More efforts are needed to prioritize supportive supervision in task -shifting frameworks and to ensure that supervision is regular, consistent and of high-quality, with well-trained and well-supported supervisors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Occupational health and safety (OHS) is a complex system due to its three components, namely human, technological and organizational factors. The interplay between the three systems causes workplace accidents and, subsequently, injuries. The body of research currently available demonstrates a disparity in the focus on contributors that cause mining-related injuries beyond the presence of hazards.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to systematically review and synthesise peer-reviewed published studies that have investigated whether certain individual characteristics, behavioural factors and job-related factors predict mining-related injuries.
   METHODS: Databases were searched and peer-reviewed publications from 2004 to 2020 were retrieved and analysed. Only 24 from 3073 identified articles were retained for review and synthesis following careful screening. Most identified studies were either cross-sectional or case-control studies, and they were rated as moderate-to-good quality.
   RESULTS: The review results showed that there is a diverging view in relation to risk factors that cause mining-related injuries. Some publications suggested that old age, male miners, married miners, less educated miners, less experienced miners, alcohol and drug usage, poor working conditions, poor management or supervision, job dissatisfaction and job stress predict injury events while other studies found contradictory relationships or insignificant statistical associations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that studied risk factors have been well-established in other industries, there is a significant gap in mining that needs further examination. It is imperative that health and safety intervention strategies are devised and implemented for vulnerable groups.

AB  - Men diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer experience severe adverse effects on quality of life (QoL) and metabolic health, some of which may be preventable or reversible with exercise, the benefits of which healthcare providers and patients increasingly acknowledge, though existing evidence on its effects varies in significance and magnitude. We aimed to review the effect of exercise on QoL and metabolic health in a broad prostate cancer population. A systematic search was conducted in nine databases and eligible trials were included in the meta-analytic procedure. All outcomes were stratified into aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and a combination of both. The review identified 33 randomised controlled trials (2567 participants) eligible for inclusion. Exercise had a borderline small positive effect on cancer-specific QoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.01-0.22), and a moderate to large effect on cardiovascular fitness (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI 0.34-0.59) with aerobic exercise being the superior modality (SMD = 0.60, 95% CI 0.29-0.90). A positive significant effect was seen in lower body strength, whole-body fat mass, general mental health, and blood pressure. No significant effect was seen in fatigue, lean body mass, and general physical health. We thereby conclude that exercise is effective in improving metabolic health in men diagnosed with prostate cancer, with aerobic exercise as the superior modality. The effect of exercise on QoL was small and not mediated by choice of exercise modality.

AB  - Background: There is a significant prevalence of new onset neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), some severe and persistent, in patients with corona virus disease 2019 ( COVID-19). Objective: This study reports on the use of electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) to treat NPS associated with COVID-19. Methods: A review of the literature pertaining to the use of ECT in patients with COVID-19 and NPS was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. Search terms included "Electroconvulsive Therapy" and "ECT," combined with "COVID-19" and "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS-COV-2 )." In addition, we present a case in which ECT was used to achieve complete remission in a patient who developed new onset, treatment-resistant depression, psychosis, and catatonia, associated with COVID-19. Results: A total of 67 articles were reviewed with 3 selected for inclusion. These articles detailed 3 case reports of patients with new onset NPS (mania, psychosis and suicidality, and catatonia) that developed in the context of active COVID-19 and were treated successfully with ECT. Conclusions: ECT, a broad-spectrum treatment that has been found to be effective in various NPS (independent of etiology), is shown in our case report and others, to be safe and effective for NPS associated with COVID-19. Although we identified only 3 other cases in the literature, we believe that the probable antiinflammatory mechanism of ECT, its safety and tolerability, and the faster time to symptom remission support the need for more research and increased clinician awareness about this life-saving procedure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In an increasingly competitive marketplace, workers struggle to find a good balance between work and personal life. Difficulties in fulfilling the demands arising from these different domains may undermine employees' well-being and job-related outcomes, thereby, impairing organizational productivity.
   OBJECTIVE: Does resilience play a relevant role in relation to work-life interface? And, if so, how is resilience related to its three facets (i.e., work-life conflict, enrichment, and balance)? To answer these questions, the current paper systematically reviews studies analysing the role of resilience in the work-life interface.
   METHODS: A key terms literature search was performed using multiple electronic databases (i.e., Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed) without setting any publication date limitation. The review process followed the international PRISMA statement guidelines. A quality assessment was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.
   RESULTS: A total of 26 eligible papers published between 2009 and 2020 were included. Among these, 6 employed a qualitative design, while 20 studies adopted a quantitative design mostly examining resilience as antecedent. Data were predominantly collected in the healthcare sector. Resilience was mainly analysed in relation to work-life conflict. The most commonly used theoretical framework was Conservation of Resources theory.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, resilience was negatively associated with work-life conflict and positively related to both work-life balance and enrichment. A positive work-life balance can promote resilience, but resilience can also help workers to balance work and life. Additionally, resilience can protect from the negative effects of both work-life imbalance and work-life conflict on workers' health and job-related outcomes.

Because it arises from the objects' electromagnetic response, the necessary calculations in quantum field theory are most naturally expressed in terms of electromagnetic scattering from each object. In this review, we illustrate a variety of such techniques, with a focus on those that can be expressed in terms of surface effects, including both idealized boundary conditions and their physical realization in terms of material properties.

AB  - Dissociative disorders (DD) and conversion disorders (CD) are frequent in general and psychiatric populations. Some evidence suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) are dysregulated in both disorders. We carried out a systematic review of the literature to summarize the existing knowledge on the stress response, via HPA and/or ANS, in patients with DD, CD, or dissociative symptoms. We systematically searched Medline and Web of Science using the Medical Subject Headings related to stress axis, CD, DD, and dissociative symptoms following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses guidelines. Results suggest that in participants without psychiatric history, high cortisol secretion is related to high dissociation scores. Conversely the stress system might be blunted in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder who develop dissociative symptoms. Stress response changes seem to be associated with the emergence and persistence of dissociative and conversion disorders. Hence, monitoring the stress response and examining closely the history of stress exposure in DD and CD should be encouraged in future larger studies.

AB  - Introduction: Rural and remote nurses are often involved in disaster response. These nurses are faced with unique challenges in their daily practice due to geographical isolation and reduced resources. Nurses' roles and experiences in times of disaster have been discussed in the past; however, in the setting of rural and remote areas it remains largely underreported. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the literature regarding the experiences of rural and remote nurses during and following disasters. Disasters affect all areas of the world.Methods: This scoping review was guided by Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for scoping reviews. Electronic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane, Joanna Briggs Institute and Embase were searched. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was used to guide the reporting of this review. Key concepts and themes were identified using Braun and Clarke's six-step framework for thematic analysis.Results: Eight articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Themes that were identified included disaster roles, pre-disaster preparations, psychological and emotional states, and community involvement and relationships.Conclusion: Minimal literature exists that explores what rural and remote nurses experience in times of disaster. In this review, the experience of rural and remote nurses included the relationships between their personal and professional obligations and their influence on nurses' ability to respond to disasters. Further research is required in this domain to better understand the phenomena and address knowledge gaps that exist in the existing literature.

AB  - Introduction: For rural and remote clinicians, quality education is often difficult to access because of geographic isolation, travel, time, expense constraints and lack of an onsite educator. The aims of this integrative review were to examine what telehealth education is available to rural practitioners, evaluate the existence and characteristics of telehealth education for rural staff, evaluate current telehealth education models, establish the quality of education provided through telehealth along with the facilitators or enablers of a successful service and develop recommendations for supporting and developing an education model for rural and remote health practitioners through telehealth.
   Methods An integrative review was conducted following the five-stage integrative review process. Searches were conducted in the electronic databases CINAHL, Medline, Nursing & Allied Health (Proquest), PubMed, Johanna Briggs Institute Evidence Based Practice (JBI EBP) and Embase.
   Results: Initial searches revealed more than 7000 articles; final inclusion and exclusion criteria refined results to 60 articles to be included in this review. Included articles were original research, case studies, reviews or randomised controlled studies. Countries of origin were countries in North and Central America, the UK, Europe, and Africa, and Australia and India. One issue noted with this review was classifying rural and remote; contexts used included rural, remote, regional, isolated, peripheral, native communities and outer regional or inner regional.
   Sample sizes in the studies ranged from 20 to more than 1000 participants, covering a broad range of health education topics. Delivery was mostly by a didactic approach and case presentations. Some included a mix of videoconferencing with face-to-face sessions. Overall, telehealth education was well received, with participants reporting mostly positive outcomes as signified by feeling less isolated and more supported.
   One interesting result was that quality in telehealth education is poorly established as there appears to be no definitions or consensus on what constitutes quality in the delivery of telehealth education. Very few studies formally tested increase in skill or knowledge, which is usual with professional development programs that do not result in further qualifications. For those that did assess these, formal knowledge and skills assessment indicated that telehealth using videoconferencing is comparable to face-to-face training with significant benefits related to travel reduction and therefore cost. Recommendations were difficult to synthesise because of the broad issues uncovered and lack of quality in many of the studies.
   Conclusion: The applications for telehealth are still evolving, with some applications having poor evidence to support use. Overall, telehealth education is well received and supported, with positives outweighing negatives. Anything that can improve connection with a community and decrease isolation experienced by rural clinicians can only be beneficial. However, further planning and evaluation of the quality of delivery of telehealth education and addressing how education outcomes can be measured needs to be addressed in this widely growing area of telehealth.

AB  - Psychological stress during childhood and adolescence increases risk of health problems across the lifecourse, and inflammation is implicated as an underlying mechanism. To evaluate the viability of this hypothesis, we used meta-analysis to quantify the association between childhood/adolescent stress and inflammation over the lifecourse. Furthermore, we addressed three unresolved conceptual questions: (a) Does the strength of this association change over the lifecourse? (b) Are different types of childhood/adolescent stressors differentially associated with inflammation? (c) And which components of the inflammatory response are involved? A systematic search identified 187 articles reporting 922 associations. Meta-analyses were conducted using a three-level multilevel approach and controlled for study quality, conversion confidence, and whether effect sizes were unadjusted or adjusted (n = 662, 72%). Results indicated a small but reliable overall adjusted association ((r) over cap = .04). The magnitude of the association strengthened across the lifecourse-effect sizes were smallest in studies that measured inflammation in childhood ((r) over cap = .02) and became progressively larger in studies of adolescence ((r) over cap = .04) and adulthood ((r) over cap = .05), suggesting the impact of early stress strengthens with time. By contrast, effect sizes did not vary by adversity type (socioeconomic disadvantage, maltreatment, other interpersonal stressors, and cumulative exposure across stressors), or component of inflammation (circulating biomarkers of low-grade inflammation vs. cytokine responses to microbial stimuli). Implications and future directions are discussed. Public Significance StatementStressful experiences during the early decades of life increase susceptibility to health problems across the lifespan. Excessive inflammation is thought to be an important biological mediator of this relationship, but there has yet to be a comprehensive synthesis of the literature relevant to this hypothesis. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of 187 studies on the association between stress during childhood and/or adolescence and inflammation that were performed over the past 2 decades. The results indicated that inflammatory markers were higher among individuals who had experienced major psychological stress during childhood and/or adolescence. The relationship between childhood/adolescent stress and inflammatory markers increased in magnitude over the lifecourse, suggesting the influence of early adversity may compound with time. These findings refine our understanding of the role that inflammation plays in connecting early stress and lifecourse health.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are particles and fragments of plastic materials of the size < 5 mm. The most popular ones include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), polyurethane (PUR), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The article presents issues related to the pollution of the environment by MPs as a byproduct of plastic decay, and the resulting health hazards. Aim of the study: Showcasing the negative effects of environmental exposure to MPs on the human health and the necessity of taking action to raise social awareness as far as the handling of plastic waste is concerned. Method: Bibliometry was used in the study as a means of evaluating the area of research related to environmental exposure to MPs. A literature review was carried out by browsing through the PubMed database, including articles written in English, using the advanced search option, on the basis of key words or their combinations and a set time frame. Some of the articles included in the review were found in the Google Scholar browser, also through the use of key words. Results: In the scope of the analysed database, there has been an increase in the interest in the topic of MPs, especially environmental exposure, which dominates the areas of interest of scientists. MPs may be a threat to human health, and consequently a cause of many illnesses, including chronic conditions of the respiratory system, depression, liver damage, obesity, and cancers. Conclusions: Environmental exposure to MPs may be the cause of chronic conditions of the respiratory system, as well as other organs. Both now and in the future, the subject of MPs is bound to remain an important global issue, not only because of the pollution of the environment with plastic waste, but also the impact of this pollutant on the health of animals and people.

AB  - Aging is the greatest risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that mechanisms driving the aging process promote PD neurodegeneration. Several lines of evidence support a role for aging in PD. First, hallmarks of brain aging such as mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, loss of protein homeostasis, and neuroinflammation are centrally implicated in PD development. Second, mutations that cause monogenic PD are present from conception, yet typically only cause disease following a period of aging. Third, lifespan-extending genetic, dietary, or pharmacological interventions frequently attenuate PD-related neurodegeneration. These observations support a central role for aging in disease development and suggest that new discoveries in the biology of aging could be leveraged to elucidate novel mechanisms of PD pathophysiology. A recent rapid growth in our understanding of conserved molecular pathways that govern model organism lifespan and healthspan has highlighted a key role for metabolism and nutrient sensing pathways. Uncovering how metabolic pathways involving NAD+ consumption, insulin, and mTOR signaling link to the development of PD is underway and implicates metabolism in disease etiology. Here, we assess areas of convergence between nervous system aging and PD, evaluate the link between metabolism, aging, and PD and address the potential of metabolic interventions to slow or halt the onset of PD-related neurodegeneration drawing on evidence from cellular and animal models.

AB  - Background: Music-based interventions may help to alleviate neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia and promote prosocial interactions between individuals living with dementia and their caregivers. However, current literature does not combine these evidence bases toward explanation of how music-based interventions may alleviate symptoms and promote prosocial interactions.
   Objective: We conducted a scoping review to address the following question: what do the evidence bases suggest toward how music therapy or music-based therapeutic interventions might promote prosocial interactions between individuals living with dementia and their caregivers?
   Methods: In this review we focused on: 1) quantitative and qualitative evidence of music-based therapies promoting prosocial behaviors in individuals living with dementia, and 2) potential neurobehavioral mechanisms associated with the processes involved with how music may promote prosocial interactions. Databases included PubMed, EBSCOhost's CINAHL and PsycINFO, Cochrane Library (sub-search conducted using ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, ProQuest's Biological Science Collection, the Journal of Music Therapy, Nordic Journal of Music Therapy, and Google Scholar.
   Results: Sixteen original research studies were included for evidence synthesis. This scoping review reveals the need to define and clarify mechanisms of prosocial interactions between individuals living with dementia and their caregivers considering biological and social factors. These mechanisms may include dynamic interactions between preserved brain regions associated with music-evoked autobiographical memory recall and shifts from negative to positive mood states.
   Conclusion: Defining and clarifying how and to what extent music may promote prosocial behaviors using well-designed and well-controlled mixed-methods studies may positively influence the design of interventions to promote prosocial interactions with caregivers.

AB  - The associations between physiological measures (i.e., heart rate and skin conductance) of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and severe antisocial spectrum behavior (AB) were meta-analyzed. We used an exhaustive partitioning of variables relevant to the ANS-AB association and investigated four highly relevant questions (on declining effect sizes, psychopathy subscales, moderators, and ANS measures) that are thought to be trans formative for future research on AB. We investigated a broad spectrum of physiological measures (e.g., heart rate (variability), pre-ejection period) in relation to AB. The search date for the current meta-analysis was on January 1st, 2020, includes 101 studies and 769 effect sizes. Results indicate that effect sizes are heterogeneous and bidirectional. The careful partitioning of variables sheds light on the complex associations that were obscured in previous meta-analyses. Effects are largest for the most violent offenders and for psychopathy and are dependent on the experimental tasks used, parameters calculated, and analyses run. Understanding the specificity of physiological reactions may be expedient for differentiating between (and within) types of AB.

AB  - Objective. To identify central nervous system (CNS) adverse events potentially associated with prophylaxis or drug treatment for COVID-19, and to describe the characteristic of the individuals affected.Methods. A scoping review was performed using a search strategy to retrieve articles from PubMed, EMBASE, SciELO, Scopus, CINAHL and BVS databases. Studies reporting on individuals receiving prophylactic or cura-tive drugs for COVID-19 with at least one CNS adverse event were included. Articles reporting on CNS adverse events associated with medication for other health conditions were excluded.Results. The search retrieved 1 547 articles, eight of which met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies had an observational design. A total of 3 035 individuals were assessed, of whom 1 701 were health care professio-nals and 1 978 were women. Curative treatment with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and azithromycin was the most frequent (n = 5). The most common adverse events were headache, dizziness, mood disturbances, and drowsiness. Suicide was the most frequent severe event. Six adverse events were unexpected for hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and doxycycline.Conclusion. Potential CNS adverse events were unspecific and in general potentially associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy or associated with antibiotics). The data confirm the unfavorable risk/benefit profile of these drugs for the prevention and management of signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Objective: To review and summarize data on the prevalence of overall personality disorder extracted from SCID-II (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III Axis II Disorders) studies conducted in Turkey with samples consisting of mental health service consumers, and also to elaborate on the level and sources of heterogeneity. Method: MEDLINE, WOS, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect databases as well as the Turkish Psychiatric Database have been systematically searched. Relevant studies conducted with samples composed of psychiatric inpatients or outpatients receiving psychiatric treatment were included. The diagnostic rate of any personality disorder was regarded as the valid indicator of the overall personality disorder prevalence; therefore, papers presenting data not conducive to this goal were excluded. Results: A total of 311 papers were identified, and 55 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Following a critical appraisal of the quality of the data involving point prevalence rates ranging from 20% to 100%, we decided to include 35 studies in the quantitative synthesis. A random-effects meta-analysis followed by a subgroup analysis yielded a summary estimate of 52% [46 - 58%] for the prevalence of overall personality disorder. A high level of overall heterogeneity 84.8% [80.0 - 88.4] was found to persist in each diagnostic subgroup with a particular primary diagnosis. Conclusion: The prevalence estimates derived from the meta-analysis of the SCID-II studies conducted in Turkey support the notion that personality disorder is present in nearly half of the mental health service consumers. That the level of heterogeneity across studies originating from Turkey alone was as high as those observed in previous reviews covering studies originating from various countries suggests that the very source of such heterogeneity might be questionable validity and reliability of SCID-II diagnoses.

AB  - Mental load and fatigue are important causes of performance decreases and accidents in different activities. However, a robust systematic review, detailing the instruments used to quantify them, is currently lacking. The purpose of this study was to summarize and classify by derivations the validated instruments used to quantify mental load and fatigue. The most representative electronic databases in the scope of this review, PubMed, WOS, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO (until September 2020) were searched for studies that included instruments to analyze mental load and fatigue. The quality of the selected studies was scored using a quality assessment checklist. A total of 40 papers were included. Most of the papers used subjective scales (75%) to quantify mental load and fatigue, with a small presence of behavioral (n = 5) and objective techniques (n = 5). Less is known about the analysis of mental load and fatigue using a combination of derivations. Despite the high cost and complexity of objective techniques, research that applies these measures is important for further analysis of brain processes in mental load and fatigue. The design of a battery of tests that include the three types of derivations also seems necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emotional management of workers can not only increase the efficiency of work, but also contribute to the improvement of the productivity of a company.
   OBJECTIVE: This scoping review surveyed the literature to identify the relationship between postural expression and emotion during sedentary tasks.
   METHODS: We searched relevant literature published up to December 1, 2019 using seven electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, and MEDLINE Complete).
   RESULTS: A total of 14 publications were included in this scoping review. It was found that the application of pressure sensor and camera-based measurement equipment was effective. Additionally, it was proposed to predict the emotional state of the worker by using forward and backward movements as the main variable as opposed to left and right movements. The information-based analysis technique was able to further increase the accuracy of workers' emotion prediction.
   CONCLUSIONS: The emotion prediction of workers based on sitting posture could be confirmed for certain movements, and the information-based technical method could further increase the accuracy of prediction. Expansion of information-based technical research will further increase the possibility of predicting the emotions of workers based on posture, and this will in turn promote safer and more efficient work performance.

AB  - The brown mussel Perna perna (Linnaeus, 1758) is a valuable resource for aquaculture in tropical and subtropical coastal regions. It presents desirable characteristics for biomonitoring, including being sessile, widely distributed and abundant, and is a filter-feeder able to accumulate several classes of pollutants (e.g., metals, hydrocarbons, among others). Mussels' biological responses to pollution exposure can be measured as biomarkers, which include alterations ranging from molecular to physiological levels, to estimate the degree of environmental contamination and its effects on biota. This full review compiles two decades (2000-2020) of literature conceming biological effects on P. perna mussel caused by environmental pollutants (i.e., metals, hydrocarbons, and emerging pollutants), considering environmental and farm-based biomonitoring. Biochemical markers related to mussels' oxidative status were efficient for the biomonitoring of metals (i.e., antioxidant enzymes associated with oxidative damage in biomolecules). Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity indicators (i.e., comet, micronucleus, and neutral red assays) provided a depiction of hydrocarbon contamination. The neutral red assay gave a time-concentration cytotoxic response to a wide range of pollutants, including emerging pollutants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and biocides) and hydrocarbons. Perna perna hemocyte parameters provided a useful approach for biocide biomonitoring. This paper summarizes useful biomarkers from molecular to physiological levels in this mussel species used to identify and quantify the degree of coastal pollution. An integrated biomarker analysis may provide a way to overcome possible biomarker variations and assess multi-polluted sites. Nevertheless, it is necessary to investigate biomarker variations according to natural factors (e.g., season and gonad maturation stage) to standardize them for trustworthy biomonitoring.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease conceptualized as a continuous process, ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to the mild, moderate, and severe clinical stages of AD dementia. AD is considered a complex multifactorial disease. Currently, the use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI), such as tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, has been the main treatment for AD patients. Interestingly, there is evidence that ChEI also promotes neuroprotective effects, bringing some benefits to AD patients. The mechanisms by which the ChEI act have been investigated in AD. ChEI can modulate the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is an important signaling cascade that is capable of causing a significant functional impact on neurons by activating cell survival pathways to promote neuroprotective effects. However, there is still a huge challenge in the field of neuroprotection, but in the context of unravelling the details of the PI3K/AKT pathway, a new scenario has emerged for the development of more efficient drugs that act on multiple protein targets. Thus, the mechanisms by which ChEI can promote neuroprotective effects and prospects for the development of new drug candidates for the treatment of AD are discussed in this review.

AB  - Introduction: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, and people with a diversity of sexual and gender identities (LGBTIQ+) residing in rural contexts may face additional challenges to attaining wellbeing, yet a comprehensive understanding of these experiences is lacking. The purpose of the systematic review is to address this knowledge gap. The aims of the review are to progress understanding about rural LGBTIQ+ communities with regard to wellbeing, healthcare access and experience, and barriers and facilitators to health care.
   Methods: Peer-reviewed literature was searched in PubMed, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, and PsychInfo databases, while grey literature was searched using Google Advanced Search. Documents produced between 2015 and 2020 in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and UK were eligible and reference lists were screened. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were adhered to. Relevant data were extracted and synthesized. The quality of the peer-reviewed literature and grey literature was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and the Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, Significance checklist, respectively. At each stage of the study selection process, a second author reviewed a sample of 10% of the articles and documents to ensure consistent application of the inclusion criteria. Consultation within the team was used to resolve any discrepancies encountered.
   Results: The 297 unique peer-reviewed returned records were screened, with 69 full texts assessed for eligibility, resulting in the inclusion of 42 articles. The initial result of 2785 grey documents were similarly screened, resulting in the inclusion of 12 documents. Overall, the included literature was deemed to be of good quality. Synthesis of data resulted in the reporting of findings concerning mental, physical, and sexual wellbeing; healthcare access and experiences with care; and barriers and facilitators to health care for various communities in rural areas. The findings showed rural LGBTIQ+ communities shared many of the health concerns of non-rural LGBTIQ+ communities, as well as encountering similar issues and barriers to the receipt of high-quality appropriate care. However, the evidence also indicates an array of nuanced challenges for communities in rural areas such as a lack of available appropriate providers, and financial and practical barriers concerning the need to travel to obtain the services needed. The intersection of rurality and LGBTIQ+ identity was especially pronounced for rural LGBTIQ+ elders facing potential isolation in the context of declining mobility, service providers experiencing high demand and isolation from professional networks, and for LGBTIQ+ populations negotiating the complexities of disclosure in interactions with health professionals. The latter three findings in particular extend on the existing knowledge base.
   Conclusion: Investment is needed in the design, trialling, and evaluation of tailored models of care, which account for the specific challenges encountered in providing services to rural LGBTIQ+ communities. Such models, should also harness identified facilitators for rural LGBTIQ+ wellbeing, including the use of online technologies. Dedicated study is merited to inform policy and practice for aged care services in rural areas. Further, the development and implementation of strategies to support rural health service providers is warranted.

KW  - STANCE
AB  - Writing at a postgraduate level is not only meant to obtain a degree in a specific field but also, and more importantly, to secure that one's research is published nationally as well as internationally. In other words, conducting research is first and foremost about making one's distinctive voice heard. Using Martin and White's (2005) appraisal framework, the present study examines the way Tunisian MA and PhD EFL researchers in applied linguistics establish a dialogue with the reader as a persuasive tool in their texts. The comparison is meant to unveil cross-generic differences in authorial voice manifestation that distinguish postgraduate writers at different degrees. A corpus of 20 Literature Review and 20 Discussion sections taken from 10 MA and 10 PhD dissertations written in English by Tunisian EFL writers is qualitatively and quantitatively explored. Linguistic markers denoting the writer's stance are identified in the corpus and are qualitatively studied using the engagement subsystem to qualify the utterance as dialogically contractive or expansive. A quantitative analysis then compares how dialogicality is manifested across the degrees and sections using SPSS. The results show that the negotiation of voice seems to be more problematic for MA researchers in both sections in comparison to PhD writers. Dialogic contraction in the MA subcorpus conveys a limited authorial positioning in the Literature Review section and a failure to stress personal contribution in the Discussion section. PhD researchers' frequent reliance on expansion in both sections displays their academic maturity. The critical evaluation of previous works in the Literature Review and the claim for authorial ownership in the Discussion section distinguish them from MA writers. The comparison not only stresses the strengths that distinguish PhD writers but also points out problematic instances in establishing a dialogue with the audience in postgraduate writings. The study findings can be used to consider EFL researchers' production in pedagogical contexts in terms of identity manifestation and stance-taking strategies across the different sections of the dissertation.

AB  - Background: Oxidative stress has a significant role in the commencement and development of hyperglycemia. Vanadium, as a transitional metal with redox properties, enters the redox process, produces free radicals, and distracts the pro-antioxidant balance. The present animal systematic review aimed to assess the effect of vanadium supplementation on inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers in diabetes-induced animals.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the PubMed, Scopus, and web of science databases from 1990 to 2021, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search strategy was based on the guidelines for systematic review of animal experiments and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). Criteria for eligibility were animal-based studies, evaluating the therapeutic effects of vanadium on inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in diabetes. The Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool was used for assessing the methodological quality of included studies.
   Results: In the present study, 341 articles were evaluated out of which 42 studies were eligible for inclusion. The majority of the studies confirmed the advantageous properties of vanadium on inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers. A minor risk of bias was reported, based on the SYRCLE's tool.
   Conclusion: According to the findings, well-designed clinical trials are warranted to assess the long-lasting effects of various vanadium compounds on inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers.

AB  - Background: Touchscreen cognitive tools opened new promising opportunities for the early detection of cognitive impairment; however, most research studies are conducted in English-speaking populations and high-income countries, with a gap in knowledge about their use in populations with cultural, linguistic, and educational diversity.
   Objective: To review the touchscreen tools used in primary care settings for the cognitive assessment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, with a focus on populations of different cultures, languages, and literacy.
   Methods: This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were identified by searching across MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, OVID, SCOPUS, SCIELO, LILACS, and by cross-referencing. All studies that provide a first-level cognitive assessment for MCI and dementia with any touchscreen tools suitable to be used in the context of primary care were included.
   Results: Forty-two studies reporting on 30 tools and batteries were identified. Substantial differences among the tools emerged, in terms of theoretical framework, clinical validity, and features related to the application in clinical practice. A small proportion of the tools are available in multiple languages. Only 7 out of the 30 tools have a multiple languages validation. Only two tools are validated in low-educated samples, e.g., IDEA and mSTS-MCI.
   Conclusion: General practitioners can benefit from touchscreen cognitive tools. However, easy requirements of the device, low dependence on the examiner, fast administration, and adaptation to different cultures and languages are some of the main features that we need to take into consideration when implementing touchscreen cognitive tools in the culture and language of underrepresented populations.

AB  - Background: The relationship between osteoarthritis (OA) and risk of dementia and cognitive impairment (CIM) has long been debated; however, uncertainties still persist.
   Objective: The aim of our present meta-analysis and systematic review was to roundly illuminate the association between OA and the risk of dementia and CIM.
   Methods: We identified relevant studies by searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to October 2021. The relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were aggregated using random-effects methods. Credibility of each meta-analysis was assessed. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were conducted. Publication bias was explored using funnel plot.
   Results: Of 21,925 identified literatures, 8 were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and 19 observational studies involving 724,351 individuals were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of developing dementia and CIM among OA patients was demonstrated in 11 prospective studies (RR=1.42, 95% CI=1.07-1.86, I-2=98.9%, p<0.001), 2 retrospective cohort studies (RR=1.35, 95% CI=1.19-1.52, I-2=61.0%, p=0.109), 3 retrospective case-control studies (OR=1.21, 95% CI=0.96-1.53, I-2=95.2%, p<0.001), and 4 cross-sectional studies (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.09-2.09, I-2=75.8%, p=0.006). Meta-regression analyses did not find any valid moderators. Heterogeneity in subgroup analyses for population age, OA location, year of publication, outcome type, adjusted for BMI, depression, and comorbidity decreased to zero. No significant evidence of publication bias was found.
   Conclusion: OA associated with an increased risk of dementia and CIM. Effective interventions in OA patients may decrease new incidence of dementia or CIM.

AB  - Sirtuins, a class III histone/protein deacetylase, is a central regulator of metabolic function and cellular stress response. This plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, metabolic syndromes, and cardiovascular disease. Sirtuins regulate biological and cellular processes, for instance, mitochondrial biogenesis, lipid and fatty acid oxidation, oxidative stress, gene transcriptional activity, apoptosis, inflammatory response, DNA repair mechanism, and autophagic cell degradation, which are known components for the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Emerging evidence suggests that sirtuins are the useful molecular targets against NDDs like, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, the exact mechanism of neuroprotection mediated through sirtuins remains unsettled. The manipulation of sirtuins activity with its modulators, calorie restriction (CR), and micro RNAs (miR) is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of NDDs. Herein, we reviewed the current putative therapeutic role of sirtuins in regulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions, which are mediated through the different molecular phenomenon to prevent neurodegeneration. We also explained the implications of sirtuin modulators, and miR based therapies for the treatment of life-threatening NDDs.

AB  - Background: Self-stigma in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) can substantially impact quality of life and possibilities for social participation. An integrative analysis of determinants of self-stigma has been lacking.
   Objective: We sought to explore which complementary insights from qualitative and quantitative studies, as well as from expert consultation, could be gained. Methods: An established mixed methods study design was employed to first conduct a mixed methods scoping review of published qualitative and quantitative literature, and then consult with experts to arrive at an exhaustive list of determinants of self-stigma after a thematic synthesis.
   Results: A total of 87 unique determinants of self-stigma were identified. Quantitative studies and expert consultations mainly identified personal determinants of people with self-stigma (e.g., age, anxiety, or apathy). In contrast, qualitative studies identified social situations associated with self-stigma (e.g., joint meals of people with typical PD with others). Notably, self-stigma of people with PD was found to be particularly salient in unfamiliar places, at the working place or in contact with people without PD. Across methods, cognitive impairment, tremor, and abnormal walk and unsteady gait, respectively, were associated with self-stigma.
   Conclusion: The mixed method study design yielded complementary insights, but also factors commonly associated with self-stigma across methods. Future prioritization exercises may gain further insights into self-stigma of people with PD. Facilitating social encounters by both addressing needs of affected people and raising knowledge and public awareness may improve quality of life in people with PD.

AB  - Some psychiatric disorders are mostly overlapping and measures for facilitating differential profiles play a key role in the identification of a disease, course, prognosis, and management. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to (i) explore the association between the components of temperament and character model and three overlap psychiatric diagnoses including avoidant personality disorder (APD), schizoid personality disorder (SPD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD) and (ii) provide differential profiles for each of these disorders. The literature search was performed on 7 international scientific databases for all articles published in English, January 1990-June 2019. The pooled effect sizes were obtained using the correlation coefficients or the standardized mean differences between cases with SAD and healthy controls by the random-effects method. Fifteen correlational studies for APD and SPD and eight case-control studies for SAD met the criteria for entering meta-analysis. All three disorders were positively associated with harm avoidance (HA) and negatively associated with novelty seeking (NS), self-directedness (SD), and cooperativeness. APD and SPD were also negatively associated with reward dependence (RD). The differential profiles are as follows: NS (APD < SAD), HA (APD > SPD, SAD), RD (SPD < APD < SAD), SD (APD < SPD, SAD), cooperativeness (APD, SPD < SAD), and self-transcendence (ST: APD > SPD, SAD). It seems that HA, SD, and cooperativeness are the common core of these three diagnostic categories. More extreme tendencies in NS and RD, along with ST with a lower possibility, are the main traits in the differential profiles.

AB  - Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies often exhibit autoimmune features, including CD4(+) and some CD8(+) T lymphocytes that recognize epitopes derived from alpha-synuclein. While neurons have long been considered to not present antigens, recent data indicate that they can be induced to do so, particularly in response to interferons and other forms of stress. Here, we review literature on neuronal antigen presentation and its potential role in PD. Although direct evidence for CD8(+) T cell-mediated neuronal death is lacking in PD, neuronal antigen presentation appears central to the pathology of Rasmussen's encephalitis, a pediatric neurological disorder driven by cytotoxic T cell infiltration and neuroinflammation. Emerging data suggest that T cells enter the brain in PD and other synucleinopathies, where the majority of neuromelanin-containing substantia nigra and locus coeruleus neurons express MHC Class I molecules. In cell culture, CD8(+) T cell recognition of antigen:MHC Class I complexes on neuronal membranes leads to cytotoxic responses and neuronal cell death. Recent animal models suggest the possibility of T cell autoreactivity to mitochondrial antigens in PD. It remains unclear if neuronal antigen presentation plays a role in PD or other neurodegenerative disorders, and efforts are underway to better elucidate the potential impact of autoimmune responses on neurodegeneration.

AB  - Background: Social media is a powerful tool for engaging diverse audiences in dementia research. However, there is little data summarizing current content exchange in this context.
   Objective: To inform ethical dementia research engagement on social media, we characterized current practices by analyzing public social media posts.
   Methods: We retrieved Facebook (2-year period, N= 7,896) and Twitter (1-year period, N= 9,323) posts containing dementia research-related keywords using manual and machine learning-based search strategies. We performed qualitative and quantitative content and sentiment analyses on random samples (10%) of the posts.
   Results: Top Facebook users were advocacy (45%) and health organizations (25%). On Twitter, academics/researchers were the largest user group. Prevention was the most frequently coded theme (Facebook 30%; Twitter 26%), followed by treatment (Facebook 15%; Twitter 18%). Diagnostics had the highest Facebook engagement. Sharing knowledge was the primary form of content exchange (Facebook 63%; Twitter 80%). Most shared journal articles were peer-reviewed and open access. Emotional tone was overall more positive on Facebook. Justice was a prominent ethics topic regarding inequalities related to identity and intersecting modes of marginalization in dementia research.
   Conclusion: The findings indicate the importance of social media as an engagement tool of current topics in health research and reveal areas of potential for increased engagement. These data can inform consensus-based best practices for ethical social media application in dementia research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgeon's hands are exposed to a range of chemical and physical stressors that influence the integrity of gloves. Thus, glove perforation facilitates pathogen transmission through the holes. Numerous studies have shown that glove perforation is of great importance, but there is still no complete consensus.
   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the safety conditions of surgical gloves based on the incidence of glove perforation among surgical teams.
   METHODS: A literature review was conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ISI, and ProQuest databases. The incidence of glove perforation was reviewed in eight categories. A total of 580 articles were found in the initial search.
   RESULTS: 109 articles containing 130 datasets were analyzed. The overall incidence of glove perforation was 14.44 %. Surgeons had the highest incidence of glove perforation (23.09 %). An increase in the duration of surgery increased the odds of perforation. It was found that 68.58% of the glove perforations were not identified by practitioners.
   CONCLUSION: Despite major advances in the design of surgical gloves, the issue of safety and integrity of gloves has not improved. Due to the high incidence of surgical glove perforations, most of which had not been identified, it is imperative to consider strategies to minimize the incidence of perforation. The results of the present study can be used to integrate information related to the rate of perforation of surgical gloves in different surgeries.

AB  - Depression and psychosis have a developmental component to their origin. Epidemiologic evidence, which we synthesize in this nonsystematic review, suggests that early-life infection, inflammation, and metabolic alterations could play a role in the etiology of these psychiatric disorders. The risk of depression and psychosis is associated with prenatal maternal and childhood infections, which could be mediated by impaired neurodevelopment. Evidence suggests linear dose-response associations between elevated concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers in childhood, particularly the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6, and the risk for depression and psychosis subsequently in early adulthood. Childhood inflammatory markers are also associated with persistence of depressive symptoms subsequently in adolescence and early adulthood. Developmental trajectories reflecting persistently high insulin levels during childhood and adolescence are associated with a higher risk of psychosis in adulthood, whereas increased adiposity during and after puberty is associated with the risk of depression. Together, these findings suggest that higher levels of infection, inflammation, and metabolic alterations commonly seen in people with depression and psychosis could be a cause for, rather than simply a consequence of, these disorders. Therefore, early-life immuno-metabolic alterations, as well as factors influencing these alterations such as adversity or maltreatment, could represent targets for prevention of these psychiatric disorders. Inflammation could also be an important treatment target for depression and psychosis. The field requires further research to examine sensitive periods when exposure to such immuno-metabolic alterations is most harmful. Interventional studies are also needed to test the potential usefulness of targeting early-life immuno-metabolic alterations for preventing adult depression and psychosis.

AB  - Since seafarers are known to be exposed to numerous job-related stress factors that can cause fatigue, sleepiness, and disturbed sleep behaviour, the aim of this review was to provide an overview of the subjective and objective measurement methods of these strains. Using a systematic review, 166 studies were identified within the period of January 2010 to December 2020 using the PubMed database. Of the 21 studies selected, 13 used both subjective and objective measurement methods. Six studies used only subjective and two studies only objective methods. For subjective assessment, 12 different questionnaires could be identified as well as activity and sleeping logs. Actigraphy and reaction time tests (RTT) were the most common objective methods. In single cases, electrooculography (EOG), pupillometry and ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) were used. Measurement-related limitations due to vessel-related impacts were less often reported than expected. No restrictions of daily routines on board were described, and only single-measurement disturbances due to ship movements were mentioned. The present literature review reveals that there are various routines to measure fatigue, sleepiness, and sleep behaviour on board. A combination of subjective and objective methods often appears to be beneficial. The frequent use of actigraphy and RTT on board suggests good feasibility and reliable measurements with these methods. The use of ambulatory PSG in maritime-like contexts suggests that this method would also be feasible on board.

AB  - Disasters cause death, trauma, and psychological distress. Comprising the largest number of healthcare workers, nurses play a crucial role in reducing the impact of a disaster. The objective of this review is to identify the factors that influence nurses' ability during a disaster emergency response to provide adequate care. This research was conducted by doing a literature search from the Pro-Quest and Science-Direct databases using the PRISMA-ScR to screen the articles. The final results included 13 articles. An analysis was performed to identify themes in line with the purpose of the review. All factors affecting nurses' ability to respond to a disaster situation were classified into three themes: 1) factors increasing nurses' ability, 2) barriers to delivering effective nursing care, and 3) support needed to maintain the nurses' ability. During an emergency situation due to a disaster, adequate knowledge and skill to save lives, treat injuries, manage stress and coordinate between teams are the basic competencies needed for optimal care. Nurses' clinical experience or previous disaster experience and training could increase nurses' adaptability in disaster conditions. Support from nurses' workplace and proper implementation of disaster management policy enhance nurses' services and prevent barrier under disaster condition. The results emphasize that future training should aim for improving nurses' knowledge and skills, including the knowledge of nurses' family to protect themselves and deal with disasters. Such knowledge increased family preparedness, which is an important factor to enhance nurses' willingness to work following a disaster.

AB  - The central nervous system (CNS) is protected by a highly selective barrier, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), that regulates the exchange and homeostasis of bloodborne molecules, excluding xenobiotics. This barrier forms the first line of defense by prohibiting pathogens from crossing to the CNS. Aging and chronic exposure of the BBB to pathogens renders it permeable, and this may give rise to pathology in the CNS such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Researchers have linked pathogens associated with periodontitis to neuroinflammation and AD-like pathology in vivo and in vitro. Although the presence of periodontitis-associated bacteria has been linked to AD in several clinical studies as DNA and virulence factors were confirmed in brain samples of human AD subjects, the mechanism by which the bacteria traverse to the brain and potentially influences neuropathology is unknown. In this review, we present current knowledge about the association between periodontitis and AD, the mechanism whereby periodontal pathogens might provoke neuroinflammation and how periodontal pathogens could affect the BBB. We suggest future studies, with emphasis on the use of human in vitro models of cells associated with the BBB to unravel the pathway of entry for these bacteria to the CNS and to reveal the molecular and cellular pathways involved in initiating the AD-like pathology. In conclusion, evidence demonstrates that bacteria associated with periodontitis and their virulence factors are capable of inflecting damage to the BBB and have a role in giving rise to pathology similar to that found in AD.

AB  - Objective: Conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate levels of anger among substance users compared to non-user controls and to analyze the possible association between anger and psychoactive substance use (PSU).
   Methods: The procedures of this review followed the Meta-Analyzes of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIREME, PsycINFO) were searched.
   Results: Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis; 10 used the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) anger trait subscale and two used the Buss-Perry-Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) anger subscale. The sample included 2,294 users of psychoactive substances and 2,143 nonusers, all male. The mean difference in anger scale scores between users and non-users was 2.151 (95%CI 1.166-3.134, p p 0.00, inconsistency index [I2] = 98.83) standard deviations. Age and abstinence duration did not moderate the difference in anger between substance users and non-users.
   Conclusion: Users of psychoactive substances had elevated anger scores compared to non-users, which represents a high risk of relapse. It is suggested that PSU treatment programs include intensive anger management modules, focusing on factors such as dealing with daily stressors, family conflicts, frustrations, and problems.

AB  - In recent years, unconventional oil and gas, such as tight sandstone gas and shale gas, have made great breakthroughs, and natural fractures have become more important for oil and gas exploration and development. Taking natural fractures of tight sandstone as an example, this paper systematically analyzes several key scientific problems in natural fractures and puts forward the shortcomings in the study of natural fractures. The natural fracture classification method based on geological genesis is better than other classification methods and has been widely used. The identification technology based on field outcrop, core, and thin section observation is still the most basic work for natural fracture. It is the geological basis of fracture detection based on logging and seismic data. Based on seismic detection, stochastic modeling, and paleotectonic stress field simulation, the main development direction of fracture prediction technology is to combine various methods to carry out comprehensive fracture prediction, which plays a positive role in improving the prediction accuracy. The key scientific problems in the study of natural fractures are identifying the formation stage of tectonic fractures, the formation mechanism of different scales and types of the fractures, the comprehensive prediction and effectiveness evaluation of the fractures.

AB  - Background: In recent years, the use of restorative justice (RJ) and restorative practices (RP) in schools has grown rapidly. Understanding how theory and research address this topic is important for its practical implementation based on scientific knowledge. The aim of this article was to analyse the practices derived from RJ implemented in school and what kinds of results have been achieved. Starting from the analysis of the qualitative and quantitative research in the field, a systematic review was conducted on the last decade of studies using RJ and RP at every level of school education. Methods: For this review, methods including the PRISMA guidelines, the PRISMA flow diagram, and qualitative synthesis were carried out. Scientific articles for the literature review were selected according to the following criteria: (1) publication date between the years 2010-2021; (2) student population aged 6-18 years; (3) publications in the English language; (4) articles directly accessible or accessible by contacting the author(s); 34 articles met the inclusion criteria. Results: The most used RP in school are circles (n = 26), followed by restorative conferences (n = 17), peer mediation (n = 10), restorative conversations (n = 8), mediation (n = 7), community-building circles (n = 5). RP can improve the school climate, discipline, positive conflict management through actions that aim at preventing suspensions, exclusions, conflicts, and misbehaviours (e.g., bullying). RJ practices promote positive relationships between peers and between students and teachers, as well as to prosocial behaviours through the development of social and emotional skills. Conclusions: From the studies examined, a great interest in applying restorative justice and practices in schools clearly emerged. Discussions on the benefits and challenges of implementation were provided. However, there is still limited evidence in terms of direct correlation, which suggests further studies on the impact of RJ and RP in school settings.

These are the B flavor anomalies. In this review, we summarize the data as of Moriond 2021 and present theoretical new physics explanations from both a model-independent effective field theory point of view and through the building of explicit models. Throughout, we stress the complementarity of these two approaches. In addition, we discuss combined explanations of both B anomalies and present models that also explain other problems, such as dark matter, (g - 2)(mu), neutrino properties, and hadronic anomalies.

AB  - The present work investigates the application of virtual reality (VR) technology to neurorehabilitation. By consulting a wealth of data, the advantages of VR in neurorehabilitation are introduced, followed by the application status of VR in the rehabilitation of stroke patients, Parkinson's patients, mental and psychological diseases. Besides, many research experiments on the application of VR technology in rehabilitation medicine at the present stage are investigated. The results indicate that compared with traditional balance training, the VR-based neurological rehabilitation training method can more effectively ease the tilt degree and strengthen the trunk control ability and balance function of patients with post-stroke tilt syndrome. When the effect of traditional rehabilitation training on the gait and balance of Parkinson's patients is not good enough, VR-based rehabilitation training can at least be used as an alternative therapy. Moreover, VR games have made great breakthroughs in promoting limb rehabilitation and brain injury rehabilitation, which is of incredible benefit to those with motor and activity disorders. It is also beneficial to the treatment and recovery of mental disorders of patients with nerve injury. Although VR still has limitations such as high cost and technical breakthrough bottleneck, it has great advantages in relieving pain, enhancing interest, and recovering patients' mental health in neurological rehabilitation training.

AB  - There is a need to understand the specific perinatal mental health care needs of migrant subgroups who often have differing health care needs and specific barriers to accessing and engaging with health care services. It is important to have evidence about the WHO European context given the rising numbers of refugees and asylum seekers in the region. The aim of this scoping review is to map the factors that enable and prevent access and engagement of refugee and asylum-seeking women with perinatal mental health care services in the WHO European Region, from the perspectives of service providers and service users. The database search will include PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL complete, Scopus, Academic Search Complete, and Maternity and Infant Care (OVID). Search results will be exported to an online tool that provides a platform to help manage the review process, including title, abstract, and full-text screening and voting by reviewers independently. Data concerning access and engagement with health care services will be mapped on to the candidacy framework. Systematically searching evidence within the WHO European region and examining this evidence through the candidacy lens will help develop a more comprehensive and a deeper conceptual understanding of the barriers and levers of access and engagement with perinatal mental health care services, whilst identifying gaps in existing evidence. Exploring factors that influence access and engagement for refugee and asylum-seeking women from the perspective of key stakeholders in the service provision and/or service utilisation of perinatal mental health care services will add a more comprehensive understanding of the recursive relationship between service provision and use.

Personality has been proven to have an effect on QoL and, in particular, Dispositional Optimism (DO) has been studied in relation to overcoming health crisis. The aim of this systematic review is to deepen the state of art of the relationship between QoL and DO in cancer patients. PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched. Fifteen studies were included with a total of 5,249 cancer patients. All of the studies consider the relationship between DO and QoL, some studies analyze the correlation between the two variables and found a positive association. The majority of the studies investigate the predictive power of DO over QoL and most of them found DO to be predictive of a higher QoL. Results confirmed the association between DO and QoL in a sample of cancer patients. These results could influence the clinical practice as DO has been proven to have a beneficial effect on mental and physical health.

AB  - Background Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is regarded as the most efficacious therapy for neonatal hypoxic encephalopathy. However, limitations in previous systematic reviews and the publication of new data necessitate updating the evidence. We conducted this up-to-date systematic review to evaluate the effects of TH in neonatal encephalopathy on clinical outcomes.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, LIVIVO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, major trial registries, and grey literature (from inception to October 31, 2021), for randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing TH vs normothermia in neonatal encephalopathy. We included RCTs enrolling neonates (gestation >= 35 weeks) with perinatal asphyxia and encephalopathy, who received either TH (temperature <= 34 degrees C) initiated within 6 hours of birth for >= 48 hours, vs no cooling. We excluded non-RCTs, those with delayed cooling, or cooling to >34 degrees C. Two authors independently appraised risk-of-bias and extracted data on mortality and neurologic disability at four time points: neonatal (from randomization to discharge/ death), infancy (18-24 months), childhood (5-10 years), and long-term (>10 years). Other outcomes included seizures, EEG abnormalities, and MRI findings. Summary data from published RCTs were pooled through fixed-effect meta-analysis.
   Results We identified 36863 citations and included 39 publications representing 29 RCTs with 2926 participants. Thirteen studies each had low, moderate, and high risk-of-bias. The pooled risk ratios (95% confidence interval, CI) were as follows: neonatal mortality: 0.87 (95% CI =0.75, 1.00), n=2434, I-2 =38%; mortality at 18-24 months: 0.88 (95% CI=0.78, 1.01), n =2042, I-2 =51%; mortality at 5-10 years: 0.81 (95% CI= 0.62, 1.04),n =515, I-2 =59%; disability at 18-24 months: 0.62 (95% C1=0.52, 0.75), n =1440, I-2 =26%; disability at 5-10 years: 0.68 (95% CI =0.52, 0.90), n=442, I-2 =3%; mortality or disability at 18-24 months: 0.78 (95% CI = 0.72, 0.86), n=1914, I-2 =54%; cerebral palsy at 18-24 months: 0.63 (95% CI = 0.50, 0.78), n=1136, I-2 =39%; and childhood cerebral palsy: 0.63 (95% CI = 0.46, 0.85), n=449, I-2 =0%. Some outcomes showed significant differences by study-setting; the risk ratio (95% CI) for mortality at 18-24 months was 0.79 (95% CI= 0.66,0.93), n=1212, I-2 =7% in high-income countries, 0.67 (95% CI =0.41, 1.09), n=276, I-2 =0% in upper-middle-income countries, and 1.18 (95% CI = 0.94, 1.47), n=554, I-2 =75% in lower-middle-income countries. The corresponding pooled risk ratios for 'mortality or disability at 18-24 months' were 0.77 (95% CI = 0.69, 0.86), n =1089, I-2 =0%; 0.56 (95% CI =0.41, 0.78), n=276, I-2 =30%; and 0.92 (95% CI=0.77, 1.09), n=549, I-2 =86% respectively. Trials with low risk of bias showed risk ratio of 0.97 (95% CI=0.80, 1.16, n =1475, I-2 = 62%) for neonatal mortality, whereas trials with higher risk of bias showed 0.71 (95% CI = 0.55, 0.91), n=959, I-2 =0%. Likewise, risk ratio for mortality at 18-24 months was 0.96 (95% CI = 0.83, 1.13), n=1336, I-2 =58% among low risk-of-bias trials, but 0.72 (95% C1=0.56, 0.92), n=706, I-2 =0%, among higher risk of bias trials.
   Conclusions Therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy reduces neurologic disability and cerebral palsy, but its effect on neonatal, infantile and childhood mortality is uncertain. The setting where it is implemented affects the outcomes. Low(er) quality trials overestimated the potential benefit of TH.

AB  - This literature review provides the first comprehensive qualitative and quantitative systematic synthesis of acute laboratory stress effects on older adults' cognition by specifying the direction and magnitude of those effects both overall and for different cognitive processes separately. A systematic literature search was performed, and effect sizes estimated whenever possible. We found meta-analytical evidence that stress has negative effects on older adults' verbal fluency (gadj = -0.53, 95 % CI [-2.70, 1.63]), null-to-negative effects on episodic memory (gadj = -0.26, 95 % CI [-0.44, -0.08]), null effects on executive functions (gadj = 0.07, 95 % CI [-0.31, 0.46]), and enhancing effects on working memory (gadj = 0.16, 95 % CI [-0.01, 0.33]). Relating these findings to those in young adults, notable differences emerged for some cognitive functions, such as opposing effects on working memory between age groups. Our review further reveals that stress effects on older adults' memory retention, associative memory, prospective memory, interference control or cognitive flexibility are heavily understudied. We provide a conceptual and methodological framework for future studies in older adults.

AB  - Among the most successful microeukaryotes to form mutualisms with animals are dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae. These photosynthetic symbioses drive significant primary production and are responsible for the formation of coral reef ecosystems but are particularly sensitive when environmental conditions become extreme. Annual episodes of widespread coral bleaching (disassociation of the mutualistic partnership) and mortality are forecasted from the year 2060 under current trends of ocean warming. However, host cnidarians and dinoflagellate symbionts display exceptional genetic and functional diversity, and meaningful predictions of the future that embrace this biological complexity are difficult to make. A recent move to trait-based biology (and an understanding of how traits are shaped by the environment) has been adopted to move past this problem. The aim of this review is to: (1) provide an overview of the major cnidarian lineages that are symbiotic with Symbiodiniaceae; (2) summarise the symbiodiniacean genera associated with cnidarians with reference to recent changes in taxonomy and systematics; (3) examine the knowledge gaps in Symbiodiniaceae life history from a trait-based perspective; (4) review Symbiodiniaceae trait variation along three abiotic gradients (light, nutrients, and temperature); and (5) provide recommendations for future research of Symbiodiniaceae traits. We anticipate that a detailed understanding of traits will further reveal basic knowledge of the evolution and functional diversity of these mutualisms, as well as enhance future efforts to model stability and change in ecosystems dependent on cnidarian-dinoflagellate organisms.

AB  - Background: Research in sport, military, and aerospace populations has shown that mental fatigue may impair cognitive performance. The effect of nutritional interventions that may mitigate such negative effects has been investigated. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the effects of nutritional interventions on cognitive domains often measured in mental fatigue research. Methods: A systematic search for articles was conducted using key terms relevant to mental fatigue in sport, military, and aerospace populations. Two reviewers screened 11,495 abstracts and 125 full texts. A meta-analysis was conducted whereby effect sizes were calculated using subgroups for nutritional intervention and cognitive domains. Results: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. The consumption of energy drinks was found to have a small positive effect on reaction time, whilst the use of beta-alanine, carbohydrate, and caffeine had no effect. Carbohydrate and caffeine use had no effect on accuracy. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that consuming energy drinks may improve reaction time. The lack of effect observed for other nutritional interventions is likely due to differences in the type, timing, dosage, and form of administration. More rigorous randomized controlled trials related to the effect of nutrition interventions before, during, and after induced mental fatigue are required.

AB  - Objectives This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the available data on prospective associations between work-related stressors and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among adult workers, according to the demand-control-support (DCS) and the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) models.
   Method We searched for prospective studies in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, CINHAL and PsychInfo. After screening and extraction, quality of evidence was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool adapted for observational studies. The effect estimates extracted for each cohort were synthesized using random effect models.
   Results We included 18 studies (reporting data on 25 cohorts) in meta-analyses for job strain, job demands, job control, social support at work and ERI. Workers exposed to job strain had a higher risk of developing T2DM when compared to unexposed workers [pooled rate ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.26]. This association was robust in several supplementary analyses. For exposed women relative to unexposed women, the RR was 1.35 (95% CI 1.12-1.64). The RR of workers exposed to ERI was 1.24 (95% CI 1.08-1.42) compared to unexposed workers.
   Conclusions This is the first meta-analysis to find an effect of ERI on the onset of T2DM incidence. It also confirms that job strain increases the incidence of T2DM, especially among women.

AB  - Schizophrenia spectrum disorders have heterogeneous outcomes and currently no marker predicts the course of illness. Motor abnormalities (MAs) are inherent to psychosis, the risk of psychosis, symptom severity, and brain alterations. However, the prognostic value of MAs is still unresolved. Here, we provide a systematic review of longitudinal studies on the prognostic role of MAs spanning individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR), patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), and chronic schizophrenia. We included 68 studies for a total of 23,630 subjects that assessed neurological soft signs (NSS), hypo-or hyperkinetic movement disorders and/or catatonia as a prognostic factor on clinical and functional outcomes. We found increased levels of MAs, in particular NSS, parkinsonism, and dyskinesia, were related to deteriorating symptomatic and poor functional outcome over time. Collectively, the findings emphasize the clinical, prognostic and scientific relevance of MA assessment and detection in individuals with or at risk of psychosis. In the future, instrumental measures of MA are expected to further augment detection, early intervention and treatment strategies in psychosis.

AB  - Teaching is the occupation that, on a global level, presents the second highest number of occupational diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize the epidemiological profile of mental health problems in teachers at national and international levels. We searched the Scopus, Web of Science, PsycNet, PubMed, and bvs portals for publications from the last 10 years (2008-2017) in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. We included original empirical studies in which mental health complaints were approached as dependent variables in research with teachers, comprising 28 articles. The results indicate that work overload is a psychosocial risk factor and that the teachers who are vulnerable to illness are female, single, with high levels of formal education and a family history of mental disorders.

AB  - Dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity can lead to alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) misfolding, aggregation, and post-translational modifications in Parkinson's disease (PD). This process is driven by neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which can contribute to the release of neurotoxic oligomers that facilitate dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Strategies that promote vaccines and antibodies target the clearance of misfolded, modified alpha-syn, while gene therapy approaches propose to deliver intracellular single chain nanobodies to mitigate alpha-syn misfolding, or to deliver neurotrophic factors that support neuronal viability in an otherwise neurotoxic environment. Additionally, transformative immune responses provide potential targets for PD therapeutics. Anti-inflammatory drugs represent one strategy that principally affects innate immunity. Considerable research efforts have focused on transforming the balance of pro-inflammatory effector T cells (Teffs) to favor regulatory T cell (Treg) activity, which aims to attenuate neuroinflammation and support reparative and neurotrophic homeostasis. This approach serves to control innate microglial neurotoxic activities and may facilitate clearance of alpha-syn aggregates accordingly. More recently, changes in the intestinal microbiome have been shown to alter the gut-immune-brain axis leading to suppressed leakage of bacterial products that can promote peripheral inflammation and alpha-syn misfolding. Together, each of the approaches serves to interdict chronic inflammation associated with disordered immunity and neurodegeneration. Herein, we examine research strategies aimed at improving clinical outcomes in PD.

AB  - Background: Unemployment is a well-documented risk factor for suicide. Findings from a number of studies suggest that government policy plays a crucial role in mediating the unemployment-suicide relationship. Aims: Our review was designed to assess whether government policies aimed at managing unemployment can moderate the impact of unemployment on suicide and self-harm. Method: A systematic search of the Medline, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted. All original, English-language, peer-reviewed studies examining the impact of unemployment policy on rates of suicide or self-harm were eligible for inclusion. Results: Six unique studies were identified, each using an ecological design and suicide deaths as the outcome. Three of five studies looking at unemployment benefits found a negative association with suicide rates. Studies examining the impact of active unemployment policy and employment protection legislation found evidence of beneficial effects. The effects of the policies were small and had particular benefit in reducing suicide rates among men. Limitations: The ecological designs used may limit conclusions around causality. It is unclear whether the findings generalize to those in lower- and middle-income countries. Conclusion: The findings suggest that unemployment policies can mitigate the relationship between unemployment and suicide, particularly among men.

AB  - Public health research that addresses chronic disease has historically under-utilized and undervalued qualitative methods. This has limited the field's ability to advance (a) a more in-depth understanding of the factors and processes that shape health behaviors, (b) contextualized explanations of interventions' impacts (e.g., why and how something did or did not work for recipients and systems), and (c) opportunities for building and testing theories. We introduce frameworks and methodological approaches common to qualitative research, discuss how and when to apply them in order to advance health equity, and highlight relevant strengths and challenges. We provide an overview of data collection, sampling, and analysis for qualitative research, and we describe research questions that can be addressed by applying qualitative methods across the continuum of chronic disease research. Finally, we offer recommendations to promote the strategic application of rigorous qualitative methods, with an emphasis on priority areas to enhance health equity across the evidence generation continuum.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder whose etiology is still unclear, hampering the development of effective treatments. There is an urgent need to identify the etiology and provide further effective treatments. Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that infection may play a role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. The infective pathogens may act as a trigger for Parkinson's disease, the most common of which are hepatitis C virus, influenza virus, and Helicobacter pylori. In addition, gut microbiota is increasingly recognized to influence brain function through the gut-brain axis, showing an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, a series of anti-infective agents exhibit surprising neuroprotective effects via various mechanisms, such as interfering with alpha-synuclein aggregation, inhibiting neuroinflammation, attenuating oxidative stress, and preventing from cell death, independent of their antimicrobial effects. The pleiotropic agents affect important events in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Moreover, most of them are less toxic, clinically safe and have good blood-brain penetrability, making them hopeful candidates for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the use of antibiotics and subsequent gut dysbiosis may also play a role in Parkinson's disease, making the long-term effects of anti-infective drugs worthy of further consideration and exploration. This review summarizes the current evidence for the association between infective pathogens and Parkinson's disease and subsequently explores the application prospects of anti-infective drugs in Parkinson's disease treatment, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Background: Knowledge about climate change may produce anxiety, but the concept of climate change anxiety is poorly understood. The primary aim of this study was to systematically review the qualitative literature regarding the scope of anxiety responses to climate change. The secondary aim was to investigate the sociodemographic and geographical factors which influence experiences of climate change anxiety. Methods: A systematic review of empirical qualitative studies was undertaken, examining the scope of climate change anxiety by searching five databases. Studies were critically appraised for quality. Content analysis was used to identify themes. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The content analysis was organised into two overarching themes. The scope of anxiety included worry about threats to livelihood, worry for future generations, worry about apocalyptic futures, anxiety at the lack of response to climate change, and competing worries. Themes pertaining to responses to climate change anxiety included symptoms of anxiety, feeling helpless and disempowered, and ways of managing climate change anxiety. Relatively few studies were identified, with limited geographical diversity amongst the populations studied. Conclusions: The review furthers understanding of the concept of climate change anxiety and responses to it, highlighting the need for high-quality psychiatric research exploring its clinical significance and potential interventions.

AB  - Multiple lines of clinical and pre-clinical research support a pathogenic role for neuroinflammation and peripheral immune system dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we have reviewed and summarised the published literature reporting evidence of neuroinflammation and peripheral immune changes in cohorts of patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder and non-manifesting carriers of GBA or LRRK2 gene mutations, who have increased risk for Parkinsonism and synucleinopathies, and could be in the prodromal stage of these conditions. Taken together, the findings of these studies suggest that the early stages of pathology in Parkinsonism involve activation of both the central and peripheral immune systems with significant crosstalk. We consider these findings with respect to those found in patients with clinical Parkinson's disease and discuss their possible pathological roles. Moreover, those factors possibly associated with the immune response, such as the immunomodulatory role of the affected neurotransmitters and the changes in the gut-brain axis, are also considered.

   Methods: The Turkish Citation Index, TR Index, Turkish Psychiatric Index, Wiley Online Library, PubMed, and Science Direct databases were reviewed between January and February 2021, and 18 qualitative and quantitative studies published between 2016 and 2020 were selected. The 27-item Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses Checklist was used to evaluate the reporting characteristics.
   Results: The findings of 18 articles were reviewed and presented. The search revealed no studies examining suicide and hopelessness in Turkiye. In all, 12 of the studies were descriptive, 2 were randomized controlled studies, 2 were retrospective studies, 1 was a cohort study, 1 was an experimental study, and 1 was a cross-sectional observational study. The data indicated that a greater level of hopelessness was associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
   Conclusion: Hopelessness is an important predictor of suicide. Greater knowledge and awareness of the complex risk factors for suicide can be used to provide the appropriate early treatment to promote hope, provide coping skills, and prevent suicidal behavior. Additional studies examining the important suicide risk factor of hopelessness in Turkiye are needed.

AB  - Introduction: Resilience is a commonly discussed term describing the ability to overcome, adapt to, or cope with stressful/disruptive events. Although researchers and practitioners define resilience in diverse ways - e.g., psychological or disaster resilience - the concept fundamentally encompasses perseverance through adversity. As experts in the interplay between individuals, environments, and occupations, occupational therapists and occupational scientists have great potential to understand and enable resilience, with some similar concepts appearing in occupational theories (e.g., occupational adaptation). However, there are no published reviews of resilience in the occupation-focused literature. Objective: We will explore how resilience is conceptualized and operationalized in the occupational therapy and occupational science research literature. Method: Guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology, we will search library databases and other sources for relevant records. Two team members will screen records for inclusion, with discrepancies settled by a third person. We will include English-language literature (including research papers, editorials, dissertations, etc.) published since 1990 which 1) contains the word root 'resilien' and 2) is occupation focused, according to our criteria (occupational therapist/occupational scientist co-authors or research participants; and/or published in occupation-focused periodical). We will report key information of included literature, such as methodology and resilience theories discussed. Results: Our study is ongoing at the time of publication; this manuscript reports its protocol without results. Conclusion: Findings will be useful for clinicians and researchers looking for occupational conceptualizations of resilience. From a social justice perspective, our review may highlight evidence that occupational engagement can foster resilience among marginalized communities.

AB  - Background Cash transfers, payments provided by formal or informal institutions to recipients, are increasingly used in emergencies. While increasing autonomy and being supportive of local economies, cash transfers are a cost-effective method in some settings to cover basic needs and extend benefits of limited humanitarian aid budgets. Yet, the extent to which cash transfers impact health in humanitarian settings remains largely unexplored. This systematic review evaluates the evidence on the effect of cash transfers on health outcomes and health service utilisation in humanitarian contexts. Methods Studies eligible for inclusion were peer reviewed (quantitative,qualitative and mixed-methods). Nine databases (PubMed, EMBAS, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, SciELO and LiLACS) were searched without language and without a lower bound time restriction through 24 February 2021. The search was updated to include articles published through 8 December 2021. Data were extracted using a piloted extraction tool and quality was assessed using The Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Tool. Due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes, results were synthesised narratively and no meta-analysis was performed. Results 30 673 records were identified. After removing duplicates, 17 715 were double screened by abstract and title, and 201 in full text. Twenty-three articles from 16 countries were included reporting on nutrition outcomes, psychosocial and mental health, general/subjective health and well-being, acute illness (eg, diarrhoea, respiratory infection), diabetes control (eg, blood glucose self-monitoring, haemoglobin A1C levels) and gender-based violence. Nineteen studies reported some positive impacts on various health outcomes and use of health services, 11 reported no statistically significant impact on outcomes assessed and 4 reported potential negative impacts on health outcomes. Discussion Although there is evidence to suggest a positive relationship between cash transfers and health outcomes in humanitarian settings, high-quality empirical evidence, that is methodologically robust, investigates a range of humanitarian settings and is conducted over longer time periods is needed. This should consider factors influencing programme implementation and the differential impact of cash transfers designed to improve health versus multipurpose cash transfers.

AB  - Introduction:Tryptophan is the precursor of kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites which regulate immune tolerance, energy metabolism, and vascular tone. Since these processes are important during pregnancy, changes in KP metabolite concentrations may play a role in the pathophysiology of pregnancy complications. We hypothesize that KP metabolites can serve as novel biomarkers and preventive therapeutic targets. This review aimed to provide more insight into associations between KP metabolite concentrations in maternal and fetal blood, and in the placenta, and adverse maternal pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Methods:A systematic search was performed on 18 February 2022 comprising all KP metabolites, and keywords related to maternal pregnancy and fetal outcomes. English-written human studies measuring KP metabolite(s) in maternal or fetal blood or in the placenta in relation to pregnancy complications, were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the ErasmusAGE quality score (QS) (range: 0-10). A meta-analysis of the mean maternal tryptophan and kynurenine concentrations in uncomplicated pregnancies was conducted. Results:Of the 6262 unique records, 37 were included (median QS = 5). Tryptophan was investigated in most studies, followed by kynurenine, predominantly in maternal blood (n = 28/37), and in the second and third trimester of pregnancy (n = 29/37). Compared to uncomplicated pregnancies, decreased tryptophan in maternal blood was associated with an increased prevalence of depression, gestational diabetes mellitus, fetal growth restriction, spontaneous abortion, and preterm birth. Elevated tryptophan was only observed in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension compared to normotensive pregnant women. In women with preeclampsia, only kynurenic acid was altered; elevated in the first trimester of pregnancy, and positively associated with proteinuria in the third trimester of pregnancy. Conclusions:KP metabolite concentrations were altered in a variety of maternal pregnancy and fetal complications. This review implies that physiological pregnancy requires a tight balance of KP metabolites, and that disturbances in either direction are associated with adverse maternal pregnancy and fetal outcomes.

AB  - Montanoa tomentosa is a shrub, belonging to the Asteraceae family, originally from Mexico and Central America, and it is known for its medicinal properties. The origins of its use in the field of herbal medicine can be traced back to the Mexican tradition. It was used for sexual dysfunctions. The extract of leaves was used in women to induce menstruation, abortion and labor, and also to reduce postpartum bleeding. The leaves are also used for their diuretic properties and the ground roots are used in the treatment of dysentery. Over time, studies have been conducted to identify the compounds responsible for the therapeutic activity and their mechanism of action. Two studies conducted in rats demonstrated the aphrodisiac properties of Montanoa tomentosa. This activity has been attributed to the presence of components that act as oxytocic agents. Furthermore, other studies have shown that Montanoa has anxiolytic properties. The mechanism underlying this action lies in the interaction with the GABA(A) receptor. However, it has been shown that the anxiolytic effect is influenced by the individual endocrine status: in conditions of low hormone levels the anxiolytic effect is more pronounced; in conditions of high hormonal levels, a state like anxiety is observed. Despite the multiple properties of Montanoa, today's research is geared towards strengthening its clinical relevance as a natural antidepressant agent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Menopause is part of working women's lives. In Western countries, labour market patterns are changing rapidly: women's labour participation has increased, the percentage of full-time working women is rising, and retirement age is increasing.
   OBJECTIVE: This narrative literature study aims to provide an insight in the state of the art in the literature about the relationship between menopause, work and health and to identify knowledge gaps as input for further research.
   METHODS: The search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE and ScienceDirect. The final set includes 36 academic articles, 27 additional articles related to the topic and 6 additional sources.
   RESULTS: Research on menopause, work and health is scarce. Results are grouped thematically as follows: Menopause and (1) a lack of recognising; (2) sickness absence and costs; (3) work ability; (4) job characteristics; (5) psychosocial and cultural factors; (6) health; (7) mental health, and (8) coping and interventions. Work ability of women with severe menopausal complaints may be negatively affected.
   CONCLUSIONS: Due to taboo, menopause remains unrecognised and unaddressed within an organisational context. New theoretical and methodological approaches towards research on menopause, work and health are required in order to match the variety of the work contexts world-wide.

AB  - Hypnosis has proven a powerful method in indications such as pain control and anxiety reduction. As recently discussed, it has been yielding increased attention from medical/dental perspectives. This systematic review (PROSPERO-registration-ID-CRD42021259187) aimed to critically evaluate and discuss functional changes in brain activity using hypnosis by means of different imaging techniques. Randomized controlled trials, cohort, comparative, cross-sectional, evaluation and validation studies from three databases-Cochrane, Embase and Medline via PubMed from January 1979 to August 2021-were reviewed using an ad hoc prepared search string and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 10,404 articles were identified, 1194 duplicates were removed and 9190 papers were discarded after consulting article titles/abstracts. Ultimately, 20 papers were assessed for eligibility, and 20 papers were included after a hand search (n(total) = 40). Despite a broad heterogenicity of included studies, evidence of functional changes in brain activity using hypnosis was identified. Electromyography (EMG) startle amplitudes result in greater activity in the frontal brain area; amplitudes using Somatosensory Event-Related Potentials (SERPs) showed similar results. Electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations of theta activity are positively associated with response to hypnosis. EEG results showed greater amplitudes for highly hypnotizable subjects over the left hemisphere. Less activity during hypnosis was observed in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

AB  - Objective. A systematic review with a meta-analysis explored effects of cognitively loaded physical activity interventions on global cognition in community-dwelling older adults (>= 65 years of age) experiencing mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared to any control. Methods. A literature search was conducted in 4 databases (MEDLINE [OvidSP], PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [Wiley]) from inception until January 30, 2018. The meta-analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5.3. Results. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 547 participants were identified. The interventions ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. Baseline and initial follow-up assessments were used. The primary pooled analysis of all RCTs demonstrated a nonsignificant trivial effect (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.44 to 0.58) favoring the intervention. In pooled subanalysis of 4 RCTs (n = 405) using the same global cognition measure (Mini-Mental State Examination) and duration of intervention >12 weeks, the intervention group achieved a small but significant improvement for global cognition (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.75). Conclusion. When all the RCTs were pooled, the effect of cognitively loaded physical activity intervention on global cognitive function in older adults with MCI remained unclear. The subgroup analysis provides translation evidence for future RCT study designs.

AB  - Given the clear role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its impact on incidence and phenotypical characteristics, this review provides an overview with focus on inflammatory biofluid markers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in PD patient cohorts. In preparation for clinical trials targeting the immune system, we specifically address the following questions: 1) What evidence do we have for pro-inflammatory profiles in blood and in CSF of sporadic and genetic PD patients? 2) Is there a role of anti-inflammatory mediators in blood/CSF? 3) Do inflammatory profiles in blood reflect those in CSF indicative of a cross-talk between periphery and brain? 4) Do blood/CSF inflammatory profiles change over the disease course as assessed in repeatedly taken biosamples? 5) Are blood/CSF inflammatory profiles associated with phenotypical trajectories in PD? 6) Are blood/CSF inflammatory profiles associated with CSF levels of neurodegenerative/PD-specific biomarkers? Knowledge on these questions will inform future strategies for patient stratification and cohort enrichment as well as suitable outcome measures for clinical trials.

AB  - Research into psychosis in adolescents is important in Africa in view of the high burden of mental disorders and prevalence of risk factors such as child maltreatment implicated in the etiology of mental health problems. In this paper, we synthesized the existing literature on psychosis in adolescents in Africa to understand current developments and chart a pathway for robust research agenda on psychosis. A search was conducted on electronic databases, including Africa Index Medicus and Scopus and selected journals for papers. Google, Google Scholar, reference list of papers selected for inclusion in the review and study authors were contacted for additional papers and grey literature. A total of 11 articles were included in this review and discussed under the following thematic areas:(1) assessment of psychosis; (2) prevalence of psychosis; (3) demographic/psychosocial correlates of psychosis; (4) clinical correlates of psychosis; (5) substance misuse and psychosis; and (6) psychosis literacy and help-seeking behavior. A pathway for research into psychosis centering on the representation of psychosis, risk and protective factors, management/treatment of psychosis and aforementioned thematic areas was proffered.

AB  - Objective: To provide a qualitative view and quantitative measure of sleep disturbances across and between early stages - clinical ultra high-risk and first episode - of psychotic and bipolar disorders. Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, PsychINFO) were searched up to March 2021 for studies comparing sleep measures between individuals with an early stage and controls. Standard mean deviations (Cohen's d effect sizes) were calculated for all comparisons and pooled with random-effects models. Chi-square tests were used for direct between-subgroups (ultra high-risk vs first episode) comparisons of standard mean deviations. The effects of age, sex ratio, symptoms and treatment were examined in meta-regression analyses. Results: A database search identified 13 studies that contrasted sleep measures between individuals with an early stage (N = 537) and controls (N = 360). We observed poorer subjective sleep quality (standard mean deviation = 1.32; 95% confidence interval, [1.01, 1.62]), shorter total sleep time (standard mean deviation =-0.44; 95% confidence interval, [-0.67, -0.21]), lower sleep efficiency (standard mean deviation = -0.72; 95% confidence interval, [-1.08, -0.36]), longer sleep onset latency (standard mean deviation = 0.75; 95% confidence interval, [0.45, 1.06]) and longer duration of wake after sleep onset (standard mean deviation = 0.49; 95% confidence interval, [0.21, 0.77]) were observed in early stages compared to controls. No significant differences were observed for any of the reported electroencephalographic parameters of sleep architecture. No significant between-subgroups differences were observed. Meta-regressions revealed a significant effect of the age and the antipsychotic status on subjective measures of sleep. Conclusion: The early stage population presents with significant impairments of subjective sleep quality continuity, duration and initiation. Systematic assessments of sleep in early intervention settings may allow early identification and treatment of sleep disturbances in this population.

AB  - Introduction: Selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are among the most prescribed antidepressants, and dose escalation is a frequently applied strategy after non-response to an initially prescribed dose. Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to find evidence of a dose-response relationship or to the contrary in direct comparisons of different SNRI doses in patients with major depressive disorder. Methods: A systematic literature search for RCTs comparing at least two doses of SNRIs was carried out in CENTRAL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Doses were classified as high, medium, and low according to manufacturers' product monographs and analyses at the level of SNRIs as a group and for single substances, accompanied by sensitivity network meta-analyses (Prospero CRD42018081031). Results: From 2,070 studies screened, we included 26 studies with a total of 10,242 patients. Comparisons of medium versus low and high versus medium doses resulted in clinically and statistically non-significant standardized mean differences of -0.06 (-0.16 to 0.04) and -0.06 (-0.16 to 0.03) in favor of higher doses. In the analyses of single substances, no statistically significant results emerged, and many contrasts yielded very small effect sizes. Dropouts due to side effects tended to be more frequent with higher doses. Heterogeneity was low. Network meta-analyses of direct comparisons supported the findings, as did a risk of bias analysis. Conclusion: Based on the lack of positive evidence for a dose-response relationship in SNRIs as a group and in single SNRIs, we recommend prescribing medium doses. In case of insufficient response, we do not recommend increasing the dose of SNRIs.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging is widely used for different diagnostic examinations involving autistic patients. The noisy, narrow, isolating magnetic resonance imaging environment and long scan times may not be suitable for autistic individuals, given their communication challenges, sensory sensitivities and often heightened anxiety. This systematic review aims to reveal any reasonable and feasible radiography-based adjustments to facilitate magnetic resonance imaging scanning without the use of sedation or general anaesthesia. Nine electronic databases were systematically searched. Out of 4442 articles screened, 53 were deemed directly relevant; when assessed against eligibility criteria, only 21 were finally included in this systematic review. Customising communication was found to be a key adjustment, as well as scan-based optimisation and environmental adaptations. The importance of distraction techniques and use of technology for familiarisation with the processes was also highlighted. The results of this study can inform recommendations to improve magnetic resonance imaging practice and patient experience, without the use of sedation or anaesthesia, where feasible. They can also inform the basis of dedicated training for magnetic resonance imaging radiographers. Lay abstract Autistic patients often undergo magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Within this environment, it is usual to feel anxious and overwhelmed by noises, lights or other people. The narrow scanners, the loud noises and the long examination time can easily cause panic attacks. This review aims to identify any adaptations for autistic individuals to have a magnetic resonance imaging scan without sedation or anaesthesia. Out of 4442 articles screened, 53 more relevant were evaluated and 21 were finally included in this study. Customising communication, different techniques to improve the environment, using technology for familiarisation and distraction have been used in previous studies. The results of this study can be used to make suggestions on how to improve magnetic resonance imaging practice and the autistic patient experience. They can also be used to create training for the healthcare professionals using the magnetic resonance imaging scanners.

AB  - Introduction: Mental health policies have encouraged removals of psychiatric beds in many countries. It is under debate whether to continue those trends. We conducted a systematic review of expert arguments for trends of psychiatric bed numbers.Methods: We searched seven electronic databases and screened 15,479 papers to identify expert opinions, arguments and recommendations for trends of psychiatric bed numbers, published until December 2020. Data were synthesized using thematic analysis and classified into arguments to maintain or increase numbers and to reduce numbers.Results: One hundred six publications from 25 countries were included. The most common themes arguing for reductions of psychiatric bed numbers were inadequate use of inpatient care, better integration of care and better use of community care. Arguments to maintain or increase bed numbers included high demand of psychiatric beds, high occupancy rates, increasing admission rates, criminalization of mentally ill, lack of community care and inadequately short length of stay. Cost effectiveness and quality of care were used as arguments for increase or decrease.Conclusions: The expert arguments presented here may guide and focus future debate on the required psychiatric bed numbers. The recommendations may help policymakers to define targets for psychiatric bed numbers. Arguments need careful local evaluation, especially when supporting opposite directions of trends in different contexts.

AB  - Adverse effects from exposure to particulate matter <2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) on health-related outcomes have been found in a range of experimental and epidemiological studies. This study aimed to assess the significance, validity, and reliability of the relationship between long-term PM2.5 exposure and various health outcomes. The Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, WANFANG, VIP, and SinoMed databases and reference lists of the retrieved review articles were searched to obtain meta-analysis and systematic reviews focusing on PM2.5-related outcomes as of August 31, 2021. Random-/fixed-effects models were applied to estimate summary effect size and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The quality of included meta-analyses was evaluated based on the AMSTAR 2 tool. Small-study effect and excess significance bias studies were conducted to further assess the associations. Registered PROSPERO number: CRD42020200606. This included 24 articles involving 71 associations between PM2.5 exposure and the health outcomes. The evidence for the positive association of 10 mu g/m(3) increments of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and stroke incidence in Europe was convincing (effect size = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.05-1.10). There was evidence that was highly suggestive of a positive association between 10 mu g/m(3) increments of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the following health-related outcomes: mortality of lung cancer (effect size = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.08-1.13) and Alzheimer's disease (effect size = 4.79, 95% CI: 2.79-8.21). There was highly suggestive evidence that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk is positively associated with higher long-term PM2.5 exposure versus lower long-term PM2.5 exposure (effect size = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.88-2.86). In conclusion, the positive association of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and stroke incidence in Europe was convincing. Given the validity of numerous associations of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and health-related outcomes is subject to biases, more robust evidence is urgently needed.

AB  - Background The transition between child and adult services should aim to support young people into the next stage of their life in a way that optimises their function. Yet financial, organisational and procedural barriers to continuity of care often hamper smooth transition between child and adult services. Aim and method We reviewed studies of transition from child to adult mental health services, focusing on: (a) rates of referrals and referral acceptance; (b) barriers and facilitators of successful transition; (c) continuity of care during and post-transition and (d) service users' experience of transition. Studies were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases: PsycINFO, Medline, Embase and Child Development and Adolescent Studies. Findings Forty-seven papers describing 43 unique studies met inclusion criteria. Service provision is influenced by previous history and funding processes, and the presence or absence of strong primary care, specialist centres of excellence and coordination between specialist and primary care. Provision varies between and within countries, particularly whether services are restricted to 'core' mental health or broader needs. Unsupportive organisational culture, fragmentation of resources, skills and knowledge base undermine the collaborative working essential to optimise transition. Stigma and young people's concerns about peers' evaluation often prompt disengagement and discontinuation of care during transition, leading to worsening of symptoms and later, to service re-entry. Qualitative studies reveal that young people and families find the transition process frustrating and difficult, mainly because of lack of advanced planning and inadequate preparation. Conclusions Despite increasing research interest over the last decade, transition remains 'poorly planned, executed and experienced'. Closer collaboration between child and adult services is needed to improve the quality of provision for this vulnerable group at this sensitive period of development.

AB  - Suicide causes approximately one death every 40 s. Suicidal ideation is the first stage in the risk scale, being a potential gate for suicide prevention. Machine learning emerged as a promising tool for helping in preventing suicide through the identification of individuals at risk. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review aiming to answer how machine learning can help in suicidal ideation identification. This study addresses the state-of-the-art for this research field by filtering 4,002 articles from eleven databases published up to February 2021. We analyzed the 54 filtered articles to explore twelve research questions, addressing techniques, data, devices, explainability, and additional resources. We propose a taxonomy of machine learning techniques explored in this area and a taxonomy for highlighting the current research challenges. This review found a growing interest in suicidal ideation in the last few years. In a general way, studies explored data from social media and performed a text analysis to investigate suicidal tendencies in the individuals' language. Moreover, deep learning models seem to be a tendency in this area nowadays. Future studies in suicidal ideation should investigate generic and proactive models that do not depend on users' self-report.

AB  - Background Mental capacity for treatment decisions in psychiatry inpatients is an important ethical and legal concern, especially in light of changes in mental capacity legislation in many jurisdictions. Aims To conduct a systematic review of literature examining the prevalence of mental capacity for treatment decisions among voluntary and involuntary psychiatry inpatients, and to assess any correlations between research tools used to measure mental capacity and binary judgements using criteria such as those in capacity legislation. Method We searched PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies assessing mental capacity for treatment decisions in people admitted voluntarily and involuntarily to psychiatric hospitals. Results Forty-five papers emanating from 33 studies were identified. There was huge variability in study methods and often selective populations, but the prevalence of decision-making capacity varied between 5% and 83.7%. These figures resulted from studies using cut-off scores or categorical criteria only. The prevalence of decision-making capacity among involuntary patients ranged from 7.7% to 42%, and among voluntary patients ranged from 29% to 97.9%. Two papers showed positive correlations between clinicians' judgement of decision-making capacity and scores on the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment; two papers showed no such correlation. Conclusions Not all voluntary psychiatry inpatients possess mental capacity and many involuntary patients do. This paradox needs to be clarified and resolved in mental health legislation; supported decision-making can help with this task.

AB  - Prevention programs are a key method to reduce the prevalence and impact of mental health disorders in childhood and adolescence. Caregiver participation engagement (CPE), which includes caregiver participation in sessions as well as follow-through with homework plans, is theorized to be an important component in the effectiveness of these programs. This systematic review aims to (1) describe the terms used to operationalize CPE and the measurement of CPE in prevention programs, (2) identify factors associated with CPE, (3) examine associations between CPE and outcomes, and (4) explore the effects of strategies used to enhance CPE. Thirty-nine articles representing 27 unique projects were reviewed. Articles were included if they examined CPE in a program that focused to some extent on preventing child mental health disorders. There was heterogeneity in both the terms used to describe CPE and the measurement of CPE. The majority of projects focused on assessment of caregiver home practice. There were no clear findings regarding determinants of CPE. With regard to the impact of CPE on program outcomes, higher levels of CPE predicted greater improvements in child and caregiver outcomes, as well as caregiver-child relationship quality. Finally, a small number of studies found that motivational and behavioral strategies (e.g., reinforcement, appointment reminders) were successful in promoting CPE. This review highlights the importance of considering CPE when developing, testing, and implementing prevention programs for child mental health disorders. Increased uniformity is needed in the measurement of CPE to facilitate a better understanding of determinants of CPE. In addition, the field would benefit from further evaluating strategies to increase CPE as a method of increasing the potency of prevention programs.

TI  - Patient-reported outcome measures suitable for quality of life/well-being assessment in multisectoral, multinational and multiperson mental health economic evaluations
KW  - OF-LIFE
KW  - ADOLESCENCE
AB  - Question The aim was to systematically collate and synthesise existing, publicly available patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) information suitable for quality of life (QOL)/well-being measurement in mental health economic evaluations, with specific focus on their applicability in multisectoral, multinational, multiperson economic evaluations and to develop an electronic PROM compendium with meta-data. Study selection and analysis A systematic literature search for non-disease-pecific PROMs and their versions suitable for the measurement of QOL/well-being or recovery was conducted from 2008 to February 2020. Six criteria were applied to judge their suitability in multisectoral, multinational, multiperson economic evaluations: (i) availability of separate adult and child/adolescent versions, (ii) availability of a proxy-completion option, (iii) assessing outcomes beyond health, (iv) availability of translations (>= 2 language versions), (v) availability of a preference-based valuation, (vi) availability of value sets in more than one country. Findings The final ProgrammE in Costing, resource use measurement and outcome valuation for Use in multisectoral National and International health economic evaluAtions (PECUNIA) PROM-MH Compendium includes 204 unique scales, out of which 88 are individual instruments, while the remaining 116 scales belong to 46 PROM families with more than one distinctive version. Out of the total 134 individual PROMs/PROM families, 72% have at least two language versions, 8% measure broader well-being beyond health-related QOL, 11% have preference-based valuation, with multiple country sets available for 60% of these. None of the identified PROMs met all six proposed criteria. Conclusions The PECUNIA PROM-MH Compendium provides a unique overview of the relevant PROMs and their linked meta-data, and should be a helpful tool when choosing a suitable instrument for future mental health economic evaluations.

AB  - Objectives: To develop a thematic framework for the range of consequences arising from a diagnostic label from an individual, family/caregiver, healthcare professional, and community perspective.Design: Systematic scoping review of qualitative studies.Search Strategy: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and CINAHL for primary studies and syntheses of primary studies that explore the consequences of labelling non-cancer diagnoses. Reference lists of included studies were screened, and forward citation searches undertaken.Study Selection: We included peer reviewed publications describing the perceived consequences for individuals labelled with a non-cancer diagnostic label from four perspectives: that of the individual, their family/caregiver, healthcare professional and/or community members. We excluded studies using hypothetical scenarios.Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data extraction used a three-staged process: one third was used to develop a preliminary framework, the next third for framework validation, and the final third coded if thematic saturation was not achieved. Author themes and supporting quotes were extracted, and analysed from the perspective of individual, family/caregiver, healthcare professional, or community member.Results: After deduplication, searches identified 7,379 unique articles. Following screening, 146 articles, consisting of 128 primary studies and 18 reviews, were included. The developed framework consisted of five overarching themes relevant to the four perspectives: psychosocial impact (e.g., positive/negative psychological impact, social- and self-identity, stigma), support (e.g., increased, decreased, relationship changes, professional interactions), future planning (e.g., action and uncertainty), behaviour (e.g., beneficial or detrimental modifications), and treatment expectations (e.g., positive/negative experiences). Perspectives of individuals were most frequently reported.Conclusions: This review developed and validated a framework of five domains of consequences following diagnostic labelling. Further research is required to test the external validity and acceptability of the framework for individuals and their family/caregiver, healthcare professionals, and community.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Violence perpetration outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders contribute to morbidity and mortality at a population level, disrupt care, and lead to stigma.
   OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of perpetrating interpersonal violence in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders compared with general population control individuals.
   DATA SOURCES Multiple databases were searched for studies in any language from January 1970 to March 2021 using the terms violen* or homicid* and psychosis or psychoses or psychotic or schizophren* or schizoaffective or delusional and terms for mental disorders. Bibliographies of included articles were hand searched.
   STUDY SELECTION The study included case-control and cohort studies that allowed risks of interpersonal violence perpetration and/or violent criminality in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders to be compared with a general population group without these disorders.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and the Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) proposal. Two reviewers extracted data. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was violence to others obtained either through official records, self-report and/or collateral-report, or medical file review and included any physical assault, robbery, sexual offenses, illegal threats or intimidation, and arson.
   RESULTS The meta-analysis included 24 studies of violence perpetration outcomes in 15 countries over 4 decades (N = 51 309 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders; reported mean age of 21 to 54 years at follow-up; of those studies that reported outcomes separately by sex, there were 19 976 male individuals and 14 275 female individuals). There was an increase in risk of violence perpetration in men with schizophrenia and other psychoses (pooled odds ratio [OR], 4.5; 95% CI, 3.6-5.6) with substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 85%; 95% CI, 77-91). The risk was also elevated in women (pooled OR, 10.2; 95% CI, 7.1-14.6), with substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 66%; 95% CI, 31-83). Odds of perpetrating sexual offenses (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.8-6.8) and homicide (OR, 17.7; 95% CI, 13.9-22.6) were also investigated. Three studies found increased relative risks of arson but data were not pooled for this analysis owing to heterogeneity of outcomes. Absolute risks of violence perpetration in register-based studies were less than 1 in 20 in women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and less than 1 in 4 in men over a 35-year period.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This systematic review and meta-analysis found that the risk of perpetrating violent outcomes was increased in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders compared with community control individuals, which has been confirmed in new population-based longitudinal studies and sibling comparison designs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by cognitive impairment, abnormal behavior, and social deficits, which is intimately linked with excessive beta-amyloid (A beta) protein deposition along with many other misfolded proteins, neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates, and mitochondrial damage in neurons, leading to neuron loss. Currently, research on the pathological mechanism of AD has been elucidated for decades, still no effective treatment for this complex disease was developed, and the existing therapeutic strategies are extremely erratic, thereby leading to irreversible and progressive cognitive decline in AD patients. Due to gradually mental dyscapacitating of AD patients, AD not only brings serious physical and psychological suffering to patients themselves, but also imposes huge economic burdens on family and society. Accordingly, it is very imperative to recapitulate the progress of gene editing-based precision medicine in the emerging fields. In this review, we will mainly focus on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technique in the fields of AD research and gene therapy, and summarize the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in the aspects of AD model construction, screening of pathogenic genes, and target therapy. Finally, the development of delivery systems, which is a major challenge that hinders the clinical application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology will also be discussed.

AB  - The interest in human migration is at its all-time high, yet data to measure migration is notoriously limited. "Big data" or "digital trace data" have emerged as new sources of migration measurement complementing 'traditional' census, administrative and survey data. This paper reviews the strengths and weaknesses of eight novel, digital data sources along five domains: reliability, validity, scope, access and ethics. The review highlights the opportunities for migration scholars but also stresses the ethical and empirical challenges. This review intends to be of service to researchers and policy analysts alike and help them navigate this new and increasingly complex field.

AB  - Background: Apathy has been suggested as a potential predictor of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression to dementia. Whether it might predict the transition from normal cognitive function to cognitive impairment has been less studied. The current study aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on the association between apathy and the transition from normal cognitive function to cognitive impairment.Methods: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for longitudinal prospective cohort studies that evaluated apathy at baseline in the cognitively normal population and had cognitive impairment as the outcome. Random effects models were used, and heterogeneity was explored with stratification. The stability of the synthesized result was indicated using sensitivity analysis by excluding one study each time and recalculating the overall effect.Results: Ten studies comprising 26,195 participants were included. Apathy status was available for 22,101 participants. Apathy was present in 1,803 of 22,101 participants (8.16%). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 13 years. The combined odds ratio (OR) of cognitive impairment for patients with apathy was 2.07 (95% CI: 1.43-2.99; I-2 = 86%), and the combined hazard ratio was 2.70 (95% CI: 1.38-5.27; I-2 = 94%). The OR meta-analyses for different conversion outcomes were MCI (OR = 3.38, 95% CI: 1.57-7.28; I-2 =71%), cognitive decline (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.81-2.00; I-2 = 64%) and dementia (OR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.32-3.41; I-2 = 86%). Subgroup analysis suggested that the association between apathy and cognitive impairment changed with age, depression adjustments, apathy measurement, and follow-up time.Conclusions: Apathy was associated with a greater than 2-fold increased risk of progression to cognitive impairment in the cognitively normal population. Future interventions targeting apathy management in the general population may reduce the risk of cognitive impairment.

AB  - Antipsychotic agents are used for various indications in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Despite their proven roles in multiple conditions, the treatment-emergent side effects of antipsychotic medications, such as metabolic side effects, are often the limiting factor for their long-term and short-term uses. Moreover, antipsychotic medications are often criticized for being less effective in treating different disabling symptoms such as negative symptoms of schizophrenia. As a result, the search for safer and more efficacious antipsychotic agents is ongoing. Newer antipsychotic agents are gaining attention related to emerging efficacy and tolerability data in treating neuropsychiatric conditions. In this review, we attempt to appraise the scientific data on psychopharmacology, safety profile, and efficacy of the newer additions to the list of second-generation antipsychotics, namely brexpiprazole, cariprazine, and lumateperone. We conducted a selective review utilizing PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane databases to gather appropriate publications, keeping broad inclusion criteria. There were no restrictions on the age of the study population or the year of publication. We also cross-referenced articles and references to capture all existing studies. Our review of the current literature indicates that all three antipsychotic agents appear to be promising based on their short-term studies, while long-term studies remain limited. There is also a need for a head to head comparison between the newer antipsychotics with the other antipsychotic agents to ascertain if the newer agents are any better than the others.

AB  - Background Early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services target the early manifestation of psychosis and provide multidisciplinary care. They demonstrate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Implementation of EIP services is inconsistent and piecemeal. This systematic review and narrative synthesis aims to identify barriers and facilitators to EIP service implementation. Methods We conducted an electronic search of databases (EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, and PsychINFO) to detect papers reporting EIP service implementation findings and associated barriers and facilitators. The search occurred between June to August 2020, and again in January 2021. Articles meeting inclusion criteria were extracted and narratively synthesized. A quality assessment was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results Twenty-three studies were selected. The most common study design was descriptive accounts of implementation. Patient age ranged varied from 14 to 35 years. We identified three barrier and facilitator domains: (a) system; (b) services; and (c) staff, and a range of subdomains. The most frequent subdomains were "funding" and "strength of collaboration and communication between EIP and outside groups and services". Associations between domains and subdomains were evident, particularly between systems and services. Conclusions A range of barriers and facilitators to EIP implementation exist. Some of these are generic factors germane across health systems and services, while others are specific to EIP services. A thorough prior understanding of these challenges and enablers are necessary before implementation is attempted. Accounting for these issues within local and national contexts may help predict and increase the likelihood of services' success, stability, and longevity.

AB  - Background and objective: Paranoia is an important psychiatric symptom with a remarkable effect on daily life. Virtual reality (VR)-based treatments are influential and safe for patients with paranoia. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, and define the clinical and technical characteristics of available VR strategies for the treatment of patients with paranoia. Materials and methods: Studies published up to 25/11/2021 reporting VR-based interventions for the treatment of patients with paranoia were reviewed in five databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Results: Out of 302 initial search results, eight were included in the present study based on the inclusion criteria. Six studies were randomized clinical trials with the interventions in the experimental group being based on VR, compared to routine interventions as controls. Two were before-after studies. The most commonly used hardware and software were head-mounted display and Unity3D, respectively. Interventions had a range of 1-16 sessions with follow-up durations of 0-6 months. All investigations showed positive results in the main target, including improved social participation, reduced level of anxiety, as well as diminished suspicious ideas and paranoid symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that VR-based interventions are effective treatments. Although the use of VR technology is limited for a variety of reasons, such as cost, it improves symptoms in patients with paranoia.

AB  - This paper conducted a preliminary study of reviewing and exploring bias strategies using a framework of a different discipline: change management. The hypothesis here is: If the major problem of implicit bias strategies is that they do not translate into actual changes in behaviors, then it could be helpful to learn from studies that have contributed to successful change interventions such as reward management, social neuroscience, health behavioral change, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The result of this integrated approach is: (1) current bias strategies can be improved and new ones can be developed with insight from adjunct study fields in change management; (2) it could be more sustainable to invest in a holistic and proactive bias strategy approach that targets the social environment, eliminating the very condition under which biases arise; and (3) while implicit biases are automatic, future studies should invest more on strategies that empower people as "change agents" who can act proactively to regulate the very environment that gives rise to their biased thoughts and behaviors.

AB  - Background: The volume of health-related publications on Syria has increased considerably over the course of the conflict compared with the pre-war period. This increase is largely attributed to commentaries, news reports and editorials rather than research publications. This paper seeks to characterise the conflict-related population and humanitarian health and health systems research focused inside Syria and published over the course of the Syrian conflict.
   Methods: As part of a broader scoping review covering English, Arabic and French literature on health and Syria published from 01 January 2011 to 31 December 2019 and indexed in seven citation databases (PubMed, Medline (OVID), CINAHL Complete, Global Health, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus), we analyzed conflict-related research papers focused on health issues inside Syria and on Syrians or residents of Syria. We classified research articles based on the major thematic areas studied. We abstracted bibliometric information, study characteristics, research focus, funding statements and key limitations and challenges of conducting research as described by the study authors. To gain additional insights, we examined, separately, non-research publications reporting field and operational activities as well as personal reflections and narrative accounts of first-hand experiences inside Syria.
   Results: Of 2073 papers identified in the scoping review, 710 (34%) exclusively focus on health issues of Syrians or residents inside Syria, of which 350 (49%) are conflict-related, including 89 (25%) research papers. Annual volume of research increased over time, from one publication in 2013 to 26 publications in 2018 and 29 in 2019. Damascus was the most frequently studied governorate (n = 33), followed by Aleppo (n = 25). Papers used a wide range of research methodologies, predominantly quantitative (n = 68). The country of institutional affiliation(s) of first and last authors are predominantly Syria (n = 30, 21 respectively), the United States (n = 25, 19 respectively) or the United Kingdom (n = 12, 10 respectively). The majority of authors had academic institutional affiliations. The most frequently examined themes were health status, the health system and humanitarian assistance, response or needs (n = 38, 34, 26 respectively). Authors described a range of contextual, methodological and administrative challenges in conducting research on health inside Syria. Thirty-one publications presented field and operational activities and eight publications were reflections or first hand personal accounts of experiences inside Syria.
   Conclusions: Despite a growing volume of research publications examining population and humanitarian health and health systems issues inside conflict-ravaged Syria, there are considerable geographic and thematic gaps, including limited research on several key pillars of the health system such as governance, financing and medical products; issues such as injury epidemiology and non-communicable disease burden; the situation in the north-east and south of Syria; and besieged areas and populations. Recognising the myriad of complexities of researching active conflict settings, it is essential that research in/on Syria continues, in order to build the evidence base, understand critical health issues, identify knowledge gaps and inform the research agenda to address the needs of the people of Syria following a decade of conflict.

AB  - Achievement Goal Theory (AGT) is one of the most popular theoretical frameworks in motivation research. Despite its application to a variety of contexts, including, school, work, and sport, it has not yet been referenced in the field of school psychology. First, we review the theoretical underpinnings as told through the theory's evolving models, explore its impacts on cognition, emotion, and behavior, and introduce a multiple goals perspective. Second, we outline the leading research supporting AGT, both in terms of structural and individual intervention studies. Third, we apply the principles of AGT to the primary tasks of school psychology professionals, including assessment, intervention, and consultation practices. The students we support can greatly benefit from gearing our approaches toward ones that foster self-improvement and interest.

AB  - Introduction: Coercion is frequent in clinical practice, particularly in psychiatry. Since it overrides some fundamental rights of patients (notably their liberty of movement and decision-making), adequate use of coercion requires legal and ethical justifications. In this article, we map out the ethical elements used in the literature to justify or reject the use of coercive measures limiting freedom of movement (seclusion, restraint, involuntary hospitalization) and highlight some important issues.Methods: We conducted a narrative review of the literature by searching the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar and Cairn.info databases with the keywords "coercive/compulsory measures/care/treatment, coercion, seclusion, restraint, mental health, psychiatry, involuntary/compulsory hospitalization/admission, ethics, legitimacy." We collected all ethically relevant elements used in the author's justifications for or against coercive measures limiting freedom of movement (e.g., values, rights, practical considerations, relevant feelings, expected attitudes, risks of side effects), and coded, and ordered them into categories.Results: Some reasons provided in the literature are presented as justifying an absolute prohibition on coercion; they rely on the view that some fundamental rights, such as autonomy, are non-negotiable. Most ethically relevant elements, however, can be used in a balanced weighting of reasons to favor or reject coercive measures in certain circumstances. Professionals mostly agree that coercion is only legitimate in exceptional circumstances, when the infringement of some values (e.g., freedom of movement, short-term autonomy) is the only means to fulfill other, more important values and goals (e.g., patient's safety, the long-term rebuilding of patient's identity and autonomy). The results of evaluations vary according to which moral elements are prioritized over others. Moreover, we found numerous considerations (e.g., conditions, procedural values) for how to ensure that clinicians apply fair decision-making procedures related to coercion. Based on this analysis, we highlight vital topics that need further development.Conclusion: Before using coercive measures limiting freedom of movement, clinicians should consider and weigh all ethically pertinent elements in the situation and actively search for alternatives that are more respectful of patient's well-being and rights. Coercive measures decided upon after a transparent, carefully balanced evaluation process are more likely to be adequate, understood, and accepted by patients and caregivers.

AB  - Autophagy is an important cellular self-digestion and recycling pathway that helps in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation at various steps of the autophagic and endolysosomal pathway has been reported in several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington disease (HD) and is cited as a critically important feature for central nervous system (CNS) proteostasis. Recently, another molecular target, namely transcription factor EB (TFEB) has been explored globally to treat neurodegenerative disorders. This TFEB, is a key regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis pathway. Multiple research studies suggested therapeutic potential by targeting TFEB to treat human diseases involving autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction, especially neurodegenerative disorders. A common observation involving all neurodegenerative disorders is their poor efficacy in clearing and recycle toxic aggregated proteins and damaged cellular organelles due to impairment in the autophagy pathway. This dysfunction in autophagy characterized by the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates leads to a progressive loss in structural integrity/functionality of neurons and may even result in neuronal death. In recent years TFEB, a key regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, has received considerable attention. It has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in numerous neurodegenerative disorders like AD and PD. In various neurobiology studies involving animal models, TFEB has been found to ameliorate neurotoxicity and rescue neurodegeneration. Since TFEB is a master transcriptional regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis pathway and plays a crucial role in defining autophagy activation. Studies have been done to understand the mechanisms for TFEB dysfunction, which may yield insights into how TFEB might be targeted and used for the therapeutic strategy to develop a treatment process with extensive application to neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we explore the role of different transcription factor-based targeted therapy by some natural compounds for AD and PD with special emphasis on TFEB.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, with a known genetic cause. Besides facial dysmorphologies and congenital and/or acquired medical conditions, the syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, accelerated aging, and an increased likelihood of an early onset Alzheimer's disease in adulthood. These common patterns of DS are derived from the long-held standard in the field of DS research, that describes individuals with DS as a homogeneous group and compares phenotypic outcomes with either neurotypical controls or other neurodevelopmental disorders. This traditional view has changed, as modern research pinpoints a broad variability in both the occurrence and severity of symptoms across DS, arguing for DS heterogeneity and against a single "DS profile." Nevertheless, prenatal counseling does not often prioritize the awareness of potential within-group variations of DS, portraying only a vague picture of the developmental outcomes of children with DS to expectant parents. This mini-review provides a concise update on existent information about the heterogeneity of DS from a full-spectrum developmental perspective, within an interdisciplinary context. Knowledge on DS heterogeneity will not only enable professionals to enhance the quality of prenatal counseling, but also help parents to set targeted early interventions, to further optimize daily functions and the quality of life of their children.

AB  - Many theories have shaped the concept of morality and its development by anchoring it in the realm of the social systems and values of each culture. This review discusses the current formulation of moral theories that attempt to explain cultural factors affecting moral judgment and reasoning. It aims to survey key criticisms that emerged in the past decades. In both cases, we highlight examples of cultural differences in morality, to show that there are cultural patterns of moral cognition in Westerners' individualistic culture and Easterners' collectivist culture. It suggests a paradigmatic change in this field by proposing pluralist "moralities" thought to be universal and rooted in the human evolutionary past. Notwithstanding, cultures vary substantially in their promotion and transmission of a multitude of moral reasonings and judgments. Depending on history, religious beliefs, social ecology, and institutional regulations (e.g., kinship structure and economic markets), each society develops a moral system emphasizing several moral orientations. This variability raises questions for normative theories of morality from a cross-cultural perspective. Consequently, we shed light on future descriptive work on morality to identify the cultural characteristics likely to impact the expression or development of reasoning, justification, argumentation, and moral judgment in Westerners' individualistic culture and Easterners' collectivist culture.

AB  - Video gaming is a popular, globally recognized phenomenon, played recreationally or competitively as esports. Gaming is a typically sedentary nighttime activity; therefore, the potential to impact sleep and health is high. Furthermore, there are limited studies on adult gamers, who represent the majority demographic in esports. This review examines evidence describing sleep in habitual adult gamers to understand the associated risk for cardiometabolic disease or the benefits to gaming performance. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science) were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 - April 2020. Twelve studies reporting on sleep in habitual adult gamers were included. A narrative synthesis was employed to report results, owing to high levels of heterogeneity across the included studies. Gamers with higher gaming addiction scores were more likely to have shorter, poorer quality sleep and greater daytime sleepiness and insomnia scores than gamers with lower gaming addiction scores and non-gamers. In addition, high-volume gamers were more likely to have worsened sleep quantity and quality, with delayed sleep timing and increased prevalence of insomnia. Despite limitations in the design of the included studies, excessive gaming is broadly associated with worsened sleep parameters. Noteworthy is the lack of studies investigating cardiometabolic health in gamers. Future work should explore the relative contribution and associated risk that various games, genres, and timing of gaming activities have on sleep, physical and mental health, particularly in vulnerable gaming cohorts engaged with contemporary forms of gaming and esports.

AB  - Background: Tropical coral reefs cover only ca. 0.1% of the Earth's surface but host an outstanding biodiversity and provide important ecosystem services to millions of people living nearby. They are currently threatened by global (e.g., climate change) and local (e.g., chemical pollution) stressors that interact in different ways. While global stressors cannot be mitigated by local actions alone, local stressors can be reduced through ecosystem management. A systematic map on the impacts of chemicals arising from anthropogenic activities on tropical reef-building corals, which are the main engineer species of reef ecosystems, was published in 2021. This systematic map gathered an abundant literature (908 articles corresponding to 7937 studies), and identified four well-represented subtopics, amenable to relevant full syntheses. Here, we focused on one of the four subtopics: we aimed to systematically review the evidence on the ecotoxicological effects of chemicals on tropical reef-building corals.
   Methods: The evidence will be identified from the recent systematic map on the impacts of chemicals arising from anthropogenic activities on tropical reef-building corals. Especially, all studies in the map database corresponding to the knowledge cluster"evidence on the ecotoxicological effects of chemicals on corals" will be selected. To identify the evidence produced since then, a search update will be performed using a subset of the search string used for the systematic map, and titles, abstracts and full-texts will be screened according to the criteria defining the selected cluster of the map. In addition, as the eligibility criteria for the systematic review are narrower than those used to define the cluster in the systematic map, additional screening will be carried out. The included studies will then be critically appraised and a low, medium, or high risk of bias will be assigned to each study. Data will be extracted from studies and synthesised according to a strategy depending on the type of exposure and outcome. Synthesis will be mainly quantitative but also narrative, aiming to identify toxicity thresholds of chemicals for corals.

AB  - Anhedonia, the reduced capacity to experience pleasure, has long been considered a prominent feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Many domain-specific conceptualizations of anhedonia and pleasure capacity have been developed, and there currently exist a variety of self-report assessment tools that purport to assess these various domains. The current systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42020156169) aimed to quantify overall and domain-specific self-reported anhedonia in people with schizophrenia compared to nonpsychiatric controls. We performed a literature search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Embase databases for dissertations and peer-reviewed articles published in English prior to June 2021. Studies employing a psychometrically validated self-report measure of anhedonia, pleasure experience or affect in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or schizophreniform disorders; studies utilizing at least one clearly defined healthy or community control group for comparison; and studies providing sufficient data to calculate effect sizes were included in this review. Random and mixed effects meta-analyses, meta-regressions, and subgroup comparisons were run across domains of anhedonia to explore weighted mean effect sizes and their associated moderators. In total, 146 studies met inclusion criteria, yielding 390 Hedges' g effect sizes from the included comparisons. People with schizophrenia reported moderate-to-large elevations in overall and domain-specific anhedonia. A sensitivity analysis accounting for high risk of bias studies did not significantly impact results. Lastly, patient sex, education, negative symptom severity, antipsychotic class, and trait negative affect differentially moderated effect sizes across domains of anhedonia. Despite the heterogeneity inherent in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, self-reported anhedonia is ubiquitously reported across self-report measures in this population.

AB  - Objective: Disasters of all varieties have been steadily increasing in frequency. Simultaneously, "big data" has seen explosive growth as a tool in business and private industries while opportunities for robust implementation in disaster management remain nascent. To more explicitly ascertain the current status of big data as applied to disaster recovery, we conducted an integrative literature review. Methods: Eleven databases were searched using iteratively developed keywords to target big data in a disaster recovery context. All studies were dual-screened by title and abstract followed by dual full-text review to determine if they met inclusion criteria. Articles were included if they focused on big data in a disaster recovery setting and were published in the English-language peer-reviewed literature. Results: After removing duplicates, 25,417 articles were originally identified. Following dual title/abstract review and full-text review, 18 studies were included in the final analysis. Among those, 44% were United States-based and 39% focused on hurricane recovery. Qualitative themes emerged surrounding geographic information systems (GIS), social media, and mental health. Conclusions: Big data is an evolving tool for recovery from disasters. More research, particularly in real-time applied disaster recovery settings, is needed to further expand the knowledge base for future applications.

AB  - Autistic adults often experience barriers to healthcare that can cause their healthcare service use to be unique from other populations. We conducted a systematic review to gather the most recent evidence about how often autistic adults use five important healthcare services (the emergency department, hospitalization, outpatient mental health, preventive services, and primary care) compared to populations of non-autistic adults. We searched six electronic research databases for articles. Our search strategy identified N = 2964 unique articles. Ultimately, we included N = 16 articles in our review. Most included studies (N = 13) were high-quality level 3a studies that compared autistic adults' service use to a non-autistic population comparison group (N = 11), and examined emergency department use (N = 12). Autistic adults most often had equal or higher use of services than population comparison groups across all healthcare services we examined. Although autistic adults had greater use of primary care and preventive services than comparison groups, frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations may reflect that these services are not adequately meeting autistic adults' needs. Future research should identify targets for improving autistic adults' access to and use of primary care and preventive services, which may ultimately reduce frequent use of the emergency department and hospitalizations. Lay abstract Autistic adults often have complex healthcare needs due to factors like having other health conditions, sensory sensitivities, and limited access to healthcare providers who are trained to provide care for them. All these factors may influence the healthcare services that autistic adults use. In this review, we searched six electronic research databases to gather the most recent evidence about how often autistic adults use five important healthcare services (the emergency department, hospitalization, outpatient mental health, preventive services, and primary care) compared to populations of non-autistic adults. A total of 16 articles were ultimately included in this review. Most articles found that autistic adults had equal or higher use of healthcare services than non-autistic adults. Autistic adults frequently used the emergency department and hospital. This may indicate that routine outpatient care in the community is not meeting their needs. Our findings show the importance of improving care at this level for autistic adults to reduce overuse of the emergency department (in this article referred to as ED) and hospital.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and its mitigation measures and impacts, such as shelter-in-place orders, social isolation, restrictions on freedoms, unemployment, financial insecurity, and disrupted routines, have led to declines in mental health worldwide and concomitant escalating demands for mental health services. Under the circumstances, electronic mental health (e-mental health) programs and services have rapidly become the "new normal."
   Objective: The aim of this study was to assess key characteristics and evidence gaps in the e-mental health literature published in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic via a scoping review and bibliometric analysis.
   Methods: We conducted a search of four academic databases (ie, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and CINAHL) for documents published from December 31, 2019, to March 31, 2021, using keywords for e-mental health and COVID-19. Article information was extracted that was relevant to the review objective, including journal, type of article, keywords, focus, and corresponding author. Information was synthesized by coding these attributes and was then summarized through descriptive statistics and narrative techniques. Article influence was examined from Altmetric and CiteScore data, and a network analysis was conducted on article keywords.
   Results: A total of 356 publications were included in the review. Articles on e-mental health quickly thrived early in the pandemic, with most articles being nonempirical, chiefly commentaries or opinions (n=225, 63.2%). Empirical publications emerged later and became more frequent as the pandemic progressed. The United States contributed the most articles (n=160, 44.9%), though a notable number came from middle-income countries (n=59, 16.6%). Articles were spread across 165 journals and had above-average influence (ie, almost half of the articles were in the top 25% of output scores by Altmetric, and the average CiteScore across articles was 4.22). The network analysis of author-supplied keywords identified key topic areas, including specific mental disorders, eHealth modalities, issues and challenges, and populations of interest. These were further explored via full-text analysis. Applications of e-mental health during the pandemic overcame, or were influenced by, system, service, technology, provider, and patient factors.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 has accelerated applications of e-mental health. Further research is needed to support the implementation of e-mental health across system and service infrastructures, alongside evidence of the relative effectiveness of e-mental health in comparison to traditional modes of care.

AB  - Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common allergic diseases in the world, and usually persists throughout the activity. Epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between air pollution and allergic rhinitis. However, we could not find any meta-analysis of the risk of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O-3 and CO) on the prevalence of AR in people of all ages.
   Objectives: Carry out a meta-analysis on the results of recent studies (up to 2020) to present valid information about exposure to air pollution and risk of prevalence of AR.
   Methods: We systematically searched three databases for studies up to December 17, 2020, including air pollution and AR. Random effect models were conducted to estimate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Subgroup analysis, funnel plot, Egger's test, and the trim-and-fill method were also conducted.
   Results: Thirty-five studies across 12 countries, including a total of 453,470 participants, were included. The OR per 10 mu g/m(3) increase of pollutants was 1.13 (1.04-1.22) for PM10 and 1.12 (1.05-1.20) for PM2.5. The OR per 10 mu g/m(3) increment of gaseous pollutants were 1.13 (1.07-1.20) for NO2, 1.13 (1.04-1.22) for SO2 and 1.07 (1.01-1.12) for O-3. No significant association was observed between CO and AR. Children or adolescents are more sensitive to air pollution than adults. The effects of PM10 and SO2 were significantly stronger in Europe than Asia. The effects of air pollutants were more significant and higher in developing countries than in developed countries, except for PM10. A significant difference of subgroup test was found between developed and developing countries of NO2.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed a positive association between air pollution and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis, and identified geographic area and economic level as the potential modifiers for the association.

AB  - Background: The number of self-monitoring apps for bipolar disorder (BD) is increasing. The involvement of users in human-computer interaction (HCI) research has a long history and is becoming a core concern for designers working in this space. The application of models of involvement, such as user-centered design, is becoming standardized to optimize the reach, adoption, and sustained use of this type of technology.
   Objective: This paper aims to examine the current ways in which users are involved in the design and evaluation of self-monitoring apps for BD by investigating 3 specific questions: are users involved in the design and evaluation of technology? If so, how does this happen? And what are the best practice ingredients regarding the design of mental health technology?
   Methods: We reviewed the available literature on self-tracking technology for BD and make an overall assessment of the level of user involvement in design. The findings were reviewed by an expert panel, including an individual with lived experience of BD, to form best practice ingredients for the design of mental health technology. This combines the existing practices of patient and public involvement and HCI to evolve from the generic guidelines of user-centered design and to those that are tailored toward mental health technology.
   Results: For the first question, it was found that out of the 11 novel smartphone apps included in this review, 4 (36%) self-monitoring apps were classified as having no mention of user involvement in design, 1 (9%) self-monitoring app was classified as having low user involvement, 4 (36%) self-monitoring apps were classified as having medium user involvement, and 2 (18%) self-monitoring apps were classified as having high user involvement. For the second question, it was found that despite the presence of extant approaches for the involvement of the user in the process of design and evaluation, there is large variability in whether the user is involved, how they are involved, and to what extent there is a reported emphasis on the voice of the user, which is the ultimate aim of such design approaches. For the third question, it is recommended that users are involved in all stages of design with the ultimate goal of empowering and creating empathy for the user.
   Conclusions: Users should be involved early in the design process, and this should not just be limited to the design itself, but also to associated research ensuring end-to-end involvement. Communities in health care-based design and HCI design need to work together to increase awareness of the different methods available and to encourage the use and mixing of the methods as well as establish better mechanisms to reach the target user group. Future research using systematic literature search methods should explore this further.

AB  - Background: Cancer survivors often experience disorders from the depressive spectrum that remain largely unrecognized and overlooked. Even though screening for depression is recognized as essential, several barriers prevent its successful implementation. It is possible that better screening options can be developed. New possibilities have been opening up with advances in artificial intelligence and increasing knowledge on the connection of observable cues and psychological states.
   Objective: The aim of this scoping meta-review was to identify observable features of depression that can be intercepted using artificial intelligence in order to provide a stepping stone toward better recognition of depression among cancer survivors.
   Methods: We followed a methodological framework for scoping reviews. We searched SCOPUS and Web of Science for relevant papers on the topic, and data were extracted from the papers that met inclusion criteria. We used thematic analysis within 3 predefined categories of depression cues (ie, language, speech, and facial expression cues) to analyze the papers.
   Results: The search yielded 1023 papers, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of their findings resulted in several well-supported cues of depression in language, speech, and facial expression domains, which provides a comprehensive list of observable features that are potentially suited to be intercepted by artificial intelligence for early detection of depression.
   Conclusions: This review provides a synthesis of behavioral features of depression while translating this knowledge into the context of artificial intelligence-supported screening for depression in cancer survivors.

AB  - Impulse-control disorders are commonly observed during dopamine-replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease, but the majority of patients seems "immune" to this side effect. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a major risk factor may be a specific difference in the layout of the dopaminergic-reinforcement system, of which the ventral striatum is a central player. A series of imaging studies of the dopaminergic system point toward a presynaptic reduction of dopamine-reuptake transporter density and dopamine synthesis capacity. Here, we review current evidence for a vulnerability-stress model in which a relative reduction of dopaminergic projections to the ventral striatum and concomitant sensitization of postsynaptic neurons represent a predisposing (hypodopaminergic) vulnerability. Stress (hyperdopaminergic) is delivered when dopamine replacement therapy leads to a relative overdosing of the already-sensitized ventral striatum. These alterations are consistent with consecutive changes in reinforcement mechanisms, which stimulate learning from reward and impede learning from punishment, thereby fostering the development of impulse-control disorders. This vulnerability-stress model might also provide important insights into the development of addictions in the non-Parkinsonian population.

AB  - Objective: The primary aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and elaborate the current knowledge and recent advances in the area of PAH and its effects on CVDs and discuss the growing epidemiological evidence linking PAH to CVDs on the health of human populations. In this systematic review, the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and their relationship with PAHs were discussed in detail.Methods: On 05th April 2021, a systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed/Medline and Web of Science search engines in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. The search was limited to articles that were written in English and dealt with human issues. All original peer-review publications were considered for inclusion. Comments, case reports, reviews, duplicated papers, and conference reports were excluded. Data was collected from included papers by two independent reviewers.Results: Conclusively, 20 research articles published between 2005 and 2021 were chosen for the final analysis. The systemic review included 20 studies with a variety of geographical studies. The most common research category among the nominated studies were time-series studies followed by retrospective cohort, cross-sectional, quasi-experimental, panel, and case-control studies. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States, whereas others were showed in various geographical countries around the world, such as Denmark, Germany, Finland, Netherlands, France, China, Norway, Korea, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, and Belgium. Eight studies assessed the association between PAH exposure and CVDs, four articles observed this relationship with blood pressure (BP), two observed association between atherosclerotic CVD and PAH, one congenital heart disease, cardiovascular events, and two with obesity. Furthermore, in some investigations, a favorable association between PAH exposure and hypertension as well as PAH exposure and obesity was found.Conclusion: In conclusion, this systematic review examined the relationship of PAH exposure with CVDs and CVD-related risk factors by searching several digital databases. After a comprehensive literature searches and summarizing findings from 20 articles, the authors concluded that a positive relationship was observed between PAH exposure and CVD risks.

AB  - Introduction: The prevalence of substance use disorders in forensic populations is high. They are an important factor linked to negative outcomes in mentally ill offenders and are detrimental to forensic or non-forensic outcome measures. In contrast, substance use disorders are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, especially in forensic settings. Forensic Assertive Community Treatment is a forensic adaptation of regular assertive community treatment, combined with essential elements of forensic rehabilitation theories. Little is known however on the effectivity of forensic assertive community treatment when it comes to substance use disorders or what their exact role is on the outcome measures. In this paper, we explore how SUD is treated in Forensic assertive community treatment and how it relates to the forensic and non-forensic outcome measures.Methods: We performed a systematic review (PRISMA) of forensic Assertive community treatment teams that followed the main evidence-based principles of regular assertive community treatment and added basic elements of forensic rehabilitation. We analyzed articles the Psychinfo and Medline databases dating from 2005 to 2020. Fifteen studies fit the search criteria and were included in the analysis. The Quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.Results: SUD was highly prevalent in all studies. Patients entered FACT through two pathways, either from a care continuum or directly from prison. The severity of SUD at intake emerges as a critical element when deciding which pathway to choose, as a high severity-score at the start of FACT follow-up was linked to recidivism. While differing in method all studies offered integrated SUD treatment. These included evidence-based techniques like CBT, therapeutic communities, and Substance Abuse Management Module. Though results on SUD outcomes were mixed 4 studies mentioned abstinence in 50-75%. The severity of SUD tended to increase initially and to stabilize afterwards.Conclusion: Severity of SUD at intake emerges as a decisive element in decision-making on entering FACT teams directly from prison or through a care-continuum. The ways to provide SUD treatment varied and outcomes for SUD were mixed. SUD was found to be detrimental to forensic and non-forensic outcome measures, such as recidivism or hospitalizations during FACT treatment.

AB  - Background: Numerous studies have examined the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and hypertension. However, the results are inconsistent. Objectives: Considering the limitations of previous meta-analyses and the publication of many new studies in recent years, we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the relationship between long-term PM2.5 exposure and the incidence and prevalence of hypertension in a healthy population. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus for relevant studies published until April 2, 2021 and reviewed the reference lists of previous reviews. A total of 28 observational studies reporting RR or OR with 95% CI for the association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and the risk of hypertension were included. Results: After the sensitivity analysis, we excluded one study with a high degree of heterogeneity, resulting in 27 studies and 28 independent reports. Approximately 42 million participants were involved, and the cases of hypertension in cohort and cross-sectional studies were 508,749 and 1,793,003, respectively. The meta-analysis showed that each 10 mu g/m3 increment in PM2.5 was significantly associated with the risks of hypertension incidence (RR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.35) and prevalence (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.09). Subgroup analyses showed that occupational exposure had a significant effect on the association of PM2.5 and hypertension incidence (p for interaction = 0.042) and that the PM2.5 concentration level and physical activity had a noticeable effect on the association of PM2.5 and hypertension prevalence (p for interaction = 0.005; p for interaction = 0.022). Conclusions: A significantly positive correlation was observed between long-term PM2.5 exposure and risks of hypertension incidence and prevalence, and a high PM2.5 concentration resulted in an increased risk of hypertension.

AB  - New findings from the neurosciences receive much interest for use in the applied field of education. For the past 15 years, neuroeducation and the application of neuroscience knowledge were seen to have promise, but there is presently some lack of progress. The present paper states that this is due to several factors. Neuromyths are still prevalent, and there is a confusion of tongues between the many neurodisciplines and the domains of behavioral and educational sciences. Second, a focus upon cognitive neuroimaging research has yielded findings that are scientifically relevant, but cannot be used for direct application in the classroom. A third factor pertains to the emphasis which has been on didactics and teaching, whereas the promise of neuroeducation for the teacher may lie more on pedagogical inspiration and support. This article states that the most important knowledge and insights have to do with the notion of brain plasticity; the vision that development is driven by an interaction between a person's biology and the social system. This helps individuals to select and process information, and to adapt to the personal environment. The paper describes how brain maturation and neuropsychological development extend through the important period of adolescence and emergent adulthood. Over this long period, there is a major development of the Executive Functions (EFs) that are essential for both cognitive learning, social behavior and emotional processing and, eventually, personal growth. The paper describes the basic neuroscience knowledge and insights - or "neuroscientific literacy" - that the educational professional should have to understand and appreciate the above-described themes. The authors formulate a proposal for four themes of neuroscience content "that every teacher should know." These four themes are based on the Neuroscience Core Concepts formulated by the Society for Neuroscience. The authors emphasize that integrating neuroscientific knowledge and insights in the field of education should not be a one-way street; attempts directed at improving neuroscientific literacy are a transdisciplinary undertaking. Teacher trainers, experts from the neuroscience fields but also behavioral scientists from applied fields (notable applied neuropsychologists) should all contribute to for the educational innovations needed.

AB  - Background: Caffeine has been purported to have anxiogenic and panicogenic properties, specifically salient in patients with panic disorder (PD). However, compilations of the magnitude of the effect of caffeine on anxiety and panic attacks are lacking and potential dose-response relationships have not been examined.
   Objectives: In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to examine the acute effects of placebo-controlled caffeine challenge on occurrence of panic attacks and subjective anxiety in patients with PD and healthy controls (HC), including dose-response relationships.
   Methods: Systematic searches were performed in six databases. We included blinded placebo-controlled studies of acute caffeine challenge on panic attacks and/or subjective anxiety in adult patients with PD.
   Results: Of the 1893 identified articles, ten met our inclusion criteria. The 9 studies investigating panic attacks included 237 patients, of which 51.1% had a panic attack following caffeine, but none after placebo. Six of these studies compared 128 patients with 115 healthy controls (HC), finding that patients (53.9%) were more vulnerable than HC (1.7%) for panic attacks following caffeine (log RR: 3.47; 95% CI 2.06-4.87). Six studies investigated subjective anxiety in 121 patients and 111 HC following caffeine, with an overall effect indicating increased sensitivity to the anxiogenic effects of caffeine in the patient group (Hedges' g = 1.02 [95% CI: 0.09-1.96]). The restricted range of caffeine employed [400-750 mg] and few studies (3) not using 480 mg prevented any meaningful analysis of a dose-response relationship.
   Limitations: Of the ten studies included, only 2 reported anxiety data for the placebo condition, precluding a proper meta-analysis comparing anxiogenic effects of caffeine and placebo. The restricted dose range used prevented assessment of dose-response relationships.
   Conclusions: The results confirm that caffeine at doses roughly equivalent to 5 cups of coffee induces panic attacks in a large proportion of PD patients and highly discriminates this population from healthy adults. Caffeine also increases anxiety in PD patients as well as among healthy adults at these doses although the exact relationship between caffeine-induced anxiety and panic attacks remains uncertain. The results suggest that caffeine targets important mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of PD.

AB  - Background: Clinical evidence suggests that acupuncture is effective for relieving abdominal pain and distension in acute pancreatitis (AP). However, there is a lack of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that provide high-quality evidence of the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in this context.<br>Aim: To assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for relieving abdominal pain and distension in AP.<br>Methods: We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and China Biomedical Literature databases. Randomized controlled trials of acupuncture plus routine treatment (RT) vs. RT alone or RT plus sham/placebo acupuncture were included. Primary outcomes included total effectiveness rate, VAS scores for abdominal pain and distension, and time until relief of abdominal pain and distension. Secondary outcomes included time until recovery of bowel sound, time until first defecation, length of hospital stay, and APACHE II score.<br>Results: Nineteen eligible original studies (n = 1,503) were included. The results showed that acupuncture in combination with RT had a significant advantage in terms of increasing the total effectiveness rate [risk ratio: 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.24; P = 0.001]. Acupuncture also reduced the VAS score for abdominal pain [weighted mean difference (WMD): -1.45; 95% CI: -1.71 to -1.19; P < 0.0001] and the VAS score for abdominal distension (WMD: -0.71; 95% CI: -1.04 to -0.37; P < 0.0001) in patients with AP. Other results also showed the efficacy of acupuncture. One study reported adverse events after acupuncture.<br>Conclusion: Acupuncture in combination with RT has a better effect than RT alone for relieving abdominal pain and distension in AP. More rigorous studies are needed to confirm this result.Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO CRD42019147503 ().

AB  - The last decades of research have gradually elucidated the complex functions of the dopamine system in the vertebrate brain. The multiple roles of dopamine in motor function, learning, attention, motivation, and the emotions have been difficult to reconcile. A broad and detailed understanding of the physiology of cerebral dopamine is of importance in understanding a range of human disorders. One of the core functions of dopamine involves the basal ganglia and the learning and execution of automatized sequences of movements. Speech is one of the most complex and highly automatized sequential motor behaviors, though the exact roles that the basal ganglia and dopamine play in speech have been difficult to determine. Stuttering is a speech disorder that has been hypothesized to be related to the functions of the basal ganglia and dopamine. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the current understanding of the cerebral dopamine system, in particular the mechanisms related to motor learning and the execution of movement sequences. The primary aim was not to review research on speech and stuttering, but to provide a platform of neurophysiological mechanisms, which may be utilized for further research and theoretical development on speech, speech disorders, and other behavioral disorders. Stuttering and speech are discussed here only briefly. The review indicates that a primary mechanism for the automatization of movement sequences is the merging of isolated movements into chunks that can be executed as units. In turn, chunks can be utilized hierarchically, as building blocks of longer chunks. It is likely that these mechanisms apply also to speech, so that frequent syllables and words are produced as motor chunks. It is further indicated that the main learning principle for sequence learning is reinforcement learning, with the phasic release of dopamine as the primary teaching signal indicating successful sequences. It is proposed that the dynamics of the dopamine system constitute the main neural basis underlying the situational variability of stuttering.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the production and deposition of beta-amyloid protein (A beta) and hyperphosphorylated tau, leading to the formation of beta-amyloid plaques (APs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Although calcium ions (Ca2+) promote the formation of APs and NFTs, no systematic review of the mechanisms by which Ca2+ affects the development and progression of AD has been published. Therefore, the current review aimed to fill the gaps between elevated Ca2+ levels and the pathogenesis of AD. Specifically, we mainly focus on the molecular mechanisms by which Ca2+ affects the neuronal networks of neuroinflammation, neuronal injury, neurogenesis, neurotoxicity, neuroprotection, and autophagy. Furthermore, the roles of Ca2+ transporters located in the cell membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and lysosome in mediating the effects of Ca2+ on activating neuronal networks that ultimately contribute to the development and progression of AD are discussed. Finally, the drug candidates derived from herbs used as food or seasoning in Chinese daily life are summarized to provide a theoretical basis for improving the clinical treatment of AD.

AB  - Western Pacific Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex (ALS/PDC) is a disappearing prototypical neurodegenerative disorder (tau-dominated polyproteinopathy) linked with prior exposure to phytogenotoxins in cycad seed used for medicine and/or food. The principal cycad genotoxin, methylazoxymethanol (MAM), forms reactive carbon-centered ions that alkylate nucleic acids in fetal rodent brain and, depending on the timing of systemic administration, induces persistent developmental abnormalities of the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and retina. Whereas administration of MAM prenatally or postnatally can produce animal models of epilepsy, schizophrenia or ataxia, administration to adult animals produces little effect on brain structure or function. The neurotoxic effects of MAM administered to rats during cortical brain development (specifically, gestation day 17) are used to model the histological, neurophysiological and behavioral deficits of human schizophrenia, a condition that may precede or follow clinical onset of motor neuron disease in subjects with sporadic ALS and ALS/PDC. While studies of migrants to and from communities impacted by ALS/PDC indicate the degenerative brain disorder may be acquired in juvenile and adult life, a proportion of indigenous cases shows neurodevelopmental aberrations in the cerebellum and retina consistent with MAM exposure in utero. MAM induces specific patterns of DNA damage and repair that associate with increased tau expression in primary rat neuronal cultures and with brain transcriptional changes that parallel those associated with human ALS and Alzheimer's disease. We examine MAM in relation to neurodevelopment, epigenetic modification, DNA damage/replicative stress, genomic instability, somatic mutation, cell-cycle reentry and cellular senescence. Since the majority of neurodegenerative disease lacks a solely inherited genetic basis, research is needed to explore the hypothesis that early-life exposure to genotoxic agents may trigger or promote molecular events that culminate in neurodegeneration.

AB  - The pathway to receiving specialty care for first episode psychosis (FEP) among Black youth in the US has received little attention despite documented challenges that negatively impact engagement in care and clinical outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of US-based research, reporting findings related to the pathway experiences of Black individuals with FEP and their family members. A systematic search of PubMed, Psyclnfo, and Embase/Medline was performed with no date restrictions up to April 2021. Included studies had samples with at least 75% Black individuals and/or their family members or explicitly examined racial differences. Of the 80 abstracts screened, 28 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies were categorized into three categories: premordid and prodromal phase, help-seeking experiences, and the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP). Compounding factors such as trauma, substance use, and structural barriers that occur during the premorbid and prodromal contribute to delays in treatment initiation and highlight the limited use of services for traumatic childhood experiences {e.g., sexual abuse). Studies focused on help-seeking experiences demonstrated the limited use of mental health services and the potentially traumatic entry to services {e.g., law enforcement), which is associated with a longer DUP. Although the majority of studies focused on help-seeking experiences and predictors of DUP, findings suggests that for Black populations, there is a link between trauma and substance use in the pathway to care that impacts the severity of symptoms, initiation of treatment, and DUP. The present review also identifies the need for more representative studies of Black individuals with FEP.

AB  - Background Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experienced a burden of organised violence within 18 low-income and middle-income countries and hosted over 33 million displaced persons in 2019. Community-centred mental health and psychosocial support (cc-MHPSS) programmes may provide insights to address the psychosocial well-being of conflict-affected individuals, though literature is mixed on community impact. This review aimed to synthesise qualitative evidence to understand the kind of experiences conflict-affected participants have and how these experiences occur during cc-MHPSS programme engagement in SSA. Methods We searched Global Health, MEDLINE, Psychological Information Database, Embase Classic+Embase, Social Policy and Practice, Web of Science, Africa-Wide Information, PubMed and Global Index Medicus databases. Eligible publications qualitatively reported on conflict-affected participants' experiences of engagement in cc-MHPSS programmes. Data were extracted to summarise publication characteristics. The results were synthesised using a thematic synthesis analysis. Results The search yielded 953 records, of which 20 publications were included in the review. Included publications were located in Rwanda (n=8), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (n=3), Mozambique (n=3), Sierra Leone (n=1), Ghana (n=1), Uganda (n=1), Zimbabwe (n=1) and South Sudan (n=1); one publication included three countries (Sierra Leone, Liberia and Uganda). Findings include the themes of (1) the experience of change in time and space, and (2) the sharing and silence of participants' experiences. Findings demonstrate that elements transferred by participants from a cc-MHPSS programme to a natural community, and vice versa, contribute to participants' healing. Elements' transfer, or non-transfer, was often related to participants' disclosure, or non-disclosure, of experiences. Discussion Findings suggest that there are elements from a cc-MHPSS programme and a wider community which aid participant engagement and work therapeutically. More rigorous research is needed concerning how participants experience change during cc-MHPSS programme engagement in proximity to their relationship with the wider community.

AB  - The relativistic fluid is a highly successful model used to describe the dynamics of many-particle systems moving at high velocities and/or in strong gravity. It takes as input physics from microscopic scales and yields as output predictions of bulk, macroscopic motion. By inverting the process-e.g., drawing on astrophysical observations-an understanding of relativistic features can lead to insight into physics on the microscopic scale. Relativistic fluids have been used to model systems as "small" as colliding heavy ions in laboratory experiments, and as large as the Universe itself, with "intermediate" sized objects like neutron stars being considered along the way. The purpose of this review is to discuss the mathematical and theoretical physics underpinnings of the relativistic (multi-) fluid model. We focus on the variational principle approach championed by Brandon Carter and collaborators, in which a crucial element is to distinguish the momenta that are conjugate to the particle number density currents. This approach differs from the "standard" text-book derivation of the equations of motion from the divergence of the stress-energy tensor in that one explicitly obtains the relativistic Euler equation as an "integrability" condition on the relativistic vorticity. We discuss the conservation laws and the equations of motion in detail, and provide a number of (in our opinion) interesting and relevant applications of the general theory. The formalism provides a foundation for complex models, e.g., including electromagnetism, superfluidity and elasticity-all of which are relevant for state of the art neutron-star modelling.

AB  - Background An 'ethnic' or 'group' density effect in psychosis has been observed, whereby the risk of psychosis in minority group individuals is inversely related to neighbourhood-level proportions of others belonging to the same group. However, there is conflicting evidence over whether this effect differs between minority groups and limited investigation into other moderators. Aims To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the group density effect in psychosis and examine moderators. Method Four databases were systematically searched. A narrative review was conducted and a three-level meta-analysis was performed. The potential moderating effect of crudely and specifically defined minority groups was assessed. Country, time, area size and whether studies used clinical or non-clinical outcomes were also tested as moderators. Results Thirty-two studies were included in the narrative review and ten in the meta-analysis. A 10 percentage-point decrease in own-group density was associated with a 20% increase in psychosis risk (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.32, P < 0.001). This was moderated by crudely defined minority groups (F-6,F-68 = 6.86, P < 0.001), with the strongest associations observed in Black populations, followed by a White Other sample. Greater heterogeneity was observed when specific minority groups were assessed (F-25,F-49 = 7.26, P < 0.001). Conclusions This is the first review to provide meta-analytic evidence that the risk of psychosis posed by lower own-group density varies across minority groups, with the strongest associations observed in Black individuals. Heterogeneity in effect sizes may reflect distinctive social experiences of specific minority groups. Potential mechanisms are discussed, along with the implications of findings and suggestions for future research.

AB  - While much is known about the health implications of low birthweight for infants and adults, there is limited information about the health implications in childhood, particularly for Indigenous children. The aim of this systematic review was to assess associations between low birthweight (LBW) and/or small for gestational age (SGA) and the developmental, physical or mental health outcomes for Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Indigenous children (5-12 years), including the potential mediating role of cultural connections. The review was guided by an Aboriginal Advisory Group established to guide the Aboriginal Families Study. Four databases were investigated with pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The search identified 417 articles after independent screening by two authors. Eight studies assessing six child outcomes were included. The review identified limited evidence, although the review suggested possible links between LBW and/or SGA and childhood asthma, lower body mass index (BMI) and poorer academic performance. Links between LBW, SGA and disability, global health and developmental vulnerability were inconclusive. One study identified cultural-based resilience as protective against perinatal adversity. In summary, research on the relationship between adverse birth outcomes and Indigenous children's health and development is limited. Further investigation and collaboration with Indigenous communities is required to drive optimised health and social services responses and equitable system reform.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health problems in many individuals, including children. Children with pre-existing socio-demographic or developmental risk factors may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of the pandemic and associated public health preventive measures.<br>Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children aged 5-13 years-old, while highlighting the specific difficulties experienced by children with neurodevelopmental issues or chronic health conditions.<br>Methods: A systematic search of the published literature was conducted in Medline, ERIC, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, followed by a quantitative meta-analysis of the eligible studies.<br>Results: Out of the 985 articles identified, 28 empirical studies with prospective or retrospective longitudinal data were included in the quantitative synthesis. COVID-19 lockdown measures were associated with negative general mental health outcomes among children (g = 0.28, p < 0.001, and k = 21), but of small magnitude. Sleep habits were also changed during the pandemic, as sleep duration significantly increased in children (g = 0.32; p = 0.004, and k = 9). Moreover, results did not differ between children from the general population and those from clinical populations such as children with epilepsy, oncology, neurodevelopmental disorders, or obesity. Effect sizes were larger in European vs. Asian countries.<br>Conclusions: Studies included in this review suggest that children's mental health was generally negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's mental health and the influence of specific risks factors as they evolve over time.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to determine the adherence to lifestyle interventions for adults with depression and to estimate the dropout rates in trials examining the impact of these interventions. A bibliographic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane library, and several sources of grey literature. We included randomised controlled trials examining the impact of multiple lifestyle interventions on depressive symptomatology in adults when compared to control or other active treatments. Two reviewers independently screened citations, extracted the relevant data, and assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane tools. A random effects meta-analysis of proportions was used to summarise the proportion of participants who completed the intervention and to determine the proportion of dropouts at post-treatment assessment. Multiple subgroup analyses were also carried out. We identified six trials. The meta-analysis of proportions showed that 53% (95%CI 49% to 58%) of the participants assigned to the intervention group fully adhered to the intervention program. The weighted mean proportion of completed intervention sessions was 66%. The pooled trial dropout rate was 22% (95%CI 20% to 24%). Around half of adults with depression adhere to lifestyle interventions. Future research is needed to develop interventions to support adherence to lifestyle interventions in depressive patients.

AB  - Background: Scarce data exists about the effect of peer support on individuals with overweight or obesity. This study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis regarding the effect of peer support on weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, quality of life, social support and depressive symptoms in individuals with overweight and obesity.
   Methods: PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched for relevant studies from their inceptions to 1 Mar 2020, and 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTS) were included. Data were pooled with Review Manager 5.3.
   Results: Significantly small improvement in weight (-0.78 kg) was found in individuals who received peer support than those who received usual care (MD= -0.78 kg, 95% CI-1.33 to -0.22, P=0.02). And peer support appeared to be associated with significant decrease in BMI levels (MD= -0.16 kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.32 to -0.01, P=0.04). However, there was no statistically significant improvement in the levels of waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, quality of life, social support and depressive symptoms after peer support.
   Conclusion: Peer support appears to be associated with decreased weight and BMI levels in individuals with overweight and obesity. However, additional research is warranted due to insufficient evidence for the effects of peer support on the other health indicators.

AB  - This study presents a systematic review (SR) of the literature on the use of Augmented Reality (AR) for the development of spatial skills of secondary and higher education students in the teaching of subjects related to the area of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Numerous researchers have confirmed that students tend to have difficulties in acquiring learning content with a high visual load, which is why AR is being used to improve teaching-learning processes. This paper aims to present information of interest to researchers, teachers and software developers about the advantages and limitations of AR in the development of spatial intelligence, the integration and development of AR applications, as well as the predominant spatial skills and assessment methods. In this regard, an initial search was carried out which returned 242 articles. After reviewing and assessing their eligibility, a total of 17 papers published since 2002 were selected. The findings reveal an increase in the number of investigations over the last few years. Some of the most notable findings are the improvement of spatial skills of students through the inclusion of AR in educational environments, the need for teacher training, the lack of personalization in the applications developed and the scarcity of augmented materials in the form of Open Educational Resources (OER).

AB  - Intelligent assistive robots can enhance the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers. They can increase the independence of older adults, reduce tensions between a person with dementia and their caregiver, and increase social engagement. This article provides a review of assistive robots designed for and evaluated by persons with dementia. Assistive robots that only increased mobility or brain-computer interfaces were excluded. Google Scholar, IEEE Digital Library, PubMed, and ACM Digital Library were searched. A final set of 53 articles covering research in 16 different countries are reviewed. Assistive robots are categorized into five different applications and evaluated for their effectiveness, as well as the robots' social and emotional capabilities. Our findings show that robots used in the context of therapy or for increasing engagement received the most attention in the literature, whereas the robots that assist by providing health guidance or help with an activity of daily living received relatively limited attention. PARO was the most commonly used robot in dementia care studies. The effectiveness of each assistive robot and the outcome of the studies are discussed, and particularly, the social/emotional capabilities of each assistive robot are summarized. Gaps in the research literature are identified and we provide directions for future work.

AB  - Intersectionality is a theoretical framework that investigates how interlocking systems of power and oppression at the societal level influence the lived experiences of historically and socially marginalized groups. Currently, there are no consistent or widely adopted quantitative methods to investigate research questions informed by intersectionality theory. The objective of this systematic review is to describe the current landscape of quantitative methods used to assess intersectionality and to provide recommendations on analytic best practices for future research. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science in December 2019 to identify studies using analytic quantitative intersectionality approaches published up to December 2019 (PROSPERO CRD42020162686). To be included in the study, articles had to: (1) be empirical research, (2) use a quantitative statistical method, (3) be published in English, and (4) incorporate intersectionality. Our initial search yielded 1889 articles. After screening by title/abstract, methods, and full text review, our final analytic sample included 153 papers. Eight unique classes of quantitative methods were identified, with the majority of studies employing regression with an interaction term. We additionally identified several methods which appear to be at odds with the key tenets of intersectionality. As quantitative intersectionality continues to expand, careful attention is needed to avoid the dilution of the core tenets. Specifically, emphasis on social power is needed as methods continue to be adopted and developed. Additionally, clear explanation of the selection of statistical approaches is needed and, when using regression with interaction terms, researchers should opt for use of the additive scale. Finally, use of methods that are potentially at odds with the tenets of intersectionality should be avoided.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to assess factors affecting panic buying and strategies to deal with them during COVID-19 with a scoping review.
   Method: The review was performed based on Arksey and O'Malley. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, and Science Direct databases were selected to search. All English language full-text articles from Jan 2020 to May 2021 were included. Initially, the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were read and screening was accomplished based on the research question. After that, the full text of eligible studies was examined. A third reviewer was resolved disagreements at any stage by a consensus meeting. A self-assessment form was designed for data extraction. The causes of panic buying were assessed as a descriptive study.
   Results: The search process returned 23 articles after deletion for complete data extraction and analysis. Through thematic analysis, the factors influencing panic buying were divided into six categories including cognitive, emotional, behavioral, social, and economic factors as well as government action, and finally, the recommended strategies were categorized in two categories included psychosocial and economic.
   Conclusion: A holistic view of panic buying's causes allows planners and decision-makers to design categorized strategies beyond the suggested strategies. Increasing customer awareness and monitoring the flow of information through social media and mass media, psychotherapy, counseling, and economic strategies are considered by planners to combat panic buying.

KW  - mental health

KW  - recovery orientation
KW  - WRAP
AB  - Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP) is a structured recovery education program used internationally for anyone who wishes to create a positive change in their life. It was developed by Mary Ellen Copeland and Jane Winterling in the late 90s, resulting from a search of programs or initiatives that could support their wellness. Since then, many studies have been conducted into the efficacy of the program for those with a mental health/addiction challenge. However, to date, there has been little to no synthesis of the evidence base for WRAP outside of the Copeland Center's internal reviews. The proposed systematic review and meta-analysis aims to investigate the evidence base for Wellness Recovery Action Planning within a mental health context. To do this, a PRISMA 2020 compliant review is proposed using the PRISMA-P statement as a guide to demonstrate the methodology to be undertaken. It outlines the inclusion/exclusion criteria, search terms, and databases while informing the readership of timescales to complete such actions. Finally, this protocol also addresses issues of bias and quality within included studies. This proposed literature review and meta-analysis will synthesize and examine the evidence base for WRAP using a systematic review methodology. It is hoped that this proposed review will identify gaps in the current literature regarding the program, and provide recommendations that will support the reviewers in their further studies while also strengthening the argument for a whole system evaluation of WRAP within an Irish context.

AB  - Electronic waste (e-waste) contains numerous chemicals harmful to human and ecological health. To update a 2013 review assessing adverse human health consequences of exposure to e-waste, we systematically reviewed studies reporting effects on humans related to e-waste exposure. We searched EMBASE, PsycNET, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PubMed for articles published between Dec 18, 2012, and Jan 28, 2020, restricting our search to publications in English. Of the 5645 records identified, we included 70 studies that met the preset criteria. People living in e-waste exposed regions had significantly elevated levels of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. Children and pregnant women were especially susceptible during the critical periods of exposure that detrimentally affect diverse biological systems and organs. Elevated toxic chemicals negatively impact on neonatal growth indices and hormone level alterations in e-waste exposed populations. We recorded possible connections between chronic exposure to e-waste and DNA lesions, telomere attrition, inhibited vaccine responsiveness, elevated oxidative stress, and altered immune function. The existence of various toxic chemicals in e-waste recycling areas impose plausible adverse health outcomes. Novel cost-effective methods for safe recycling operations need to be employed in e-waste sites to ensure the health and safety of vulnerable populations.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to analyze the effects of workplace interventions (WI) on clinical outcomes related to low back pain (LBP) in a worker population, and to assess socio-economic parameters as participants on sick leave, days of sick leave, and return to work following WI. A systematic literature search was performed to select randomized clinical trials that investigated the effectiveness of WI on return to work, sick leave, and working capacity of workers affected by nonspecific LBP. Fourteen articles were included in the review and meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed improvements in pain (p = 0.004), disability (p = 0.0008), fear-avoidance for psychical activity (p = 0.004), and quality of life (p = 0.001 for physical scale and p = 0.03 for mental scale) for patients who underwent WI compared to controls. Moreover, the pain reduction following WI was statistically significant in the healthcare workers' group (p = 0.005), but not in the other workers' group. The participants on sick leave and the number of days of sick leave decreased in the WI group without statistical significance (p = 0.85 and p = 0.10, respectively). Finally, LBP recurrence was significantly reduced in the WI group (p = 0.006). WI led to a significant improvement of clinical outcomes in a workers' population affected by LBP.

AB  - Marine environments are contaminated with enormous amounts of warfare agents due to military activity and exercise, and the disposal of unused ordnance. Due to corrosion of munition shells, substances are leaking from the warfare materials into the environment. It has to be expected that climate change will influence munition corrosion and distribution of their content. Although there is no doubt about the principle toxicity of many of the munition compounds, including their transformation/degradation products, the impact of munition compounds on marine environments, including their biota are yet only at the beginning to be understood. Recently the intake of munition compounds has been confirmed in mussels and fish collected from contaminated areas. It has become clear that dumped munitions are a continuous source of toxic substances leaking into the environment and that ongoing corrosion will worsen the problem. The present review intends to evaluate the available literature on how climate change might influence the contamination of marine environments and inhabiting biota with munition compounds. Direct testing (or modelling) of climate change scenarios in the context of the marine munition problems has yet not been undertaken. Nevertheless, it can be predicted that climate change effects such as rising temperature and higher frequencies of extreme weather events will accelerate the rates at which disposed ordnance corrodes and consequently accelerate the rate at which munition compounds are leaking out. Climate change will cause elevated stress to biota, ranging from temperature stress and lower availability of oxygen to shifts in salinity and pH. In combination, elevated release of munition related compounds and elevated environmental stress, will put biota under threat, in particular in areas with high munition contamination and limited water exchange, such as the Baltic Sea. On a positive side, biodegradation of organic munition compounds by biota and microorganisms is likely to be accelerated with rising temperature.

AB  - Knee osteoarthritis (OA) causes pain, disability and poor quality of life in the elderly. The primary aim was to identify and map out the current evidence for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on complex lifestyle and psychosocial interventions for knee OA. The secondary aim was to outline different components of complex lifestyle and psychosocial interventions. Our scoping review searched five databases from 2000 to 2021 where complex lifestyle or psychosocial interventions for patients with knee OA were compared to other interventions. Screening and data extraction were performed by two review authors independently and discrepancies resolved through consensus and in parallel with a third reviewer. A total of 38 articles were selected: 9 studied the effectiveness of psychological interventions; 11 were on self-management and lifestyle interventions; 18 looked at multifaceted interventions. This review highlights the substantial variation in knee OA interventions and the overall lack of quality in the current literature. Potential areas of future research, including identifying prognostic social factors, stratified care models, transdisciplinary care delivery and technology augmented interventions, have been identified. Further high-quality RCTs utilizing process evaluations and economic evaluation in accordance with the MRC guidelines are critical for the development of evidence-based knee OA programs globally.

AB  - Common mental health disorders (CMDs) represent a major public health concern and are particularly prevalent in people experiencing disadvantage or marginalisation. Primary care is the first point of contact for people with CMDs. Pharmaceutical interventions, such as antidepressants, are commonly used in the treatment of CMDs; however, there is concern that these treatments are over-prescribed and ineffective for treating mental distress related to social conditions. Non-pharmaceutical primary care interventions, such as psychological therapies and "social prescribing", provide alternatives for CMDs. Little is known, however, about which such interventions reduce social inequalities in CMD-related outcomes, and which may, unintentionally, increase them. The aim of this protocol (PROSPERO registration number CRD42021281166) is to describe how we will undertake a systematic review to assess the effects of non-pharmaceutical primary care interventions on CMD-related outcomes and social inequalities. A systematic review of quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods primary studies will be undertaken and reported according to the PRISMA-Equity guidance. The following databases will be searched: Assia, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsycInfo and Scopus. Retrieved records will be screened according to pre-defined eligibility criteria and synthesised using a narrative approach, with meta-analysis if feasible. The findings of this review will guide efforts to commission more equitable mental health services.

AB  - Arteriosclerosis requires early detection and treatment. However, its treatment remains insufficiently established. Elucidating the mechanisms of vasorelaxation may lead to early treatment and contribute to the prevention of diseases caused by arteriosclerosis. The ability of acupuncture/moxibustion stimulation to temporarily increase vasorelaxation and vascular flow has been extensively reported, but its mechanism remains unknown. We successfully modeled the mechanism starting from acupuncture/moxibustion stimulation to vasorelaxation/vasodilation by collating the results of numerous studies in various fields, such as medicine, biology, neurosciences, and pharmacology. Ion channels, including transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, exist at free nerve endings. Acupuncture/moxibustion stimulation is sensed by its ion channels and generates nitric oxide in three subsequent pathways, which leads to vasorelaxation. The three pathways are 1) the nNOS activity pathway (based on neural information), 2) eNOS activity pathway (based on vascular wall shear stress), and 3) iNOS activity pathway (based on multiple cytokines produced by macrophages). These pathways differ depending on the external stimulus; however, in each case, they lead to vasorelaxation and contribute to arteriosclerosis prevention. These pathways can be expected to create complex circuits and produce sustained stimulation effects. This model is expected to contribute to the expansion of the research fields and improvement of treatment methods for medical professionals.

AB  - Severe mental illness (SMI) is associated with poor daily functioning; however available interventions currently under-deliver on their recovery prospect. Mobile digital health (mHealth) interventions are increasingly being developed and evaluated, and have the potential to support recovery. This review evaluates the use of mHealth technology to assess, monitor and reduce functioning difficulties in people with SMI. Studies were systematically searched on multiple databases. Study quality was assessed and double-rated independently. Findings were organised using a narrative synthesis and results were summarised according to the mHealth device purpose, i.e., assessment and monitoring or intervention. Thirty-eight studies comprised of 2262 participants met the inclusion criteria. Smartphones were the most popular mHealth device; personal digital assistants, wearables and tablets were also used. mHealth was widely found to be acceptable and feasible, with preliminary findings suggesting it can support functional recovery by augmenting an intervention, simplifying the assessment, increasing monitoring frequency and/or providing more detailed information. Considerations for overcoming barriers to implementation, recommendations for future research to establish effectiveness, personalisation and specification of mHealth devices and methodologies are discussed. The value of mHealth for remote delivery of recovery based interventions is also considered.

AB  - School engagement is considered an antidote to several academic problems found in middle and high school. Previous data highlight the importance of understanding school engagement in early years. The present systematic review aims to outline investigations regarding school engagement in elementary school. Findings are expected to (i) help educators learn about research in a comprehensible way, (ii) design future school-based interventions with strong theoretical support, and (iii) systematize information about research gaps and indicate new avenues for investigation. The systematic search for original articles published up to 2018 followed the PRISMA statement and Cochrane's guidelines. A total of 102 articles were included and organized, according to the self-system model of motivational development from Skinner et al. (Journal of Educational Psychology, 100, 765-781, 2008). Results showed that balanced and quality support from peers, teachers, and parents positively influenced school engagement. Additionally, some common characteristics of the school context were found to undermine school engagement. Regarding interventions aimed to promote school engagement, we found various effective designs, differing in complexity. Moreover, studies focused on students' emotions, behaviors and cognitions, experiences, motivational variables, and learning provided important inputs to promote school engagement. Furthermore, studies focused on examining the trajectories of school engagement provided data to understand how to prevent school engagement from declining throughout schooling. Finally, most studies found a positive and significant relationship between school engagement and achievement; however, results differ regarding the source of information or school domain examined. The school engagement conceptualizations, dimensions, and measures used were analyzed and their relationships to the results were discussed.

AB  - Successful blinding in double-blind RCTs is crucial for minimizing bias, however studies rarely report information about blinding. Among RCTs for depression, the rates of testing and success of blinding is unknown. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the rates of testing, predictors, and success of blinding in RCTs of antidepressants for depression. Following systematic search, further information about blinding assessment was requested from corresponding authors of the included studies. We reported the frequency of blinding assessment across all RCTs, and conducted logistic regression analyses to assess predictors of blinding reporting. Participant and/or investigator guesses about treatment allocation were used to calculate Bang's Blinding Index (BI). The BI between RCT arms was compared using meta-analysis. Across the 295 included trials, only 4.7% of studies assessed blinding. Pharmaceutical company sponsorship predicted blinding assessment; unsponsored trials were more likely to assess blinding. Meta-analysis suggested that blinding was unsuccessful among participants and investigators. Results suggest that blinding is rarely assessed, and often fails, among RCTs of antidepressants. This is concerning considering controversy around the efficacy of antidepressant medication. Blinding should be routinely assessed and reported in RCTs of antidepressants, and trial outcomes should be considered in light of blinding success or failure.

AB  - Balneotherapy (BT) is one of the most commonly used non-pharmacologic complementary therapies for different rheumatic diseases. Its beneficial properties probably derived from a combination of mechanical, thermal, and chemical effects, but the exact mechanism of action is not elucidated. This review aimed at summarizing the current knowledge about the effects of BT, and identifying its possible mechanism of action in different rheumatic diseases. Pubmed and Scopus were used to perform a search of the literature to extract articles including terms related to BT and rheumatic diseases published in the period from 2010 to 2021. We selected pre-clinical studies, randomized controlled trials, and clinical trials. The results of clinical studies confirmed the beneficial properties on different mediators and factors of inflammation, oxidative stress, cartilage metabolism, and humoral and cellular immune responses in patients affected by chronic degenerative musculoskeletal disorders. The data derived from OA and RA-induced murine models revealed the efficacy of different BT treatments in decreasing pain, inflammation, and improving mobility, as well as in reducing the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes and markers of oxidative stress damage. Different in vitro studies analyzed the potential effect of a mineral water, as a whole, or of a mineral element, demonstrating their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and chondroprotective properties in OA cartilage, synoviocytes and chondrocytes, and osteoblast and osteoclast cultures. The presented data are promising and confirm BT as an effective complementary approach in the management of several low-grade inflammation, degenerative, and stress-related pathologies, as rheumatic diseases.

AB  - Objective: Polydipsia is defined at the intake of excessive fluid (>3 L daily). Psychogenic polydipsia (PPD) presents without an identifiable medical cause and is often seen in patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia, OCD, anxiety, alcohol use disorder, and other psychotic disorders. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the therapeutic effect of various non-antipsychotic medications on patients with a stable psychotic illness and concurrent PPD. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE with Full Text, CINAHL complete, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, Cochrane methodology register, MasterFILE Premier, APA PsychArticles, APA PsychInfo, APA PsycBooks, APA PsycTests, TRIP, Nursing and Allied Health. The quality of each retained study was assessed using appropriate risk of bias tools based on study design. Results: The initial search resulted in 1422 articles from which 22 articles were included for qualitative synthesis. Study designs ranged from case reports to double blind, placebo controlled randomized trials and was interpreted uniquely based on study design. Acetazolamide was effective in improving some PPD outcomes. Fluoxetine at high doses was effective in reducing fluid intake and polydipsia. Other medications included in this review performed equivocally for reduction of numerous parameters evaluating PPD. Conclusion: No one drug appeared to be the most efficacious; however, some did show promise in specific populations. Those in need of pharmacotherapeutic options for PPD may consider one of the included agents to assist with co-morbid state. Further high-quality research is needed to provide better treatment guidance for PPD.

AB  - The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of publications that reported the association between dispositional optimism and depression during youth, analyzing if the strength of this relationship varied according to potential factors. Systematic searches were carried out in APA PsycNet, Virtual Health Library, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed Central, and Scopus to collect English, Portuguese, or Spanish studies from 2009 onwards. Two reviewers selected the eligible articles, assessed the quality of each study, and extracted the data. For the synthesis of the results, a meta-analytic approach was used. We identified 4077 publications in the initial searches and 22 in the supplementary searches, from which 31 studies remained for analysis once the eligibility criteria were applied. The results showed a statistically significant negative association between dispositional optimism and depression in the young population, age being a factor that modifies the effect measure between these variables. This meta-analysis provides a consistent and robust synthesis on the interaction effect between dispositional optimism and depression in the young population. Based on these findings, early clinical admissions may effectively improve optimistic tendencies in young people, which could help them prevent depressive symptoms or episodes.

AB  - While a definitive understanding of the molecular pathology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is far from a current reality, it has become increasingly clear that many of the molecular effects of PTSD are sex specific. Women are twice as likely as men to develop PTSD after a traumatic event, and neurobiological evidence suggests that there are structural differences between the brains of males versus females with PTSD. Recent advances in genomic technologies have begun to shed light on the sex-specific molecular determinants of PTSD, which seem to be governed predominantly by dysfunction of GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic) signaling and immune function. We review the current state of the field of PTSD genomics focusing on the effect of sex. We provide an overview of difference in heritability of PTSD based on sex, how difference in gene regulation based on sex impacts the PTSD brain, and what is known about genomic regulation that is dysregulated in specific cell types in PTSD.

AB  - The ability to deceive is a key milestone in social cognitive development for typically developing individuals. In this scoping review, we systematically searched the literature to summarise research on deceptive behaviour in autism and identify gaps in knowledge. Across the 28 studies identified, three main themes were synthesised, with seven subthemes: (1) Deception ability and prevalence (1a) gameplay deception; (1b) naturalistic deception; (2) Psychological correlates of deception (2a) verbal, intellectual and social ability; (2b) theory of mind (ToM) behaviours; (2c) executive function; and (3) Social learning (3a) training; (3b) social contexts. The findings challenge common stereotypes, showing that autistic individuals can and do engage in deception. However, many do so less frequently and less adeptly than typically developing individuals. Emerging evidence also suggests that autistic individuals (without co-occurring intellectual disability) may use compensatory strategies when engaging in deception, and that more skilled deceptive behaviour may arise later in life. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. Lay abstract The ability to deceive others is an important skill that usually develops in early childhood. In this review, we give an overview of studies that have examined deceptive behaviour in autistic children, adolescents and adults. We separated the study findings into three main categories and seven sub-categories: (1) Deception ability and prevalence (1a) gameplay deception; (1b) naturalistic deception; (2) Psychological processes in deception (2a) verbal, intellectual and social ability; (2b) ability to understand others' thoughts and beliefs; (2c) cognitive ability; and (3) Social learning (3a) training; (3b) social contexts. Contrary to some stereotypes, we found that autistic people can and do deceive but often find this more difficult than non-autistic people. We also found that autistic people may use different psychological processes than non-autistic people when deceiving and may get better at deception in adulthood.

AB  - Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a typical intervention treating drug-refractory dystonia. Currently, the selection of the better target, the GPi or STN, is debatable. The outcomes of DBS treating dystonia classified by body distribution and etiology is also a popular question.Objective: To comprehensively compare the efficacy, quality of life, mood, and adverse effects (AEs) of GPi-DBS vs. STN-DBS in dystonia as well as in specific types of dystonia classified by body distribution and etiology.Methods: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched to identify studies of GPi-DBS and STN-DBS in populations with dystonia. The efficacy, quality of life, mood, and adverse effects were quantitatively compared. Meta-regression analyses were also performed. This analysis has been registered in PROSPERO under the number CRD42020146145.Results: Thirty five studies were included in the main analysis, in which 319 patients underwent GPI-DBS and 113 patients underwent STN-DBS. The average follow-up duration was 12.48 months (range, 3-49 months). The GPI and STN groups were equivalent in terms of efficacy, quality of life, mood, and occurrence of AEs. The focal group demonstrated significantly better disability symptom improvement (P = 0.012) than the segmental and generalized groups but showed less SF-36 enhancement than the segmental group (P < 0.001). The primary groups exhibited significantly better movement and disability symptom improvements than the secondary non-hereditary group (P < 0.005), which demonstrated only disability symptom improvement compared with the secondary hereditary group (P < 0.005). The primary hereditary and idiopathic groups had a significantly lower frequency of AEs than the secondary non-hereditary group (P < 0.005). The correlation between disability symptom improvement and movement symptom improvement was also significant (P < 0.05).Conclusion: GPi-DBS and STN-DBS were both safe and resulted in excellent improvement in efficacy and quality of life in patients with dystonia. Compared with patients with segmental dystonia, patients with focal dystonia demonstrated better improvement in dystonia symptoms but less enhancement of quality of life. Those with primary dystonia had a better response to DBS in terms of efficacy than those with secondary dystonia. Patients who exhibit a significant improvement in movement symptoms might also exhibit excellent improvement in disability symptoms.

AB  - Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used worldwide for anesthesia, pain management, treatment resistant depression (TRD) and suicidality. Predictors of antidepressant response and adverse effects to ketamine remain poorly understood due to contradictory results. The objective of the systematic review herein is to identify and evaluate the extant literature assessing pharmacogenomic predictors of ketamine clinical benefits and adverse effects. Electronic databases were searched from inception to July 2021 to identify relevant articles. Twelve articles involving 1,219 participants with TRD, 75 who underwent elective surgeries and received ketamine as an anesthetic, 49 with pain, and 68 healthy participants met the inclusion criteria and enrolled to this review. While identified articles reported mixed results, three predictors emerged: 1) Val66Met (rs6265) brain derived neu-rotrophic factor (BDNF; Met allele) was associated with reduced antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects, 2) CYP2B6*6 (e.g., CYB2B6 metabolizer) was associated with more severe dissociative effects and 3) NET allelic (rs28386840) variant were associated with greater cardiovascular complications (e.g., moderate to severe treatment emergent hypertension). Several important limitations were identified, most notably the small sample sizes and heterogeneity of study design and results. Taken together, preliminary evidence suggests the potential for pharmacogenomic testing to inform clinical practices; however, further research is needed to better deter-mine genetic variants of greatest importance and the clinical validity of pharmacogenomics to help guide ke-tamine treatment planning.

AB  - Background Risk assessment and risk management are fundamental processes in the delivery of safe and effective mental health care, yet studies have shown that service users are often not directly involved or are unaware that an assessment has taken place. Shared decision-making in mental health systems is supported by research and advocated in policy. This systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42016050457) aimed to explore the perceived barriers and enablers to implementing shared decision-making in risk assessment and risk management from mental health professionals' perspectives. Methods PRISMA guidelines were followed in the conduct and reporting of this review. Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED and Internurse were systematically searched from inception to December 2019. Data were mapped directly into the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), a psychological framework that includes 14 domains relevant to behaviour change. Thematic synthesis was used to identify potential barriers and enablers within each domain. Data were then matched to the three components of the COM-B model: Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation. Results Twenty studies met the eligibility criteria. The findings of this review indicate that shared decision-making is not a concept commonly used in mental health services when exploring processes of risk assessment and risk management. The key barriers identified were 'power and best interest' (social influences) and 'my professional role and responsibility' (social/professional role and identity). Key enablers were 'therapeutic relationship' (social influences) and 'value collaboration' (reinforcement). The salient barriers, enablers and linked TDF domains matched COM-B components 'opportunity' and 'motivation'. Conclusion The review highlights the need for further empirical research to better understand current practice and mental health professionals' experiences and attitudes towards shared decision-making in risk assessment and risk management.

AB  - Aim Cognitive deficits are recognized features of depressive disorders in youth aged 12-25. These deficits are distressing, predict functional impairment and limit the effectiveness of psychological therapies. Cognitive enhancement using behavioural, biochemical or physical treatments may be useful in young people with depression, but studies have not been synthesized. The aim was to systematically review the evidence for treatments for objective and subjective cognitive functioning, and their acceptability and functional outcomes in people aged 12-25 with depression. Method Three electronic databases were searched for articles using pre-specified criteria. Pharmacological treatments were not eligible. Risk of bias was rated using the Cochrane Collaboration's revised risk-of-bias tool. Dual full-text article screening, data extraction and quality ratings were completed. Results Twelve studies were included for review (median participant age: 20.39 years), five of which were randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Sample sizes were generally small (median = 23; range: 9-46). Eight studies investigated behavioural treatments including aerobic exercise, cognitive training and education or strategy-based methods. Four studies examined repetitive transcranial magnetic brain stimulation (rTMS). Most behavioural treatments revealed preliminary evidence of improved cognitive function in youth depression. Consent rates were greatest for exercise- and education-based approaches, which may indicate higher acceptability levels. Findings from rTMS trials were mixed, with only half showing cognitive improvement. Functional outcomes were reported by three behavioural treatment trials and one rTMS trial, with functional improvement reported only in the former. Some concern of risk of bias was found in each RCT. Conclusion Behavioural treatments, such as exercise, cognitive training and education/strategy-focused techniques, show encouraging results and appear to be acceptable methods of addressing cognitive deficits in youth depression based on participation rates. Brain stimulation and biochemical treatments (e.g., nutrient-based treatment) require further investigation.

AB  - Background: The aim of the current study was to examine the internal structure and assess the psychometric properties of the Work-Related Rumination Scale (WRRS) - Spanish version in a Puerto Rican sample of workers. This instrument is a 15-item questionnaire, which has three factors, affective rumination, problem-solving pondering, and detachment. This measure is used in the occupational health psychology context; however, there is little evidence of its psychometric properties.Materials and Methods: A total sample of 4,100 from five different study samples was used in this cross-sectional study design in which the WRRS was used. We conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) to examine the internal structure of the Work-Related Rumination Scale. Measurement invariance across sex and age was examined.Results: The three-factor model was supported; however, four items were eliminated due to their cross-loadings and factorial complexity. This 11-item Spanish version of the WRRS was invariant across sex and age. Reliability of the three-factors of WRRS were within the range of 0.74 to 0.87 using Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega. Correlations between the three factors were as expected as well as with other established measures.Conclusion: The results suggest that the WRRS-Spanish version appears to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure work-related rumination using its three factors. Comparison across sex and age appear to be useful in occupational health psychology research setting since results suggest that the WRRS is invariant regarding those variables.

AB  - Purpose Work can offer a myriad of social and health benefits. Long-term sick leave can be detrimental to employers, individuals, families, and societies. The burden of long-term sick leave has motivated the development of return to work (RTW) interventions. This study sought to determine what constitutes an effective psychosocial RTW intervention, which included exploring whether the level of intervention intensity and intervention characteristics matter to RTW outcomes. Methods A systematic review and narrative synthesis were undertaken. Studies were identified through six databases (Ovid Medline, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), PsycInfo (Ovid), ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar) between 2011 and 3 September 2019. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or reviews published in English were eligible for inclusion if they targeted adults who were on sick leave/unemployed trying to return to full-capacity employment, had at least one structured psychosocial RTW intervention, and assessed RTW. Study quality was assessed using checklists from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Results Database searching yielded 12,311 records. Eighteen RCTs (comprising 42 intervention/comparison groups), seven reviews (comprising 153 studies), and five grey literature documents were included. Included studies were of moderate-to-high quality. Research was primarily conducted in Europe and focused on psychological or musculoskeletal problems. RTW outcomes included RTW status, time until RTW, insurance claims, and sick days. Participating in a RTW program was superior to care-as-usual. RTW outcomes were similar between diverse interventions of low, moderate, and high intensity. Common foundational characteristics seen across effective RTW interventions included a focus on RTW, psychoeducation, and behavioural activation. Conclusions Evidence suggests that a low intensity approach to RTW interventions may be an appropriate first option before investment in high intensity, and arguably more expensive interventions, as the latter appear to provide limited additional benefit. More high-quality RCTs, from diverse countries, are needed to provide stronger evidence.

AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by declining motor and cognitive functions. Even though these diseases present with distinct sets of symptoms, FTD and ALS are two extremes of the same disease spectrum, as they show considerable overlap in genetic, clinical and neuropathological features. Among these overlapping features, mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with both FTD and ALS. Recent studies have shown that cells derived from patients' induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)s display mitochondrial abnormalities, and similar abnormalities have been observed in a number of animal disease models. Drosophila models have been widely used to study FTD and ALS because of their rapid generation time and extensive set of genetic tools. A wide array of fly models have been developed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of toxicity for mutations associated with FTD/ALS. Fly models have been often instrumental in understanding the role of disease associated mutations in mitochondria biology. In this review, we discuss how mutations associated with FTD/ALS disrupt mitochondrial function, and we review how the use of Drosophila models has been pivotal to our current knowledge in this field.

AB  - Adolescence is a period of rapid change, with cognitive, mental wellbeing, environmental biological factors interacting to shape lifelong outcomes. Large, longitudinal phenotypically rich data sets available for reuse (secondary data) have revolutionized the way we study adolescence, allowing the field to examine these unfolding processes across hundreds or even thousands of individuals. Here, we outline the opportunities and challenges associated with such secondary data sets, provide an overview of particularly valuable resources available to the field, and recommend best practices to improve the rigor and transparency of analyses conducted on large, secondary data sets.

A qualitative synthesis was performed with the findings, and meta-analytic measures were used for reliability and convergent validity.Results: Fifty studies were assessed, which comprised 23 assessment instruments. Of these, 13 proposed new instruments, 18 investigated the psychometric properties of instruments previously developed, and 19 reported cross-cultural adaptations. The Empathy Quotient, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy were the instruments most frequently addressed. They presented good meta-analytic indicators of internal consistency [reliability, generalization meta-analyses (Cronbach's alpha): 0.61 to 0.86], but weak evidence of validity [weak structural validity; low to moderate convergent validity (0.27 to 0.45)]. Few studies analyzed standardization, prediction, or responsiveness for the new and old instruments. The new instruments proposed few innovations, and their psychometric properties did not improve. In general, cross-cultural studies reported adequate adaptation processes and equivalent psychometric indicators, though there was a lack of studies addressing cultural invariance.Conclusion: Despite the diversity of instruments assessing empathy and the many associated psychometric studies, there remain limitations, especially in terms of validity. Thus far, we cannot yet nominate a gold-standard instrument.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions, including national lockdown, social distancing, compulsory quarantine, and organizational measures of remote working, are imposed in many countries and organizations to combat the coronavirus. The various restrictions have caused different impacts on the employees' mental health worldwide. The purpose of this mini-review is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on employees' mental health across the world. We searched articles in Web of Science and Google Scholar, selecting literature focusing on employees' mental health conditions under COVID-19 restrictions. The findings reveal that the psychological impacts of teleworking are associated with employees' various perceptions of its pros and cons. The national lockdown, quarantine, and resuming to work can cause mild to severe mental health issues, whereas the capability to practice social distancing is positively related to employees' mental health. Generally, employees in developed countries have experienced the same negative and positive impacts on mental health, whereas, in developing countries, employees have reported a more negative effect of the restrictions. One explanation is that the unevenly distributed mental health resources and assistances in developed and developing countries.

AB  - Sexual violence and intimate partner violence are exacerbated by armed conflict and other humanitarian crises. This narrative systematic review of evidence for interventions to reduce risk and incidence of sexual and intimate partner violence in conflict, post-conflict and other humanitarian crises, updates and expands our review published in 2013. A search of ten bibliographic databases for publications from January 2011 to May 2020 used database specific key words for sexual/intimate partner violence and conflict/humanitarian crisis. The 18 papers, describing 16 studies were undertaken in conflict/post-conflict settings in 12 countries. Six intervention types were reported: i) personnel; ii) community mobilisation; iii) social norms; iv) economic empowerment; v) empowerment; and vi) survivor responses, with the most common being economic empowerment (n = 7) and gendered social norms interventions (n = 6). Combined interventions were reported in nine papers. Four studies identified non-significant reductions in incidence of sexual/ intimate partner violence, showing an evident positive trend; all four evaluated gendered social norms or economic empowerment singly or in combination. Evidence for improved mental health outcomes was found for some economic empowerment, social norms and survivor interventions. Some evidence of reduced risk of sexual violence and intimate partner violence was identified for all intervention types. Qualitative studies suggest that experiences of social connection are important for women who participate in programming to address sexual and intimate partner violence. Interventions with multiple strategies appear to hold merit. Achieving and demonstrating reduced sexual and intimate partner violence remains challenging in this context. Future research should continue to explore how social norms interventions can be most effectively delivered, including the impact of including mixed and same sex groups. Work is needed with local partners to ensure programs are contextually adapted.

AB  - Background: Veterans who did not seek and complete treatment as intended have been shown to have an elevated risk of experiencing and being exposed to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Internet-based interventions (IBIs) provide more confidentiality and fewer treatment barriers, and they are regarded as potential treatments to reduce PTSD in veterans. However, the effects of IBI for veterans with PTSD are inconclusive.Objectives: IBI is defined as any internet-based series of psychosocial interventions, of which the internet works as a way of delivery. Psychosocial content and reduction of PTSD symptoms in veterans have been recognized as two core elements of this intervention. This study aimed to (1) examine the effects of IBI on veterans' PTSD outcomes and (2) distinguish between the elements of IBI that play an important role for veterans with PTSD.Methods: Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Wanfang Data, CNKI, and CQVIP databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) in IBI programs for veterans with PTSD, covering all studies in English and Chinese published from January 1990 to November 2020. Also, related studies tracking citations were identified. Studies met the following inclusion criteria of (1) being RCTs; (2) containing IBI in the full text; (3) having IBI conducted on veterans as participants; and (4) being on PTSD. All processes followed PRISMA. The risk of bias of the studies was assessed by the Cochrane Systematic Review Handbook. The confidence of outcomes of this review was valued according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). The meta-analysis was done by RevMan 5.13. Two teams of reviewers independently searched the literature, made the assessment, and extracted the data.Results: A total of 1,493 citations were identified after initial searching, of which the full texts of 66 studies were screened. Eventually, six RCT studies met the inclusion criteria. Beneficial effects of IBI were found on the overall PTSD outcome (-0.29; 95% CI-0.48 to -0.11, p<0.01). Particularly, IBI based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with peer support was found to be effective for PTSD outcomes (-0.36; 95% CI-0.61 to -0.11, p<0.01). The subgroup analysis demonstrated that scores of PTSD outcome measured by a PCL (PTSD Checklist) decreased to an average score of 0.38 (95% CI -0.60 to -0.15, p=0.001). The intervention had a positive effect on the PTSD outcome on veterans with comorbid psychological disorders (-0.30; 95% CI -0.61 to -0.11, p<0.01). Overall, the six studies included were evaluated with a low risk of bias, and the outcomes of the meta-analysis were proven with high confidence.Conclusion: On the whole, IBIs have a positive effect on the overall PTSD outcome of veterans. The results encouraged us to focus on IBI with CBT with peer support for veterans, on specific instruments for veterans with PTSD, and on veterans with comorbid psychological disorders. This study, however, has limits. Only six studies with a Western population were included, which might result in cultural bias on IBI effects. In future, more high-qualified research and diverse cultural background of RCTs is needed to prove the effectiveness of IBI on veterans with PTSD.

AB  - Emotion recognition has become increasingly prominent in the medical field and human-computer interaction. When people's emotions change under external stimuli, various physiological signals of the human body will fluctuate. Electroencephalography (EEG) is closely related to brain activity, making it possible to judge the subject's emotional changes through EEG signals. Meanwhile, machine learning algorithms, which are good at digging out data features from a statistical perspective and making judgments, have developed by leaps and bounds. Therefore, using machine learning to extract feature vectors related to emotional states from EEG signals and constructing a classifier to separate emotions into discrete states to realize emotion recognition has a broad development prospect. This paper introduces the acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification of EEG signals in sequence following the progress of EEG-based machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition. And it may help beginners who will use EEG-based machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition to understand the development status of this field. The journals we selected are all retrieved from the Web of Science retrieval platform. And the publication dates of most of the selected articles are concentrated in 2016-2021.

AB  - Aim To identify and summarize the evidence for the effect of health-oriented leadership interventions on health and wellbeing outcomes at the employee level following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (Moher et al. 2009).
   Subject and Methods A systematic search of relevant studies was conducted in multiple databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) and controlled before-after studies (CBAs) were included based on the following criteria: interventions that addressed supervisors, to raise awareness for the importance of health issues, teach mindfulness practices for conscious awareness, reduce stress and promote resources at the level of individual behavior, and evaluated the effect on at least one outcome of psychomental stress, absenteeism and well-being on the employee level.
   Results Of 6126 publications retrieved, ten studies were identified for analysis. Significant effects of leadership training were reported on exhaustion tendency, self-reported sickness absence, work-related sickness absence and job satisfaction in studies comparing health-oriented training programs to no intervention. Studies comparing health-oriented leadership training to other training did not report significant effects. Risk of bias was judged to be high in seven studies and unclear in three studies.
   Conclusion Evidence for the effectiveness of health-oriented leadership interventions on employees' stress, absenteeism or well-being is judged to be low, clearly indicating the need for more and higher-quality research.

AB  - Optimizing the possibility to lead good lives is at the core of treatment and care for people with dementia. This may be monitored by assessing well-being and quality of life. However, cognitive impairment following dementia may complicate recall-based assessment with questionnaires, and proxy-ratings from family-caregivers do not correspond well to self-reports. Thus, using observational measures represents a potentially advanced option. Systematic reviews evaluating measurement properties, interpretability and feasibility of observational instruments assessing well-being in people living with dementia are lacking. Thus, this review performed systematic searches to find peer reviewed validated instruments of relevance in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL and ProQuest. Twenty-two instruments assessing well-being were included for evaluation of measurement properties based on the systematic approach of the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN). The evaluation included risk of bias on study level, and assessment of measurement properties on instrument level including content validity, construct validity, structural validity, internal consistency, measurement invariance, cross-cultural validity, measurement error and inter-rater/intra-rater/test-retest reliability and responsiveness. Additionally, the feasibility and interpretability of the measures were evaluated. No single instrument could be recommended based on existing publications. Thus, we provide general recommendations about further assessment and development of these instruments. Finally, we describe the most promising instruments and offer guidance with respect to their implementation and use in clinical and research contexts.

AB  - Studies suggested that the smaller particle size has more adverse effects on cardiorespiratory diseases. However, the associations between PM1 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <= 1 mu m) and cardiorespiratory diseases remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to summarize and quantify the associations between short-term exposure to PM1 and morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Four databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI) were searched for articles published up to March 16, 2021. Meta-analysis was used to pool the effect estimates of PM(1)on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [i.e., relative risk (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI)]. Subgroup analysis were conducted based on the statistical analysis methods, disease subtypes, and pollutant models. Finally, 12 studies were included, and we observed significant associations between PM1 and both cardiovascular mortality (ER: 0.84%, 95%CI: 0.06%, 1.64%) and respiratory mortality (ER: 0.57%, 95%CI: 0.30%, 0.78%). However, a significant PM1-morbidity association was only found for total respiratory morbidity (ER: 2.60%, 95%CI: 1.00%, 4.30%). The results of the subgroup analysis showed that only the association between asthma and PM1 was significant (ER: 2.60%, 95%CI: 1.00%, 4.30%), and the risk based on the two-pollutant model was higher than that of the single-pollutant model. Considering the limited number of available studies, our findings should be proven in future studies involved in varying settings, disease subtypes, and advanced study designs.

AB  - Background Brain tumours are the most common and fatal of all solid tumours for children and adolescents. The effects of the tumour and treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery) results in significant disruptions to childhood development and large amounts of missed schooling. Among other challenges for families, this produces obstacles for children and adolescents to achieve and maintain academic performance and experience positive schooling encounters. Aims We thus aimed to systematically identify and synthesize qualitative evidence on how families experience paediatric brain tumour from diagnosis and beyond with regards to their schooling and education to identify gaps in service delivery, research, and policy. Methods A protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020177165). Searches were conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science, and yielded 22 eligible papers (representing 17 studies). Data were extracted into NVivo12 and analysed by qualitative description. Results We formed the following domain summaries: academic (perceived failure to keep up with peers and finding success where one could, the importance of encouragement for diagnosed children), social (the importance of friendships and the harm of bullying), and support (the defining factor in overall return-to-school experience, often not enough received from educational professionals and clinicians). Our review highlights the need for more comprehensive, individualized, and integrated support for diagnosed children to return to educational institutions, and for the need to address their social experiences, particularly with regards to bullying, potentially through a school-wide social and emotional learning approach. Conclusion Funding support, evidence-based guidelines, staff skill development, and clear communication structures across families, health care facilities, schools, and educational departments are essential to achieving this.

This scoping review provides an overview of about 300 research works focusing on the use of the NAO robot from 2010 to 2020. This study presents one of the most extensive and inclusive pieces of evidence on the deployment of the humanoid NAO robot and its global reach. Unlike most reviews, we provide both qualitative and quantitative results regarding how NAO is being used and what has been achieved so far. We analyzed a wide range of theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions that provide multidimensional insights, such as general trends in terms of application, the robot capabilities, its input and output modalities of communication, and the human-robot interaction experiments that featured NAO (e.g. number and roles of participants, design, and the length of interaction). Lastly, we derive from the review some research gaps in current state-of-the-art and provide suggestions for the design of the next generation of social robots.

New-onset depression after hip fracture has also received attention because of its increasing incidence and negative impact on recovery.AIMTo provide a synthesis of the literature addressing two very important questions arising from postoperative hip fracture depression (PHFD) research: the risk factors and associated clinical outcomes of PHFD, and the optimal options for intervention in PHFD.METHODSWe searched the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases for English papers published from 2000 to 2021.RESULTSOur results showed that PHFD may result in poor clinical outcomes, such as poor physical function and more medical support. In addition, the risk factors for PHFD were summarized, which made it possible to assess patients preoperatively. Moreover, our work preliminarily suggested that comprehensive care may be the optimal treatment option for PHFDs, while interdisciplinary intervention can also be clinically useful.CONCLUSIONWe suggest that clinicians should assess risk factors for PHFDs preoperatively, and future research should further validate current treatment methods in more countries and regions and explore more advanced solutions.

AB  - Introduction: depression is considered one of the most common obstacles to daily life activities and quality of life in the elderly. Evidence is accumulating regarding the effectiveness of reminiscence and life review interventions in reducing depression and raising well-being in the elderly. The aim of this review was to determine the effects of life review interventions on depression outcomes among the elderly. Methods: a search of the literature was performed through 11 electronic databases to identify all randomized controlled trials studies that examine life review effects on depression among the elderly. For each study, the effect size (Cohen's d) between groups (life review vs. control) differences in depression scores for post-intervention and follow-up intervention were computed. Results: in total, 15 studies were met the inclusion criteria and was evaluated by meta-analysis. Results showed that the life review group has a large effect on reducing depression level than the control group on post-intervention and followup. After conducted sensitivity analysis, a moderate effect (effect size=-0.54; 95% CI=-0.71 to -0.36; p<0.05) and small effect (effect size=-0.20; 95% CI=0.41 to -0.01; p<0.05) were found on post-intervention and follow-up, respectively. Conclusion: through this systematic review and meta-analysis, the overall results showed a moderate effect to reducing depression levels among the elderly in the life review group after carrying out post-intervention measurements, while in the follow-up the effect was small. This review indicates that life review intervention is one of the options likely to be of benefit for elderly in primary care settings, but further research con be focused on intervention and follow-up durations to obtain long-term effects.

AB  - Alterations in the peripheral (e.g., serum, plasma, platelet) concentrations of arginine and its related catabolic products (i.e., ornithine, citrulline) in the urea and nitric oxide cycles have been reported to be associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). The meta-analysis herein aimed to explore the association between the concentration of peripheral arginine, its catabolic products and MDD, as well as to discuss the possible role of arginine catabolism in the onset and progression of MDD. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched from inception to June 2020. The protocol for the meta-analysis herein has been registered at the Open Science Framework []. In total, 745 (47.5%) subjects with MDD and 823 (52.5%) healthy controls (HCs) from 13 articles with 16 studies were included. Fifteen of the included studies assessed concentrations of peripheral arginine, eight assessed concentrations of ornithine, and six assessed concentrations of citrulline. Results indicated that: (1) the concentrations of arginine, ornithine, and citrulline were not significantly different between individuals with MDD and HCs when serum, plasma and platelet are analyzed together, (2) in the subgroups of serum samples, the concentrations of arginine were lower in individuals with MDD than HCs, and (3) concurrent administration of psychotropic medications may be a confounding variable affecting the concentrations of arginine, ornithine, and citrulline. Our findings herein do not support the hypothesis that arginine catabolism between individuals with MDD and HCs are significantly different. The medication status and sample types should be considered as a key future research avenue for assessing arginine catabolism in MDD.

AB  - Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD) are amongst top of the prevalent neurodegenerative disease. One-third of PD patients are diagnosed with dementia, a pre-symptom of AD, but the underlying mechanism is elusive. Amyloid beta (A beta) and alpha-synuclein are two of the most investigated proteins, whose pathological aggregation and spreading are crucial to the pathogenesis of AD and PD, respectively. Transcriptomic studies of the mammalian central nervous system shed light on gene expression profiles at molecular levels, regarding the complexity of neuronal morphologies and electrophysiological inputs/outputs. In the last decade, the booming of the single-cell RNA sequencing technique helped to understand gene expression patterns, alternative splicing, novel transcripts, and signal pathways in the nervous system at single-cell levels, providing insight for molecular taxonomy and mechanistic targets of the degenerative nervous system. Here, we re-visited the cell-cell transmission mechanisms of A beta and alpha-synuclein in mediating disease propagation, and summarized recent single-cell transcriptome sequencing from different perspectives and discussed its understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Purpose The importance of both frequent and high-quality social connections is widely recognised. Previous reviews of interventions for promoting social connections found mixed results due to the inclusion of uncontrolled studies and merging of objective and subjective dimensions of social connections. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote 'objective social contact' and the 'quality of social connections'; and compare the effectiveness of interventions from different theoretical orientations on these social dimensions through a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and PubMed was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials of interventions for social isolation, loneliness, social participation and/or social connectedness in adults. Data were analysed using Stata V.16.0. Results Fifty-eight studies met inclusion criteria (mean age = 62 years). Overall, interventions led to significant improvements in objective social contact (Hedges' g = 0.43) and perceived quality of social connections (Hedges' g = - 0.33). Increasing access to other people was the most effective strategy for promoting objective social contact (Hedges' g = 0.67). Providing adults with skills to manage maladaptive attributional biases, fear-related avoidance of social situations, and barriers to social contact, was the most effective strategy for addressing deficits in perceived quality of social connections (Hedges' g = - 0.53). Conclusion In summary, different interventions had differential effects on the frequency and quality of social relationships and associated emotional distress. Psychological interventions hold the most promise for increasing meaningful social connections and reducing distress.

AB  - Nanotechnology has received much attention because of its distinctive properties and many applications in various fields. Nanotechnology is a new approach to increase agricultural production with premium quality, environmental safety, biological support, and financial stability. Ecofriendly technology is becoming progressively important in modern agricultural applications as alternatives to traditional fertilizers and pesticides. Nanotechnology offers an alternative solution to overcome the disadvantages of conventional agriculture. Therefore, recent developments in using nanoparticles (NPs) in agriculture should be studied. This review presented a novel overview about the biosynthesis of NPs, using NPs as nano fertilizers and nano-pesticides, the applications of NPs in agriculture, and their role in enhancing the function of biofactors. We also, show recent studies on NPs-plant interactions, the fate and safety of nanomaterials in plants, and NPs' function in alleviating the adverse effects of abiotic stress and heavy metal toxicity. Nano-fertilizers are essential to reduce the use of inorganic fertilizers and reduce their antagonistic effects on the environment. Nano-fertilizers are more reactive, can penetrate the epidermis allowing for gradual release, and targeted distribution, and thus reducing nutrients surplus, enhancing nutrient use efficiency. We also, concluded that NPs are crucial in alleviating abiotic stress and heavy metal toxicity. However, some studies reported the toxic effects of NPs on higher plants by induction of oxidative stress signals via depositing NPs on the cell surface and in organelles. The knowledge in our review article is critical in defining limitations and future perspectives of using nano-fertilizers as an alternative to conventional fertilizers. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Nowadays, the exploitation of the oil fields and gas wells has transformed the Algerian Sahara into a special economic zone. Geologic evolution of the Algerian Desert is not limited to economic benefits, this vast desert contains various unexploited ecosystems. In other words, desert ecosystems are controlled by several extreme environmental conditions, in which abiotic stresses play an important role in the modification of the metabolism and the selction of the flora. The impacts of environmental stresses observed in several desert areas of the world have encouraged microbiological researches in some regions of the Algerian Sahara. Indeed, recent researches revealed that significant microbial diversity is dominated by actinobacterial strains. Morever, it has been proved that new extremophiles taxa that have recently been discovered are capable of producing and synthesizing new secondary metabolites. Furthermore, some researchers have isolated strains with bioremediation benefits, while other isolates are considered important for agricultural development. Unfortunately, most of the studies established in this vast desert are still limited. For that reason, more in-depth researches are recommended in order to uncover rare actinobacteria producing new secondary metabolites. The first part of the current review aims to summarize the latest studies on the diversity of rare actinobacteria in the Algerian Sahara and its secondary metabolites. The second part focuses on the impact of abiotic stresses and adaptation mechanism of actinobacteria in desert environments. Eventually, the review describes some unexploited sites in the Algerian Sahara which may be considered as a new platform for future researches.

AB  - An expanding literature has investigated emotion recognition across visual and auditory modalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Findings, however, have been highly variable. The present work systematically reviewed and quantitatively synthesised a large body of literature, in order to determine whether autistic individuals differ from their neurotypical counterparts in emotion recognition across human face, nonhuman face, speech, and music domains. To identify eligible studies, the literature was searched using Embase, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Synthesising data from 72 papers, results showed a general difficulty with emotion recognition accuracy in ASD, while autistic individuals also showed longer response times than their neurotypical counterparts for a subset of emotions (i.e., anger, fear, sadness, and the six-emotion composite). These impairments were shown to be robust as they were not driven by differences in stimulus presentation time restriction and IQ matching, though the severity of impairments was less pronounced for a subset of emotions when full-scale IQ matching (i.e., anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and disgust) and verbal IQ matching (i.e., anger, fear, sadness, and disgust) had been undertaken. The heterogeneity among studies arose from a combination of sample characteristics (i.e., age but not IQ) and experimental design (i.e., stimulus domain and task demand) parameters. Specifically, we show that (i) impairments were more pronounced in autistic adults; (ii) full-scale, verbal, and nonverbal IQ did not moderate impairments; (iii) emotion-general impairments were found for human faces but emotion-specific impairments were observed for speech prosody (i.e., anger, happiness, and disgust) and music (i.e., fear and sadness), while no impairment was observed for nonhuman faces; (iv) impairments were found across emotions for verbal but not nonverbal tasks. Importantly, further research on the recognition of prosodic, musical, and nonhuman facial emotions is warranted, as the current findings are disproportionately influenced by studies on human faces. Future studies should also continue to explore the different emotion processing strategies employed by autistic individuals, which could be fundamental to promoting fulfilling emotional experiences in real life.

AB  - Background: Emerging studies have investigated potential cardiovascular and respiratory health impacts from the use of personal-level intervention equipment against air pollution exposure. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the efficacy of personal-level air pollution intervention on mitigating adverse health effects from air pollution exposure by using portable air cleaner or wearing respirator. Methods: In this systematic review, we searched PubMed and Web of Science for published literatures up to May 31, 2020, focusing on personal-level air pollution intervention studies. Among these studies, we investigated the impacts on cardio-respiratory responses to the use of these interventions. The intervention of review interest was the use of personal-level equipment against air pollution, including using portable air cleaner indoors or wearing respirator outdoors. The outcome of review interest was impacts on cardio-respiratory health endpoints following interventions, including level changes in blood pressure, heart rate variability (HRV), lung function, and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Weighted mean differences or percent changes were pooled in meta-analyses for these health endpoints. The heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the Cochran's Q statistic test, and the individual study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool version 2 (RoB 2). We further applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method to evaluate the certainty of evidence. Results: From systematic literature search and screening, we identified 29 related eligible intervention studies, including 21 studies on indoor portable air cleaner use and 8 studies on respirator use. For portable air cleaner intervention, we observed suggestive evidence of beneficial changes on cardio-respiratory health endpoints. Collectively in these studies, we found significantly beneficial changes of 2.01% decreases (95% CI: 0.50%, 3.52%) in systolic blood pressure, as well as non-significantly beneficial changes of 3.04% increases (95% CI:-2.65%, 8.74%) in reactive hyperemia index and 0.24% increases (95% CI:-0.82%, 1.31%) in forced expiratory volume in 1 s. We also observed non-significant reductions in levels of inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, fractional exhaled nitric oxide and malondialdehyde. For respirator intervention, we observed some beneficial changes on cardiovascular health endpoints, such as significant increases in HRV parameters [SDNN (2.20%, 95% CI: 0.54%, 3.86%)], as well as nonsignificant decreases in blood pressure [SBP (0.63 mmHg, 95% CI:-0.39, 1.66)]; however, no sufficient data were available for meta-analyses on lung function and biomarkers. RoB 2 assessments suggested that most intervention studies were with a moderate to high overall risk of bias. The certainty of evidence for intervention outcome pairs was graded very low for either portable air cleaner or respirator intervention. The common reasons to downgrade study evidence included loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, lack of washout period, small sample size, and high heterogeneity across studies. Conclusions: The uses of indoor portable air cleaner and respirator could contribute to some beneficial changes on cardiovascular health, but with much limited evidence on respiratory health. Low certainty of the overall study evidence shed light on future research for larger sample size trials with more rigorous study design.

AB  - Background Aripiprazole augmentation is proven effective for antidepressant-refractory depression, but its licensed dose range is wide and optimal dosage remains unclear. Aims To find the optimal dosage of aripiprazole augmentation. Method Multiple electronic databases were searched (from inception to 16 February 2021) to identify all assessor-masked randomised controlled trials evaluating aripiprazole augmentation therapy in adults (>= 18 years old, both genders) with major depressive disorder showing inadequate response to at least one antidepressant treatment. A random-effects, one-stage dose-effect meta-analysis with restricted cubic splines was conducted. Outcomes were efficacy (treatment response: >= 50% reduction in depression severity), tolerability (drop-out due to adverse effects) and acceptability (drop-out for any reason) after 8 weeks of treatment (range 4-12 weeks). Results Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. All were individually randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel studies including 2625 participants in total. The maximum target dose-efficacy curve showed an increase up to doses between 2 mg (odds ratio OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.15-1.85) and 5 mg (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.33-2.81), and then a non-increasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 20 mg (OR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.52-2.37). Tolerability showed a similar trend with greater uncertainty. Acceptability showed no significant difference through the examined dose range. Certainty of evidence was low to moderate. Conclusions Low-dose aripiprazole as augmentation treatment might achieve the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability and acceptability in the acute treatment of antidepressant-refractory depression. However, the small number of included studies and the overall moderate to high risk of bias seriously compromise the reliability of the results. Further research is required to investigate the benefits of low versus high dose.

AB  - Almost a century after Jacob Levy Moreno pioneered the group practice of psychodrama, research in this area has flourished to include different sub-fields of study and psychodramatic intervention for various psychological conditions. By making use of scientometric analysis, particularly document citation analysis and keyword analysis, this study maps out dominant research domains in psychodrama since its inception. From these findings, projections of future research trends and an evaluation of psychodrama research are discussed. Generally, there has been an increased adoption of technology to facilitate psychodrama practice, along with an increasing integration of psychodramatic principles with other psychotherapies. To improve research in this area, this paper recommends greater transparency in the reporting of materials, processes and data used in publications. Finally, we encourage embracing new technological methods such as neuroimaging to provide greater insight into mechanisms of change in psychodrama. The field of psychodrama remains full of potential and innovations to be developed.

AB  - Decision-making is a crucial skill that has a central role in everyday life and is necessary for adaptation to the environment and autonomy. It is the ability to choose between two or more options, and it has been studied through several theoretical approaches and by different disciplines. In this overview article, we contend a theoretical review regarding most theorizing and research on decision-making. Specifically, we focused on different levels of analyses, including different theoretical approaches and neuropsychological aspects. Moreover, common methodological measures adopted to study decision-making were reported. This theoretical review emphasizes multiple levels of analysis and aims to summarize evidence regarding this fundamental human process. Although several aspects of the field are reported, more features of decision-making process remain uncertain and need to be clarified. Further experimental studies are necessary for understanding this process better and for integrating and refining the existing theories.

AB  - Objective Over the past two decades, there has been a steady increase in research focused on the association between weight-based stigma and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents. The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between weight stigma and mental health in youth. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, PsychInfo, and Embase databases was conducted in January 2020. Inclusion criteria included the following: (a) examined an association between weight stigma and a mental health outcome, (b) mean sample age <18 (+1 standard deviation) years, (c) written in English, and (d) peer reviewed. Forty eligible articles were identified. The moderating effects of age, sex (percent female), weight status (percent with overweight/obesity), and study quality were examined. Results Overall, meta-analytic findings using a random-effects model indicated a statistically significant moderate association between weight stigma and poorer mental health outcomes (r = .32, 95% confidence interval [0.292, 0.347], p < .001). Age and study quality each moderated the association between weight stigma and mental health. Generally, the study quality was fair to poor, with many studies lacking validated measurement of weight stigma. Conclusions Although there was a significant association between weight stigma and mental health in youth, study quality hinders the current body of literature. Furthermore, findings highlight the lack of consideration of internalized weight stigma in child populations, the importance of using validated measures of weight stigma, and the need for increased awareness of how these associations affect populations of diverse backgrounds.

AB  - This systematic review assessed the psychometric properties and the cross-cultural adaptation of the University of California and Los Angeles Loneliness scale (UCLA-LS) in adults. A systematic search of four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and PsycINFO) was conducted from inception until March 2021. We followed the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guidelines for data extraction and evidence synthesis. Eighty-one studies assessed the validity and reliability of the UCLA-LS, translated into many languages, and applied across several countries/societies. Three versions of the 20-item and nine short versions of the UCLA-LS with 3 to 20 questions were identified. High-quality evidence supported the internal structure of the UCLAs: 4, 6, 7 and 10, while low-to moderate-quality evidence supported the construct validity of the UCLAs: 3, 4, 6, 8, 16 and 20. Moderate-quality evidence supported the test-retest reliability of version 3 UCLA-20 with excellent interclass coefficients values of 0.76-0.93. The UCLAs: 4, 6, 7 and 10 had the most robust internal structure and may therefore be the most useful for informing clinicians and social psychologists engaged in assisting those with loneliness.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in parent-mediated interventions (PMIs) for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effect of PMIs compared to no PMI for children with ASD aged 2-17 years. The primary outcome was adaptive functioning rated by a parent or clinician. The secondary outcomes were long-term adaptive functioning rated by the parents, adverse events, core symptoms of ASD, disruptive behavior, parental well-being, quality of life of the child rated by the parents and anxiety. The MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched in March 2020. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to rate the individual studies, and the certainty in the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. We identified 30 relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including 1,934 participants. A clinically relevant effect of PMIs on parent-rated adaptive functioning was found with a low certainty of evidence [Standard mean difference (SMD): 0.28 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.57)] on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), whereas no clinically relevant effect was seen for clinician-rated functional level, with a very low certainty of evidence [SMD on Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-severity scale: SMD -0.45 [95% CI: -0.87, -0.03)]. PMIs may slightly improve clinician-rated autism core symptoms [SMD: -0.35 (95% CI: -0.71, 0.02)]. Additionally, no effect of PMIs on parent-rated core symptoms of ASD, parental well-being or adverse effects was identified, all with a low certainty of evidence. There was a moderate certainty of evidence for a clinically relevant effect on disruptive behavior [SMD: 0.55 (95% Cl: 0.36, 0.74)]. The certainty in the evidence was downgraded due to serious risk of bias, lack of blinding, and serious risk of imprecision due to few participants included in meta-analyses. The present findings suggest that clinicians may consider introducing PMIs to children with ASD, but more high-quality RCTs are needed because the effects are not well-established, and the results are likely to change with future studies. The protocol for the systematic review is registered at the Danish Health Authority website (www.sst.dk).

AB  - The proportion of people with dementia has been increasing yearly, and the decision-making capacity of these people has become a major concern in fields such as the financial industry and in medical settings. In this narrative review, we discuss decision-making in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and we propose the support for decision-making in people with AD, especially financial and medical decision-making. We summarize several hypotheses and theories on the decision-making capacity of people with AD. These include the frontal lobe hypothesis, physiological theory, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the Person-Task-Fit (PTF) framework. Both internal and external factors can affect decision-making by people with AD. Internal factors are affected by changes in the brain and neurotransmitters, as well as alterations in cognitive ability and emotion. External factors include task characters, task contents, and situation influence. Since feedback has a significant effect on decision-making capacity, a series of suggestions may be helpful to improve this capacity, such as explicit advice, simple options, pleasant rewards, the Talking Mats approach, memory and organizational aid, support by caregivers, cognitive training and feedback. Thus, in providing decision-making support for people with AD, it is important to identify the internal and external factors that impair this process and to deal with these factors.

AB  - Epigenetic marks, particularly DNA methylation (DNAm), are emerging as an important biological marker of susceptibility to cardiac autonomic dysfunction. This review summarizes recent discoveries about the association between DNAm and cardiac autonomic activity. A systematic literature search was performed through the Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Pubmed, PsycINFO, and Pilots databases. Twenty-two studies met inclusion criteria, of which 18 were human studies including a total of 2,686 participants. DNAm differences in multiple genes, such as NR3C1, TLR2, GPR133, EPO, PHGDH, OXTR, and SLC7A11, linked environmental stressors to physiological responses. For instance, exposure to psychosocial stressors increased NR3C1 methylation, which was associated with both decreased blood pressure and increased parasympathetic activity. Additionally, GPR133 played a potential role in cardiac autonomic dysfunction in an occupational setting, affecting the heart rate's deceleration capacity in welders. This review's findings suggest that DNAm is involved in cardiac autonomic regulation under different stress-mediated responses.

AB  - Background: This PRISMA scoping review explored worldwide research on family-based treatments for suicide prevention. Research on this topic highlights the importance of facilitating familial understanding of a suicidal individual. Aim: The review sought evidence of outcomes of trials in which both the patient and family member in the intervention arm attended the same sessions at which suicide was openly discussed. Method: To explore this topic, the authors searched for randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials using Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Social Services Abstracts (EBSCO), and Web of Science on July 8, 2020. Results: Ten different studies were included that spanned five treatment modalities. Specifically, of the interventions in these 10 articles, 40% employed some sort of cognitive-behavioral therapy, 20% examined attachment-based family therapy, 20% used family-based crisis intervention, and the remaining 20% were distinct interventions from one another. Additionally, several of these articles demonstrated rigorous study methodology and many of the articles reported significant improvements in suicidal ideation or behaviors. Conclusion: Several important research gaps were identified. While this approach has been largely understudied, and to date has been primarily researched in adolescent populations, family interventions have great potential for treatment and prevention of suicidality.

AB  - MDMA's first identified potential as a therapeutic catalyst was for couple therapy. Early work in the 1970s and 1980s explored its potential amongst seasoned psychotherapists and their clients. With the completion of the first pilot trial of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with couples for PTSD, and as the possibility of conducting MDMA-assisted psychotherapy trials expands due to new regulatory frameworks, we have an opportunity to explore and investigate how and why MDMA-assisted couples therapy works. This theoretical paper will explore the neurobiological and neurochemical effects of MDMA in a relational context, the emotional, behavioral, cognitive and somatic effects within a dyadic frame, and how empathy, communication, perception of social connection/support, non-avoidance, openness, attachment/safety, bonding/social intimacy and relationship satisfaction, are all impacted by MDMA, and can be harnessed to facilitate systems-level and interpersonal healing and growth. A model to support MDMA-assisted couple therapy is introduced, and future directions, including implications for intervention development and delivery, will be elucidated.

AB  - Cellular senescence is a highly complex and programmed cellular state with diverse and, at times, conflicting physiological and pathological roles across the lifespan of an organism. Initially considered a cell culture artifact, senescence evolved from an age-related circumstance to an intricate cellular defense mechanism in response to stress, implicated in a wide spectrum of biological processes like tissue remodelling, injury and cancer. The development of new tools to study senescence in vivo paved the way to uncover its functional roles in various frameworks, which are sometimes hard to reconcile. Here, we review the functional impact of senescent cells on different organismal contexts. We provide updated insights on the role of senescent cells in tissue repair and regeneration, in which they essentially modulate the levels of fibrosis and inflammation, discussing how "time" seems to be the key maestro of their effects. Finally, we overview the current clinical research landscape to target senescent cells and contemplate its repercussions on this fast-evolving field.

AB  - Importance Single-blind placebo run-in (PRI) periods are common in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of treatment for depression. They aim to increase sensitivity to detect drug effects; however, the association of PRI periods with study outcomes remains unclear. This is concerning given the costs of PRI periods to patients and investigators. Objective To examine the association of the use of PRI periods with the placebo response, drug response, and drug-placebo difference among RCTs of antidepressants. Data Sources MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO, as well as repositories of unpublished studies, were systematically searched up to July 2021. Study Selection Included studies were double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs of antidepressant medication among adults with depressive disorders. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were extracted into a coding sheet, including the characteristics of studies, the characteristics of PRI periods, and the outcomes of studies. Main Outcomes and Measures Study outcomes were the primary depression symptom measure reported by the RCT. These outcomes were used to calculate effect sizes (Hedges g) of the within-group drug response and placebo response as well as the drug-placebo difference. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate effect sizes, and subgroup analyses were used to compare outcomes depending on use of PRI periods. Results A total of 347 trials (representing 89 183 participants) were included; 174 studies (50%) reported using a single-blind PRI period. Response outcome data were available for 189 studies. Studies using PRI periods reported a smaller placebo response (g = 1.05 [95% CI, 0.98-1.11]; I-2 = 82%) than studies that did not use a PRI period (g = 1.15 [95% CI, 1.09-1.21]; I-2 = 81%; P = .02). Subgroup analysis showed a larger drug response size among studies that did not use a PRI period (g = 1.55 [95% CI, 1.49-1.61]; I-2 = 85%) than those that did use a PRI period (g = 1.42 [95% CI, 1.36-1.48]; I-2 = 81%; P = .001). The drug-placebo difference did not differ by use of PRI periods (g = 0.33 [95% CI, 0.29-0.38]; I-2 = 47% for use of a PRI period vs g = 0.34 [95% CI, 0.30-0.38]; I-2 = 54% for no use of PRI periods; P = .92). The likelihood of response to drug vs placebo also did not differ between studies that used a PRI period (odds ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.76-2.03]) and those that did not use a PRI period (odds ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.65-1.89]; P = .18). Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that RCTs using PRI periods yield smaller within-group changes across both placebo and drug groups compared with RCTs without PRI periods. The reduction in effect size across groups was equivalent in magnitude. Consequently, PRI studies do not observe larger drug-placebo differences, suggesting that they do not increase trial sensitivity. As such, given the resources and probable deception required and risk to external validity, the practice of using PRI periods in RCTs of antidepressants should be ended.
   Question Is the use of a placebo run-in (PRI) period associated with different outcomes among randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of antidepressants? Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 347 RCTs of antidepressants comprising 89 183 participants, the use of PRI periods was associated with a lower placebo and drug response but was not associated with the drug-placebo difference. Meaning This study suggests that the use of PRI periods is common in RCTs of antidepressants, despite offering no apparent benefits to RCT outcomes; given the risks and costs of PRI periods, their practice should be ceased.
   This meta-analysis of 347 trials examines the association of the use of placebo run-in periods with the placebo response, drug response, and drug-placebo difference among randomized clinical trials of antidepressants.

AB  - In Parkinson's disease (PD) impairments in decision making can occur, in particular because of the tendency toward risky and rewarding options. The Iowa Gambling Task has been widely used to investigate decision processes involving these options. The task assesses the ability to manage risk and to learn from feedback. The present paper aims at critically examining those studies in which this task has been administered to PD patients, in order to understand possible anomalies in patients' decision processes and which variables are responsible for that. A meta-analysis has been conducted as well. Features of the task, sociodemographic and clinical aspects (including daily drugs intake), cognitive conditions and emotional disorders of the patients have been taken into account. Neural correlates of decision-making competences were considered. It emerged that PD patients show a trend of preference toward risky choices, probably due to an impairment in anticipating the unrewarding consequences or to an insensitiveness to punishment. The possible role played by dopamine medications in decision making under uncertain conditions, affecting basal ganglia and structures involved in the limbic loop, was discussed. Attention has been focused on some aspects that need to be investigated in further research, in order to delve into this issue and promote patients' quality of life.

AB  - Numerous studies reported that BPA could cause oxidative damage to different tissues in rats/mice. This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of BPA exposure on oxidative damage in rats/mice. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from their inception date until July 18, 2020. 20 eligible articles were included in this study. The results showed that BPA could significantly increase the level of MDA (SMD, 16.88; 95%CI, 12.06-21.71), but there was a significant reduction in the contents of antioxidants, such as GR (-10.46,-13.91 --7.02),CAT (-8.48,-11.66 --5.30),GPx (-9.37,-11.95 --6.80),GST (-7.59,-14.51 --0.67),GSH (-10.64,-13.96 --7.33),and SOD (-6.48,-8.37 --4.58)in rats/mice. Our study provided clear evidence that BPA exposure could significantly induce oxidative damage in rats/mice. And we also found that the degree of oxidative damage was related to BPA dose, target tissue, intervention means, and exposure duration of BPA.

AB  - Objective: To integrate existing literature on barriers and facilitators to implementing interventions for Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS) in primary and secondary care.
   Method: Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. A search of PsychINFO/Pubmed/Web of Science was performed to select studies focusing on MUS-interventions and implementation. All included papers were checked for quality and bias. A narrative synthesis approach was used to describe the included papers by implementation level, ranging from the specific intervention to the broader economic/political context.
   Results: 20 (quantitative/qualitative/mixed design) papers were included, but the quantitative studies especially, lacked methodological quality, with possible publication bias as a result. Results showed that the intervention needs to be acceptable and in line with daily practice routines. The professional's attitude and skills are important for implementation success, as well as for overcoming problems in the professional-patient interaction. If patients stick to finding a somatic cause, this hampers implementation. A lack of time is a frequently mentioned barrier at the organizational level. Barriers/facilitators at the social context level and at the economic/political level were barely reported on in the included papers.
   Conclusion: Results were integrated into an existing implementation model, as an example of how MUSinterventions can be successfully implemented in practice.

AB  - The Human Plasma Proteome has always been the most investigated compartment in proteomics-based biomarker discovery, and is considered the largest and deepest version of the human proteome, reflecting the state of the body in health and disease. Even if efforts have been always dedicated to the refinement of proteomic approaches to investigate more deeply the plasma proteome, it should not be forgotten that also highly abundant plasma proteins, like human serum albumin (HSA), often neglected in these studies, might provide fundamental physiological functions in plasma, and should be better considered. This review summarizes the important roles of HSA in the context of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and in particular in heart failure. Notwithstanding much attention has been historically directed toward the association of HSA levels and CVD risk, the advances in the field of mass spectrometry research allow also a better characterization of the effects of oxidative modifications that could alter not only the structure but also the function of HSA.

AB  - Background Access to healthcare and service utilization are both considered essential factors for improving the general health and wellbeing of older people, especially at the time of COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study is to explore factors affecting healthcare access and health service utilization for older people during the pandemic. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Embase were systematically searched for relevant articles. Access, utilization, health, elderly and COVID-19 were used as keywords in the search strategy. A total of 4308 articles were identified through the initial database search; 50 articles were included in the review as passing the eligibility criteria. The searches were conducted up to August 2021. Data extraction was performed, and evidence was descriptively illustrated. Thematic analysis was used to explore factors influencing the elderly's access and utilization of healthcare services, using Max QDA(10), a qualitative analysis software. Results Among articles included in the review (n = 50), a majority of the studies were from the United States (36%), followed by India (8%). According to the main healthcare services, a large number of articles (18%) were related to mental health services, followed by digital health services (16%). Factors were identified at an individual, provider and systems level. Seven main themes emerged from the thematic analysis, as determinants of elderly's access and utilization of healthcare services during COVID-19 pandemic. These included: access to non-COVID related services, access to COVID-related services, literacy and education, accommodation challenges, perceived attitudes of aging, and policies and structures, and social determinants. Conclusion Mental health and digital health services were identified as major issues influencing or contributing to or influencing older people's health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also argue on the importance of a rounded view, as attention to a range of factors is vital for policy decisions towards sustainable care and equitable interventions for improving the health of older people.

AB  - Background: The awareness rate of mental health knowledge among medical staff is an important evaluation index to assess the service capacity of a country or region, and this indicator in China has not been quantitatively evaluated.Study Design: This study systematically combined pertinent quantitative study data from previous related studies to conclude the awareness rate of mental health knowledge among Chinese medical staff.Methods: Related studies from five electronic databases were searched, and a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the combined result. The primary outcome of the present study was the awareness rate of medical staff or the sample size and the number of those who can answer the relevant questions correctly. We also performed a hierarchical analysis according to the sample group's region and specialty. The awareness rate of medical staff and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The heterogeneity was assessed with the I-2 test, and Egger's test was used to evaluate publication bias.Results: A total of 15 articles with 11,526 medical staff were included in the present study; the overall awareness rate of mental health knowledge among Chinese medical staff was as low as 81%. The awareness rate of mental health knowledge among medical workers in developed regions is higher than that in developing regions. The awareness rate of mental health among medical staff in the department of psychiatry, non-psychiatry, and community medical staff was 88, 68, and 82%, respectively.Conclusion: The overall awareness rate among medical staff in this country is unsatisfactory, and the awareness rate in developed regions is higher than medical staff in developing regions. Psychiatric hospital staff has a higher awareness rate than community medical staff, and non-psychiatric hospital staff has the lowest awareness rate.

Ten studies entered final analysis [HIV/AIDs (5), climate change (1), sexual health (3), and croup (1)]. ST techniques included digital ST (DST), written ST, verbal ST, and use of professional writers. Of the ten studies, seven used ST to change KAB/P; the remainder used ST to extract insights. Follow-up and evaluation were very limited.Conclusion: ST reveals insights and serves as an intervention in public health. Benefits of ST largely outweigh the limitations, but more follow-up/evaluation is needed. ST should play a more significant role in tackling public health issues.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019124704

AB  - Aim Family and friends are often the first and/or only support options used by young people (12-25 years) struggling with mental health issues. The overarching aim of this literature review is to map current practice in online interventions specifically targeting family and friends of young people with mental health issues, especially relevant in light of the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A rapid scoping literature review was conducted searching health and psychology databases for online interventions targeting family and friends supporting a young person (12-25 years) struggling with a mental health issue. The search strategy was comprehensive and expert librarian endorsed. The final synthesis comprised 13 articles. Results Identified articles were few, reporting a disparate range of research aims, intervention content and delivery modes. Studies addressing caregivers of adolescents with a mental health diagnosis were small-scale, although suggested virtual modalities are positively received and viable alternatives to other delivery methods with potential for equivalent outcomes. Five randomized control trials involving caregivers of 'at-risk' adolescents reported improved parental knowledge, but mixed effects on family functioning. Conclusions Preliminary evidence suggests flexible online options including professional and peer support, to respond to carers' busy lives are needed to maximize benefits. Content that is sufficiently individualized and targeted to address the diverse needs of parents, as well as other caregivers, is also required. Well-being and self-care, in addition to parenting skills should be given more consideration in online interventions. Examination of the value of support from peers is also warranted.

AB  - Refugees are at great risk of developing mental health problems. Yet, little is known about how to optimally help this vulnerable group as there is a lack of evaluated refugee mental health interventions. The current article presents the results of a literature review which investigates the importance of place attachment for the promotion of refugees' well-being in the resettlement process. This review concentrated on the most recent and current literature regarding the potential role, importance, and relevance of people-place bonds in the dynamic process of refugee resettlement. It examines literature from the field of positive and environmental psychology, highlighting key theoretical concepts and research findings as well as gaps in research. The review revealed that little is known about the dynamics of place bonding, while the debate rages on about the geometry of the psychological constructs of person-place relationships. Yet, knowing more about which needs should be satisfied for easing place bonding could be of crucial importance for facilitating refugee well-being. Ultimately, improving the knowledge and understanding of the phases of this dynamic process could be useful for a more successful implementation of refugee resettlement practices and activities.

AB  - We appraise newly accumulated evidence of the impact of particle pollution on the brain, the portals of entry, the neural damage mechanisms, and ultimately the neurological and psychiatric outcomes statistically associated with exposures. PM pollution comes from natural and anthropogenic sources such as fossil fuel combustion, engineered nanoparticles (NP & LE; 100 nm), wildfires, and wood burning. We are all constantly exposed during normal daily activities to some level of particle pollution of various sizes-PM2.5 (& LE;2.5 mu m), ultrafine PM (UFP & LE; 100 nm), or NPs. Inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption are key portals of entry. Selected literature provides context for the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) ambient air quality standards, the conclusions of an Independent Particulate Matter Review Panel, the importance of internal combustion emissions, and evidence suggesting UFPs/NPs cross biological barriers and reach the brain. NPs produce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, neurovascular unit, mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum and DNA damage, protein aggregation and misfolding, and other effects. Exposure to ambient PM2.5 concentrations at or below current US standards can increase the risk for TIAs, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cognitive deficits, dementia, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Residing in a highly polluted megacity is associated with Alzheimer neuropathology hallmarks in 99.5% of residents between 11 months and & LE;40 y. PD risk and aggravation are linked to air pollution and exposure to diesel exhaust increases ALS risk. Overall, the literature supports that particle pollution contributes to targeted neurological and psychiatric outcomes and highlights the complexity of the pathophysiologic mechanisms and the marked differences in pollution profiles inducing neural damage. Factors such as emission source intensity, genetics, nutrition, comorbidities, and others also play a role. PM2.5 is a threat for neurological and psychiatric diseases. Thus, future research should address specifically the potential role of UFPs/NPs in inducing neural damage.</p>

AB  - The social construct of masculinity evolves in response to changes in society and culture. Orthodox masculinity is mostly considered to be hegemonic and is evidenced by the dominance of men over women and other, less powerful men. Contemporary shifts in masculinity have seen an emergence of new masculinities that challenge traditional male stereotypes. This systematic review aims to review and synthesize the existing empirical research on contemporary masculinities and to conceptualize how they are understood and interpreted by men themselves. A literature search was undertaken on 10 databases using terms regularly used to identify various contemporary masculinities. Analysis of the 33 included studies identified four key elements that are evident in men's descriptions of contemporary masculinity. These four elements, (a) Inclusivity, (b) Emotional Intimacy, (c) Physicality, and (d) Resistance, are consistent with the literature describing contemporary masculinities, including Hybrid Masculinities and Inclusive Masculinity Theory. The synthesized findings indicate that young, middle-class, heterosexual men in Western cultures, while still demonstrating some traditional masculinity norms, appear to be adopting some aspects of contemporary masculinities. The theories of hybrid and inclusive masculinity suggest these types of masculinities have several benefits for both men and society in general.

KW  - STRESS
AB  - This study systematically reviewed the relationship between occupational risks and quality of life (QoL) and quality of work life (QWL) in hospitals. A systematic review was performed according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guide, and the protocol was submitted on the PROSPERO website (CRD 2019127865). The last search was performed in June 2021 by two independent reviewers in the main databases, a gray literature database, and a manual search (LILACS, MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, Ovid). As eligibility criteria, we included observational studies, with adult hospital workers, with no restrictions on date and language, any type of instrument to assess QoL and QWL, any definition of QoL and QWL, and studies that presented the relationship between exposure and outcome. Newcastle-Ottawa was used to assess the methodological quality and RTI-Item Bank to assess the risk of bias. Given the impossibility of performing a meta-analysis, a qualitative synthesis was used to present the results. Thus, 11 studies met the criteria and were included in the review, with 6923 individuals aged 18 to 64 years. The studies were mainly carried out with health professionals (81.81%), women (63.60%), and in Asian countries (63.63%). All studies used different instruments and ways to categorize the QoL and QWL, and occupational risks. Only one study assessed occupational noise and another the ergonomic risk. All of them presented a relationship between occupational risk and quality of work life. They pointed to the need for measures to improve the lives of these professionals in the work environment. Therefore, studies show a relationship between occupational risks (noise, ergonomics, and stress) and workers' perception of low or moderate quality of work life. However, more homogeneous studies are necessary for instruments, conceptualization, and categorization of quality of work life.

AB  - Simple Summary The continuous reduction of approved conventional microbicides, due to health concerns and the development of plant-pathogen resistance, has been urged for the use of safe alternatives in crop protection. Several beneficial bacterial species, termed biological control agents, are currently used in lieu of chemical pesticides. The approach to select such bacterial species and manufacture commercial products has been based on their biocontrol effect under optimal growth conditions, which is far from the real nutrient-limited field conditions of plant niches. It's important to determine the complex interactions that occur among BCAs, plant host and niche microbiome to fully understand and exploit the potential of biological control agents. Furthermore, it's crucial to acknowledge the environmental impact of their long-term use. Bacterial biological control agents (BCAs) have been increasingly used against plant diseases. The traditional approach to manufacturing such commercial products was based on the selection of bacterial species able to produce secondary metabolites that inhibit mainly fungal growth in optimal media. Such species are required to be massively produced and sustain long-term self-storage. The endpoint of this pipeline is large-scale field tests in which BCAs are handled as any other pesticide. Despite recent knowledge of the importance of BCA-host-microbiome interactions to trigger plant defenses and allow colonization, holistic approaches to maximize their potential are still in their infancy. There is a gap in scientific knowledge between experiments in controlled conditions for optimal BCA and pathogen growth and the nutrient-limited field conditions in which they face niche microbiota competition. Moreover, BCAs are considered to be safe by competent authorities and the public, with no side effects to the environment; the OneHealth impact of their application is understudied. This review summarizes the state of the art in BCA research and how current knowledge and new biotechnological tools have impacted BCA development and application. Future challenges, such as their combinational use and ability to ameliorate plant stress are also discussed. Addressing such challenges would establish their long-term use as centerfold agricultural pesticides and plant growth promoters.

AB  - The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically affected medical societies. We aim to provide an overview and summarize the information published so far concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology residency programs and the mental wellbeing of trainees, and to establish factors to help maintain successful residency training to ensure high-quality, specialist ophthalmic training. A literature search was conducted in October 2021 of the PubMed database for articles assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of ophthalmology trainees and on ophthalmology residency programs. Cross-sectional survey studies, editorials, articles in scientific journals, letters to editors, and commentaries were considered; finally, 19 studies were included after excluding abstract-only publications and conference posters. The studies' demographic details, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and limitations were extracted. Our summarized information showed the alarmingly significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology trainees' mental health and the associated considerable changes in ophthalmic training programs. Thus, in future, virtual training and surgical simulators should be permanently introduced, in addition to traditional teaching, to complete successful ophthalmology residency programs. Additionally, we emphasize the need for a widely facilitated and encouraged access to psychological support programs for healthcare workers, including ophthalmologists.

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing interest in investigating the effect of specific pharmacological treatments for ADHD not only on its core symptoms, but also on social skills in youths. This stands especially true for ADHD patients displaying impulsive aggressiveness and antisocial behaviors, being the comorbidity with Disruptive Behavior Disorders, one of the most frequently observed in clinical settings. This systematic review aimed to synthesize research findings on this topic following PRISMA guidelines and to identify gaps in current knowledge, future directions, and treatment implications. Search strategies included the following terms: ADHD; methylphenidate and other ADHD drugs; empathy, theory of mind and emotion recognition. Full-text articles were retrieved and data from individual studies were collected. Thirteen studies were finally included in our systematic review. Ten studies assessing changes in empathy and/or theory of mind in patients with ADHD treated after pharmacological interventions were identified. Similarly, seven partially overlapping studies assessing changes in emotion recognition were retrieved. Despite a great heterogeneity in the methodological characteristics of the included studies, most of them reported an improvement in emphatic and theory of mind abilities in youths with ADHD treated with psychostimulants and nonstimulant drugs, as well as positive but less consistent results about emotion recognition performances.

AB  - Background: Several empirical studies have shown an association between informal caregiving for adults and loneliness or social isolation. Nevertheless, a systematic review is lacking synthesizing studies which have investigated these aforementioned associations. Therefore, our purpose was to give an overview of the existing evidence from observational studies. Materials and Methods: Three electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL) were searched in June 2021. Observational studies investigating the association between informal caregiving for adults and loneliness or social isolation were included. In contrast, studies examining grandchild care or private care for chronically ill children were excluded. Data extractions covered study design, assessment of informal caregiving, loneliness and social isolation, the characteristics of the sample, the analytical approach and key findings. Study quality was assessed based on the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Each step (study selection, data extraction and evaluation of study quality) was conducted by two reviewers. Results: In sum, twelve studies were included in our review (seven cross-sectional studies and five longitudinal studies)-all included studies were either from North America or Europe. The studies mainly showed an association between providing informal care and higher loneliness levels. The overall study quality was fair to good. Conclusion: Our systematic review mainly identified associations between providing informal care and higher loneliness levels. This is of great importance in assisting informal caregivers in avoiding loneliness, since it is associated with subsequent morbidity and mortality. Moreover, high loneliness levels of informal caregivers may have adverse consequences for informal care recipients.

AB  - The examination of the risk factors that affect the recurrence of transient global amnesia (TGA) may shed light on the pathophysiological substrate of the disease. A systematic review was performed to identify the factors associated with the recurrence of TGA. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO were meticulously searched. Observational controlled studies involving patients with single (s-TGA) and recurrent TGA (r-TGA) according to Hodges and Warlow's criteria were retrieved. Differences in the demographic characteristics, personal and family medical history, previous exposure to precipitating events and laboratory findings were examined. Retrieved evidence was assessed in the context of the individual article validity, based on the numerical power and methodological quality of each study. Nine cohort studies with retrospective, prospective or mixed design were retrieved. In total, 1989 patients with TGA were included, 269 of whom suffered from r-TGA (13.5%). R-TGA presented an earlier age of onset. Evidence was suggestive of a relationship between recurrence and a family or personal history of migraine, as well as a personal history of depression. There was weaker evidence that associated recurrence with a positive family history of dementia, a personal history of head injury and hippocampal lesions in diffusion-weighted MRI. On the other hand, no connection was found between recurrence and electroencephalographic abnormalities, impaired jugular venous drainage, cardiovascular risk factors, atrial fibrillation, previous cerebrovascular events, exposure to precipitating events, a positive family history of TGA and hypothyroidism. Important pathophysiological insights that arised from these findings were discussed.

AB  - Background: This systematic review aims to summarise available patient-reported questionnaires to detect adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that can be utilised by healthcare professionals in clinical practice and to summarise the psychometric properties (validity, reliability, and responsiveness) of the questionnaires. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Pubmed, Embase, and Emcare databases to screen for articles published between January 2000 and July 2020. Data items regarding validity, reliability, and responsiveness were extracted independently by two authors. The methodological quality was assessed using the COSMIN (Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments) checklist. Results: A total of 1563 unique article titles were identified after removing duplicates. Following shortlisting of relevant articles, 19 patient-reported ADR questionnaires were identified. Questionnaires most commonly focused on mental health medications (42.1%, n = 8), followed by general questionnaires applicable to any medication (21.1%, n = 4). Many questionnaires did not report assessing the validity and reliability of the measurement tool. For example, only 11 questionnaires (58%) mentioned assessing content validity, in addition to criterion or construct testing. Conclusion: This systematic review summarised the available patient-reported questionnaires that can be used in research and clinical practice to identify ADRs. Results of this systematic review highlight the need for more robust validity and reliability testing when developing patient-reported ADR questionnaires.

AB  - Parkinson's disease can be approached from various points of view, one of which is music therapy-a complementary therapy to a pharmacological one. This work aims to compile the scientific evidence published in the last five years (2015-2020) on the effects of music therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. A systematic review has been performed using the Web of Science and Scopus databases with the descriptors "music therapy" and "Parkinson's disease". A total of 281 eligible articles were identified, which, after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were reduced to 58 papers. The results display a great diversity of evidence, confirming positive effects on various spheres. All mentioned patients with Parkinson's disease had experienced different music therapy programs. Some studies focused on the motor component, which can be addressed through listening, body rhythm, and rhythmic auditory stimulation. Other studies confirm effects on communication, swallowing, breathing, and the emotional aspect through programs that focus on singing, either individually or in groups, in order to improve the quality of life of people with PD. It was concluded that music therapy programs can achieve improvements in various areas of patients with Parkinson's.

AB  - Background: Adolescents often present at primary care clinics with nonspecific physical symptoms when, in fact, they have at least 1 mental health or risk behavior (psychosocial) issue with which they would like help but do not disclose to their care provider. Despite global recommendations, over 50% of youths are not screened for mental health and risk behavior issues in primary care.
   Objective: This review aimed to examine the implementation, acceptability, feasibility, benefits, and barriers of e-screening tools for mental health and risk behaviors among youth in primary care settings.
   Methods: Electronic databases-MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews-were searched for studies on the routine screening of youth in primary care settings. Screening tools needed to be electronic and screen for at least 1 mental health or risk behavior issue. A total of 11 studies that were reported in 12 articles, of which all were from high-income countries, were reviewed.
   Results: e-Screening was largely proven to be feasible and acceptable to youth and their primary care providers. Preconsultation e-screening facilitated discussions about sensitive issues and increased disclosure by youth. However, barriers such as the lack of time, training, and discomfort in raising sensitive issues with youth continued to be reported.
   Conclusions: To implement e-screening, clinicians need to change their behaviors, and e-screening processes must become normalized into their workflows. Co-designing and tailoring screening implementation frameworks to meet the needs of specific contexts may be required to ensure that clinicians overcome initial resistances and perceived barriers and adopt the required processes in their work.

AB  - Background: Crisis support services play an important role in providing free, immediate access to support people in the community experiencing a personal crisis. Recently, services have expanded from telephone to digital modalities including online chat and text message services. This raises the question of what outcomes are being achieved for increasingly diverse service users across different modalities. Aims: This systematic review aimed to determine the expectations and outcomes of users of crisis support services across three modalities (telephone, online chat, and text message/SMS). Method: Online databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Collection) and gray literature were searched for studies measuring expectations and outcomes of crisis support services. Results: A total of 31 studies were included in the review, the majority of which were telephone-based. Similar expectations were found for telephone and online chat modalities, as well as consistently positive outcomes, measured by changes in emotional state, satisfaction, and referral plans. Limitations/Conclusion: There is a paucity of consistent outcome measures across and within modalities and limited research about users of text message/SMS services.

TI  - Precarious employment and health in the context of COVID-19: a rapid scoping umbrella review
KW  - NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES
AB  - Background: There are widespread concerns that workers in precarious employment have suffered the most in the COVID-19 pandemic and merit special attention. The aim of this rapid scoping umbrella review was to examine what evidence exists about how COVID-19 has affected the health of this highly vulnerable group, and what gaps remain to be investigated. Methods: Five databases were searched for systematic or scoping reviews from January 2020 to May 2021. The quality of the included reviews was determined using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews. Results: We identified 6 reviews that reported 30 unique relevant primary studies. The included studies indicate that essential (non-health) workers are at greater risk of COVID-19 infection and case fatality than others in their surrounding community. The occupational risk of exposure to COVID-19 also seems to be greater among more precarious categories of workers, including younger workers and workers in low-income and low-skilled occupations. Further, hazardous working conditions faced by many essential workers appear to have amplified the pandemic, as several occupational sites became `super-spreaders', due to an inability to socially distance at work and high contact rates among workers. Finally, employment and financial insecurity generated by the pandemic appears to be associated with negative mental health outcomes. The quality of the included reviews however, and their primary studies, were generally weak and many gaps remain in the evidence base. Conclusions: Our study highlights that COVID-19 is creating new health risks for precarious workers as well as exacerbating the pre-existing health risks of precarious employment.

AB  - Overdose prevention for people who use illicit drugs is essential during the current overdose crisis. Peer support is a process whereby individuals with lived or living experience of a particular phenomenon provide support to others by explicitly drawing on these experiences. This review provides a systematic search and evidence synthesis of peer support within overdose prevention interventions for people who use illicit drugs. A systematic search of six databases (CINAHL, SocINDEX, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge) was conducted in November 2020 for papers published in English between 2000 and 2020. Following screening and full-text review, 46 papers met criteria and were included in this review. A thematic analysis approach was used to synthesize themes. Important findings include: the value of peers in creating trusted services; the diversity of peers' roles; the implications of barriers on peer-involved overdose prevention interventions; and the stress and trauma experienced by peers. Peers play a pivotal role in overdose prevention interventions for people who use illicit drugs and are essential to the acceptability and feasibility of such services. However, peers face considerable challenges within their roles, including trauma and burnout. Future interventions must consider how to support and strengthen peer roles in overdose settings.

AB  - Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is more common in females, especially during puberty and menopause. These inflammatory lesions include painful deep-seated nodules and abscesses, draining sinus tracts, and fibrotic scars. This article is a narrative review to explain whole disease aspects, including complication, causes, epidemiology, history, classification, prognosis, comorbidities, the effect of sex hormone, and potent treatments. Most patients with HS, who are not aware of their primary disease, visit primary care physicians to superinfection lesions instead of specialists. If these physicians suspect HS, their illness will not get misdiagnosed. This brief and comprehensive information in this article may help doctors to decide better about the same situation.

AB  - Introduction: Depression is highly prevalent and causes considerable suffering and disease burden despite the existence of wide-ranging treatment options. Momentary assessment is a promising tool in the management of psychiatric disorders, and particularly depression. It allows for a real-time evaluation of symptoms and an earlier detection of relapse or treatment efficacy. Treating the motivational and hedonic aspects of depression is a key target reported in the literature, but it is time-consuming in terms of human resources. Digital Applications offer a major opportunity to indirectly regulate impaired motivational circuits through dopaminergic pathways. Objective: The main objective of this review was twofold: (1) propose a conceptual and critical review of the literature regarding the theoretical and technical principles of digital applications focused on motivation in depression, activating dopamine, and (2) suggest recommendations on the relevance of using these tools and their potential place in the treatment of depression. Material and Methods: A search for words related to "dopamine ", "depression ", "smartphone apps ", "digital phenotype " has been conducted on PubMed. Results: Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) differ from traditional treatments by providing relevant, useful intervention strategies in the context of people's daily lives. EMIs triggered by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) are called "Smart-EMI ". Smart-EMIs can mimic the "dopamine reward system " if the intervention is tailored for motivation or hedonic enhancement, and it has been shown that a simple reward (such as a digital badge) can increase motivation. Discussion: The various studies presented support the potential interest of digital health in effectively motivating depressed patients to adopt therapeutic activation behaviors. Finding effective ways to integrate EMIs with human-provided therapeutic support may ultimately yield the most efficient and effective intervention method. This approach could be a helpful tool to increase adherence and motivation. Conclusion: Smartphone apps can motivate depressed patients by enhancing dopamine, offering the opportunity to enhance motivation and behavioral changes, although longer term studies are still needed.

AB  - Sensitive caregiver-child interactions appear fundamental throughout childhood, supporting infants' wellbeing and development not only in a familial context but in professional caregiving as well. The main aim of this review was to examine the existing literature about Early Childhood Education Context (ECEC) intervention studies dedicated to caregiver-child interaction, fostering children's socioemotional developmental pathways. Studies published between January 2007 and July 2021 were identified in four electronic databases following PRIMSA guidelines. The initial search yielded a total of 342 records. Among them, 48 studies were fully reviewed. Finally, 18 of them met all inclusion criteria and formed the basis for this review. Main factors characterizing implemented programs were recorded (e.g., intervention and sample characteristics, dimensions of the teacher-child interaction targeted by the intervention, outcome variables, main results) in order to frame key elements of ECE intervention programs. Our review points to a range of fundamental issues that should consider to enhance ECEC interventions' efficacy, supporting children's socioemotional development and caregiver-child interaction. Reflections and considerations for future research are provided.

AB  - To counteract the COVIC-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced social distancing measures. While these restrictions helped contain the virus, it had adverse effects on individuals' mental and physical health-especially children. The aim of the present study is to review the evidence on the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on children's physical activity and their determinants. A scoping review was conducted in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, SportDiscus, and BISp-Surf. Inclusion criteria were empirical and peer-reviewed studies, youth samples, investigation of COVID-19 restrictions, and investigating changes and/or determinants of physical activity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Risk of bias was assessed using the checklist by Downs and Black. The search resulted in 1672 studies, of which 84 studies were included in the analysis. The results highlighted a decrease in physical activity during the pandemic, ranging between -10.8 min/day and -91 min/day. If an increase was detected, it related to unstructured and outdoor activities. The main determinants of children's physical activity during the pandemic were age, gender, socioeconomic background, and the outdoor environment. The results imply that governments need to consider the negative effects that restrictive measures have on children's physical activity and act to ensure high levels of physical activity.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to record the brain's evoked and induced electrical activity from the scalp. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, are increasingly being applied to EEG data for pattern analysis, group membership classification, and brain-computer interface purposes. This study aimed to systematically review recent advances in ML and DL supervised models for decoding and classifying EEG signals. Moreover, this article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques used for EEG signal preprocessing and feature extraction. To this end, several academic databases were searched to explore relevant studies from the year 2000 to the present. Our results showed that the application of ML and DL in both mental workload and motor imagery tasks has received substantial attention in recent years. A total of 75% of DL studies applied convolutional neural networks with various learning algorithms, and 36% of ML studies achieved competitive accuracy by using a support vector machine algorithm. Wavelet transform was found to be the most common feature extraction method used for all types of tasks. We further examined the specific feature extraction methods and end classifier recommendations discovered in this systematic review.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, ERIC, and ERC for studies published from 2010 to July 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions aimed at increasing participation in open/competitive or non-competitive employment were eligible for inclusion. We included studies with adults with psychosocial disability autism and/or intellectual disability. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias II Tool. Data were qualitatively synthesized. Our review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020219192). Results: We included 26 RCTs: 23 targeted people with psychosocial disabilities (n = 2465), 3 included people with autism (n = 214), and none included people with intellectual disability. Risk of bias was high in 8 studies, moderate for 18, and low for none. There was evidence for a beneficial effect of Individual Placement and Support compared to control conditions in 10/11 studies. Among young adults with autism, there was some evidence for the benefit of Project SEARCH and ASD supports on open employment. Discussion: Gaps in the availability of high-quality evidence remain, undermining comparability and investment decisions in vocational interventions. Future studies should focus on improving quality and consistent measurement, especially for interventions targeting people with autism and/or intellectual disability.

After reviewing the emerging line of research on the positive feedback loop between prosocial behavior and well-being, I integrate all up-to-date empirical findings to present a reciprocal model where prosocial behavior begets well-being and well-being begets prosocial behavior. This article provides fresh insights, including the moderating roles of prosocial behavior and well-being and fading (and anti-fading) of the positive feedback loop. I also offer various promising lines of inquiry for future work and highlight powerful and ecologically valid research designs, such as experience-sampling studies and multiple-time point field experiments to capture the dynamic interplay between prosocial behavior and well-being.

AB  - The topic of mental health and mental disorders is very sensitive and delicate in families and the society. Stigma is one of the main reasons for little help-seeking for mental disorders. Transgenerational effects of mental disorders is the utmost sensitive theme that brings difficulties for service organization and research. By emphasizing the importance of the effects of parental mental illnesses on the health of offspring and their adjustment, together with sharing the international experience between professionals, both the administration of services and society could provide opportunities for further positive change in this little-studied but utmost actual field. There is still a lack of appropriate long term systematic programs and ways to overcome complex organizational challenges. Sharing international experience and research could help find ways that best fit the situations in each country. After a descriptive analysis of the current system of mental health services in Lithuania, opportunities were sought to meet the needs of children and adolescents whose parents have mental disorders by ensuring their healthy psychosocial development. Child and adolescent psychiatry services are a more favorable and less stigmatized area in Lithuania than adult psychiatry, so assistance and specialized programs for children of parents with mental health problems could be organized using the country's relatively well-developed network of child and adolescent psychiatric and pediatric services. For such a small country with limited resources, there could be a possibility to use and strengthen the existing network of services together with finding opportunities for mixed models of financing and cooperation with non-governmental initiatives and organizations. A unique network of primary mental health outpatient centers that provide services for adults and children/adolescents could serve as a reasonable basis for the systematic implementation of specialized programs and initiatives in this field. This network is still not adequately used in the organization of mental health prevention, early intervention, and complex treatment services for the children of parents with mental illness.

AB  - The five-year survival rate of childhood cancer has increased substantially over the past 50 yr; however, racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes of survival have not been systematically reviewed. This scoping review summarized health disparities between racial/ethnic minorities (specifically non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic) and non-Hispanic White childhood cancer survivors, and elucidated factors that may explain disparities in health outcomes. We used the terms "race", "ethnicity", "childhood cancer", "pediatric cancer", and "survivor" to search the title and abstract for the articles published in PubMed and Scopus from inception to February 2021. After removing duplicates, 189 articles were screened, and 23 empirical articles were included in this review study. All study populations were from North America, and the mean distribution of race/ethnicity was 6.9% for non-Hispanic Black and 4.5% for Hispanic. Health outcomes were categorized as healthcare utilization, patient-reported outcomes, chronic health conditions, and survival status. We found robust evidence of racial/ethnic disparities over four domains of health outcomes. However, health disparities were explained by clinical factors (e.g., diagnosis, treatment), demographic (e.g., age, sex), individual-level socioeconomic status (SES; e.g., educational attainment, personal income, health insurance coverage), family-level SES (e.g., family income, parent educational attainment), neighborhood-level SES (e.g., geographic location), and lifestyle health risk (e.g., cardiovascular risk) in some but not all articles. We discuss the importance of collecting comprehensive social determinants of racial/ethnic disparities inclusive of individual-level, family-level, and neighborhood-level SES. We suggest integrating these variables into healthcare systems (e.g., electronic health records), and utilizing information technology and analytics to better understand the disparity gap for racial/ethnic minorities of childhood cancer survivors. Furthermore, we suggest national and local efforts to close the gap through improving health insurance access, education and transportation aid, racial-culture-specific social learning interventions, and diversity informed training.

AB  - Steep geochemical gradients surround roots and rhizomes of seagrass and protect the plants against the harsh conditions in anoxic sediment, while enabling nutrient uptake. Imbalance of these gradients, due to e.g., low plant performance and/or changing sediment biogeochemical conditions, can lead to plant stress and large-scale seagrass meadow die-off. Therefore, measuring and mapping the dynamic gradients around seagrass roots and rhizomes is needed to better understand plant responses to human impact and environmental changes. Historically, electrochemical microsensors enabled the first measurements of important chemical species like O-2, pH or H2S with high sensitivity and spatial resolution giving important insights to the seagrass rhizosphere microenvironment; however, such measurements only provide information in one dimension at a time. In recent years, the use of reversible optical sensors (in the form of planar optodes or nanoparticles) and accumulative gel sampling methods like Diffusive Gradients in Thin films (DGT) have extended the array of analytes and allowed 2-D mapping of chemical gradients in the seagrass rhizosphere. Here, we review and discuss such microscale methods from a practical angle, discuss their application in seagrass research, and point toward novel experimental approaches to study the (bio)geochemistry around seagrass roots and rhizomes using a combination of available techniques, both in the lab and in situ.

AB  - Introduction: The neuropeptide-Y (NPY) is involved in the development of alcoholism through NPY receptors. A T>C mutation causes substitution of leucine to proline at codon 7 (L7P; rs16139) in the signal peptide of neuropeptide Y is known to cause a 42% increase in plasma NPY levels. Studies that analyzed the association between NPY rs16139 and alcoholism risk did not demonstrate conclusive evidence for this relationship. The present study aims to evaluate the association between NPY gene rs16139 variant and alcohol dependence.
   Method: An electronic search of databases including PubMed and Google Scholar was performed to retrieve studies investigating the association between NPY rs16139 and alcoholism. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated in allelic and dominant genetic models. Sensitivity analyses and publication bias were assessed in our meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was conducted using the MetaGenyo web tool.
   Result: Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (p < 0.001). Our results have shown that there is no significant association between NPY rs16139 variant and the risk of alcoholism in allelic (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.70-1.38, p = 0.921) and dominant models (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.69-1.40, p = 0.919). Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test have not shown publication bias (p = 0.332).
   Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that evaluates the relationship between the NPY rs16139 polymorphism and the risk of alcoholism. Our large-scale meta-analysis suggests that NPY rs16139 polymorphism is not associated with alcoholism. However, further studies are needed to increase our understanding of the relationship between NPY variants in alcoholism.

AB  - The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate whether executive functioning predicts subsequent acute stress responses. A systematic search (conducted between May 22nd and 30th, 2019; updated on April 4th, 2020) on Cochrane, OpenGray, Proquest Dissertations and Thesis Global, PsycInfo, Pubmed, Sco-pus, and Web of Science revealed 27 correlational and five interventional studies. For quality appraisal, we used the BIOCROSS Tool, the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies, and the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-bias Tool for Randomized Trials. Attentional control was most consistently associated with acute stress. A robust variation estimation meta-analysis, conducted when sufficient data was available, revealed a small, significant, and negative correlation between higher working memory and subsequent lower cortisol reactivity (r = .09, p = .025, 95 % CI [0.15, 0.02]). These results highlight the role of executive func-tioning for acute stress responses, the scarcity of relevant data, and the need for both interventional designs and the consideration of mediators and moderators to understand underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Background: Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) and augmented reality exposure therapy (ARET) are digitally assisted psychotherapies that potentially enhance posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment by increasing a patient's sense of presence during exposure therapy. This study aimed to systematically review current evidence regarding the efficacy of VRET and ARET as PTSD treatment. Methods: A systematic electronic database search, a systematic quality assessment and two meta-analyses were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results: Eleven studies on the efficacy of VRET for PTSD (n = 438) were found, but no studies on the efficacy of ARET. The majority of VRET studies were of a low quality and had heterogeneous results. Meta-analyses showed VRET outperformed waitlist control (standardized mean difference -0.64 (95% CI -1.05 to -0.22)) while no significant difference was found between VRET and active treatment conditions (standardized mean difference -0.25 (95% CI -0.77 to 0.27)). Conclusion: VRET was superior to waitlist control groups and as effective as other psychotherapies. However, the results showed considerable heterogeneity due to the low number of studies and variety of VRET methods. VRET may be an effective alternative to current treatments and shows promise for the treatment of PTSD patients that have not responded to previous treatment. Future research should focus on high quality RCTs, including information on side effects and adverse events, with sufficient numbers of participants. This study recognizes a research gap regarding the efficacy of ARET, while it may have potential for PTSD treatment.

AB  - The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a model organism that is used to investigate many cellular processes including chemotaxis, cell motility, cell differentiation, and human disease pathogenesis. While many single-cellular model systems lack homologs of human disease genes, Dictyostelium's genome encodes for many genes that are implicated in human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. Due to its short doubling time along with the powerful genetic tools that enable rapid genetic screening, and the ease of creating knockout cell lines, Dictyostelium is an attractive model organism for both interrogating the normal function of genes implicated in neurodegeneration and for determining pathogenic mechanisms that cause disease. Here we review the literature involving the use of Dictyostelium to interrogate genes implicated in neurodegeneration and highlight key questions that can be addressed using Dictyostelium as a model organism.</p>

AB  - Existing data suggest that deficits in social cognitive functioning are transdiagnostic phenomena that are observed across various forms of psychopathology. The goal of the present review was to provide an updated systematic review of the literature on social cognitive functioning across eating disorders (EDs), including anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED). Studies that assessed six areas of social cognition were included: theory of mind, social perception, social knowledge, attributional bias, emotion perception, and emotion processing. A systematic search identified 71 studies, the majority of which examined adult women with AN. Research typically focused on alexithymia, theory of mind, empathy, social processing, emotion recognition, or emotion processing. Results suggested some deficits in social cognition in EDs. AN had the most studies with some evidence for deficiencies in social cognition but a fair amount of variability. Research on BN and BED was limited and inconsistent, though there appear to be some deficits in social cognition. Together, the limited coverage across EDs and heterogeneous methodology preclude firm conclusions regarding general or ED-specific deficits, as well as understanding the role of social cognition in ED etiology and maintenance. Therefore, several key questions and future directions are outlined for research moving forward.

AB  - Background There is some evidence that paternal health behaviours during and around pregnancy could be associated with offspring health outcomes. However, the impact that paternal health behaviours during pregnancy can have on offspring mental health is understudied and remains unclear. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles in PubMed describing studies of potentially modifiable paternal health behaviours (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption and physical activity) in the prenatal period in relation to offspring mental health. GRADE was used to measure risk of bias. Results Eight studies were included and categorized by paternal health behaviour and offspring mental health outcome investigated. The narrative synthesis provided evidence of association between paternal health behaviours around pregnancy and offspring mental health problems, with the strongest evidence shown for tobacco use. Grouped by analysis type, two separate meta-analyses showed evidence of paternal smoking during pregnancy being associated with greater odds of ADHD in offspring (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-1.99; HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.39). Conclusions The small number of studies that have investigated paternal prenatal effects on offspring mental health, and the limited sample sizes of those studies, makes it challenging to draw firm conclusions. Although existing studies suggest that paternal tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption in the prenatal period are associated with poorer offspring mental health, (particularly hyperactivity/ADHD), further investigation of potential paternal effects is required, using methods that allow stronger inference to determine whether associations are causal.
   Plain language summary More research has focused on the impact mothers' behaviours (such as smoking or alcohol use) during and around pregnancy may have on their children's health, with less research investigating the role paternal health behaviours may play. This review captured what research was currently available that investigated the impact of paternal alcohol, tobacco, caffeine use, and physical activity during pregnancy on children's mental health. We showed that this area is currently under researched, finding only eight studies. However, of the research that was already published we found evidence of paternal health behaviours having an impact on children's mental health. The strongest evidence was shown for paternal smoking during pregnancy having a negative impact on children's hyperactivity/ADHD. No studies measured paternal caffeine use or physical activity around pregnancy. This review highlights the lack of research that has investigated the association between paternal modifiable health behaviours around pregnancy and offspring mental health. Despite including four different types of paternal health behaviours and a broad definition of offspring mental health across any age, only eight studies were shown. This review suggests further research within this area is needed which may influence health warnings to potential fathers to be both before conception and during pregnancy.

AB  - Detecting substance use as a predictor of bipolar disorder (BD) is important for clinicians to perform accurate and early diagnosis, as well as better manage the treatment of individuals with BD. The aim of this systematic review was to describe whether substance use is a predictor of BD. A literature search was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase. All eligible studies published up to February 9, 2021 were included. This systematic review included 22 studies. We found that 66.7% of the studies assessing overall substance use found that overall substance use was a risk factor for BD. Regarding the specific substances assessed, cannabis use was described as a risk factor for BD in 55.6% of the studies, nonmedical use of prescription medications was a risk factor for BD in 50% of the studies, nicotine was found as a risk factor for BD in 50% of the studies, and alcohol use was described as a risk factor for BD in 42.9% of the studies assessing it. Only one study assessed whether cocaine use was a risk factor for BD and found a significant association. Interestingly, some studies suggested that the greater frequency of cannabis use was associated with greater risk to develop BD or hypomanic/manic symptoms. In conclusion, there is evidence supporting that substance use is a risk factor for BD. Importantly, when assessing the risk factors for BD related to psychoactive substance use, special attention should be given for the frequency of cannabis use.

AB  - Although epidemiological studies have discerned the association between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure and hypertension and/or cardiovascular disease in the general population, the possible mechanisms for this association are not well understood. We sought to examine the association between urinary metabolites of PAHs and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and blood pressure in adults, by conducting a meta-analysis of observational studies. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of science, up to July 2021, for observational studies that investigated the association between urinary metabolites of PAHs and CVDs and blood pressure in adults. Nine prospective studies, including 27,280 participants, were included. Based on overall pooled results, there was a significant positive association between all types of urinary metabolites of PAH and blood pressure (OR: 1.32; 95%, CI: 1.19 to 1.48, p < 0.0001) (I-2 = 62.4%, p < 0.0001). There was no significant association between any urinary metabolite of PAH and CHD (OR: 0.93; 95%, CI: 0.83 to 1.03, p = 0.174) (I-2 = 0%, p = 0.653). Overall, there was a significant positive association between all urinary metabolites of PAH and CVD (OR: 1.23; 95%, CI: 1.16 to 1.30, p < 0.0001) (I-2 = 59.7%, p < 0.0001). The results of the present meta-analysis suggest that different metabolites PAHs are associated with an increased risk of CVD and HTN. Further studies, including randomized clinical trials, are needed to confirm the veracity of our findings.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of physical activity (PA) intervention on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related symptoms.Method: Studies that investigated PA intervention for ADHD-related symptoms were identified through searching PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases from inception through June 2021. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the effectiveness of PA intervention on improving ADHD-related symptoms. The meta-analyses were conducted using fixed-effect or random-effect models according to the heterogeneity of the studies.Results: Nine before-after studies (232 participants) and 14 two-group control studies (162 participants/141 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Combined results for before-after studies indicated significant improvements on all studied ADHD-related symptoms (inattention: SMD = 0.604, 95% CI: 0.374-0.834, p < 0.001; hyperactivity/impulsivity: SMD = 0.676, 95% CI: 0.401-0.950, p < 0.001; emotional problems: SMD = 0.416, 95% CI: 0.283-0.549, p < 0.001; behavioral problems: SMD = 0.347, 95% CI: 0.202-0.492, p < 0.001). Meta-analyses for two-group control studies further confirmed that PA intervention significantly improved the inattentive symptom (SMD = 0.715, 95% CI: 0.105, 1.325, p = 0.022). Subgroup analyses suggested significant beneficial effect on inattention symptoms in children. Moreover, closed motor skills were beneficial for hyperactive/impulsive problems (SMD = 0.671, p < 0.001), while open motor skills were beneficial for attention problems (SMD = 0.455, p = 0.049). When excluding studies with combined medication, the studies in unmedicated participants in before-after studies still showed significant results in all studied ADHD-related symptoms as in the overall analysis. Given the limited sample size, the best frequency and intensity of PA intervention need further investigation.Conclusion: Our results suggested that PA intervention could possibly improve ADHD-related symptoms, especially inattention symptoms. Closed-skill and open-skill activities could be beneficial for hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention symptoms, respectively. Further high-quality randomized clinical trials with large sample size are needed.

AB  - Purpose This integrative review aimed to identify and synthesis literature on analysis techniques and methodological approaches used to analyse consumer measures in mental health research. Design/methodology/approach The review included papers published up to January 2020 across seven databases: CINAHL, Web of Science, Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus and Google Scholar. Data search and extraction was conducted according to the recommended guidelines for conducting review by Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute. Mixed method synthesis was used to integrate both qualitative and quantitative data into a single synthesis. Findings The initial search yielded a total of 2,282 papers. A total of 32 papers were included in the synthesis. Most of the included papers (25/32; 78.12%) focused on psychometric properties, whereas 14% (5/32) targeted analysis techniques, and 6.3% (2/32) addressed methodological justification. The measurement models (e.g. psychometric properties) were analysed through validity and reliability testing as part of instrument development and adaptation. The structural models were analysed using techniques such as structural equation modelling, multivariable regression models, intraclass correlation coefficient and partial least squares-structural equation modelling. Practical implications Although consumer-reported instruments are analysed using techniques involving linear, hierarchical and longitudinal effects, no attempt has been given to procedures that applied complex data mining or machine learning. Consumer researchers, clinicians and quality management are encouraged to apply rigorous analysis techniques to critically evaluate consumer outcome measures. Originality/value This review provides evidence on the analysis techniques in mental health research to inform the training of mental health professionals, students and quality assessment practitioners.

AB  - Objectives: Transcranial electric stimulation (TES) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have experienced significant development in treating insomnia. This review aims to examine the effectiveness of randomized sham-controlled trials of TES and rTMS in improving insomnia and examine potential moderators associated with the effect of the treatment.
   Methods: Nine electronic databases were searched for studies comparing the effects of TES/rTMS with sham group on insomnia from the inception of these databases to June 25, 2021, namely, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis, and CNKI. Meta-analyses were conducted to examine the effect of TES and rTMS in treating insomnia. Univariate meta-regression was performed to explore potential treatment moderators that may influence the pooled results. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.
   Results: A total of 16 TES studies and 27 rTMS studies were included in this review. The pooled results indicated that there was no significant difference between the TES group and the sham group in improving objective measures of sleep. rTMS was superior to its sham group in improving sleep efficiency, total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake up after sleep onset, and number of awakenings (all p < 0.05). Both TES and rTMS were superior to their sham counterparts in improving sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at post-intervention. The weighted mean difference for TES and rTMS were -1.17 (95% CI: -1.98, -0.36) and -4.08 (95% CI: -4.86, -3.30), respectively. Gender, total treatment sessions, number of pulses per session, and length of treatment per session were associated with rTMS efficacy. No significant relationship was observed between TES efficacy and the stimulation parameters.
   Conclusions: It seems that TES and rTMS have a chance to play a decisive role in the therapy of insomnia. Possible dose-dependent and gender difference effects of rTMS are suggested.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe psychosocial impact on healthcare workers (HCWs). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the association between individual features and depressive symptoms reported by HCWs during the pandemic. We searched Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo up to 23 June 2020. We included cross-sectional studies testing the association between individual correlates and depressive symptoms in HCWs during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria, involving 14,173 HCWs (3,070 with depressive symptoms). Women (OR = 1.50; 95 %CI: 1.28-1.76; I-2 = 40.0 %), individuals with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 (OR = 2.10; 95 %CI: 1.64-2.69; I-2 = 0 %), and those with an infected family member or friend (OR = 1.67; 95 %CI: 1.37-2.04; I-2 = 0%) were more likely to report depressive features, which, instead, were less frequent among doctors (compared with nurses) (OR = 0.80; 95 %CI: 0.66-0.98; I-2 = 48.2 %) and HCWs who felt adequately protected (OR = 0.48; 95 %CI: 0.32-0.72; I-2 = 36.3 %). Our study provided timely evidence on the correlates of depressive symptoms among HCWs during the pandemic. Early screening is crucial to develop tailored health interventions, redesigning the response to COVID-19.

AB  - Available literature indicates that 30-66% of stroke survivors present persistent upper limb impairment. Considering the importance of upper limb function for activities of daily living, it is necessary to investigate neurorehabilitation therapies that could improve the upper limb function. Among stroke complementary ther-apies, mirror therapy has shown promising results. Thus, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analyses was to review and synthesize clinical evidence on the use of mirror therapy on motor recovery of the upper limb and activities of daily living, and its neural correlates in stroke patients. The literature search was carried out in PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Twenty-nine studies met all the inclusion criteria. Two meta-analyses were conducted to compare mirror therapy with sham therapy on two general measures, upper limb assessment and activities of daily living. Results suggest that mirror therapy was better than sham therapy, mainly in the subacute phase, but the meta-analyses were nonsignificant. In addition, mirror therapy and cortical reorganization showed potential neural correlates, such as the primary motor cortex, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex.

AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional organelle and serves as the primary site for intracellular calcium storage, lipid biogenesis, protein synthesis, and quality control. Mitochondria are responsible for producing the majority of cellular energy required for cell survival and function and are integral for many metabolic and signaling processes. Mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) are direct contact sites between the ER and mitochondria that serve as platforms to coordinate fundamental cellular processes such as mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics, calcium and lipid homeostasis, autophagy, apoptosis, inflammation, and intracellular stress responses. Given the importance of MAM-mediated mechanisms in regulating cellular fate and function, MAMs are now known as key molecular and cellular hubs underlying disease pathology. Notably, neurons are uniquely susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular stress, which highlights the importance of MAMs as potential targets to manipulate MAM-associated mechanisms. However, whether altered MAM communication and connectivity are causative agents or compensatory mechanisms in disease development and progression remains elusive. Regardless, exploration is warranted to determine if MAMs are therapeutically targetable to combat neurodegeneration. Here, we review key MAM interactions and proteins both in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We further discuss implications of MAMs in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), as MAMs have not yet been explored in this neuropathology. These perspectives specifically focus on mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium dysregulation and ER stress as notable MAM-mediated mechanisms underlying HAND pathology. Finally, we discuss potential targets to manipulate MAM function as a therapeutic intervention against neurodegeneration. Future investigations are warranted to better understand the interplay and therapeutic application of MAMs in glial dysfunction and neurotoxicity.

AB  - With the introduction of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), a new era for treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has arrived. However, despite the much larger recanalization rate as compared to thrombolysis alone, final outcome remains far from ideal. This raises the question if some of the previously tested neuroprotective drugs warrant re-evaluation, since these compounds were all tested in studies where large-vessel recanalization was rarely achieved in the acute phase. This review provides an overview of compounds tested in clinical AIS trials and gives insight into which of these drugs warrant a re-evaluation as an add-on therapy for AIS in the era of EVT. A literature search was performed using the search terms "ischemic stroke brain" in title/abstract, and additional filters. After exclusion of papers using pre-defined selection criteria, a total of 89 trials were eligible for review which reported on 56 unique compounds. Trial compounds were divided into 6 categories based on their perceived mode of action: systemic haemodynamics, excitotoxicity, neuro-inflammation, blood-brain barrier and vasogenic edema, oxidative and nitrosative stress, neurogenesis/-regeneration and -recovery. Main trial outcomes and safety issues are summarized and promising compounds for re-evaluation are highlighted. Looking at group effect, drugs intervening with oxidative and nitrosative stress and neurogenesis/-regeneration and -recovery appear to have a favourable safety profile and show the most promising results regarding efficacy. Finally, possible theories behind individual and group effects are discussed and recommendation for promising treatment strategies are described.

We begin with a description of current conceptualizations of the darkness of traits followed by a new perspective on the catalogue of dark personality traits and the theoretical boundaries of different shades of darkness within the broader personality structure. Finally, we address the redundancy problem observed within the field on dark personality traits. Our analyses are offered as a guide to future research towards a more parsimonious and useful set of criteria (a "compass" of sorts) for inclusion within the "dark" cluster.

AB  - Objectives: Although the importance of ketamine in clinical practice and in resource-poor settings and disaster zones, several attempts were made to reschedule it because of the issues around its misuse. Resisting future moves to reschedule ketamine is important for its continuous availability where needed. This scoping review addresses the question of whether ketamine should or should not be banned and the state of preparedness of low resource settings if ketamine petitions become successful in the future. Methods: A search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar to identify articles published in the English language from March 2015 to August 2020. The articles were searched with a wide range of priori search terms related to the research questions. The selection of articles was based on relevance and eligibility. Results: Seventy-five articles were selected and grouped into 4 ethical themes. The search revealed that several articles addressed the importance of ketamine, pharmacology, misuse, supply, and consequences of a ketamine ban; however, none addressed how resource-poor countries should prepare for a future without the overreliance of ketamine. Conclusion: Four ketamine petitions in about 10 years are an indication that another may resurface soon; therefore, it is important to continue to study the clinical importance of ketamine while discouraging its overreliance for clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose To perform a systematic review on the use of maintenance treatment to prevent relapse and recurrence in patients with psychotic unipolar or bipolar depression. Methods We conducted an electronic search in December 2019 (and an updated search in July 2021) of four databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane) to identify controlled studies comparing the relapse rates of patients receiving maintenance treatment for psychotic unipolar depression and psychotic bipolar depression. A meta-analysis was made that included three studies comparing antidepressant (AD) and antipsychotic (AP) combination therapy with AD monotherapy. We used the GRADE tool to assess the quality of evidence. Results We included five randomized controlled trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria, making three comparisons: (a) AD + AP versus AD monotherapy; (b) AD + AP versus AP monotherapy; (c) AD + electroconvulsive therapy versus AD monotherapy. The included studies only examined patients with psychotic unipolar depression. The largest included study reported a statistically significant advantage of AD + AP compared with AD monotherapy. We made a meta-analysis of the three studies comparing AD + AP combination therapy with AD monotherapy, which included 195 patients and 56 events. The meta-analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between these treatments. Conclusions Contrary to the finding of the largest study, we did not find a statistically significant difference between AD + AP combination therapy and AD monotherapy in the meta-analysis. There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of any treatment modality as maintenance treatment for psychotic depression. Further studies are required.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective treatment for depression but is limited in that the optimal therapeutic target remains unknown. Early TMS trials lacked a focal target and thus positioned the TMS coil over the prefrontal cortex using scalp measurements. Over time, it became clear that this method leads to variation in the stimulation site and that this could contribute to heterogeneity in antidepressant response. Newer methods allow for precise positioning of the TMS coil over a specific brain location, but leveraging these precise methods requires a more precise therapeutic target. We review how neuroimaging is being used to identify a more focal therapeutic target for depression. We highlight recent studies showing that more effective TMS targets in the frontal cortex are func-tionally connected to deep limbic regions such as the subgenual cingulate cortex. We review how connectivity might be used to identify an optimal TMS target for use in all patients and potentially even a personalized target for each individual patient. We address the clinical implications of this emerging field and highlight critical questions for future research.

AB  - Introduction This systematic review aims to determine the efficacy of interventions to support the self-management for parents of children with a chronic condition. An overview of prior research, regardless of the children's diagnosis, is lacking. Therefore, this systematic review provides an overview of the most recent available scientific literature that describes interventions to support self-management for parents of children with a chronic condition. Methods A systematic search of Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) was conducted in CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsychInfo. Studies that describe any type of self-management intervention or a combination of self-management interventions that support parents of children with a chronic condition between 0 and 18 years were included. The interventions and results were reported, hence categorized in the four areas of self-management: medical management, adjustment of lifestyle, shared decision-making and managing the consequences of a chronic condition. Results The study included 23 RCTs. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies a meta-analysis was impossible. Twenty studies showed statistically significant effects in favour of the intervention on at least one of the outcomes. Twenty-two studies showed risk of bias. The results indicate that disease management, (parent) group training, psycho-education and the Triple P intervention are effective interventions to support self-management. There were limited studies found in the areas lifestyle adjustment and shared decision making. Discussion Effective interventions to support self-management for parents of children with a chronic condition are described, but the moderate quality of the studies hampers firm conclusions.

AB  - Several care models have been developed to improve treatment for depression, all of which provide "enhanced" evidence-based care (EEC). The essential component of these approaches is Measurement-Based Care (MBC). Specifically, Collaborative Care (CC), and Algorithm-guided Treatment (AGT), and Integrated Care (IC) all use varying forms of rigorous MBC assessment, care management, and/or treatment algorithms as key instruments to optimize treatment delivery and outcomes for depression. This meta-analysis systematically examined the effectiveness of EEC versus usual care for depressive disorders based on cluster-randomized studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs). PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and PsycInfo, EMBASE, up to January 6th, 2020 were searched for this meta-analysis. The electronic search was supplemented by a manual search. Standardized mean difference (SMD), risk ratio (RR), and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and analyzed. A total of 29 studies with 15,255 participants were analyzed. EEC showed better effectiveness with the pooled RR for response of 1.30 (95%CI: 1.13-1.50, I-2 = 81.9%, P < 0.001, 18 studies), remission of 1.35 (95%CI: 1.11-1.64, I-2 = 85.5%, P < 0.001, 18 studies) and symptom reduction with a pooled SMD of -0.42 (95%CI: -0.61-(-0.23), I-2 = 94.3%, P < 0.001, 19 studies). All-cause discontinuations were similar between EEC and usual care with the pooled RR of 1.08 (95%CI: 0.94-1.23, I-2 = 68.0%, P = 0.303, 27 studies). This meta-analysis supported EEC as an evidence-based framework to improve the treatment outcome of depressive disorders. Review registration: PROSPERO: CRD42020163668

AB  - The importance of resilience for employees' well-being and performance at work has grown steadily in recent years. This development has become even more pronounced through the recent COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, including major changes in occupational settings. Although there is increasing interest in resilience in general and a growing number of publications focusing on the development of resilience in particular, many questions remain about resilience training, especially in organizational contexts. The purpose of this scoping review is to uncover what is known about resilience training in organizational contexts. A systematic search of four databases for articles published through 2021 was conducted. A total of 48 studies focusing on resilience training programs in organizational contexts were included in this review. The review provides relevant insights into resilience training programs by focusing on program characteristics, target group, study design, and outcomes. Based on the results, the main aspects that concern the development of resilience training programs for organizational settings and requirements for the study design for empirical investigation were summarized. The results of the review highlight possible directions for future research and offer useful insights for resilience-enhancing training programs in organizations.

AB  - Extensive research has been carried out by researchers for improving the thermal efficiency of the microchannel. There are various types of methodologies that have been proposed by authors for different geometry and fluid flow. The use of microchannel in the miniature heat exchangers and microchannel heat sink (MCHS) have taken the science of heat transfer to an another level for which the field of electronic device cooling, aerospace applications, automobile sectors, biomedical engineering, and chemical engineering sectors are being keen toward further development of the technology. Since 3 decades, the microchannel has been tested numerically, experimentally, and analytically for establishing the theories of hydraulic and thermal efficiency during fluid flow. Improper geometry selection of microchannel may lead to carry various losses such as pressure drop, friction factor, wall shear stress, and temperature jump. Available investigations and results have been reviewed immensely in this paper to give a clear prospective for further research in selecting a proper channel geometry.

AB  - The startle reflex has been suggested to operate as a psychophysiological marker of psychopathic personality, based on findings from studies using a range of different methodologies and participant samples. The present review aims at synthesizing existing evidence of the relationship between psychopathy and the startle reflex across task paradigms, psychopathic personality subtypes and subdimensions, participant samples (i.e., incarcerated/ clinical or non-offenders), and age groups using the triarchic model of psychopathy as a frame of reference. Systematic literature searches were conducted up until the 24th of March 2020 in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. A total of 2311 potential studies were identified, out of which 40 met relevancy and quality criteria. Results indicate that reduced aversive startle potentiation is associated with psychopathic personality in general, but clusters of traits relating to the triarchic model constructs of boldness and meanness in particular. Available evidence suggest that startle paradigms could be meaningful for differentiating individuals with and without psychopathic personality. Findings support suggestions of psychopathic personality as a multifaceted, rather than a unitary construct. Reduced aversive startle potentiation has also been found in relation to psychopathic features in child-aged samples but work of this kind is limited and more research is needed. Future studies should focus on greater consistency in task paradigms and analytic strategies to enhance the capacity to compare and integrate findings across studies.

AB  - Interpersonal coordination is a research topic that has attracted considerable attention this last decade both due to a theoretical shift from intra-individual to inter-individual processes and due to the development of new methods for recording and analyzing movements in ecological settings. Encompassing spatiotemporal behavioral matching, interpersonal coordination is considered as "social glue" due to its capacity to foster social bonding. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are still unclear and recent findings suggest a complex picture. Goal-oriented joint action and spontaneous coordination are often conflated, making it difficult to disentangle the role of joint commitment from unconscious mutual attunement. Consequently, the goals of the present article are twofold: (1) to illustrate the rapid expansion of interpersonal coordination as a research topic and (2) to conduct a systematic review of spontaneous interpersonal coordination, summarizing its latest developments and current challenges this last decade. By applying Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction and Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithms, keywords were extracted from PubMed and Scopus databases revealing the large diversity of research topics associated with spontaneous interpersonal coordination. Using the same databases and the keywords "behavioral matching," "interactional synchrony," and "interpersonal coordination," 1,213 articles were identified, extracted, and screened following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. A total of 19 articles were selected using the following inclusion criteria: (1) dynamic and spontaneous interactions between two unacquainted individuals (2) kinematic analyses, and (3) non-clinical and non-expert adult populations. The results of this systematic review stress the proliferation of various definitions and experimental paradigms that study perceptual and/or social influences on the emergence of spontaneous interpersonal coordination. As methods and indices used to quantify interpersonal coordination differ from one study to another, it becomes difficult to establish a coherent picture. This review highlights the need to reconsider interpersonal coordination not as the pinnacle of social interactions but as a complex dynamical process that requires cautious interpretation. An interdisciplinary approach is necessary for building bridges across scattered research fields through opening a dialogue between different theoretical frameworks and consequently provides a more ecological and holistic understanding of human social cognition.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs). Mutations in PD-related genes lead to neuronal pathogenesis through various mechanisms, with known examples including SNCA/alpha-synuclein (PAKR1), Parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), DJ-1 (PARK7), and LRRK2 (PARK8). Molecular chaperones/cochaperones are proteins that aid the folding of other proteins into a functionally active conformation. It has been demonstrated that chaperones/co-chaperones interact with PD-related proteins and regulate their function in PD. HSP70, HSP90 and small heat shock proteins can prevent neurodegeneration by regulating alpha-syn misfolding, oligomerization and aggregation. The function of chaperones is regulated by co-chaperones such as HSP110, HSP40, HOP, CHIP, and BAG family proteins. Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 are PD-related proteins which are associated with mitochondrial function. Molecular chaperones regulate mitochondrial function and protein homeostasis by interacting with these PD-related proteins. This review discusses critical molecular chaperones/ co-chaperones and PD-related proteins which contribute to the pathogenesis of PD, hoping to provide new molecular targets for therapeutic interventions to thwart the disease progression instead of only bringing symptomatic relief. Moreover, appreciating the critical role of chaperones in PD can also help us screen efficient biomarkers to identify PD at an early stage.

AB  - Cerebellar manifestations have been described in patients with gluten sensitivity (GS)-related disorders. A better understanding of the neurological manifestations of GS requires the use of neuroimaging techniques. We performed a systematic review on neuroimaging findings in GS patients with cerebellar symptoms. We also included a specific search on neuroimaging findings in GS patients with cerebellar manifestations on a gluten-free diet (GFD). PubMed, Embase, and Bireme were systematically searched to identify studies assessing neuroimaging features of adults with cerebellar manifestations and GS with or without enteropathy on a GFD. Ten studies with a total of 222 adult-GS patients were included. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in 100% of the studies. Cerebellar atrophy was evaluated in 7 studies and observed in 63% of the patients. White matter abnormalities were described in 2 studies. Single-photon emission computed tomography was used in 2 studies, and decreased cerebellar perfusion was detected in 92% of the included patients. No study employed nuclear medicine after the start of GFD. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed in 2 studies before and after GFD. An increase in the Naa/Cr ratio in cerebellar vermis was seen in 98% of the cases on a strict GFD. Cerebellar atrophy was found to be a prevalent condition in GS patients. MRS demonstrated to be useful in the follow-up of GS patients with cerebellar manifestations on a GFD. Prospective studies using nuclear medicine imaging are needed to study brain changes in GS patients on a GFD.

AB  - Background: Subthreshold depression (SD) is considered to be the precursor stage of major depression, which is correlated with functional impairment and increased suicide rate. Although there are multiple therapies for the treatment of SD, the comparison and efficacy of various methods has yet to be evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different therapies by performing a Bayesian network meta-analysis.
   Methods: We searched eight databases on April 3, 2021. Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Beck Depression Inventory scale (BDI), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K-6) were used as efficacy outcomes. This Bayesian network meta-analysis used a fixed-effects model.
   Findings: Twenty-one randomized controlled trials involving 5,048 participants were included in this study. The results suggested that electroacupuncture (MD -12.00, 95% CrI -15.00, -10.00), conventional acupuncture plus wheat-grain moxibustion (MD -9.70, 95% CrI -14.00, -5.30), and the Chinese traditional peripateticism pill plus group counseling (MD -9.00, 95% CrI -11.00, -6.70) had better efficacy than the control group (CG) in improving CES-D. For BDI outcome, bright light therapy (MD -9.70, 95% CrI -13.00, -6.00), behavioral activation program (MD -5.70, 95% CrI -6.10, -5.40), and dim light therapy (MD -6.30, 95% CrI -10.00, -2.20) were better than the CG. Tai chi (MD -3.00, 95% CrI -4.00, -2.00) was better than CG for PHQ-9 outcomes. Telephone-based cognitive behavioral treatment (MD -2.50 95% CrI -2.70, -2.30) was better than the CG for K-6 scores.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that electroacupuncture or bright light therapy appear to be the better choices in the treatment of SD. This study provide new insights into clinical treatment selection and may aid the development of guidelines for the management of SD.

AB  - There has been a progressive increase in the prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases worldwide. Recent studies have suggested that the crosstalk between adipose tissue and central nervous system (CNS), through cellular mediators and signaling pathways, may causally link obesity with cognitive decline and give rise to neurodegenerative disorders. Several mechanisms have been proposed in obesity, including inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, altered lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, which may result in neuroinflammation, altered brain insulin signaling, amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition and neuronal cell death. Since obesity is associated with functional and morphological alterations in the adipose tissues, the resulting peripheral immune response augments the development and progression of cognitive decline and increases susceptibility of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Studies have also elucidated an important role of high fat diet in the exacerbation of these clinical conditions. However, the underlying factors that propel and sustain this obesity associated cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, remains highly elusive. Moreover, the mechanisms linking these phenomena are not well-understood. The cumulative line of evidence have demonstrated an important role of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and transcriptional changes, as biomarkers of pathophysiological conditions. Despite the lack of utility in current clinical practices, miRNAs have been shown to be highly specific and sensitive to the clinical condition being studied. Based on these observations, this review aims to assess the role of several miRNAs and aim to elucidate underlying mechanisms that link obesity with cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, this review will also provide evidence for the effect of dietary modulation which can potentially ameliorate cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases associated with obesity.

AB  - Introduction: Ireland has an ageing population of persons with intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and both (ID/ASD). Despite this, little is known about the prevalence of ASD and its effect on functional outcomes, psychiatric comorbidity or diagnostic issues in an older population with ID. This article reviews the literature on older adults with ID/ASD and identifies opportunities for future research in this population. Method: The authors searched the Medline, Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL and PsychInfo databases using the search terms using key words: (older adults) AND (ID OR mental retardation OR learning disability) AND (autism OR ASD). After excluding articles for relevance, a scoping review was carried out on the results retrieved. Results: Of the 1227 articles retrieved from the literature on ID and autism/ASD in older adults, 85 articles were relevant to an adult population with ID/ASD. The data were collated and are presented covering domains of diagnosis, prevalence, psychiatric comorbidities and functional outcomes. Conclusions: Despite increased prevalence in childhood ASD in the last 20 years, there is a lack of research regarding adults, especially older adults, with ASD, up to half of whom will have some level of ID. The existing literature suggests that older adults with ID/ASD may have reduced functional independence, increased psychiatric comorbidity and psychotropic prescribing and more behavioural presentations than the older population generally or those with ID only. There is a need for longitudinal data to be collected on this ageing population so that care and management needs can be met in the future.

AB  - Background Psychotherapies are the treatment of choice for panic disorder, but which should be considered as first-line treatment is yet to be substantiated by evidence. Aims To examine the most effective and accepted psychotherapy for the acute phase of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia via a network meta-analysis. Method We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the most effective and accepted psychotherapy for the acute phase of panic disorder. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and CENTRAL, from inception to 1 Jan 2021 for RCTs. Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines were used. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). The protocol was published in a peer-reviewed journal and in PROSPERO (CRD42020206258). Results We included 136 RCTs in the systematic review. Taking into consideration efficacy (7352 participants), acceptability (6862 participants) and the CINeMA confidence in evidence appraisal, the best interventions in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU) were cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) (for efficacy: standardised mean differences s.m.d. = -0.67, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.39; CINeMA: moderate; for acceptability: relative risk RR = 1.21, 95% CI -0.94 to 1.56; CINeMA: moderate) and short-term psychodynamic therapy (for efficacy: s.m.d. = -0.61, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.07; CINeMA: low; for acceptability: RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.54-1.54; CINeMA: moderate). After removing RCTs at high risk of bias only CBT remained more efficacious than TAU. Conclusions CBT and short-term psychodynamic therapy are reasonable first-line choices. Studies with high risk of bias tend to inflate the overall efficacy of treatments. Results from this systematic review and network meta-analysis should inform clinicians and guidelines.

AB  - Objective: An analysis of the literature was conducted to clearly define the meaning of cultural responsiveness as it applies to the work of mental health practitioners who engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. Method: This concept analysis utilised Rogers' (2000) protocol, seeking to understand the key terms defining cultural responsiveness. A search of databases yielded a sample of 13 articles for analysis after screening and quality assessment. Results: Five major themes emerged, which were considered definitive of cultural responsiveness: Knowledge, Inclusive Relationships, Cultural Respect, Social Justice/ Human Rights, and Self-Reflection. Conclusion: These themes are presented as core values or components of culturally responsive mental health services with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. The implications for practitioner professional development and the education of students within mental health disciplines are also discussed. What is already known about this topic: Cultural responsiveness is a fundamental requirement for mental health practitioners working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Cultural responsiveness is a core learning component for students of psychology aspiring to work as mental health practitioners. Cultural responsiveness is not clearly defined within the literature. What this topic adds: Cultural responsiveness is a recursive dynamic which differs from past linear models. Cultural responsiveness is a more embracing term than previous terms and consists of overlapping features, including knowledge, inclusive relationships, cultural respect, social justice and self-reflection. Cultural responsiveness elicits a personal response from practitioners.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and borderline personality Disorder (BPD) share features, including social and emotion regulation difficulties. The evidence for the overlap in prevalence and clinical characteristics was systematically reviewed. Ovid Medline, PsycInfo, and PubMed were searched until November 30, 2020 using keywords relating to BPD and ASD. Studies that reported on the overlap of ASD and BPD diagnoses or traits and used a case, cohort, or case-controlled design were included. Of 1633 screened studies, 19 were included, of which 12 reported data suitable for meta-analysis. Most samples were of small, clinically ascertained groups, with 11 having high risk of bias. The pooled prevalence of BPD in ASD was 4% [95% CI 0%-9%] and of ASD in BPD, 3% [95% CI 1%-8%]. There were inconsistent findings across clinical areas. The prevalence of a dual diagnosis of BPD in ASD cohorts and of ASD in BPD cohorts was within population prevalence estimates of each disorder. Based on this data we were not able to assess whether there is misdiagnosis of one in favor of the other. Neurocognitive differences may underlie similar behavioral symptoms, but further research using larger, well-validated samples is needed. Lay Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) have overlaps in their symptoms. The overlap in how frequently they co-occur and their presentation was systematically reviewed. We searched the key databases and including all studies that reported on the overlap of ASD and BPD diagnoses or traits and used a case, cohort or case-controlled design. Of 1633 studies, 19 were included, of which 12 reported data suitable for pooling. Most samples were of small, clinical groups, with 11 having high risk of bias. The pooled prevalence of BPD in ASD was 4% [95% CI 0%-9%] and of ASD in BPD, 3% [95% CI 1%-8%]. There were inconsistent findings across studies comparing ASD and BPD related symptoms and problems. The prevalence of a dual diagnosis of BPD in ASD cohorts and of ASD in BPD cohorts was similar to the population prevalence of each disorder. Further research using larger, well-validated samples is needed.

AB  - Diverse intellectual functions including memory are some important aspects of cognition. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter of the catecholamine family, which contributes to the experience of pleasure and/or emotional states but also plays crucial roles in learning and memory. Methamphetamine is an illegal drug, the abuse of which leads to long lasting pathological manifestations in the brain. Chronic methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity results in an alteration of various parts of the memory systems by affecting learning processes, an effect attributed to the structural similarities of this drug with dopamine. An evolving field of research established how cognitive deficits in abusers arise and how they could possibly trigger neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, the drugs-induced tenacious neurophysiological changes of the dopamine system trigger cognitive deficits, thereby affirming the influence of this addictive drug on learning, memory and executive function in human abusers. Here we present an overview of the effects of methamphetamine abuse on cognitive functions, dopaminergic transmission and hippocampal integrity as they have been validated in animals and in humans during the past 20 years.

AB  - Introduction Chronic stress is a potential root cause of racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease. This review assesses literature surrounding effective stressreduction interventions to reduce hypertension (HTN)-a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor-among an understudied population, non-Hispanic black (NHB) women. Methods We conducted an electronic search of PubMed and PsycINFO literature published between January 1, 2000 and February 1, 2020, employing the keywords: "blood pressure", "hypertension", and "women", "black", "African-American", "stress", "meditation", "stress-coping", "stress-management", and "faith-based". We manually searched the bibliographies for additional articles. Studies were excluded if they: were published before 2000; were not intervention-based; did not study Black women in the US; did not target stress reduction; or did not measure blood pressure as an outcome. Independent reviewers screened the articles, which were selected based on consensus. Effect sizes and statistical p values were reported as provided in the included articles. Results We identified 109 articles in total. Of those, six articles met inclusion criteria. Stronger evidence presented by a randomized control trial supported the efficacy of transcendental meditation with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure up to 7 mmHg. Relaxation exercises, support groups, and therapeutic massage emerged as potentially beneficial in non-randomized pilot trials with reductions in systolic BP up to 9 mmHg and diastolic BP up to 5 mmHg varying by type and duration of the intervention. Conclusions This scoping review found that faith-based strategies and meditation can be effective stress reduction techniques to reduce BP among NHB women. However, much remains to be known about how these strategies may be leveraged to reduce blood pressure within this highly vulnerable population.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to provide a scoping review on how to address and mitigate burnout in the profession of clinical oncology. Also, it examines how artificial intelligence (AI) can mitigate burnout in oncology.
   Methods: We searched Ovid Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, for articles that examine how to address burnout in oncology.
   Results: A total of 17 studies were found to examine how burnout in oncology can be mitigated. These interventions were either targeted at individuals (oncologists) or organizations where the oncologists work. The organizational interventions include educational (psychosocial and mindfulness-based course), art therapies and entertainment, team-based training, group meetings, motivational package and reward, effective leadership and policy change, and staff support. The individual interventions include equipping the oncologists with adequate training that include-communication skills, well-being and stress management, burnout education, financial independence, relaxation, self-efficacy, resilience, hobby adoption, and work-life balance for the oncologists. Similarly, AI is thought to be poised to offer the potential to mitigate burnout in oncology by enhancing the productivity and performance of the oncologists, reduce the workload and provide job satisfaction, and foster teamwork between the caregivers of patients with cancer.
   Discussion: Burnout is common among oncologists and can be elicited from different types of situations encountered in the process of caring for patients with cancer. Therefore, for these interventions to achieve the touted benefits, combinatorial strategies that combine other interventions may be viable for mitigating burnout in oncology. With the potential of AI to mitigate burnout, it is important for healthcare providers to facilitate its use in daily clinical practices.
   Conclusion: These combinatorial interventions can ensure job satisfaction, a supportive working environment, job retention for oncologists, and improved patient care. These interventions could be integrated systematically into routine cancer care for a positive impact on quality care, patient satisfaction, the overall success of the oncological ward, and the health organizations at large.

AB  - Improving irrigation water management and enhancing water productivity (WP) is required to address future water scarcity in the sub-Saharan region. Maximizing WP by exposing the crop to a certain level of water stress using deficit irrigation (DI) is considered a promising strategy. To adopt DI strategies, a shred of comprehensive evidence concerning DI for different crops is required. This review aims to provide adequate information about the effect of DI on WP. The result showed that DI considerably increased WP compared to full irrigation. Despite higher WP, the reduced yield was obtained in some of the studied DI practices compared to full irrigation. It was also found that yield reduction may be low compared to the benefits gained by diverting the saved water to irrigate extra arable land. Maize revealed the highest (2.7 kg m(-3)) and lowest (0.5 kg m(-3)) WP when irrigated at only the initial stage compared with being fully irrigated in all growth stages. Also, onion showed a decreasing WP with increased irrigation water from 60% crop water requirement (ETc) (1.8 kg m(-3)) to 100% ETc (1.3 kg m(-3)). Increasing water deficit from 100 to 30% ETc led to an increase of wheat WP by 72%. For tomato, the highest WP (7.0 kg m(-3)) was found at 70% ETc followed by 50% ETc (7.0 kg m(-3)) and 85% ETc (6.9 kg m(-3)), while 100% ETc showed the least WP (6.8 kg m(-3)). Teff showed the lowest WP (1.7 kg m(-3)) under optimal irrigation, while it was highest (3.0 kg m(-3)) under 75% ETc throughout the growing season. The regression analysis for WP increment and yield reduction versus saved water showed higher values, indicating that DI could be an option for WP increment and increasing overall yield by expanding irrigated area and applying the saved water in water-scarce regions.

AB  - Decades of research have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), but its clinical use remains somewhat restricted because of its cognitive side effects. The aim of this systematic review is to comprehensively summarize current evidence assessing potential biomarkers of ECT-related cognitive side effects. Based on our systematic search of human studies indexed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge, a total of 29 studies evaluating patients with MDD undergoing ECT were reviewed. Molecular biomarkers studies did not consistently identify concentration changes in plasma S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), or A beta peptides significantly associated with cognitive performance after ECT. Importantly, these findings suggest that ECT-related cognitive side effects cannot be explained by mechanisms of neural cell damage. Notwithstanding, S-100b protein and A beta 40 peptide concentrations, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphisms, have been suggested as potential predictive biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction after ECT. In addition, recent advances in brain imaging have allowed us to identify ECT-induced volumetric and functional changes in several brain structures closely related to memory performance such as the hippocampus. We provide a preliminary framework to further evaluate neurobiological cognitive vulnerability profiles of patients with MDD treated with ECT.</p>

AB  - Objectives: To characterize the availability, content, and psychometric properties of self-reported measures that assess race/ethnicity-related discrimination or psychosocial stress and have potential relevance to studies of health disparities in children and adolescents.
   Design: Using PRISMA extension guidelines for scoping reviews, we searched Ovid Medline, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Scopus databases from 1946 to April 20, 2020, using the search terms "stress," "child," "adolescents," "discrimination," and "psychometrics." We limited the search to articles in English, with children and adolescents, in the United States. For each measure, we extracted information about the content, reliability, and construct validity.
   Results: The 12 measures that met inclusion criteria assessed discrimination or stress from racial discrimination in African American children and adolescents (n=8), acculturative stress in Hispanic/Latino children (n=1), or bicultural stress in Mexican American adolescents (n=2), and one measure assessed both discrimination-related and acculturative stress in Hispanic/Latino children. The majority (n=7) articles were published between 2001 and 2010. All discrimination measures evaluated individual experiences of discrimination and one also evaluated stressfulness of discrimination and coping. The acculturative stress measures assessed general stress and immigration-related discrimination, and the bicultural stress measures evaluated many different aspects of biculturalism.
   Conclusions: Despite the recent increased interest in the racial discrimination and stress as a contributor to racial or ethnic health disparities affecting U.S. children and adolescents, the small number of eligible measures identified and incomplete coverage of various types of racial and ethnic discrimination within and across population groups indicates a currently inadequate capacity to conduct child health disparity studies on this issue.

AB  - Background After remission, antidepressants are often taken long term to prevent depressive relapse or recurrence. Whether psychological interventions can be a viable alternative or addition to antidepressants remains unclear. Aims To compare the effectiveness of psychological interventions as an alternative (including delivered when tapering antidepressants) or addition to antidepressants alone for preventing depressive relapse. Method Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO were searched from inception until 13 October 2019. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with previously depressed patients in (partial) remission where preventive psychological interventions with or without antidepressants (including tapering) were compared with antidepressant control were included. Data were extracted independently from published trials. A random-effects meta-analysis on time to relapse (hazard ratio, HR) and risk of relapse (risk ratio, RR) at the last point of follow-up was conducted. PROSPERO ID: CRD42017055301. Results Among 11 included trials (n = 1559), we did not observe an increased risk of relapse for participants receiving a psychological intervention while tapering antidepressants versus antidepressants alone (RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.84-1.25; P = 0.85). Psychological interventions added to antidepressants significantly reduced the risk of relapse (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97; P = 0.01) compared with antidepressants alone. Conclusions This study found no evidence to suggest that adding a psychological intervention to tapering increases the risk of relapse when compared with antidepressants alone. Adding a psychological intervention to antidepressant use reduces relapse risk significantly versus antidepressants alone. As neither strategy is routinely implemented these findings are relevant for patients, clinicians and guideline developers.

AB  - Background. Low back pain is a deeply felt problem among the world's population, and it causes distress for health care workers, especially in nurses. Therefore, it is important to investigate the incidence of low back pain in Italian nurses.
   Methods. A search has been conducted on the main international databases, only studies conducted in Italian nurse have been considered.
   Results. Results are various: 13.7% - 20% of annual incidence and 17% - 63.7% of prevalence; working night shifts, insufficient training, frequent patient handling, lack of devices, work department, obesity, age, work-related stress and no physical activity represent a greater risk to incur in low back pain.
   Conclusions. There is a need to improve devices, training and lifestyle to reduce chronic situations.

AB  - Introduction: Bipolar disorder (BD) has a high heritability rate. Current studies have been dedicated to identifying prodromes of BD in the offspring of parents with BD (BO) and the sleep patterns of these individuals have been considered important factors.
   Objective: To describe changes in sleep parameters among offspring of parents with BD when compared to offspring of controls and to identify if changes in parameters and quality of sleep predict the onset of BD among these individuals.
   Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase were systematically searched with no year or language restrictions, up to August 18, 2020. We searched for a combination of the following search items ("sleep*") AND ("bipolar disorder*" OR "mania" OR "hypomania" OR "bipolar depression") AND ("ultra-high risk" OR "high risk" OR "offspring" OR "first degree relatives").
   Results: A total of 10 studies were included in the systematic review and 4 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that the BO had greater daytime sleepiness as compared to the offspring of control parents. The systematic review indicated that shorter sleep duration, sleep disorders, and other related features can differentiate the two groups. Finally, some sleep patterns such as decreased sleep, difficulty falling asleep, and overall sleep problems might be predictors for the development of BD.
   Conclusion: Results from the meta-analysis indicated that BO had greater daytime sleepiness. Qualitative results showed that the offspring of parents with BD have an increased likelihood of experiencing an adverse sleep pattern.

AB  - Background Although widely used, the current evidence for the efficacy of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is limited and conflicting. Aims We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of these medications in people with ASD. Method We searched the following databases: Cochrane Library, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, DARE and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we hand-searched 11 relevant journals. We used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Jadad score to assess the quality of each included study. We carried out a meta-analysis using a random effects model. Results We included 15 randomised controlled trials (13 on antidepressants and two on anti-anxiety medications) for a total of 958 people with ASD. Data showed contradictory findings among the studies, with larger studies mostly showing a non-significant difference in outcomes between the treatment and the placebo groups. Meta-analysis of pooled Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and Clinical Global Impression Scale data from nine studies (60%) did not show any statistically significant inter-group difference on either of the outcome measures. The adverse effects reported were mild and, in most studies, their rates did not show any significant inter-group difference. Conclusions Given the methodological flaws in the most included studies and contradictory findings, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusion about the effectiveness of either antidepressant or anti-anxiety medications to treat either ASD core symptoms or associated behaviours. Robust, large-scale, randomised controlled trials are needed to address this issue.

AB  - Sand play may be a significant determinant of health and development in early childhood, but systematically synthesised evidence is absent in the literature. The main objective of this study was to present a planned methodology to systematically review, and synthesise, the evidence regarding sand play and its associations with 0-8-year-old children's health and development. The systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement was registered to PROSPERO (CRD42021253852). Literature searches will be conducted using information from eight electronic databases. Studies will be included when participating children were aged 0-8 years, settings provided children with exposure to sand environments and/or materials, and child-level outcomes related to physical, cognitive, and/or social-emotional health and development. The search results will be imported to software; duplicates will be removed; and independent double screening, and study quality assessments using appropriate tools, will be conducted. Synthesis without meta-analysis will be conducted for quantitative studies similar in exposure, outcome, and content analysis to qualitative studies. Our overall confidence in each review finding will be assessed. The findings of this systematic review can inform policy makers and early childhood education teachers about the associations between sand play and children's health and development, and its impact in practice.

AB  - The thalamus is a central brain structure crucially involved in cognitive, emotional, sensory, and motor functions and is often reported to be involved in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The functional subdivision of the thalamus warrants morphological investigation on the level of individual subnuclei. In addition to volumetric measures, the investigation of other morphological features may give additional insights into thalamic morphology. For instance, shape features offer a higher spatial resolution by revealing small, regional differences that are left undetected in volumetric analyses. In this review, we discuss the benefits and limitations of recent advances in neuroimaging techniques to investigate thalamic morphology in vivo, leading to our proposed methodology. This methodology consists of available pipelines for volume and shape analysis, focussing on the morphological features of volume, thickness, and surface area. We demonstrate this combined approach in a Parkinson's disease cohort to illustrate their complementarity. Considering our findings, we recommend a combined methodology as it allows for more sensitive investigation of thalamic morphology in clinical populations.

AB  - Introduction: Social isolation has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting well-being. Veterans, a marginalized population, are more likely to be impacted by social isolation; however, animals living in Veteran households may be an integral part of improving well-being. Methods: A narrative review was conducted to synthesize current literature published in peer-reviewed journals addressing the impact of animals on Veteran well-being during times of social isolation. Articles retrieved from five computerized databases were screened for inclusion. A biopsychosocial model was used to understand contributions of human-animal interactions to health outcomes. Results: A total of 114 articles were retrieved and 10 met inclusion criteria. Four articles were chosen for evaluation. There was a dearth of literature regarding social isolation, such as that experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of animals on Veteran well-being. Discussion: Robust methodological research designs are limited; therefore, investigation on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on social isolation and well-being of humans and their animals is recommended. It is also suggested that a database be created as a repository for human-animal interaction research.
   LAY SUMMARY Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative consequences of social isolation on well-being, the authors wanted to better understand the impact animals have on Veteran well-being during times of social isolation. The authors searched current articles to find the answer. What was found was limited, but the findings support that human-animal interaction has beneficial effects on Veteran well-being ameliorating the consequences of social isolation.

AB  - Adherence to prescribed medication regimes improves outcomes for patients with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorders. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the effectiveness among interventions to improve medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorders. Literature published in the last decade was searched for interventions studies to improve adherence in patients with schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder. Interventions were categorised on the basis of type, and the context and effectiveness of the interventions were described. Two review authors independently extracted and assessed data, following criteria outlined by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The GRADEPro (McMaster University, 2020, Ontario, Canada) was used for assessing the quality of the evidence. Twenty-three publications met the selection criteria. Different types of interventions aiming to improve adherence were tested: educational, behavioural, family-based, technological, or a combination of previous types. Meta-analysis could be performed for 10 interventions. When considered separately by subgroups on the basis of intervention type, no significant differences were found in adherence among interventions (p = 0.29; I-2 = 19.9%). This review concluded that successful interventions used a combination of behavioural and educational approaches that seem easy to implement in daily practice.

AB  - For patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) lifestyle changes and disease management are key aspects of treatment that could be facilitated by mobile health applications (MHA). However, the quality and functions of MHA for CHD are largely unknown, since reviews are missing. Therefore, this study assessed the general characteristics, quality, and functions of MHA for CHD. Hereby, the Google Play and Apple App stores were systematically searched using a web crawler. The general characteristics and quality of MHA were rated with the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) by two independent raters. From 3078 identified MHA, 38 met the pre-defined criteria and were included in the assessment. Most MHA were affiliated with commercial companies (52.63%) and lacked an evidence-base. An overall average quality of MHA (M = 3.38, SD = 0.36) was found with deficiencies in information quality and engagement. The most common functions were provision of information and CHD risk score calculators. Further functions included reminders (e.g., for medication or exercises), feedback, and health management support. Most MHA (81.58%) had one or two functions and MHA with more features had mostly higher MARS ratings. In summary, this review demonstrated that a number of potentially helpful MHA for patients with CHD are commercially available. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence documenting their usability and clinical potential. Since it is difficult for patients and healthcare providers to find suitable and high-quality MHA, databases with professionally reviewed MHA are required.

AB  - Although the built environment (BE) is important for children's health, there is little consensus about which features are most important due to differences in measurement and outcomes across disciplines. This meta-narrative review was undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers to summarise ways in which the BE is measured, and how this links to children's health. A structured search of four databases across the relevant disciplines retrieved 108 relevant references. The most commonly addressed health-related outcomes were active travel, physical activity and play, and obesity. Many studies used objective (GIS and street audits) or standardised subjective (perceived) measurements of the BE. However, there was a wide variety, and sometimes inconsistency, in their definition and use. There were clear associations between the BE and children's health. Objective physical activity and self-reported active travel, or obesity, were positively associated with higher street connectivity or walkability measures, while self-reported physical activity and play had the strongest association with reduced street connectivity, indicated by quieter, one-way streets. Despite the high heterogeneity found in BE measures and health outcomes, the meta-narrative approach enabled us to identify ten BE categories that are likely to support children's health and be protective against some non-communicable disease risk factors. Future research should implement consistent BE measures to ensure key features are explored. A systems approach will be particularly relevant for addressing place-based health inequalities, given potential unintended health consequences of making changes to the BE.

AB  - Essential oil (EO)-based mouthwashes have been used for oral health maintenance due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim was to review clinical trials that assessed the role of EO-based mouthwashes in controlling gingivitis in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment (OT). The Patients, Interventions, Control and Outcome (PICO) format was based on the following: (a) P: Patients undergoing fixed OT (b) Intervention: EO-based mouth-wash; Control: Mouthwashes that did not contain EOs or no mouthwash (d) Outcome: Control of gingivitis measured by clinical indices. Databases were searched manually and electronically up to and including May 2021 using different medical subject subheadings. Data screening and extraction were performed. The risk of bias within randomized controlled trials was assessed using the revised Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool (RoB 2). The Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was used for non-randomized controlled trials. Disagreements related to literature search and RoB evaluations were resolved via discussion. Six clinical studies were included. Four studies showed that Listerine(R) is effective in controlling gingivitis in patients undergoing fixed OT. One study reported that the use of 5% Fructus mume mouthwash resulted in a significant reduction in gingival bleeding. Two mouthwashes that contained 1% Matricaria chamomilla L. and 0.5% Zingiber officinale were also found to be efficient in controlling gingival bleeding. Four, one and one studies had a low, moderate and high RoB, respectively. In conclusion, EO-based mouthwashes seem to be effective for the management of gingivitis among patients undergoing fixed OT. Further well-designed and power-adjusted clinical trials are needed.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an unprecedented threat for individuals and societies, revealing stark inequalities in preparedness, exposure, and consequences. The present systematic literature review complements extant knowledge on disasters and pandemic diseases with programmatic research on the COVID-19 pandemic. Building upon an integrative definition of threat, we merge intra-personal threat regulation with group dynamics and inter-group relations. Via streamlined methods of knowledge synthesis, we first map out a broad taxonomy of threats, as appraised by the majority population and ethno-racial and immigrant minorities. Second, we delve into research linking threat appraisals with either conflict or prosociality within and across group boundaries. To conclude, we propose some guidelines for researchers to involve ethno-racial and immigrant minorities actively and for societies to cope cohesively with the impact of COVID-19.

AB  - The correct identification of basic emotions (joy, fear, disgust, sadness, surprise and anger) plays an important role in social relationships and behaviors linked to one's survival. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the ability to recognize emotions may already be impaired at early stages of the disease. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature on facial emotional recognition in people with AD, identifying possible modulating variables. A search on the Web of Science and Psyclnfo databases was carried out. After applying the inclusion-exclusion criteria, a total of 28 articles were selected. Static images were the most used stimuli to evaluate the recognition of basic emotions, especially the photographs developed by Paul Ekman and collaborators. Results of the present review indicate that people with AD generally display deficits in emotional recognition, although data are not conclusive, which could be related to the diversity of methodologies applied. In relation to the variables evaluated (sex and age), the need of further research in order to study how these factors could modulate emotional recognition in AD patients is highlighted.

AB  - Despite the long evolutionary history of this group, the challenges brought by the Anthropocene have been inflicting an extensive pressure over sharks and their relatives. Overexploitation has been driving a worldwide decline in elasmobranch populations, and rapid environmental change, triggered by anthropogenic activities, may further test this group's resilience. In this context, we searched the literature for peer-reviewed studies featuring a sustained (>24 h) and controlled exposure of elasmobranch species to warming, acidification, and/or deoxygenation: three of the most pressing symptoms of change in the ocean. In a standardized comparative framework, we conducted an array of mixed-model meta-analyses (based on 368 control-treatment contrasts from 53 studies) to evaluate the effects of these factors and their combination as experimental treatments. We further compared these effects across different attributes (lineages, climates, lifestyles, reproductive modes, and life stages) and assessed the direction of impact over a comprehensive set of biological responses (survival, development, growth, aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism, oxygen transport, feeding, behavior, acid-base status, thermal tolerance, hypoxia tolerance, and cell stress). Based on the present findings, warming appears as the most influential factor, with clear directional effects, namely decreasing development time and increasing aerobic metabolism, feeding, and thermal tolerance. While warming influence was pervasive across attributes, acidification effects appear to be more context-specific, with no perceivable directional trends across biological responses apart from the necessary to achieve acid-base balance. Meanwhile, despite its potential for steep impacts, deoxygenation has been the most neglected factor, with data paucity ultimately precluding sound conclusions. Likewise, the implementation of multi-factor treatments has been mostly restricted to the combination of warming and acidification, with effects approximately matching those of warming. Despite considerable progress over recent years, research regarding the impact of these drivers on elasmobranchs lags behind other taxa, with more research required to disentangle many of the observed effects. Given the current levels of extinction risk and the quick pace of global change, it is further crucial that we integrate the knowledge accumulated through different scientific approaches into a holistic perspective to better understand how this group may fare in a changing ocean.</p>

AB  - Background Anxiety is common in youth on the autism spectrum and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been adapted to address associated symptoms. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of CBT for reducing anxiety in autistic youth. Method Searches of PubMed and Scopus databases were undertaken from January 1990 until December 2020. Studies were included if they consisted of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using CBT to reduce anxiety in autistic youth. Separate random effects meta-analyses assessed anxiety ratings according to informant (clinician; parent; child), both at end-of-trial and at follow-up. Results A total of 19 RCTs met our inclusion criteria (833 participants: CBT N = 487; controls N = 346). Random effects meta-analyses revealed a large effect size for clinician rated symptoms (g = 0.88, 95% CI 0.55, 1.12, k = 11), while those for both parent (g = 0.40, 95% CI 0.24, 0.56; k = 18) and child-reported anxiety (g = 0.25, 95% CI 0.06, 0.43; k = 13) were smaller, but significant. These benefits were not however maintained at follow-up. Moderator analyses showed that CBT was more efficacious for younger children (for clinician and parent ratings) and when delivered as individual therapy (for clinician ratings). Using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, we found concerns about reporting bias across most trials. Conclusions The efficacy of CBT for anxiety in autistic youth was supported in the immediate intervention period. However, substantial inconsistency emerged in the magnitude of benefit depending upon who was rating symptoms (clinician, parent or child). Follow-up analyses failed to reveal sustained benefits, though few studies have included this data. It will be important for future trials to address robustness of treatment gains overtime and to further explore inconsistency in efficacy by informant. We also recommend pre-registration of methods by trialists to address concerns with reporting bias.

AB  - Background People affected by homelessness, imprisonment, substance use, sex work or severe mental illness experience substantial excess ill health and premature death. Though these experiences often co-occur, health outcomes associated with their overlap have not previously been reviewed. We synthesised existing evidence on mortality, morbidity, self-rated health and quality of life among people affected by more than one of these experiences. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO for peer-reviewed English-language observational studies from high-income countries published between 1 January 1998 and 11 June 2018. Two authors undertook independent screening, with risk of bias assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Findings were summarised by narrative synthesis and random-effect meta-analysis. Results From 15 976 citations, 2517 studies underwent full-text screening, and 444 were included. The most common exposure combinations were imprisonment/substance use (31% of data points) and severe mental illness/substance use (27%); only 1% reported outcomes associated with more than two exposures. Infections were the most common outcomes studied, with blood-borne viruses accounting for 31% of all data points. Multiple exposures were associated with poorer outcomes in 80% of data points included (sign test for effect direction, p<0.001). Meta-analysis suggested increased all-cause mortality among people with multiple versus fewer exposures (HR: 1.57 and 95% CI: 1.38 to 1.77), though heterogeneity was high. Conclusion People affected by multiple exclusionary processes experience profound health inequalities, though there are important gaps in the research landscape. Addressing the health needs of these populations is likely to require co-ordinated action across multiple sectors, such as healthcare, criminal justice, drug treatment, housing and social security.

AB  - Programming for data wrangling and statistical analysis is an essential technical tool of modern epidemiology, yet many epidemiologists receive limited formal training in strategies to optimize the quality of our code. In complex projects, coding mistakes are easy to make, even for skilled practitioners. Such mistakes can lead to invalid research claims that reduce the credibility of the field. Code review is a straightforward technique used by the software industry to reduce the likelihood of coding bugs. The systematic implementation of code review in epidemiologic research projects could not only improve science but also decrease stress, accelerate learning, contribute to team building, and codify best practices. In the present article, we argue for the importance of code review and provide some recommendations for successful implementation for 1) the research laboratory, 2) the code author (the initial programmer), and 3) the code reviewer. We outline a feasible strategy for implementation of code review, though other successful implementation processes are possible to accommodate the resources and workf lows of different research groups, including other practices to improve code quality. Code review isn't always glamorous, but it is critically important for science and reproducibility. Humans are fallible; that's why we need code review.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multifactor disease in the development of which both genetic and environmental factors play a role. Specifically, the effects of organic and inorganic toxic substances can result in an increased risk of ALS development and the acceleration of disease progression. It was described that some toxins can induce potentially curable ALS-like syndromes. In this case, the specific treatment for the prevention of the effects of the toxic factor may result in positive clinical dynamics. In this article, we review the main types of toxins that can damage motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord leading to the development of the clinical manifestation of ALS, briefly present historical data on studies on the role of toxic substances, and describe the main mechanisms of the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease associated with their action.

AB  - The purpose of this scoping literature review was to examine research on police involvement in school mental health crisis response. The search was conducted in PsychInfo, PubMed, and ERIC and initially identified 315 articles. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 47 articles remained. Detailed review and data extraction by three independent reviewers resulted in a final article count of nine. Three primary themes were identified across articles: (1) perceptions and consequences of law enforcement presence in schools; (2) the role of school-community partnerships in successful crisis response models; and (3) gaps in research and challenges of implementing and scaling existing models. Though in practice law enforcement officers are often involved in school mental health crisis response, there is limited empirical research supporting this approach. Our review did not return any randomized trials. In the absence of empirical evidence supporting the use of current models, there is a need for research on law enforcement involvement in school crisis response and, more broadly, community-partnered models of responding to student mental health needs.

AB  - In schizophrenia, impairments in neurocognition (NC) and social cognition (SC) are associated with reduced functional capacity (FC) and poor real-world functioning (RWF).
   In this semi-systematic review, we examined this association across a range of research questions.
   We conducted a systematic search in Embase and MEDLINE from 2005 to 2019, and conducted additional pragmatic searches. After screening of titles, abstracts and full-texts, we included 564 citations, of which 44 (26 primary studies, 15 systematic reviews and 3 narrative reviews) were prioritized for reporting.
   Both NC and SC were significantly associated with functioning, with slightly stronger association for SC. Effect sizes were generally larger for FC than for RWF. NC showed stronger associations with occupational functioning and independent living, and SC with social functioning. Baseline cognition predicted long-term RWF up to 20 years of follow-up, though long-term data were limited for SC. Cognitive remediation improved RWF func-tioning, especially when it was combined with psychosocial rehabilitation.
   SC mediated the relationship of NC with functioning. Negative symptoms appeared to mediate and moderate the association of cognition with functioning. Other factors involved included severity of cognitive dysfunction, metacognition, depression and choice of RWF instrument.
   We discuss potential implications for studies of pharmacological cognitive interventions in schizophrenia - the relevance of both NC and SC, the advantage of adjunctive psychosocial rehabilitation, the role of relevant moderating and mediating variables, and the challenges with RWF instrument selection. Successful cognitive interventions could allow patients with schizophrenia to improve their potential for community functioning.

AB  - War as an unpleasant and stressful phenomenon could be the cause of psychiatric disorders. This study aims to collect and compare conducted research to estimate the prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in combatants, veterans, and freed soldiers of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. This study is a case review study in which articles were found using keywords, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), veterans, combatants, captive, soldiers and war in domestic and foreign databases, personal archives, libraries of Iran and Tehran Universities of Medical Sciences and the National Library. The cumulative incidence of PTSD was determined to be 27.8% in veterans, combatants, and freed soldiers. The prevalence of PTSD as seen in civilian and some military studies is less than the values determined in this study. Reasons for this discrepancy may be due to longer durations of exposure and greater numbers of in-the-field missions, multiple traumas, and higher rates of combat exposure, as well as differences in sampling and measurement strategies (e.g. the use of questionnaires instead of clinical interviews).

AB  - Aim Former unaccompanied immigrant minors (UMs) now living in the USA are a uniquely vulnerable population. The US Office of Refugee Resettlement shelters provide health services, but most are discontinued once UMs leave the shelters. A systematic review was therefore designed to quantify access to medical, mental, and dental healthcare services by former UMs living in the USA. Subject and methods The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO. A search was made in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Academic Search Complete in June 2020. Full-text review, data extraction, and data analysis were completed by all authors. Results Searches returned a total of 2646 studies, of which 15 met all eligibility criteria. There was an overlap in the services investigated in the studies - 13 assessed mental health, ten assessed medical, and four included dental care. Sample sizes ranged from one to 4809, and there was a wide range of study designs. Some studies included multiple locations. Nine studies demonstrated success in community-based clinics or programs; one in a hospital, four in schools, three in group living settings, and one in U.S. Customs Border Patrol (CBP) custody. Three studies explored access to services post-release from shelters. Conclusions Healthcare programs at shelters, schools, and in the community have provided some screening and diagnosis of medical, mental health, and dental conditions for UMs, but multiple financial and cultural barriers make ongoing treatment difficult to access. Long-term studies following UMs in shelters and post-release through adulthood are needed to help create new, or modify existing, programs, to adequately support UMs now living in the USA.

AB  - Background: Patients with chronic diseases, like diabetes need to continuously perform tasks associated with self-management especially with medications they use. It is shown that the patients with diabetes with limited HL and PTHL cannot read medication labels correctly, may misuse their medications, spend much more on therapy and generally have difficulties in understanding printed care instructions and perceiving health advice and warnings. There has been an increasing demand for valid and reliable instruments for HL and PTHL assessment in this population. This review aims to search and critically discuss instruments used to assess HL and PTHL in people with type 2 diabetes and propose their use in different settings.Methods: Authors conducted a comprehensive, electronic search of original studies using a structured approach of the Scopus and PubMed databases, during November and the first 2 weeks of December 2020 to find relevant papers. The review was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines and the reporting was based on the PRISMA-ScR. The comparison of instruments was made by utilizing a comparison model related to their structure, measurement scope, range, psychometric properties, validation, strengths, and limitations.Results: The final number of included studies was 24, extracting the following identified instruments: Korean Functional Test HL, NVS, FCCHL, HLS-EU-47, TOFLHA, S-TOFHLA, REALM-R, 3-brief SQ, REALM, HLQ and DNT-15. In all, FCCHL and 3-brief SQ are shown with the broadest measurement scopes. They are quick, easy, and inexpensive for administration. FCCHL can be considered the most useful and comprehensive instrument to screen for inadequate HL. The limitation is that the English version is not validated. Three-brief SQ has many advantages in comparison to other instruments, including that it is less likely to cause anxiety and shame. These instruments can be considered the best for measuring functional HL in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and other chronic diseases. PTHL instruments (REALM and DNT-15) did not find the best application in this population.Conclusions: The future research should be directed in validation of the FCCHL in English and establishing of the structural validity of this questionnaire. Developing a specific PTHL questionnaire for this population will be of great help in management of their disease.

AB  - The Japanese government approved a plan to discharge Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Accident contaminated water (FDNPPACW) into the Pacific Ocean. It immediately caused a new wave of global concern and anxiety. To assess this matter, this work briefly reviewed the dispersion of FDNPPA-derived radionuclides in the Pacific Ocean in the past and the resulting impacts on marine biota. Combining the drafted plan of discharging FDNPPACW and the public's concerns, 5 points, including (1) the detailed plan of discharging FDNPPACW, (2) the isotopes left in the advanced liquid processing system (ALPS)-treated water and their amounts, (3) the stability of the Kuroshio Extension, (4) the fates and transports of the main radionuclides (left in the ALPS-treated water) in North Pacific seawater, (5) and bioaccumulations and the ecological half-lives of the main radionuclides (left in the ALPS-treated water) in marine biota in the North Pacific, remain to be known to understand the impacts of discharging FDNPPACW into the Pacific Ocean.

AB  - In the present-day knowledge society, people need to critically comprehend information across multiple sources that express diverse and contradictory viewpoints. Due to the complexity associated with this process, an important role can be played by Executive Functions, that is, cognitive control processes used to regulate mental functioning and behavior when automatized elaborations are not sufficient. The aim of this article is to review existing research on the roles of executive functions when reading from multiple texts. To identify the appropriate studies, we conducted a search in the following databases: Web of science, Scopus, PsycInfo, Eric. The search string was created by combining the terms used in past literature reviews on executive functions and multiple-texts comprehension. From the total number of 4,877 records identified, seven articles met all the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Given the scarcity of studies on the topic, we decided to examine also eight articles reporting indirect evidence about the association between executive functions and multiple-text comprehension. Our review revealed that the study of the association between executive functions and multiple-texts comprehension is underdeveloped. The results seem to suggest that working memory is involved in surface comprehension, whereas results about sourcing and intertextual integration processes are mixed. Indirect evidence suggests that other executive functions, such as planning or monitoring, may be involved when learning from multiple texts. More research on this topic is needed given the increasing complexity of the contexts in which reading activities take place.

AB  - Perception of facial expression is essential for social interactions. Although a few competing models have enjoyed some success to map brain regions, they are also facing difficult challenges. The current study used an updated activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method of meta-analysis to explore the involvement of brain regions in facial expression processing. The sample contained 96 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies of healthy adults with the results of whole-brain analyses. The key findings revealed that the ventral pathway, especially the left fusiform face area (FFA) region, was more responsive to facial expression. The left posterior FFA showed strong involvement when participants passively viewing emotional faces without being asked to judge the type of expression or other attributes of the stimuli. Through meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) of the main brain regions in the ventral pathway, we constructed a co-activating neural network as a revised model of facial expression processing that assigns prominent roles to the amygdala, FFA, the occipital gyrus, and the inferior frontal gyrus.

AB  - Uncovering community structure has made a significant advancement in explaining, analyzing, and forecasting behaviors and dynamics of networks related to different fields in sociology, criminology, biology, medicine, communication, economics, and academia. Detecting and clustering communities is a powerful step toward identifying the structural properties and the behavioral patterns in social networks. Recently, online learning has been progressively adopted by a lot of educational practices which raise many questions about assessing the learners' engagement, collaboration, and behaviors in the new emerging learning communities. This systematic literature review aims to assess the use of community detection techniques in analyzing the network's structure in online learning environments. It provides a comprehensive overview of the existing research that adopted those techniques with identifying the educational objectives behind their application as well as suggesting possible future research directions. Our analysis covered 65 studies that found in the literature and applied different community discovery techniques on various types of online learning environments to analyze their users' interactions patterns. Our review revealed the potential of this field in improving educational practices and decisions and in utilizing the massive amount of data generated from interacting with those environments. Finally, we highlighted the need to include automated community discovery techniques in online learning environments to facilitate and enhance their use as well as we stressed on the urge for further advance research to uncover a lot of hidden opportunities.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in various environment compartments, including food. Here, we collected research reports of MPs in food published during 2010-2020, and summarized the analytical methods developed and utilized by researchers (e.g., digestion, separation and identification, as well as related QA/QC measures implemented), the occurrence, and the characteristics of MPs in six kinds of food. The potential effects on biota from exposure to MPs were also reviewed. The results showed that most researchers digested food samples using chemical solutions such as HNO3, H2O2, KOH, or NaOH. FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy were the main technique for identifying MPs, and microscopes were used to count MP particles. The abundances MPs were in the ranges of 0-5860, 2.00-1100, 0-698, 4.00-18.7, 0-5.68 x 10(4) and 900-3000 particles/kg in beverages, condiments, honey, meat, seafood and vegetables, respectively. The "maximum" annual human intake of MPs from these foods is approximately 1.42 x 10(5)-1.54 x 10(5) particles/capita, equivalent to the consumption of 50 plastic bags (size: 0.04 mm x 250 mm x 400 mm, density: 0.98 g/cm(3)) each year. Blue-colored and fiber-shaped MP particles were the most commonly observed in food, predominated by PA, PE, PES, PET and PP types. Toxicity studies indicated that MPs, additives of MPs and adsorbents or microorganisms on the surfaces of MPs were all somewhat toxic to cells or biota. Exposure to MPs may induce oxidative stress, inflammation, neurotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity, and change the structure of intestinal microflora in cells or biota. Therefore, we call for more investigation into the residual, excretion and bioavailability of MPs or related absorbents/additives in biota and humans. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, philosophical-legal studies on neuroscience (mainly in the fields of neuroethics and neurolaw) have given increasing prominence to a normative analysis of the ethical-legal challenges in the mind and brain sciences in terms of rights, freedoms, entitlements and associated obligations. This way of analyzing the ethical and legal implications of neuroscience has come to be known as "neurorights." Neurorights can be defined as the ethical, legal, social, or natural principles of freedom or entitlement related to a person's cerebral and mental domain; that is, the fundamental normative rules for the protection and preservation of the human brain and mind. Although reflections on neurorights have received ample coverage in the mainstream media and have rapidly become a mainstream topic in the public neuroethics discourse, the frequency of such reflections in the academic literature is still relatively scarce. While the prominence of the neurorights debate in public opinion is crucial to ensure public engagement and democratic participation in deliberative processes on this issue, its relatively sporadic presence in the academic literature poses a risk of semantic-normative ambiguity and conceptual confusion. This risk is exacerbated by the presence of multiple and not always reconcilable terminologies. Several meta-ethical, normative ethical, and legal-philosophical questions need to be solved in order to ensure that neurorights can be used as effective instruments of global neurotechnology governance and be adequately imported into international human rights law. To overcome the shortcomings above, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive normative-ethical, historical and conceptual analysis of neurorights. In particular, it attempts to (i) reconstruct a history of neurorights and locate these rights in the broader history of idea, (ii) outline a systematic conceptual taxonomy of neurorights, (iii) summarize ongoing policy initiatives related to neurorights, (iv) proactively address some unresolved ethico-legal challenges, and (v) identify priority areas for further academic reflection and policy work in this domain.

AB  - Water scarcity is a global challenge, yet existing responses are failing to cope with current shocks and stressors, including those attributable to climate change. In sub-Saharan Africa, the impacts of water scarcity threaten livelihoods and wellbeing across the continent and are driving a broad range of adaptive responses. This paper describes trends of water scarcity for Africa and outlines climate impacts on key water-related sectors on food systems, cities, livelihoods and wellbeing, conflict and security, economies, and ecosystems. It then uses systematic review methods, including the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative, to analyse 240 articles and identify adaptation characteristics of planned and autonomous responses to water scarcity across Africa. The most common impact drivers responded to are drought and participation variability. The most frequently identified actors responding to water scarcity include individuals or households (32%), local government (15%) and national government (15%), while the most common types of response are behavioural and cultural (30%), technological and infrastructural (27%), ecosystem-based (25%) and institutional (18%). Most planned responses target low income communities (31%), women (20%), and indigenous communities (13%), but very few studies target mi-grants, ethnic minorities or those living with disabilities. There is a lack of coordination of planned adaptation at scale across all relevant sectors and regions, and lack of legal and institutional frameworks for their operation. Most responses to water scarcity are coping and autonomous responses that showed only minor adjustments to business-as-usual water practices, suggesting limited adaptation depth. Maladaptation is associated with one or more dimension of responses in almost 20% of articles. Coordinating institutional responses, carefully planned technologies, planning for projected climate risks including extension of climate services and increased climate change literacy, and integrating indigenous knowledge will help to address identified challenges of water scarcity towards more adaptive responses across Africa.

AB  - Objective: People living with severe and persistent mental illness experience poorer physical health, often due to medication and preventable lifestyle factors, and exacerbated by barriers to accessing healthcare services. Pharmacists are well-positioned to improve the physical and mental health of this population. However, little is known about pharmacists' current practices when providing services to this population nor the impact of pharmacist-led interventions on consumer health outcomes. We undertook a systematic review to identify, describe and assess the effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions for supporting people living with severe and persistent mental illness and the impact on consumer outcomes. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched between January 1990 and April 2020. Full-text studies exploring pharmacist-led interventions in any setting for people living with severe and persistent mental illness were included. A risk of bias assessment was conducted. Results: A total of 37 studies were included. More than half of the pharmacist interventions were multifaceted. The most common components of pharmacist-led interventions included education and/or patient counselling, providing recommendations to healthcare professionals and conducting medication reviews. Multifaceted interventions demonstrated improvements in clinical outcomes, whereas single interventions focused mostly on consumer-reported outcomes. The methodological quality of included studies was moderate-to-high risk of bias and there was considerable heterogeneity in the study design, interventions described, and outcomes reported. Conclusion: There is evidence that pharmacist-led interventions improve consumer-reported and clinical outcomes for people living with severe and persistent mental illness. Pharmacists are capable and have a role in supporting people living with severe and persistent mental illness, either individually or as interprofessional collaborators with other healthcare professionals. Future research should attempt to better understand which particular intervention components have the greatest impact and also evaluate the implementation and long-term sustainability of such interventions.

AB  - As the ocean warms, the frequency, duration, intensity, and range of marine heatwaves (MHWs) increase. MHWs are becoming a severe challenge for marine ecosystems. However, our understanding in regard to their impacts on algal structure and carbon sequestration is still deficient or fragmentary, particularly when combined with ocean warming and acidification. In this paper, we reviewed the impacts of MHWs individually and combined with ocean warming and acidification on regime shift in algal community and carbon sequestration of both macroalgae and microalgae. Solid evidence shows that MHWs cause the decline of large canopy macroalgae and increase of turf-forming macroalgae in abundance, leading to the regime shift from kelp forests to seaweed turfs. Furthermore, increased grazing pressure on kelps due to tropicalization facilitates the expansion of turfs that prevent the recovery of kelps through plundering light and space. Meanwhile, MHWs could trigger microalgal blooms and the intensity of algal blooms is regulated by the severity of MHWs and nutrient availability. MHWs could lead to the decrease of carbon burial and sequestration by canopy-forming macroalgae due to depressed growth and increased mortality. The effects of MHWs on the productivity of microalgae are latitude-dependent: negative effects at low and mid-latitudes whilst positive effects at high latitudes. Ocean warming and acidification may accelerate the shift from kelps to turfs and thus decrease the carbon sequestration by canopy-forming macroalgae further. We propose that MHWs combined with ocean warming and acidification would reduce the biodiversity and facilitate the thriving of morphologically simple, ephemeral and opportunistic turfs and diatoms in coastal oceans, and phytoplankton with smaller size in open oceans. This structure shift would not be in favor of long-term carbon sequestration. Future studies could be conducted to test this hypothesis and investigate the impacts of MHWs on carbon sequestration under future ocean conditions.</p>

AB  - Background: Dhat syndrome is a culture-bound syndrome prevailing in the Indian subcontinent, first described in the 1960s. Over time, newer studies are exploring various aspects of Dhat syndrome, including its epidemiology, nosology, clinical features, and management predominantly in South Asia. We aimed to review the epidemiology, nosology, clinical presentation, and management of Dhat syndrome over the last six decades through a systematic review of studies.
   Methods: We searched PubMed and Scopus using the following search terms - "Dhat syndrome," "Semen loss syndrome," "Semen loss anxiety' together with the Boolean operator OR. We collected the articles from inception till March 2021. We included articles in the English language published in peer-reviewed journals.
   Results: A total of 89 articles were included in the analysis. Most of the articles were published in the last decade (2011-2020). Most of the publications were cross-sectional studies and of unsatisfactory quality. Most of the studies lack representativeness of the population; hence the generalizability of the findings was poor. Most of the articles discussed phenomenology (64%), overview (52.8%), and cultural basis of Dhat syndrome. The comorbidities associated with Dhat syndrome were discussed in 37.1% of the articles. The nosological status of Dhat syndrome and management of Dhat syndrome was discussed in 18% of publications each; whereas, the outcome of Dhat syndrome was discussed in 5.6% of articles.
   Conclusion: Though Dhat syndrome is a commonly diagnosed entity in the South Asian population, the research on Dhat syndrome is sparse and of poor quality.

AB  - Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common chronic mental disorder with a high disability rate. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine, are the most common choices for the pharmacological treatment of OCD. Optimizing their use is pivotal in guiding clinical practice of OCD. However, there are few studies on the optimal dose of SRIs and there is controversy about their dose-response relationship and optimal target dose. Therefore, the objective of this study was to summarize the relationship between the dose and effect of SRIs, as well as the optimal dose of SRIs for OCD, as to propose future research directions.
   Methods: Medline, Embase, Biosis, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched for relevant publications, and the search was up to February 22, 2020. We used a one-stage, robust error meta-regression (REMR) model to deal with the correlated dose-response data for SRIs from different studies. Doses of SRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents when performing dose-response analysis. Review Manager Program Version 5.3 and STATA software package (version 15.1) were applied to analyze data. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42020168344).
   Results: Eleven studies involving 2,322 participants were included in final analysis. For SRIs, the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase trend in the 0-40-mg dose range and then had a decreased trend in doses up to 100 mg fluoxetine equivalent. Dropouts due to adverse effects gradually increased throughout the inspected dose slope. The curve of dose of all-cause dropouts suggested no relationship between them. Sensitivity analysis proved that these results were robust.
   Conclusion: The systematic review found that the optimal dose for efficacy was about 40mg fluoxetine equivalent. Tolerability decreased with increased doses, and there was no significant correlation between acceptability and doses of SRIs. Therefore, the optimal dose of SRIs needs to consider effectiveness and tolerability.

AB  - Background: As a global pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound effect on public mental health.
   Methods: Publications related to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic from December 1, 2019, to November 13, 2020, were extracted from the Web of Science database. Bibliometric indicator analysis was performed using VOSviewer 1.6.15.
   Results: In total, 1233 documents from 2020 were retrieved, of which 680 were original articles. The United States contributed the largest publication output (285, 23.1%). Huazhong University of Science and Technology published the most articles in this field (35), while Wuhan University received the most citations (1149). The United Kingdom had the strongest collaboration network. Four keyword clusters representing hotspots in this field were identified.
   Conclusions: In addition to developed countries, countries seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic also made significant contributions to mental health research during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focused on various aspects, such as mental health during isolation, mental health in healthcare workers, and public mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, countries should strengthen global cooperation and pay more attention to the mental health of vulnerable groups during pandemics.

TI  - Mindfulness training for borderline personality disorder: A systematic review of contemporary literature
KW  - DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR-THERAPY
KW  - INDIVIDUALS
AB  - Mindfulness is a component of several psychotherapies. Nonetheless, its effectiveness in borderline personality disorder (BPD) management remains obscure. This systematic review examined the effect of mindfulness training in BPD patients. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CAB Abstracts, Embase, MEDLINE and APA PsycInfo were searched until 30 June 2021. Five trials with 294 participants were included. Improvements were reported in participants' levels of impulsivity, in their emotion dysregulation patterns, in their attention skills and in their mindfulness-related capacities including decentering and nonjudging. The findings suggest that mindfulness training may be an effective tool for alleviating certain aspects of BPD symptomatology. More research is needed before definitive conclusions can be reached about the effectiveness of mindfulness training in the treatment of BPD patients, and this remains to be elucidated in larger structured clinical trials, with longer follow-ups.

AB  - Background: Despite the high prevalence of mental health disorders worldwide, a significant proportion of distressed individuals do not seek professional help. Digital technology can be a potential bridge to reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders. A systematic review was undertaken to examine the technology-based interventions aimed at improving help-seeking attitude, intention, or behavior for mental health concerns. Methods: The literature search was conducted in January-February 2020 through various e-databases using relevant keywords that targeted help-seeking interventions for mental health disorders via different technology modes. Results: 21 studies (15 randomized controlled trials and six non-randomized studies) were reviewed. The included studies were published between April 2006 to February 2020. Majority of the interventions led to an increase in the help-seeking variables. The crucial role of online delivery, participant involvement, and embedded links to professional services in encouraging help-seeking is highlighted. The review emphasizes the need for understanding utility of multicomponent interventions with personalized elements targeting help-seeking behavior, particularly in low-middle-income countries, and studies involving longer duration follow-ups. Conclusion: This systematic review is the first of its kind to examine technology-based interventions to improve help-seeking for mental health and suggests that such interventions play a crucial role in positively impacting help-seeking. The complex interplay between the relevant variables such as mental health literacy, stigma, help-seeking attitude, intention and behavior, and the intervention components that may have a differential bearing on these variables are issues that merit urgent attention in further research.

AB  - Background: The high incidence of phobias and the limited accessibility of psychotherapy are the reasons for the search for alternative treatments that increase the availability of effective treatment. The use of virtual reality (VR) technology is an option with the potential to overcome the barriers in obtaining an effective treatment. VR exposure therapy (VRET) is based on a very similar rationale for in vivo exposure therapy. The study aimed to answer the question of how to perform exposure therapy in a virtual reality environment so that it is effective.
   Methods: A systematic review of the literature, using PRISMA guidelines, was performed. After analysis of 362 records, 11 research papers on agoraphobia, 28 papers on social phobia and 10 about specific phobias were selected for this review.
   Results: VRET in agoraphobia and social phobia is effective when performed from 8 to 12 sessions, on average once a week for at least 15 min. In turn, the treatment of specific phobias is effective even in the form of one longer session, lasting 45-180 min. Head mounted displays are an effective technology for VRET. Increasing the frequency of sessions and adding drug therapy may shorten the overall treatment duration. The effectiveness of VRET in phobias is greater without concomitant psychiatric comorbidity and on the condition of inducing and maintaining in the patient an experience of immersion in the VR environment. Long-term studies show a sustained effect of VRET in the treatment of phobias.
   Conclusion: A large number of studies on in VR exposure therapy in phobias allows for the formulation of some recommendations on how to perform VRET, enabling the effective treatment. The review also indicates the directions of further VRET research in the treatment of phobias.

AB  - Purpose of the review: The study of platelets in the context of neurodegenerative diseases is intensifying, and increasing evidence suggests that platelets may play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of platelets and their diverse activation pathways in the development of these diseases. Recent findings: Platelets participate in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, and platelets activated by exercise promote neuronal differentiation in several brain regions. Platelets also contribute to the immune response by modulating their surface protein profile and releasing pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In Alzheimer's disease, increased levels of platelet amyloid precursor protein raise the production of amyloid-beta peptides promoting platelet activation, triggering at the same time amyloid-beta fibrillation. In Parkinson's disease, increased platelet alpha-synuclein is associated with elevated ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction. Summary: In this review, we revise different platelet activation pathways, those classically involved in hemostasis and wound healing, and alternative activation pathways recently described in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in the midbrain resulting in progressive impairment in cognitive and motor abilities. The physiological and molecular mechanisms triggering dopaminergic neuronal loss are not entirely defined. PD occurrence is associated with various genetic and environmental factors causing inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain, leading to oxidative stress, proteinopathy, and reduced viability of dopaminergic neurons. Oxidative stress affects the conformation and function of ions, proteins, and lipids, provoking mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation and dysfunction. The disruption of protein homeostasis induces the aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN) and parkin and a deficit in proteasome degradation. Also, oxidative stress affects dopamine release by activating ATP-sensitive potassium channels. The cholinergic system is essential in modulating the striatal cells regulating cognitive and motor functions. Several muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are expressed in the striatum. The nAChRs signaling reduces neuroinflammation and facilitates neuronal survival, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic plasticity. Since there is a deficit in the nAChRs in PD, inhibiting nAChRs loss in the striatum may help prevent dopaminergic neurons loss in the striatum and its pathological consequences. The nAChRs can also stimulate other brain cells supporting cognitive and motor functions. This review discusses the cholinergic system as a therapeutic target of cotinine to prevent cognitive symptoms and transition to dementia in PD.</p>

AB  - Background: Personality disorders (PDs) are a severe health issue already prevalent among adolescents and young adults. Early detection and intervention offer the opportunity to reduce disease burden and chronicity of symptoms and to enhance long-term functional outcomes. While psychological treatments for PDs have been shown to be effective for young people, the mediators and specific change mechanisms of treatment are still unclear.
   Aim: As part of the "European Network of Individualized Psychotherapy Treatment of Young People with Mental Disorders" (TREATme), funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST), we will conduct a systematic review to summarize the existing knowledge on mediators of treatment outcome and theories of change in psychotherapy for young people with personality disorders. In particular, we will evaluate whether mediators appear to be common or specific to particular age groups, treatment models, or outcome domains (e.g., psychosocial functioning, life quality, and adverse treatment effects).
   Method: We will follow the reporting guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement recommendations. Electronic databases (PubMed and PsycINFO) have been systematically searched for prospective, longitudinal, and case-control designs of psychological treatment studies, which examine mediators published in English. Participants will be young people between 10 and 30years of age who suffer from subclinical personality symptoms or have a personality disorder diagnosis and receive an intervention that aims at preventing, ameliorating, and/or treating psychological problems.
   Results: The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and at conference presentations and will be shared with relevant stakeholder groups. The data set will be made available to other research groups following recommendations of the open science initiative. Databases with the systematic search will be made openly available following open science initiatives. The review has been registered in PROSPERO (evaluation is pending, registration number ID 248959).
   Implications: This review will deliver a comprehensive overview on the empirical basis to contribute to the further development of psychological treatments for young people with personality disorders.

AB  - Ten years of the Syrian war had a devastating effect on Syrian lives, including millions of refugees and displaced people, enormous destruction in the infrastructure, and the worst economic crisis Syria has ever faced. The health sector was hit hard by this war, up to 50% of the health facilities have been destroyed and up to 70% of the healthcare providers fled the country seeking safety, which increased the workload and mental pressure for the remaining medical staff. Five databases were searched and 438 articles were included according to the inclusion criteria, the articles were divided into categories according to the topic of the article. Through this review, the current health status of the Syrian population living inside Syria, whether under governmental or opposition control, was reviewed, and also, the health status of the Syrian refugees was examined according to each host country. Public health indicators were used to summarize and categorize the information. This research reviewed mental health, children and maternal health, oral health, non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases, occupational health, and the effect of the COVID - 19 pandemic on the Syrian healthcare system. The results of the review are irritating, as still after ten years of war and millions of refugees there is an enormous need for healthcare services, and international organization has failed to respond to those needs. The review ended with the current and future challenges facing the healthcare system, and suggestions about rebuilding the healthcare system. Through this review, the major consequences of the Syrian war on the health of the Syrian population have been reviewed and highlighted. Considerable challenges will face the future of health in Syria which require the collaboration of the health authorities to respond to the growing needs of the Syrian population. This article draws an overview about how the Syrian war affected health sector for Syrian population inside and outside Syria after ten years of war which makes it an important reference for future researchers to get the main highlight of the health sector during the Syrian crisis.

AB  - BACKGROUND The metacognitive model of generalized anxiety disorder identifies three forms of metacognition: Positive metacognitive beliefs about worry (POS), negative metacognitive beliefs about worry (NEG), and meta-worry. Though this model was originally developed relying on adult samples, it has since been applied to children and youth in different studies, and results mostly support its validity for this group. As the roles of POS, meta-worry, and age-effects do not appear to be fully clarified for children and adolescents yet, an integration of studies on children and adolescents and the metacognitive model is both timely and worthwhile. AIM To summarize the current research on relationships, age-effects, and measurements for POS, NEG, and meta-worry in childhood and youth. METHODS We carried out a literature search in the electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, PSYNDEX, and ERIC in 2017 and updated in 2020. Empirical research in German or English language on metacognition was included with child and adolescent samples diagnosed with anxiety disorders or healthy controls if POS, NEG, or meta-worry were measured. Studies were included for meta-analysis if they reported correlations between these metacognitions and anxiety or worry. Consensus rating for eligibility was done for 20.89% of full-texts with 90.32% agreement. Risk of bias was assessed with the appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies and consensus rating of appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies for 20.83% of included studies attaining agreement of intraclass correlation = 0.898. Overall, correlations between metacognitions, anxiety and worry were calculated with RevMan 5.4.1, assuming random-effects models. Meta-regressions with mean age as the covariate were performed via the online tool MetaMar 2.7.0. PROSPERO-ID: CRD42018078852. RESULTS Overall, k = 763 records and k = 78 additional records were identified. Of those, k = 48 studies with 12839 participants were included and of those, k = 24 studies were included for meta-analysis. Most studies showed consistent NEG correlations with worry and anxiety, as well as higher values for clinical than for non-clinical samples. POS findings were less consistent. Meta-analysis revealed large effects for NEG correlating with worry and anxiety, small to medium effects for POS correlating with worry and anxiety, as well as small to medium effects for POS correlating with NEG. Meta-regressions did not reveal mean age as a significant covariate. Meta-worry was assessed in only one study. We identified eight questionnaires and one interview-format that assess metacognition about worry in children and adolescents. CONCLUSION POS and NEG are measurable from the age of seven upwards and correlate with anxiety and worry without influences by age. Meta-worry requires further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND Twenty years after its first use in a patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the results confirm that deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapy for patients with severe and resistant forms of the disorder. Nevertheless, many unknowns remain, including the optimal anatomical targets, the best stimulation parameters, the long-term (LT) effects of the therapy, and the clinical or biological factors associated with response. This systematic review of the articles published to date on DBS for OCD assesses the short and LT efficacy of the therapy and seeks to identify predictors of response. AIM To summarize the existing knowledge on the efficacy and tolerability of DBS in treatment-resistant OCD. METHODS A comprehensive search was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to December 31, 2020, using the following strategy: "(Obsessive-compulsive disorder OR OCD) AND (deep brain stimulation OR DBS)." Clinical trials and observational studies published in English and evaluating the effectiveness of DBS for OCD in humans were included and screened for relevant information using a standardized collection tool. The inclusion criteria were as follows: a main diagnosis of OCD, DBS conducted for therapeutic purposes and variation in symptoms of OCD measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) as primary outcome. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS Forty articles identified by the search strategy met the eligibility criteria. Applying a follow-up threshold of 36 mo, 29 studies (with 230 patients) provided information on short-term (ST) response to DBS in, while 11 (with 155 patients) reported results on LT response. Mean follow-up period was 18.5 +/- 8.0 mo for the ST studies and 63.7 +/- 20.7 mo for the LT studies. Overall, the percentage of reduction in Y-BOCS scores was similar in ST (47.4%) and LT responses (47.2%) to DBS, but more patients in the LT reports met the criteria for response (defined as a reduction in Y-BOCS scores > 35%: ST, 60.6% vs LT, 70.7%). According to the results, the response in the first year predicts the extent to which an OCD patient will benefit from DBS, since the maximum symptom reduction was achieved in most responders in the first 12-14 mo after implantation. Reports indicate a consistent tendency for this early improvement to be maintained to the mid-term for most patients; but it is still controversial whether this improvement persists, increases or decreases in the long term. Three different patterns of LT response emerged from the analysis: 49.5% of patients had good and sustained response to DBS, 26.6% were non responders, and 22.5% were partial responders, who might improve at some point but experience relapses during follow-up. A significant improvement in depressive symptoms and global functionality was observed in most studies, usually (although not always) in parallel with an improvement in obsessive symptoms. Most adverse effects of DBS were mild and transient and improved after adjusting stimulation parameters; however, some severe adverse events including intracranial hemorrhages and infections were also described. Hypomania was the most frequently reported psychiatric side effect. The relationship between DBS and suicide risk is still controversial and requires further study.
   Finally, to date, no clear clinical or biological predictors of response can be established, probably because of the differences between studies in terms of the neuroanatomical targets and stimulation protocols assessed.
   CONCLUSION The present review confirms that DBS is a promising therapy for patients with severe resistant OCD, providing both ST and LT evidence of efficacy.

AB  - The development of effective and environmentally friendly methods for the green synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs) is a critical stage in the field of nanotechnology. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are significant due to their unique physical, chemical, and biological properties, as well as their numerous applications. Physical, chemical, and green synthesis approaches can all be used to produce AgNPs; however, synthesis using biological precursors, particularly plant-based green synthesis, has shown outstanding results. In recent years, owing to a combination of frequent droughts, unusual rainfall, salt-affected areas, and high temperatures, climate change has changed several ecosystems. Crop yields have decreased globally as a result of these changes in the environment. Green synthesized AgNPs role in boosting antioxidant defense mechanisms, methylglyoxal (MG) detoxification, and developing tolerance for abiotic stress induced oxidative damage has been thoroughly described in plant species over the last decade. Although various studies on abiotic stress tolerance and metallic nanoparticles (NPs) in plants have been conducted, but the details of AgNPs mediated abiotic stress tolerance have not been well summarized. Therefore, the plant responses to abiotic stress need to be well understood and to apply the gained knowledge to increase stress tolerance by using AgNPs for crop plants. In this review, we outlined the green synthesis of AgNPs extracted from plant extract. We also have updates on the most important accomplishments through exogenous application of AgNPs to improve plant tolerance to drought, salinity, low and high-temperature stresses.

AB  - Background Awareness of the cumulative stress placed on first responders and tactical operators is required to manage acute fatigue, which can impair occupational performance, and may precipitate negative chronic health outcomes. The aim of this review was to investigate the utility of heart rate variability (HRV) to monitor stress and allostatic load among these populations. Methods A systematic search of Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE complete, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Scopus databases was conducted. Eligibility criteria: original peer reviewed research articles, written in English, published between 1985 and 2020, using human participants employed as a first responder or tactical operator, free from any psychological disorder. Results Of the 360 articles screened, 60 met the inclusion criteria and were included for full text assessment. Articles were classified based on single or repeated stressor exposure and the time of HRV assessment (baseline, during stressor, post stressor). Singular stressful events elicited a reduction in HRV from baseline to during the event. Stressors of greater magnitude reduced HRV for extended durations post stressor. Lower resting HRV was associated with lower situational awareness and impaired decision-making performance in marksmanship and navigation tasks. There were insufficient studies to evaluate the utility of HRV to assess allostatic load in repeated stressor contexts. Conclusion A reduction in HRV occurred in response to acute physical and cognitive occupational stressors. A slower rate of recovery of HRV after the completion of acute occupational stressors appears to occur in response to stressors of greater magnitude. The association between lower HRV and lower decision-making performance poses as a useful tool but further investigations on within subject changes between these factors and their relationship is required. More research is required to investigate the suitability of HRV as a measure of allostatic load in repeated stress exposures for fatigue management in first responder and tactical operators.

AB  - Introduction Meta-analytic reviews suggest similar outcomes across trauma-focused psychotherapies for adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, this conclusion may be premature due to suboptimal statistical-review methodologies. Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows a detailed rank-ordering of the efficacy of established psychotherapy interventions derived from indirect evidence as well as results from direct head-to-head comparisons. Objective We sought to determine the efficacy and attrition rates of psychotherapy interventions for PTSD by applying NMA. Methods We searched EMBASE, PsychINFO, PTSDPubs and PubMed for randomised controlled trials that compared psychotherapies either head-to-head or against controls for adults with PTSD. A frequentist NMA was used to compare direct and indirect effects to determine the efficacy and attrition rates of psychotherapy interventions. Results Of the 5649 papers identified, 82 trials comprising of 5838 patients were included. The network comprised 17 psychotherapies and four control conditions. Network estimates indicated superior efficacy of meta-cognitive therapy and cognitive processing therapy over other psychotherapies (ESs between = 0.26 and 2.32). Written exposure therapy and narrative exposure therapy were associated with lower risk of drop out when considered alongside other psychotherapies. Confidence in the network meta-analytic estimates was considered moderate for both outcomes. Conclusions In broad terms, therapeutic commensurability was evident. Nevertheless, with additional studies and larger sample sizes, meta-cognitive and written exposure therapies could indeed differentiate themselves from other approaches as having favourable efficacy and acceptability respectively. These findings may inform clinical decision-making, as well as guide future research for PTSD.

AB  - Salinity is one of the major causes of abiotic stress that leads to a reduction in crop yield. One strategy to alleviate and improve crop yield is to use halophytes. These types of plants naturally produce bioactive secondary metabolites, proteins, carbohydrates, and biopolymers that are involved in specialized physiological adaptation mechanisms to alleviate soil salinity. These traits could be leveraged and, in turn, be the focus of future breeding programs aimed to improve salinity resistance in traditional crops. Recently, the field of nanotechnology has gained the attention of researchers involved in agricultural science and associated disciplines. However, information on salinity tolerance mechanisms of halophytes, based on nanoparticles in agricultural crop plants, is limited. Recently, the use of selected halophytic-based nanoparticles has shown to improve crop performance by enhancing the plants' ion flux, improving water efficiency, root hydraulic movement in the favor of plant photosynthesis, the production of proteins involved in oxidation-reduction reactions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, and hormonal signaling pathways under stress. Therefore, the aim of this review is to highlight the application of halophytic nanoparticles in alleviating salt stress in plants by understanding the mechanisms of plant growth, water relation, ion flux, photosynthesis, and the antioxidant defense system. This review also addresses uncertainties, ecotoxicological concerns, and associated drawbacks of nanoparticles on the environment. Future research perspectives with respect to the sustainable usage of nanoparticles in saline agriculture have also been presented.

KW  - Co-production
KW  - Mental health
KW  - Recovery
KW  - Personal and public involvement
KW  - Recovery colleges
KW  - PUBLIC-SERVICES
AB  - Purpose "Co-production" is a process in health and social care wherein service users and practitioners work in partnership. Recovery colleges (RCs) are educational establishments offering mental health education; a cornerstone feature is that courses are designed and delivered in parity by both mental health practitioners and "peers" - people with lived experience of mental illness. This paper aims to consider, through the identification of key themes, whether co-production within RCs is operating successfully. Design/methodology/approach The paper is a systematic review of qualitative literature. Relevant concept groups were systematically searched using three bibliographic databases: Medline, Social Care Online and Scopus. Articles were quality appraised and then synthesised through inductive thematic analysis and emergent trends identified. Findings Synthesis identified three key themes relating to the impact of co-production in RCs: practitioner attitudes, power dynamics between practitioners and service users, and RCs' relationships with their host organisations. As a result of RC engagement, traditional practitioner/patient hierarchies were found to be eroding. Practitioners felt they were more person-centred. RCs can model good co-productive practices to their host organisations. The review concluded, with some caveats, that RC co-production was of high fidelity. Originality/value RC research is growing, but the body of evidence remains relatively small. Most of what exists examine the impact of RCs on individuals' overall recovery and mental health; there is a limited empirical investigation into whether their flagship feature of parity between peers and practitioners is genuine.

AB  - Background: Suicidality is common in major depressive disorder (MDD), but there has been no systematic review published about all aspects of suicidality. This meta-analysis and systematic review compared the prevalence of the whole range of suicidality comprising suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plan (SP), suicide attempt (SA), and completed suicide (CS), between patients with MDD and non-MDD controls.Methods: Major international (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE) and Chinese (Chinese Nation Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG) databases were systematically and independently searched from their inception until January 12, 2021.Results: Fifteen studies covering 85,768 patients (12,668 in the MDD group and 73,100 in the non-MDD group) were included in the analyses. Compared to non-MDD controls, the odds ratios (ORs) for lifetime, past month, past year, and 2-week prevalence of SI in MDD were 2.88 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.30-27.22, p = 0.36], 49.88 (95% CI = 2-8.63, p < 0.001), 13.97 (95% CI = 12.67-15.41, p < 0.001), and 24.81 (95% CI = 15.70-39.22, p < 0.001), respectively. Compared to non-MDD controls, the OR for lifetime SP in MDD was 9.51 (95% CI = 7.62-11.88, p < 0.001). Compared to non-MDD controls, the ORs of lifetime and past-year prevalence of SA were 3.45 (95% CI = 1.58-7.52, p = 0.002), and 7.34 (95% CI = 2.14-25.16, p = 0.002), respectively, in MDD patients. No difference in the prevalence of CS between MDD and controls was found (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.23-2.02, p = 0.50).Conclusions: MDD patients are at a higher risk of suicidality, compared to non-MDD controls. Routine screening for a range of suicidality should be included in the management of MDD, followed by timely treatment for suicidal patients.Systematic Review Registration: Identifier [INPLASY202120078].

AB  - Background: Several studies have found an association between elevated neutrophil count or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood from patients with schizophrenia. The etiology behind this effect is unknown, and it is unclear if changes in neutrophil count and NLR may be induced by antipsychotics or if these parameters relate to the diagnosis and symptoms of schizophrenia. The purpose of this scoping review was to map research that explores this association, and to identify gaps in the current knowledge base.<br>Method: The work was conducted in accordance with established methodological standards for scoping reviews. Studies on neutrophil count and NLR in schizophrenia were identified through search in relevant databases, and a parallel screening procedure was performed to ensure validity and reproducibility of the search. Articles that included different comparison groups, with differences in medication status (drug-naive or drug-free vs. medicated), current disease state (relapse vs. remission), or treatment response, were included, as well as studies evaluating the association between symptomatology and neutrophil count or NLR.<br>Results: The available literature was limited with substantial differences in aims, methods, and outcomes. In total, 13 articles were included for the synthesis of this review. Some interesting trends were identified: Neutrophil count and NLR seem to be elevated in schizophrenia patients regardless of current or past use of antipsychotic therapy. Neutrophil count and NLR correlated significantly with positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Still, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to considerable methodological differences and weaknesses in the literature, particularly concerning the blood sampling procedure.<br>Conclusion: By including longitudinal studies and by comparing patient groups based on medication status, disease state and response, our study provides a basis for dissecting the associations between increased neutrophil count or NLR and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Further research should investigate and quantify the apparent strong correlation between neutrophil count or NLR and positive symptoms in schizophrenia, to evaluate its clinical potential to guide diagnostics, treatment, or as a predictor of outcome. This review also exposes important methodological weaknesses in the literature on neutrophil count and NLR measurements. Standardization of blood sampling and processing is crucial to reduce bias, and factors that are known to influence leukocyte levels need to be accounted for.

AB  - Background There is a growing body of research focused on autistic individuals who present with aggressive behaviour. Aggressive behaviour has been found to occur more frequently in autism compared with other developmental disabilities or the general population. The most common types of aggressive behaviours are self-injurious behaviours, aggression towards others and the destruction of property. Aggressive behaviour can threaten access to support services and education. Many types of stigma are experienced by parents as a result of their child's diagnosis or observed aggressive behaviour (e.g. ignorance, prejudice and discrimination). The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise the current research into the experience of stigma by parents of autistic children who display aggressive behaviour. The specific question addressed by this review was 'Do parents of autistic children with aggressive behaviours experience stigma?'. This review found that stigma is experienced in many forms and contributes to higher levels of stress and poorer quality of life for these families than for the general population and other disabilities. Methods The published English-language literature was examined using multiple online databases, grey literature and hand searches. The review was conducted and reported using PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating family members of children with a diagnosis of autism who exhibited aggressive behaviour were included. An additional criterion was that the participants had experienced some form of stigma because of their child's autism and/or aggressive behaviour. All studies that met the criteria were critically appraised. No limits were applied for date of publication up until February 6, 2019. Results Total search results yielded 5707 records. Of these, nine studies were identified and reviewed. Two were identified as mixed method designs and the remaining seven were qualitative designs. Despite diverse research methods, research questions, interview guides, a large variation in age range and year of publication, the stigma associated with caring for an autistic child with aggressive behaviour was consistently identified. Conclusions Taken together, the available research literature suggests that autistic people and their families experience high levels of stigma. For parents of autistic children who behave aggressively, stigma is even more prominent and invasive. This systematic review can conclude that this triad of autism, aggression and stigma is not well understood and is under-investigated.

AB  - This paper offers a critical analysis of the arsenic-accumulating, transforming bacteria and their potential use and effect in remediating agricultural soil. Given the worldwide presence, sources, types, and pathways of arsenic, accumulating, and transforming bacteria, and the effect of arsenic contamination on plant and agricultural soil were studied. Diverse published studies have emphasized arsenic characteristics and effects on soil. In this study, we emphasized the biochemical process and the bioremediation mechanism of arsenic contamination. The method used to isolate and identify arsenic-resistant bacteria was also described. This paper provided an overview of the information about the contamination of arsenic, the effect of its accumulation in agricultural fields, and which bacteria are used to metabolize arsenic in soil. Various types of microbes, including Exiguobacterium, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Escherichia, and Acinetobacter, metabolize the activity of inorganic arsenic to generate their energy. The bacterial ars operon consists of three to five genes that are located in plasmids. These genes are involved in oxidation, reduction, methylation, or demethylation in the arsenic transformation process in bioremediation. For example, in arsenic (V) reduction, two microbial pathways known are the detoxification pathway arsC genes negotiate and the respiratory pathway arsA genes negotiate. Further, this paper demonstrates briefly the sources of arsenic contamination and its effect on plants and soils. It has been found that certain microbes' genes facilitate the reduction and oxidization in arsenic toxicity and have some bioremediation capacity to reduce and immobilize the arsenic contamination in agricultural soil.

AB  - The emergent respect for the prominence of engagement in the present education has made it one of the most widespread inquiry issues that it has been regarded as the ultimate target of learning. In the language teaching field, the idea of student activities for learning is intensely rooted in the prevailing standards of effective language learning, which considers language communication and interaction as analytical for language improvement. Moreover, teachers as center of learning process is the most prominent research attention, and teachers play a key role in regulating the education process as well as students' learning achievement. However, there is an absence of research which have considered teachers' care and praise among all positive interpersonal behavior and its significant effect on students' engagement. So, the present review attempts to focus on teacher care and praise, and their effects on student engagement in EFL classrooms. Subsequently, some implications are presented to clarify the practice of teachers, students, teacher educators, and materials developers.

AB  - Introduction: Despite respiratory disease being a major cause of excess mortality in people with schizophrenia, the prevalence of respiratory conditions in this population is poorly defined. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to establish the prevalence and association of respiratory diseases in people with schizophrenia. Material and methods: Major electronic databases were searched from inception to 27 April 2020 for articles reporting respiratory disease (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], pneumonia, and tuberculosis) in people with schizophrenia and, where possible, a control group. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018115137). Results: Of 1569 citations, 21 studies consisting of 619,214 individuals with schizophrenia and 52,159,551 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia had significantly higher rates of COPD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.28-2.57), asthma (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.02-2.83), and pneumonia (OR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.10-6.23). In people with schizophrenia, the prevalence of COPD was 7.7% (95% CI: 4.0-14.4), asthma 7.5% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3), pneumonia 10.3% (95% CI 5.4-18.6), and tuberculosis 0.3% (95% CI 0.1 -0.8). After adjusting for publication bias, the prevalence of COPD increased to 19.9% (95% CI: 9.6-36.7). Discussion: All respiratory diseases examined were significantly more prevalent in people with schizophrenia compared with the general population. Future studies should focus on improving the prevention and management of respiratory disease in this group to reduce associated excess mortality.

AB  - Despite the growing relevance and applicability of elements based on and derived from the embodied mind paradigm, body psychotherapy (BPT) appears not to be a well-established treatment option. This might be due to a lack of proof for its efficacy. We searched electronic databases (Pubmed MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and PSYNDEX) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining predefined BPT interventions. A total of 2,180 references were screened, of which 113 studies were scrutinized in detail and 18 RCTs finally included. The observed effect size (ES) demonstrated medium effects of BPT on primary outcomes psychopathology and psychological distress. In case of significant statistical heterogeneity, exploratory subgroup analyses revealed diagnosis and the degree of control group activity as noteworthy moderators. For secondary outcomes, evidence was scarce, and an improvement could be demonstrated only for coping abilities. The identified evidence indicates that BPT is beneficial for a wide spectrum of psychic suffering. There is a strong need for high-quality studies with bigger samples and for well-defined diagnostic entities to underpin its effectiveness.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial global public health problem in need of novel and effective treatment strategies. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive and promising treatment for depression that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the methodological weaknesses of existing work impairs the universal clinical use of rTMS. The variation of stimulated targets across the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may account for most of the heterogeneity in the efficacy of rTMS. Many rTMS target location methods for MDD have been developed in recent decades. This review was conducted to assess this emerging field and to improve treatment outcomes in clinical practice.

AB  - Several drugs previously tested in clinical trials and approved for different indications have been repurposed for bipolar disorder. We carried out a systematic meta-review of meta-analyses of randomized placebo-controlled trials investigating repurposed drugs as adjunctive treatments for mania and bipolar depression. We performed a critical appraisal using 'A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews' Version 2 (AMSTAR 2). We synthesized results on efficacy, tolerability, and safety, assessing evidence quality according to the 'Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations' (GRADE) approach. Our systematic search identified nine eligible studies investigating 12 drugs, four for mania and eight for bipolar depression. The quality of reporting was heterogeneous according to AMSTAR 2. In mania, allopurinol (for symptoms reduction and remission at 4-8 weeks) and tamoxifen (for response and symptoms reduction at 4-6 weeks) showed higher efficacy than placebo, with low and very low quality of evidence, respectively. Concerning bipolar depression, modafinil/armodafinil (for response, remission, and symptoms reduction at 6-8 weeks) and pramipexole (for response and symptoms reduction at 6 weeks) were superior to placebo, despite the low quality of evidence. Results on the efficacy of celecoxib and N-acetylcysteine were of low quality and limited to certain outcomes. Overall, the lack of evidence of high and moderate quality does not allow us to draw firm conclusions on the clinical utility of repurposed drugs as adjunctive treatments for mania and bipolar depression, highlighting the need for additional research.

AB  - Background: Promoting work engagement is of interest to organizations across sectors due to the associated positive outcomes. This interest warrants research on the evidence of work engagement interventions. Intervention research increasingly advocates a bottom-up approach, highlighting the role of employees themselves. These workplace interventions often encourage employees to identify, develop, and make use of workplace resources. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the effectiveness and potential underlying mechanisms of these bottom-up, resource-developing interventions.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Method: Systematic searches were conducted in the online databases Web of Science, Academic Search Complete, Business Source Ultimate, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar. Publication year range was 2000-2020. Eligibility criteria were defined using PICOS. To be eligible for the systematic review, the intervention study identified had to aim at promoting working individuals' work engagement by developing workplace resources from bottom-up. Work engagement had to be measured using the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale. The systematic review included one-, two-, or multiple-armed - randomized or non-randomized - intervention studies with various study designs. Further, a meta-analysis was conducted on a sub-set of the studies included in the systematic review. To be eligible for the meta-analysis, the studies had to be two- or multiple-armed and provide the information necessary to compute effect sizes.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Results: Thirty-one studies were included in the systematic review. The majority reported that overall work engagement increased as an effect of the intervention. The evidence regarding the sub-components of work engagement was scattered. Potential underlying mechanisms explored were intervention foci, approach, and format. Dimensions of satisfaction and performance were identified as secondary outcomes. Participant experiences were generally described as positive in most of the studies applying mixed methods. The meta-analysis showed a small but promising intervention effect on work engagement (24 studies, SMD: -0.22, 95% CI: -0.34 to -0.11, with I-2=53%, indicating moderate inconsistency in the evidence).</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Conclusion: The synthesized evidence suggests that bottom-up, resource-developing interventions are effective in the promotion of work engagement. The meta-analysis suggests that focusing on strengths use or mobilizing ego resources and adopting a universal approach increase intervention effectiveness.</p>

AB  - An update on systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to explore effects of phthalate exposure on insulin resistance. A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CNKI until March 2021. A conceptual framework was constructed to guide the organization and presentation of results. Besides, beta coefficients with corresponding confidence intervals were extracted from the most adjusted models. Extracted beta coefficients were transformed into correlation, and z Fisher transformation of correlation with the corresponding standard error was included in meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed by age (adult vs. adolescent) and sex (female vs. male) of participants and site of study (America and Europe vs. Asia) to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. Nineteen literatures with 12,533 participants reporting on the association of exposure to specific phthalates and insulin resistance were selected. The majority of included studies revealed positive relationships of insulin resistance with different phthalate metabolites exposure. Meta-analyses were performed on 16 studies. Exposure to MnBP, MBzP, MCPP, MEHP, MEOHP, MEHHP, n-ary sumation DEHP, and high-molecular weight phthalate ( n-ary sumation HMWP) was associated with the increase of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. The results of sensitivity analyses stratified by age, sex, and site of study remained stable, suggesting the robustness of these meta-analyses. Most of heterogeneity in sensitivity analyses decreased to moderate or low degree. Exposure to MnBP, MBzP, MCPP, MEHP, MEOHP, MEHHP, n-ary sumation DEHP, and n-ary sumation HMWP was associated with the increased risk of HOMA-IR. Age, sex, and site of study might provide limited source of heterogeneity.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among people with psychosis and may play a role in the aetiology of psychotic disorders. However, its impact on clinical symptom severity has not been independently reviewed. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of randomized trials and observational studies that assessed the relationship between vitamin D and symptom domains (positive and negative psychotic symptoms, total and general psychopathology, cognitive and depressive) in people with a psychotic disorder. Results: 1040 articles were identified, of which 29 were eligible for inclusion: 26 observational studies and 3 randomized trials. Five studies included people with First-Episode Psychosis (FEP) and 24 included people with enduring psychosis. Most observational studies found that vitamin D was inversely associated with negative symptoms (57%; 13/23), positively associated with cognitive performance (63%; 5/8), and bore no association with positive symptoms (68%; 15/22), total psychopathology (64%; 7/11), general psychopathology (57%; 4/7) or depressive symptoms (64%; 9/14). Randomized controlled trials indicated that vitamin D supplementation improved cognitive performance (100%; 1/1) and, in some cases, reduced total psychopathology (50%; 1/2), general psychopathology (50%; 1/2) and negative symptoms (30%; 1/3), but had no effect on positive (100%; 3/ 3) or depressive (100%; 3/3) symptoms. Some positive associations were attenuated when controlled for potential confounders. Conclusion: Low vitamin D was found to be inversely associated with more severe clinical symptoms in some, but not all symptom domains in people with psychosis. These preliminary findings warrant further exploration, particularly in regard to cognitive performance and negative symptoms.

AB  - Background Patients with mental disorders have an increased risk of developing somatic disorders, just as they have a higher risk of dying from them. These patients often report feeling devaluated and rejected by health professionals in the somatic health care system, and increasing evidence shows that disparities in health care provision contribute to poor health outcomes. The aim of this review was to map and synthesize literature on somatic health professionals' stigmatization toward patients with mental disorders. Methods We conducted a scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley's framework and carried out a systematic search in three databases: Cinahl, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO in May-June 2019. Peer-reviewed articles published in English or Scandinavian languages during 2008-2019 were reviewed according to title, abstract and full-text reading. We organized and analyzed data using NVivo. Results A total of 137 articles meeting the eligibility criteria were reviewed and categorized as observational studies (n = 73) and intervention studies (n = 64). A majority of studies (N = 85) focused on patients with an unspecified number of mental disorders, while 52 studies focused on specific diagnoses, primarily schizophrenia (n = 13), self-harm (n = 13), and eating disorders (n = 9). Half of the studies focused on health students (n = 64), primarily nursing students (n = 26) and medical students (n = 25), while (n = 66) focused on health care professionals, primarily emergency staff (n = 16) and general practitioners (n = 13). Additionally, seven studies focused on both health professionals and students. A detailed characterization of the identified intervention studies was conducted, resulting in eight main types of interventions. Conclusions The large number of studies identified in this review suggests that stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors toward patients with mental disorders is a worldwide challenge within a somatic health care setting. For more targeted interventions, there is a need for further research on underexposed mental diagnoses and knowledge on whether specific health professionals have a more stigmatizing attitude or behavior toward specific mental disorders.

AB  - Congenital anomalies are the main causes of infant death and disability. Previous studies have suggested that maternal exposure to particulate matter is related to congenital malformation. However, the conclusions of this study remain controversial. Hence, meta-analyses were performed to assess the relationship between maternal exposure to particulate matter and the risk of congenital anomalies. The Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systemically searched from inception until August 2020 to find articles related to birth defects and particulate matter. The pooled risk estimated for the combination of pollution outcomes was calculated for each study by performing fixed effects or random effects models. The existence of heterogeneity and publication bias in relevant studies was also examined. Thirty studies were included in the analysis. A statistically increased summary risk valuation was found. PM10 exposure was associated with an increased risk of congenital heart disease, neural tube defects, and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (OR per 10 mu g/m(3) = 1.05, 95% CI, 1.03-1.07; OR per 10 mu g/m(3) = 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; OR per 10 mu g/m(3) = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.01-1.06). Maternal exposure to particulate matter might be associated with an increased risk of congenital anomalies. Our results indicate the dangers of particulate matter exposure on fetal development and the importance of protection against exposure to such particles during pregnancy.

AB  - Background Refugees often face psychosocial complexity and multi-dimensional healthcare needs. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methods have been previously employed in designing health programs for refugee communities and in building strong research partnerships in refugee communities. However, the extent to which these communities are involved remains unknown. Objective To review the evidence on the involvement of refugees in CBPR processes to inform healthcare research. Methods A scoping review was performed, using Arksey & O'Malley's methodological framework. A literature search in Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, and Policy File Index for articles published until August 2020 was conducted. Articles were included if they focused on CBPR, had refugee involvement, and discussed healthcare/health policy. Results 4125 articles were identified in the database searches. After removal of duplicates, 2077 articles underwent title and abstract review by two authors, yielding an inter-reviewer kappa-statistic of 0.85. 14 studies were included in the final analysis. The purpose of CBPR use for 6 (42.9%) of the articles was developing and implementing mental health/social support interventions, 5 (35.7%) focused on sexual and reproductive health interventions, 1 (7.1%) focused on domestic violence interventions, 1 (7.1%) focused on cardiovascular disease prevention and 1 (7.1%) focused on parenting interventions. In terms of refugee involvement in the various stages in the research process, 9 (64.3%) articles reported refugees having a role in the inception of the research, no articles reported including refugees in obtaining funding, all articles included refugees in the design of the research study, 10 (71.4%) articles reported having refugees involved in community engagement/recruitment, 8 (57.1%) articles reported involvement throughout the data collection process, 4 (28.6%) articles reported involvement in data analysis, 6 (42.9%) articles reported having refugees involved in knowledge translation/dissemination and 1 article (7.1%) reported having refugees contribute to scale up initiatives. Conclusions CBPR has been identified as a methodology with the potential to make substantial contributions to improving health and well-being in traditionally disenfranchised populations. As the needs of refugee communities are so diverse, efforts should be made to include refugees as partners in all stages of the research process.

AB  - Pollution is a major worldwide problem that is increasing with urban growth, mainly along coastal areas. Pollution is often worse, governance is poorer and managerial strategies to improve environmental quality are less advanced in developing than developed countries. Here, we present an overview of the current scientific knowledge of the impacts of contamination on the biota of coastal ecosystems of Brazil and evaluate the scientific challenges to provide baseline information for local managerial purposes. We compiled data from 323 peerreviewed published papers from the extensive Brazilian coast. We critically evaluated the produced knowledge (target contaminants, sources, ecosystems, taxa, response variables) and the science behind it (rigour and setting) within its socioenvironmental context (land occupation, use of the coast, sanitation status, contamination history). Research was driven largely by environmental outcomes of industrial development with a focus on the single effects of metals on the biota. The current knowledge derives mainly from laboratory manipulative experiments or from correlative field studies of changes in the biota with varying levels of contamination. Of these, 70% had problems in their experimental design. Environmental impacts have mainly been assessed using standard indicators of populations, mostly in ecotoxicological studies. Benthic assemblages have mostly been studied using structural indicators in field studies. Future assessments of impacts should expand research to more taxonomic groups and ecosystem compartments, adding combined functional and structural responses. Furthermore, further investigations need to consider the interactive effects of contaminants and other environmental stressors. By doing so, researchers would deliver more robust and effective results to solve problems of pollution. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - While first-episode schizophrenia has received extensive attention in the literature, few studies have focused on the first episode of affective psychoses. Considering the lack of structured data regarding this diagnostic grouping commonly used in clinical settings, our aim was to scope the literature on first-episode affective psychoses to consolidate current knowledge and to identify areas to be targeted in future studies. We also planned to investigate the relevance of the "affective psychosis" concept regarding diagnostic categories and specific needs of intervention. We conducted a search on the Embase, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO and Web Of Science databases until October 2020. We selected studies and synthesized the key findings into a narrative review regarding major topics of early intervention research: diagnostic categorization, premorbid factors, intervention, duration of untreated illness, neurobiology and neurocognition. After screening 961 titles and abstracts and 193 full-text papers, we selected 77 studies for inclusion. Our results showed heterogeneity in diagnosis-related grouping under the concept of affective psychoses, especially variability regarding the inclusion of schizoaffective disorder. Nonetheless, this concept still encompasses patients with different psychopathological and neurocognitive profiles from the non-affective patients requiring specialized intervention. This study thus provided support for the relevance of this concept as well as a need for further investigation.

AB  - The association between maternal sensitivity and attachment security has long been established among normative samples. However, less is known about how this association operates among children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This meta-analytic review is the first to address the association between maternal sensitivity/availability and attachment security in a population of children with ASD (aged 1 to 7 years) and to explore if this association is moderated by child chronological age, mental age, ASD-related symptoms severity. The objective was also to assess the role of methodological moderators, including the informant of the attachment measure, country and publication year. A systematic search was performed on relevant databases. Seven studies were retained. Meta-analytic results showed a significant medium effect size between maternal sensitivity/availability and attachment security in children with ASD (r = .47; 95% CI: 0.32-.60; p < .001), which is a stronger association than in the general population (r = .24). Moderation analyses did not show any significant effect of child chronological age and publication year on effect sizes. The categorical moderators (e.g., informant, country) could not be tested due to the limited number of studies. More research is needed to better understand the way mothers adapt to their children with autism and identify the nuances regarding how maternal sensitivity/availability relates to child attachment in the context of ASD.

AB  - Background: Auditory emotion recognition (AER) deficits refer to the abnormal identification and interpretation of tonal or prosodic features that transmit emotional information in sounds or speech. Evidence suggests that AER deficits are related to the pathology of schizophrenia. However, the effect size of the deficit in specific emotional category recognition in schizophrenia and its association with psychotic symptoms have never been evaluated through a meta-analysis.
   Methods: A systematic search for literature published in English or Chinese until November 30, 2020 was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsychINFO, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang and Weip Databases. AER differences between patients and healthy controls (HCs) were assessed by the standardized mean differences (SMDs). Subgroup analyses were conducted for the type of emotional stimuli and the diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders (Sch/SchA). Meta-regression analyses were performed to assess the influence of patients' age, sex, illness duration, antipsychotic dose, positive and negative symptoms on the study SMDs.
   Results: Eighteen studies containing 615 psychosis (Sch/SchA) and 488 HCs were included in the meta-analysis. Patients exhibited moderate deficits in recognizing the neutral, happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, and surprising emotion. Neither the semantic information in the auditory stimuli nor the diagnosis subtype affected AER deficits in schizophrenia. Sadness, anger, and disgust AER deficits were each positively associated with negative symptoms in schizophrenia.
   Conclusions: Patients with schizophrenia have moderate AER deficits, which were associated with negative symptoms. Rehabilitation focusing on improving AER abilities may help improve negative symptoms and the long-term prognosis of schizophrenia.

We aim to provide an overview of healthcare-related articles published in peer-reviewed journals, authored by the Singapore research community about COVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic. Methods-This was reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) protocol. It included healthcare-related articles about COVID-19 published between 23 January 2020 and 22 January 2021 with a Singapore-affiliated author. MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and local journals were searched. The articles were screened independently by two reviewers. Results-The review included 504 articles. Most of the articles narrated the changes to hospital practice (210), while articles on COVID-19 pathology (94) formed most of the non-narrative papers. Publications on public health (61) and the indirect impacts to clinical outcomes (45) were other major themes explored by the research community. The remaining articles detailed the psychological impact of the pandemic (35), adaptations of medical education (30), and narratives of events (14). Conclusion-Amidst a resurgence of community cases involving variant COVID-19 strains, the resources from the research community will provide valuable guidance to navigate these uncertain times.

AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a treatment sequela with negative physical and psychological implications. BCRL is a lifetime concern for survivors and is currently incurable. With the increase in the Latino population in the United States, it is critical for the cancer care community to address factors that increase BCRL risk and negatively impact long-term quality of life. This literature review undertook to identify successful intervention strategies for BCRL among Latina survivors. Methods: Multiple databases were searched for published articles from 2006 to 2020. PRISMA guidelines were utilized. Data were extracted related to physical activity, diet, and psychosocial stress concerns of Latinas at risk for or living with BCRL. Results: Eleven interventions combined education and skill-building techniques to address physical activity, diet, and stress management for BCRL. Family involvement, peer-mentoring, culturally tailored education, and self-care skill development were identified as important for Latina survivors. Conclusion: Latina survivors may benefit from culturally tailored BCRL education programs and self-management interventions. Health care professionals and researchers should consider cultural influences when developing clinical intervention strategies to enhance outcomes for Latinas at risk for living with BCRL. In addition, including family members and/or peers in such strategies may be helpful to Latina survivors.

AB  - Background Repeat offending, also known as criminal recidivism, in people released from prison has remained high over many decades. To address this, psychological treatments have been increasingly used in criminal justice settings; however, there is little evidence about their effectiveness. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in prison to reduce recidivism after release.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar for articles published from database inception to Feb 17, 2021, without any language restrictions. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of psychological interventions, delivered to adolescents and adults during incarceration, on recidivism outcomes after release. We excluded studies of solely pharmacological interventions and of participants in secure psychiatric hospitals or special residential units, or attending therapies mainly delivered outside of the prison setting. We extracted summary estimates from eligible RCTs. Data were extracted and appraised according to a prespecified protocol, with effect sizes converted to odds ratios. We used a standardised form to extract the effects of interventions on recidivism and estimated risk of bias for each RCT. Planned sensitivity analyses were done by removing studies with fewer than 50 participants. Our primary outcome was recidivism. Data from individual RCTs were combined in a random-effects meta-analysis as pooled odds ratios (ORs) and we explored sources of heterogeneity by comparing effect sizes by study size, control group, and intervention type. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020167228.
   Findings Of 6345 articles retrieved, 29 RCTs (9443 participants, 1104 [11.7%] females, 8111 [85.9%] males, and 228 [2.4%] unknown) met the inclusion criteria for the primary outcome. Mean ages were 31.4 years (SD 4.9, range 24.5-41.5) for adult participants and 17.5 years (SD 1.9; range 14.6-20.2) for adolescent participants. Race or ethnicity data were not sufficiently reported to be aggregated. If including all 29 RCTs, psychological interventions were associated with reduced reoffending outcomes (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.92). However, after excluding smaller studies (<50 participants in the intervention group), there was no significant reduction in recidivism (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68-1.11). Based on two studies, therapeutic communities were associated with decreased rates of recidivism (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.91). These risk estimates did not significantly differ by type of control group and other study characteristics.
   Interpretation Widely implemented psychological interventions for people in prison to reduce offending after release need improvement. Publication bias and small-study effects appear to have overestimated the reported modest effects of such interventions, which were no longer present when only larger studies were included in analyses. Findings suggest that therapeutic communities and interventions that ensure continuity of care in community settings should be prioritised for future research. Developing new treatments should focus on addressing modifiable risk factors for reoffending. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: There is an urgent need to systematically analyze the growing body of literature on the effect of motor imagery (MI) training in children and adolescents. Methods: Seven databases and clinicaltrials.gov were searched. Two reviewers independently screened references and full texts, and extracted data (studies' methodology, MI elements, temporal parameters). Two studies were meta-analyzed providing the standard mean difference (SDM). Selected studies were evaluated with the risk of bias (RoB) and GRADE tools. Results: A total of 7238 references were retrieved. The sample size of the 22 included studies, published between 1995 and 2021, ranged from 18 to 136 participants, totaling 934 (nine to 18 years). Studies included healthy pupils, mentally retarded adolescents, children with motor coordination difficulties or with mild mental disabilities. The motor learning tasks focused on upper, lower and whole body movements. SMDs for the primary outcome of pooled studies varied between 0.83 to 1.87 (95% CI, I-2, T-2 varied 0.33-3.10; p = 0.001; 0-74%; 0-0.59). RoB varied between some concerns and high risk. GRADE rating was low. Conclusions: MI combined with physical practice (PP) might have a high potential for healthy and impaired children and adolescents. However, important reporting recommendations (PETTLEP, TIDieR, CONSORT) should be followed. The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42021237361.

   & nbsp;</p>
   Results: The search of electronic databases identified 18 reports based on rigorous inclusion criteria. Single-session therapy was found superior to no treatment in reducing anxiety symptoms, and similar results were observed while comparing SST to multi-treatment sessions.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Discussion: The findings support the benefits of SST in enhancing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological outcomes in both youth and adults suffering from anxiety disorders across treatment conditions and approaches, SST thus appears to be a promising way of providing access to both private and public therapeutic services efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Conclusions: Single-session therapy is effective in treating anxiety disorders. Further research is required to quantify its cost-effectiveness and deepen the knowledge of effective treatment ingredients for both young people and the adult population suffering from diverse anxiety disorders.</p>

AB  - Pesticides are substances that have become widely used in agriculture and the human exposure to these substances may cause adverse health outcomes. Non-occupational exposure to them can come from many sources, such as food or water. For occupational exposure, many studies have been conducted in men, as they have been mostly in charge of work related to these substances. Nonetheless, the information available concerning the exposure in women is very scarce. In addition, an important differentiation between rural and urban areas has been established, rural areas being known as the most exposed ones due to plantation fields. However, the application of higher concentrations of herbicides in small urban areas is taking a lot of importance currently as well. Regardless of gender, the conditions of exposure, and the environment, the exposure to these pesticides can have different effects on health from early life stages, resulting in different outcomes ranging from neurodevelopmental effects in newborns to different types of cancers. In this review, we discussed the toxicity of the most commonly used pesticides and the main impact on the health of the general population, focusing mainly on the effect in women from both rural and urban areas, and the different stages of development, from pregnancy or lactation to the outcomes of these exposures for their children.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by glucose clearance abnormalities and insufficient insulin response. Left uncontrolled, T2DM can result in serious complications and death. With no cure available currently and the prevalence of major risk factors such as pre-diabetes and the metabolic syndrome continuously increasing, there is an urgent need for effective treatments with limited or no side effects. Red raspberries (RR) contain various phytonutrients with potential for modulating insulin function, glucose, and lipid metabolism. The objective of this literature review was to investigate the potential metabolic benefits of dietary RR in individuals with T2DM and pre-diabetes. A search of major scientific databases was employed to identify peer-reviewed, in vivo, or human studies that utilized whole RR or its functional constituents as treatment. The studies examined provide evidence that RR may offer clinically beneficial effects for the prevention and management of chronic diseases through improvements in glucose handling and insulin sensitivity, adiposity, lipid profiles, ectopic lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiac health. More human trials and in vivo studies are needed to confirm the benefits of dietary RR in T2DM and pre-diabetes and to explore the dose-dependent relationships, optimal duration, and treatment modality.

AB  - People who identify as LGBTQ+ and are in prison often experience many additional challenges. Once in prison, there is systemic discrimination against imprisoned LGBTQ+ people and a lack of understanding and concern regarding their care, treatment and support needs. While there is growing interest in their protection and that of other vulnerable populations in prison settings, little is known about their views and experiences regarding their distinct psychosocial needs. The aim of this systematic review is to critically evaluate and synthesize the existing research evidence relating to the unique psychological and social experiences of LGBTQ+ people in prison and identify aspects that may help or hinder access to appropriate psychosocial interventions and supports. The PRISMA procedure was utilized. A search of relevant databases from January 2010 to March 2021 was undertaken. Studies were identified that involved LGBTQ+ people, and addressed their views and experiences regarding their psychosocial needs whilst in prison. The search yielded 858 papers in total. Following the application of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria a total of 12 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Quality was assessed using the CASP instrument. Following analysis, three themes were identified: (i) interpersonal factors (ii) intrapersonal factors and (iii) institutional factors. The policy, education and practice development implications are highlighted and discussed. Future research opportunities have been identified that will add significantly to the body of evidence that may further the development of appropriate health interventions and supports specific to the LGBTQ+ population in prison.

AB  - This review summarized literature about knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women from Australia who smoke during pregnancy, then examined the extent that existing health promotion materials and media messages aligned with evidence on smoking cessation for pregnant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of pregnant Aboriginal women who smoke tobacco were identified in the literature. Health promotion campaigns were retrieved from a grey literature search with keywords and social and professional networks. Key themes from peer-reviewed papers were compared against the content of health promotion campaigns using the Aboriginal Social and Emotional Wellbeing Model, the Behavior Change Wheel and thematic analysis. Eleven empirical studies and 17 campaigns were included. Empirical studies highlighted women sought holistic care that incorporated nicotine replacement therapy, engaged with their family and community and the potential for education about smoking cessation to empower a woman. Health promotion campaigns had a strong focus on 'engagement with family and community', 'knowledge of risks of smoking,' 'giving up vs cutting down' and 'culture in language and arts'. There were similarities and variances in the key themes in the research evidence and promotion materials. Topics highly aligned included risks from smoking and quitting related issues.

AB  - Background: Currently, chronic pain is a disabling condition that is difficult to manage, which generates a high burden on health systems. The objective is to determine the effects of aerobic physical exercise in adults with chronic pain. Methods: A systematic review of searches in databases including MEDLINE, LILACS, ScienceDirect, PEDro, OTseeker, The Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and Google Scholar was conducted. The search process was carried out until July 31, 2020, and the study selection process was independently carried out through a criteria analysis for each phase. Outcome measures were chosen: aerobic capacity, physical function, quality of life, and pain. Results: Twenty-seven studies were included in which aerobic exercise was considered as an option to treat chronic pain. These studies showed significant results compared with other treatment options in terms of pain measurements (-0.22 [-0.42 to -0.03]) and aerobic capacity. For quality of life, there were significant improvements in the physical function component over the mental health component evaluated with the short form health survey-36/12. Conclusion: Aerobic exercise is a nonpharmacological therapeutic option for treatment. Also, aerobic capacity and endurance improved when this type of exercise was prescribed, thus resulting in a substantial improvement in the quality of life of people suffering from chronic pain.

AB  - Objective: Primary care clinicians in Asia employed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to aid dementia diagnosis post-stroke. Recent studies questioned their clinical utility in stroke settings for relying on verbal abilities and education level, as well as lack of consideration for aphasia and neglect. We aimed to review the clinical utility of the MMSE and MoCA for stroke patients in Asia and provide recommendations for clinical practice. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct were searched for relevant articles. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. RevMan 5.4 was used for data synthesis (sensitivity and specificity) and covariates were identified. Results: Among the 48 full-text articles reviewed, 11 studies were included with 3735 total subjects; of these studies, 7 (77%) were conducted in China, 3 (27%) in Singapore, and 1 (9%) in South Korea. Both the MMSE and MoCA generally showed adequate sensitivity and specificity. Education was identified as a covariate that significantly affected detection accuracy. Due to heterogeneity in cutoff scores, methodologies, and languages, it was not feasible to suggest a single cutoff score. One additional point is recommended for MoCA for patients with <6 years of education. Conclusion: Clinicians in Asia are strongly recommended to consider the education level of stroke patients when interpreting the results of the MMSE and MoCA. Further studies in other Asian countries are needed to understand their clinical value in stroke settings.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) and sports are efficient ways to promote the young generation's physical and mental health and development. This study expected to demonstrate the complexity of correlates associated with children's and adolescents' non-organized PA participation. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA), a systematic review and meta-analysis were applied. Seven electronic databases were systematically searched to identify eligible articles based on a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The internal validity of the systematic reviews thus identified was evaluated using a validated quality instrument. Calculations were produced in SPSS 27.0 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.3. Thirty-nine eligible studies (N = 324,953) with moderate to high quality were included. No potential publication bias was detected using statistical analyses. The meta-analysis revealed that the overall ecological factors correlated positively with children and adolescents' PA; the meta-analytic average of the correlations was (' r = 0.32, p < 0.001). Results from subgroup analysis indicated that theory-based influence factors achieved moderate effect with boys (' r = 0.37, p < 0.001) and girls (' r = 0.32, p < 0.001) in PA participation. Interestingly, higher correlations were found between ecological factors and twins' PA participation (' r = 0.61, p = 0.001). Further, individual (' r = 0.32, p < 0.001), macro-, and chronosystems factors (' r = 0.50, p < 0.001) appeared slightly more influential than microsystems factors (' r = 0.28, p < 0.001) on children and adolescents' PA participation. Although findings from the included studies covered were to some extent heterogeneous, it is possible to identify consistent correlates of PA in children and adolescents. The results supported that PA is a complex and multi-dimensional behavior, which is determined by numerous biological, psychological, sociocultural, and environmental factors. Future studies that focus on the integration effect of macrosystem and chronosystem environmental factors, and apply longitudinal designs and objective measurements are encouraged to further unfold the complexity of the ecological system and its implications in promoting children and adolescents' PA participation.

AB  - Integration of religion in community health and wellbeing interventions is important for achieving a good life among faith-based populations. In countries hosting Muslim-minorities, however, relatively little is reported in academic literature on processes of faith integration in the development and delivery of interventions. We undertook a review of peer reviewed literature on health and wellbeing interventions with Muslim-minorities, with specific interest on how Islamic principles were incorporated. Major databases were systematically searched and PRISMA guidelines applied in the selection of eligible studies. Twenty-one journal articles met the inclusion criteria. These were coded and analyzed thematically. Study characteristics and themes of religiosity are reported in this review, including the religious tailoring of interventions, content co-creation and delivery design based on the teachings from the Quran and Sunnah, and applicability of intervention structures. We reviewed the philosophical and structural elements echoing the Quran and Islamic principles in the intervention content reported. However, most studies identified that the needs of Muslim communities were often overlooked or compromised. This may be due to levels of religio-cultural knowledge of persons facilitating community health and wellbeing interventions. Our review emphasizes the importance of intellectual apparatus when working in diverse communities, effective communication-strategies, and community consultations when designing interventions with Muslim-minority communities.

KW  - SELF-HARM
AB  - Background: Police and paramedics are often the first to respond to individuals in suicide crisis and have an important role to play in facilitating optimal care pathways. Yet, little evidence exists to inform these responses. Data linkage provides one approach to examining this knowledge gap. Aim: We identified studies that examined suicide behaviors and linked to police or ambulance data. Method: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus was undertaken to identify data linkage studies that: (1) examined suicide behaviors, and (2) included police or ambulance data. Studies were reviewed to identify: aims; suicide behaviors examined; how these were measured; how the cohort was defined; topic area; and what datasets were linked. Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies included police data, and two studies included ambulance data. No study included both. Two topic areas were identified: (1) suicide-related contact with police or ambulance services; and (2) associations between suicidal behaviors and violence, victimization, and criminality. Limitations: Limitations to the review include the potential to have missed studies that investigated or reported on suicidality under the guise of mental health problems; complexities and nuances arising from the role of police data in coronial investigations; and limitations in the number of databases searched. Conclusion: Police and ambulance data represent a currently underutilized source of valuable information relevant to suicide crises, and further research should aim to address this gap.

AB  - The global campaign of osteoporosis has been organized by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and them introducing World Osteoporosis Day (WOD) in 1997. The day is celebrated on October 20th each year and aimed to improve the awareness of the population about disease prevention. We present some aspects of bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis related to the use of vitamins. The presenting mini-review covers a variety of sources including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and directory of open access journals (DOAJ) from 10 years ago (Oct 2009 to Oct 2019) for recent developments in the prevention of bone loss. The search was performed by using combinations of the following keywords and or their equivalents; osteoporosis, bones health, bone loss, and vitamin to find related articles about the prevention of osteoporosis by nutritional factors. The factors affecting bone are various and could begin from fetal periods to the end of life. Some of them are not changeable including age, and genetic; however, it is possible to modify some others such as poor nutrition and vitamin deficiency. Beyond vitamin D deficiency, consumption of other vitamins also is beneficial to maintain bone health. By considering the nutritional factors especially vitamins that affect bones, it is possible to have stronger bones to enjoy life in the elderly and protect your future.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an important commitment to the development of programs to promote mental health literacy (MHL) among adolescents, due to the prevalence of mental health problems and the low level of MHL that affects this group. The aim of this study was to map the structure and context of programmes/interventions for promoting MHL among adolescents in school settings. A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of The Joanna Briggs Institute. We searched for studies on programmes/interventions promoting at least one of the components of MHL of adolescents, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, published from 2013 to 2020, in MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, SciELO, SCOPUS, OpenGrey, RCAAP and in the article reference lists. This review included 29 articles. The majority of programmes/interventions addressed one or more of the four components of MHL, with the knowledge of mental disorders and stigma reduction components being the most covered; were taught by adolescent's regular teachers; used face to face interventions; had a height variable duration; used non-validated instruments; were implemented in a classroom environment; and showed statistically significant improvements in adolescent's MHL levels. More research is needed to implement/construct programmes/interventions promoting adolescents' MHL concerning knowledge on how to obtain and maintain good mental health.

AB  - Purpose of Review The training of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals requires education on a range of interpersonal, communication, and psychotherapy techniques. Classroom and workshop training must be augmented by experiential learning with feedback for skill implementation with fidelity. Virtual standardized patients (VSPs) are computerized conversational agents that can support experiential learning through standardized, consequence-free training environments at reduced costs. Recent Findings Research on mental health VSPs is rife with feasibility and acceptability pilot studies across various training populations and settings. Users have generally reported positive reactions to training with VSPs, though frustrations with some VSP speech recognition or VSP response relevance has been reported. Several studies have demonstrated a promising transfer of clinical skills from VSP training to human standardized patients and randomized trials supporting improved skill relative to reading or academic study are encouraging. As technology improves and natural language processing and accurate computer response generation for broad ranging conversational topics emerges, the field would benefit from research on the characteristics of effective VSPs for a range of purposes and trainee populations. Well-designed randomized evaluations of VSPs relative to best practices in education are needed, particularly regarding the impact of VSPs on clinical practice among actual patients.

AB  - Background Vaccine hesitancy (VH) and the global decline of vaccine coverage are a major global health threat, and novel approaches for increasing vaccine confidence and uptake are urgently needed. 'Nudging', defined as altering the environmental context in which a decision is made or a certain behaviour is enacted, has shown promising results in several health promotion strategies. We present a comprehensive synthesis of evidence regarding the value and impact of nudges to address VH. Methods We conducted a systematic review to determine if nudging can mitigate VH and improve vaccine uptake. Our search strategy used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and non-MeSH terms to identify articles related to nudging and vaccination in nine research databases. 15 177 titles were extracted and assessed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The final list of included articles was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. Findings Identified interventions are presented according to a framework for behaviour change, MINDSPACE. Articles (n=48) from 10 primarily high-income countries were included in the review. Nudging-based interventions identified include using reminders and recall, changing the way information is framed and delivered to an intended audience, changing the messenger delivering information, invoking social norms and emotional affect (eg, through storytelling, dramatic narratives and graphical presentations), and offering incentives or changing defaults. The most promising evidence exists for nudges that offer incentives to parents and healthcare workers, that make information more salient or that use trusted messengers to deliver information. The effectiveness of nudging interventions and the direction of the effect varies substantially by context. Evidence for some approaches is mixed, highlighting a need for further research, including how successful interventions can be adapted across settings. Conclusion Nudging-based interventions show potential to increase vaccine confidence and uptake, but further evidence is needed for the development of clear recommendations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic increases the urgency of undertaking nudging-focused research. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020185817.

AB  - Mental health presentations to the emergency department (ED) have increased, and the emergency department has become the initial contact point for people in a mental health crisis. However, there is mounting evidence that the ED is not appropriate nor effective in responding to people in mental health crises. Insufficient attention has been paid to the subjective experience of people seeking support during a mental health crisis. This review aims to describe the qualitative literature involving the subjective experiences of people presenting to the ED during a mental health crisis. The method was guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping studies and included keyword searches of PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline and Embase. A narrative analysis, drawing on the visual tool of journey mapping, was applied to summarise the findings. Twenty-three studies were included. The findings represent the experience of accessing EDs, through to the impact of treatment. The review found points of opportunity that improve people's experiences and characteristics associated with negative experiences. The findings highlight the predominance and impact of negative experiences of the ED and the incongruence between the expectations of people presenting to the ED and the experience of treatment.

AB  - The built environment directly and indirectly affects mental health, especially for people transitioning from long-term homelessness to permanent supportive housing (PSH) who often experience co-occurring behavioral health challenges. Despite a rapid increase in PSH availability, little research examines influences of architecture and design within this context. This integrative review synthesized limited research on PSH design in the U.S. and Canada to identify built environment characteristics associated with PSH residents' mental health, highlight gaps in the literature, and prioritize future research directions. A systematic search for peer-reviewed articles was conducted using nine databases drawing from multiple disciplines including architecture, environmental psychology, interior design, psychology, psychiatry, medicine, and nursing. Seventeen articles met inclusion criteria. Study design, methodology, built environment properties, place attributes, and relevant findings were extracted and iteratively analyzed. Three domains relevant to architecture and design were identified related to home, ontological security, and trauma sensitivity; dwelling unit type, privacy, control, safety, housing quality and location, and access to amenities; and shared common space. Integrative review results emphasize the potential of architecture and design to contribute to improved built environment quality and mental health outcomes among PSH residents. Methodological limitations and directions for future research are also discussed.

AB  - Background: Reflective functioning has roots in developmental-clinical psychology and refers to an individual's capacity to understand one's own and others' social and cooperative behaviors in terms of mental states. Team cognition has roots in socialorganizational psychology and refers to organized cognitive structures that allow team members who interact with each other to share, store, and retrieve individual and collective knowledge. These theories emerged in separate silos despite the potential conceptual overlap. The goal of this article is to examine if the theories of reflective functioning and team cognition can inform each other's research and practice. Method: This article describes the concepts of reflective functioning and team cognition, and also selectively reviews some of the research by focusing on metaanalyses and some key studies in each domain. Results: Research indicates that team cognition is related to team processes and team performance. Research also indicates that deficits in reflective functioning are related to psychopathology and to poorer psychological treatment outcomes including in group therapy. Team reflexivity, a team cognition function, may be hampered in the context of prementalizing reflective capacity of team members. And team psychological safety bears a striking resemblance to the reflective functioning concept of epistemic trust. Conclusion: Research and theory of reflective functioning, a clinical psychology construct, may be advanced by considering it also as an emergent property of groups and teams. Conversely, research on team cognition, a social/organizational construct, may move forward by considering how it is affected by individuals' capacities for reflective functioning and team composition along this dimension.

AB  - The aim of the article is to review systematically current researches investigating the relationship between intrauterine exposure to antidepressants and neonatal hypoglycemia. This paper included studies published in electronic databases from January 2005 to July 2020. The searched keywords were as follows: antidepressants, pregnancy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, fluvoxamine, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), neonatal outcomes, neonatal hypoglycemia, imipramine, clomipramine, amitriptyline, bupropion, trazodone, and mirtazapine. This review examined 10 relevant studies. The odds ratio/risk ratio reported in the studies were 1.33-1.73 for any antidepressant, 1.30-1.35 for SSRI, 1.42-2.11 for SNRI, and 2.07 for TCAs. The risk of neonatal hypoglycemia in infants exposed to maternal TCAs appears to be slightly higher compared to infants exposed to maternal SSRIs. Data from current studies consistently show that exposure to maternal antidepressants during pregnancy may be related to increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia in infants.

AB  - Background Young people present high rates of cannabis use, abuse, and dependence. The United Nations estimates that roughly 3.8% of the global population aged 15-64 years used cannabis at least once in 2017. Cannabis use in young people may impair cognitive skills, interfere with learning, impact relationships, and lead to long term behavioural and psychological consequences. Online cannabis interventions (OCI) are increasingly popular, but their dissemination is not often supported by empirical evidence. Aim To systematically compile and analyse the effectiveness of OCI for the reduction of cannabis use among adolescents and young adults (AYA). Methods Pooled effect sizes of cannabis use between treatment and control groups were estimated. For each comparison, Hedge's g was calculated using a random effects model. Results The search strategy yielded 4531 articles. Of those, a total of 411 articles were retrieved for detailed evaluation resulting in 17 eligible studies (n = 3525). Analyses revealed that online interventions did not significantly reduce cannabis consumption (Hedge's g = -0.061, 95% CI [-0.363] to [-0.242], p = .695) and high heterogeneity was noted (Q = 191.290). More recent studies using structured interventions, daily feedback, AYA centred designs, and peer support, specifically targeting CU seemed to have positive effects to address CU in this population. Conclusions The lack of positive outcomes suggests that more specific and targeted interventions may be necessary to promote cannabis-related behavioural change among young people. These targeted interventions may include structured CU modules, daily feedback, peer support for increased adherence, user-centred design procedures, and input from key stakeholders such as families and service providers.

AB  - The changes in lifestyle and living conditions have affected not only humans but also microorganisms. As man invents new drugs and therapies, pathogens alter themselves to survive and thrive. Multiple drug resistance (MDR) is the talk of the town for decades now. Many generations of medications have been termed useless as MDR rises among the infectious population. The surge in nanotechnology has brought a new hope in reducing this aspect of resistance in pathogens. It has been observed in several laboratory-based studies that the use of nanoparticles had a synergistic effect on the antibiotic being administered to the pathogen; several resistant strains scummed to the stress created by the nanoparticles and became susceptible to the drug. The major cause of resistance to date is the efflux system, which makes the latest generation of antibiotics ineffective without reaching the target site. If species-specific nanomaterials are used to control the activity of efflux pumps, it could revolutionize the field of medicine and make the previous generation resistant medications active once again. Therefore, the current study was devised to assess and review nanoparticles' role on efflux systems and discuss how specialized particles can be designed towards an infectious host's particular drug ejection systems.

AB  - Objective: To undertake a narrative literature review of imposter syndrome (IS) in doctors beyond training. Method: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria from a systematised search of three databases. Results: There is a paucity of literature on IS, although it has been observed across a diverse range of specialties. IS appears to be more common in female doctors but is also seen amongst male doctors. IS impacts career progression, leadership and mental health. Conclusions: IS causes professional and personal detriment. Solutions must include institutional changes to foster safer workplaces and to address systemic barriers to help-seeking and peer support. Systemic interventions are the only solution to the systemic drivers of IS.

AB  - Background: Medical students are at an increased risk of developing substance use and related problems (SURP) because of the inherent stress associated with the professional medical course apart from the developmental risk factors. However, this is under-researched. Moreover, a comprehensive review on the prevalence of SURP among the medical undergraduates (UGs) and associated factors is lacking from India. To fill this gap, the current research work is aimed to review the existing literature on the magnitude of the SURP among UGs of India and its determinants. Methods: PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases were searched for the original articles studying the prevalence of SURP among medical UGs of India, published from inception till date. Non-original articles, studies on behavioral addictions, and those not directly assessing the prevalence of SURP among the medical UGs were excluded. Results: A total of 39 studies were found eligible for the review. Alcohol (current use: 3.2%-43.8%), followed by tobacco (3.7%-28.8%) and cannabis (1.6%-15%), were the common substances used by the medical students. Among the females, an increasing trend of substance use, particularly of nonprescription sedatives (even higher than males), alcohol, and smoking, was seen. Family history, peer pressure, transition from school to college life, and progression in the medical course were important associated factors. Conclusion: Sensitizing medical students and college authorities, increasing the duration of training on SURP in medical curricula, and providing psychological support for the students with SURP could address this issue.

AB  - Intercellular communication in the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for brain growth, development, and homeostasis maintenance and, when dysfunctional, is involved in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases. Increasing evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes, are critical mediators of intercellular signal transduction. Under physiological and pathological conditions, neural cells secret exosomes with the influence of many factors. These exosomes can carry specific proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and other bioactive substances to the recipient cells to regulate their function. Depending on the CNS environment, as well as the origin and physiological or pathological status of parental cells, exosomes can mediate a variety of different effects, including synaptic plasticity, nutritional metabolic support, nerve regeneration, inflammatory response, anti-stress effect, cellular waste disposal, and the propagation of toxic components, playing an important role in health and neurodegenerative diseases. This review will discuss the possible roles of exosomes in CNS intercellular communication in both physiologic and neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are more prevalent in women than in men. In women the menstrual cycle introduces another variable; indeed, some conditions e.g., premenstrual syndrome, are menstrual cycle specific. Animal models of fear and anxiety, which form the basis for research into drug treatments, have been developed almost exclusively, using males. There remains a paucity of work using females and the available literature presents a confusing picture. One confound is the estrous cycle in females, which some authors consider, but many do not. Importantly, there are no accepted standardized criteria for defining cycle phase, which is important given the rapidly changing hormonal profile during the 4-day cycle of rodents. Moreover, since many behavioral tests that involve a learning component or that consider extinction of a previously acquired association require several days to complete; the outcome may depend on the phase of the cycle on the days of training as well as on test days. In this article we consider responsiveness of females compared to males in a number of commonly used behavioral tests of anxiety and fear that were developed in male rodents. We conclude that females perform in a qualitatively similar manner to males in most tests although there may be sex and strain differences in sensitivity. Tests based on unconditioned threatening stimuli are significantly influenced by estrous cycle phase with animals displaying increased responsiveness in the late diestrus phase of the cycle (similar to the premenstrual phase in women). Tests that utilize conditioned fear paradigms, which involve a learning component appear to be less impacted by the estrous cycle although sex and cycle-related differences in responding can still be detected. Ethologically-relevant tests appear to have more translational value in females. However, even when sex differences in behavior are not detected, the same outward behavioral response may be mediated by different brain mechanisms. In order to progress basic research in the field of female psychiatry and psychopharmacology, there is a pressing need to validate and standardize experimental protocols for using female animal models of anxiety-related states.

AB  - Background Difficult-to-treat-depression (DTD) is a clinical challenge. The interventions that are well-established for DTD are not suitable or effective for all the patients. Therefore, more treatment options are highly warranted. We formulated an evidence-based guideline concerning six interventions not well-established for DTD in Denmark. Methods Selected review questions were formulated according to the PICO principle with specific definitions of the patient population (P), the intervention (I), the comparison (C), and the outcomes of interest (O), and systematic literature searches were performed stepwise for each review question to identify relevant systematic reviews/meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Clinical recommendations were formulated based on the evidence, the risk-benefit ratio, and perceived patient preferences. Results We found sufficient evidence for a weak recommendation of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP). The use of bright light therapy in DTD was not sufficiently supported by the evidence, but should be considered as good clinical practice. The interventions should be considered in addition to ongoing antidepressant treatment. We did not find sufficient evidence to recommend intravenous ketamine/esketamine, rumination-focused psychotherapy, or cognitive remediation to patients with DTD. Conclusion The evidence supported two of the six reviewed interventions, however it was generally weak which emphasizes the need for more good quality studies. This guideline does not cover all treatment options and should be regarded as a supplement to relevant DTD-guidelines.

AB  - Sexual violence is a concerning public health and criminal justice problem. Even though extensive literature has linked sexual victimization to a multitude of mental and physical problems, some victim/survivors recover and are able to lead lives without notable negative impacts. Little is known about women who experienced posttraumatic growth following sexual victimization. This review brings together knowledge accumulated in the academic literature in the past decade. It was informed by the PRISMA-P guidelines. Databases were searched using a combination of keywords to locate original peer-reviewed research articles published between January 2010 and October 2020 focusing on posttraumatic growth following sexual victimization. The initial search identified 6,187 articles with 265 articles being read in full, identifying 41 articles that were included in the analysis. The results suggest that recovery from sexual victimization is possible with the healing process being idiosyncratic. Victim/survivors employed various strategies resulting in higher degrees of functioning, which were termed growth. Following a synthesis of themes that emerged from the thematic analysis, a higher order abstraction, using creative insight through reflexivity, discussions among the research team and consistent interpretation and re-interpretation of the identified themes as a second stage analysis, resulted in the identification of two superordinate topics "relationship to self" and "relationship to others." Findings indicated that women engaged in deliberate introspection to connect with themselves and utilized altruistic actions and activism in an attempt to prevent further sexual victimization Helping victim/survivors deal with the sexual violence facilitated growth as a collective. We concluded that helping others may be a therapeutic vehicle for PTG. Given research in this area remains in its infancy, further investigation is urgently needed.

AB  - Microbiota have increasingly become implicated in predisposition to human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Traditionally, a central nervous system (CNS)-centric approach to understanding PD has predominated; however, an association of the gut with PD has existed since Parkinson himself reported the disease. The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the brain. Gut microbiota dysbiosis, reported in PD patients, may extend this to a microbiota-gut-brain axis. To date, mainly the bacteriome has been investigated. The change in abundance of bacterial products which accompanies dysbiosis is hypothesised to influence PD pathophysiology via multiple mechanisms which broadly centre on inflammation, a cause of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) misfolding. Two main routes are hypothesised by which gut microbiota can influence PD pathophysiology, the neural and humoral routes. The neural route involves a-syn misfolding peripherally in the enteric nerves which can then be transported to the brain via the vagus nerve. The humoral route involves transportation of bacterial products and proinflammatory cytokines from the gut via the circulation which can cause central a-syn misfolding by inducing neuroinflammation. This article will assess whether the current literature supports gut bacteria influencing PD pathophysiology via both routes.</p>

AB  - Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects 1.2 to 5% of women of reproductive age. Besides significant suffering and social, occupational, and interpersonal impairment, it has been suggested that this syndrome is associated with other affective disorders, in different reproductive phases, such as pregnancy and the postpartum period. However, the literature on this association is scarce and presents great variability in terms of adopted methodology and mixed results. To analyze the relationship between PMDD and other affective disorders, aiming to contribute to the clarification of whether PMDD can be considered a risk factor for perinatal depression (PND). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases. Seven original studies were included. Only one study linked PMDD with depression during pregnancy, with evidence of a positive association between PMDD and PND. This and five other studies show a positive relationship between PMDD and postpartum depression (PPD), assessed in periods ranging from 2 to 4 days to 1 year after birth. Only one study found no significant association between PMDD and PPD, assessed at 4 weeks postpartum. There seems to be a positive and significant association between PMDD and the development of perinatal depression, particularly postpartum depression. This review supports the relevance of health professionals systematically evaluating the presence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, when monitoring women throughout the perinatal period.

AB  - Purpose - The current policy landscape advocates for the involvement of people with lived experience in the co-production and co-delivery of mental health services. However, evidence on how to do this safely and effectively for people with eating disorders (EDs) is lacking. The purpose of this study was to explore and synthesis the implementation of ED interventions which involved lived-experience and to evaluate the associated benefits and risks to participants.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study will conduct a systematic review of ED interventions which involve people with lived experience of an ED. A total of seven databases and four subject-specific journals were searched using Boolean search terms.
   Findings - The search yielded ten eligible studies. Involvement procedures were extracted which highlighted variation with some roles being continuous and active and others being isolated and passive. Qualitative results were extracted and thematically analysed which demonstrated many benefits from involving people with lived experience, such as normalisation of experiences, inspiration to recover and the sharing of insight, as well as some risks such as disingenuity and exposure to triggering content.
   Practical implications - The implications of this review highlight the need for policy and guidance to minimise variation across procedures and implementation of co-production to ensure positive outcomes and benefits for participants, given the current landscape. More research in the benefits and risks for those involved in the delivery of the interventions is needed to ensure that co-production and peer support is delivered as safely and effectively as possible.
   Originality/value - This was the first systematic review since 2016 (Fogarty et al., 2016) to assess peer-mentorship programmes in ED treatments, whilst expanding the remit to include wider definitions of peer-support and peer-mentorships such as co-production and co-design in research.

AB  - Purposes To better assess and reduce suicidal risk in first-episode psychosis (FEP), we aimed to investigate the evolution of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) and associated factors in FEP. Method This systematic review (PROSPERO-CRD42020168050) meets PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, EBM Reviews and references lists of relevant articles were searched (February 2020) to identify longitudinal studies, published in English or in French, that assessed the prevalence of STBs at entry to services and over follow-up, and examined factors associated with STBs among all persons with affective and non-affective FEP from a defined catchment area. Screening, data extraction and quality assessment using the adapted Newcastle Ottawa Scale were done independently by two reviewers. Results on prevalence and associated factors are presented by type of STB. Results Of 3,177 references, 17 studies of 11 non-overlapping samples (n = 14,907) with varying lengths of follow-up (1-41.7 years) were included. The prevalence of STBs decreased over follow-up. Up to 21.6% made at least one suicide attempt, 27% had suicidal ideation, and 1-4.3% died by suicide during follow-up. Of 53 factors assessed across studies, only male sex, depressive symptoms, and STBs occurring early during follow-up were associated with subsequent STBs. Early intervention for psychosis decreased STBs in the first three years. Other factors were assessed in a single study, yielded conflicting results, or were not associated with STBs. Conclusions The high prevalence of STBs following onset of psychosis highlights the need for early detection and intervention and ongoing assessment of suicidal risk throughout follow-up, with attention to identified risk factors. The heterogeneity of the studies precluded a meta-analysis and several factors were each assessed by a single study. Additional well-designed longitudinal studies of STBs and associated factors are warranted.

AB  - Background: Modern slavery is a term which incorporates a range of exploitative situations that involve the violation of human rights and the subjugation of individuals. It presents a significant public health concern. Post-release, survivors of modern slavery have complex mental health needs. Whilst mental health provision is a component of international and national policy, the delivery of evidence-based support remains a gap in the global anti-slavery response. Aim: To identify and synthesise the evidence base for mental health interventions developed and evaluated for use in a post-slavery survivor population. Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken. The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO and followed the PRISMA guidance in its reporting. A multi-stage search strategy was utilised to retrieve studies. Quality appraisal was undertaken using the QualSyst tool. Due to heterogeneity in study design, a narrative approach to synthesising the findings was undertaken. Results: Nine studies met the final inclusion criteria. The narrative synthesis clustered the studies in three themes: study design and population; type of intervention; and outcomes reported. The included studies focussed on specific subpopulations, namely child soldiering, child labour or sex trafficking. Conclusion: This review has highlighted not only important theory-practice gaps in relation to the provision of evidence-based mental health support but scant evidence limited to specific sub-groups (child soldiering, child labour or sex trafficking). The emphasis placed on PTSD within the interventions tested risks mental health support becoming exclusionary to those with other needs. When assessing intervention efficacy, the complex socio-political context in which survivors exist as well as the increasing emphasis on holistic care, personal recovery and lived experience need to be considered. Taking this into account, the case can be made for the inclusion of a wider range of non-clinical outcomes in the assessment of mental health intervention effectiveness.

AB  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) mediated protein degradation is crucial to maintain quantitive and functional homeostasis of diverse proteins. Balanced cellular protein homeostasis controlled by UPS is fundamental to normal neurological functions while impairment of UPS can also lead to some neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Functioning as the substrate recognition component of the SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXW7 is essential to multiple aspects of cellular processes via targeting a wide range of substrates for proteasome-mediated degradation. Accumulated evidence shows that FBXW7 is fundamental to neurological functions and especially implicated in neurodevelopment and the nosogenesis of neurodegeneration. In this review, we describe general features of FBXW7 gene and proteins, and mainly present recent findings that highlight the vital roles and molecular mechanisms of FBXW7 in neurodevelopment such as neurogenesis, myelination and cerebral vasculogenesis and in the pathogenesis of some typical neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Additionally, we also provide a prospect on focusing FBXW7 as a potential therapeutic target to rescue neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative impairment.</p>

AB  - It is expected that by 2050 human population will exceed nine billion leading to increased pressure on marine ecosystems. Therefore, it is conjectured various levels of ecosystem functioning starting from individual to population-level, species distribution, food webs and trophic interaction dynamics will be severely jeopardized in coming decades. Ocean warming and acidification are two prime threats to marine biota, yet studies about their cumulative effect on marine fish and shellfishes are still in its infancy. This review assesses existing information regarding the interactive effects of global environmental factors like warming and acidification in the perspective of marine capture fisheries and aquaculture industry. As climate change continues, distribution pattern of species is likely to be altered which will impact fisheries and fishing patterns. Our work is an attempt to compile the existing literatures in the biological perspective of the above-mentioned stressors and accentuate a clear outline of knowledge in this subject. We reviewed studies deciphering the biological consequences of warming and acidification on fish and shellfishes in the light of a molecule to ecosystem perspective. Here, for the first time impacts of these two global environmental drivers are discussed in a holistic manner taking into account growth, survival, behavioural response, prey predator dynamics, calcification, biomineralization, reproduction, physiology, thermal tolerance, molecular level responses as well as immune system and disease susceptibility. We suggest urgent focus on more robust, long term, comprehensive and ecologically realistic studies that will significantly contribute to the understanding of organism's response to climate change for sustainable capture fisheries and aquaculture.

AB  - As a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, remote school psychological services have increased notably in many countries. With the aim of supporting evidence-based practices, we conducted a rapid systematic evidence review on the efficacy of remote as compared to in-person school psychological services. From a total of 3,873 references identified through our search, only three (< 1%) met eligibility criteria for this review. One of these studies showed serious risk of bias according to the ROBINS-I rating scale and was therefore excluded. Overall, the limited evidence that we identified indicates that the impact of remote school psychological services on consumer satisfaction and evaluated mental health outcomes of service users is equivalent or slightly higher to in-person school psychological services. However, this information needs to be interpreted with caution due to the scarcity of available data, as well as methodological limitations.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and cognitive function of magnetic seizure therapy vs. electroconvulsive therapy for major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis
KW  - SAFETY
AB  - Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) has established efficacy in the treatment of depression and a growing evidence base in the treatment of depression. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of MST in anti-depressive treatment and its impact on cognitive function (INPLASY registration number: INPLASY202170061). We searched for controlled trials published in English between 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2020 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases. The evaluation process strictly followed the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool into the literature, and Meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane System Reviewer's Manual. Data from a total of 285 patients from 10 studies were retained in the quantitative synthesis. The results showed no significant difference between MST and ECT in the antidepressant effect (SDM -0.13 [-0.78;0.52]). Compared with ECT, MST showed shorter recovery time (MD -5.67 [-9.75; -1.60]) and reorientation time (MD -14.67 [-27.96; -1.41]); and MST showed less cognitive impairment on the immediate recall of words (SDM 0.80 [0.35;1.25]), delayed recall of words (SDM 0.99 [0.01;0.74]), visual-spatial immediate memory (SDM 0.51 [0.20;0.83]), visual-spatial delayed memory (SDM 0.57 [0.11;1.02]), and the verbal fluency (SDM 0.51 [0.20;0.83]). Our evidence-based study is the first meta-analysis on the efficacy of MST in anti-depressive treatment and its effect on cognitive function. It showed that the curative effect of MST in anti-depressive treatment is equivalent to that of ECT. Besides, depressive patients with MST benefit more from cognitive function compared with ECT.

AB  - Purpose Over the past 15 years, mental health organisations have taken steps to move towards providing services that are more recovery-oriented. This review was undertaken to explore what is known about service users' experience of services that have introduced a recovery-oriented approach to service provision. There is limited research evaluating consumers' lived experiences of recovery-orientated care; a scoping review was chosen to provide an overview of the available research in this area (Munn et al., 2018). The purpose of this review was to summarize and synthesize current qualitative research exploring consumers' experience of recovery orientated mental health care provision. Design/methodology/approach This scoping review was undertaken as outlined by Arksey and O'Malley (2005). The five steps consisted identifying the research question; searching for relevant studies; selecting the studies; charting the studies; and collating, summarising and reporting the findings. Findings Three key themes emerged from this review: translation of recovery policy to practice; ward environment; and recovery principles with five subthemes: engagement; not being listened to; shared decision-making; informational needs; and supportive and collaborative relationships. The themes and subthemes identified in each of the 18 studies are presented in Table 3. Research limitations/implications This review highlights the different degree to which service users have received recovery-oriented recovery care. In the majority of cases, most service users reported few opportunities for nursing engagement, poor communication, inadequate information provision, a lack of collaborative care and mostly negative experiences of the ward environment. Because of the limited studies on mental health service users' lived experiences of a recovery-oriented service, more clinical studies are needed and in different cultural contexts. Practical implications On hindsight, the authors should have included service users in this review process as consumer inclusion is progressively emphasised in mental health educational and research activities. This review highlights that not all studies have involved service users or consumers in their research activity. Social implications Service users need relevant information in a timely manner to participate in decision-making regarding their treatment and care. This review found that either no information was provided to the service users or it was provided in a limited and fragmented manner. This review also found inpatients reported limited opportunities to have meaningful participation in decision-making about their care. These findings have important social implications, as greater consumer engagement in the design and delivery of mental health services will increase community trust in the care provided. This in turn has the potential to facilitate greater community engagement in preventative mental health care. Originality/value This is the first review to systematically synthesis consumers perspectives on the extent to which service providers are achieving the goal of implementing recovery-orientated practice into their service provision. Despite important policy changes, the findings of this review demonstrate that more work is needed to truly operationalise and translate these principles into practice.

AB  - Modern lifestyle and alleviated anthropogenic activities have increased the pollutant load, ultimately causing stress on the environment. In industrialization, many harmful compounds are released into the environment polluting air, water, and soil, triggering adverse impacts on the ecosystem and human beings. Therefore, the development of advanced remediation technologies turns out as a significant environmental priority. Less polar cyclic oligosaccharide Cyclodextrin (CD) with cavity binding organic compounds attracted attention by helping effectively as environmental application. The formation of inclusion complexes and modified Cyclodextrin by cross-linking or surface modification enhances their capacity to abate pollutant effectively from the environment. Modification results in the formation of several novel materials such as CD-based composites, nanocomposites, crosslinked polymer or hydrogels, potent cross-linkers, CD-based membranes, and CD immobilized supports. Several environmental remediation technologies based on Cyclodextrin and modified Cyclodextrin have been discussed in detail in this review. Various environmental applications of Cyclodextrin and its derivatives have been discussed, along with their formation, properties, and characterization. Effective removal of organic pollutants, inorganic pollutants, micropollutants, volatile compounds etc., has been explained using several remediation technologies. Based on CD innocuity, this is referred to as the green process. The reversible equilibrium corresponded by the inclusion phenomenon sets a significant trend in the field of CD environmental application to develop techniques by incorporating supramolecular chemistry as well as irreversible methods such as biodegradation and advanced oxidation. It helps in the complete removal of pollutants and ultimately recycling the CD.

AB  - Accumulating studies had been performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to understand the neural mechanism of acupuncture therapy for depression. However, inconsistencies remain due to differences in research designs and MRI analytical methods. Therefore, we aim to summarize the current MRI research and provide useful information for further research by identifying papers published in English and Chinese about MRI studies on acupuncture for depression up to November 2020. A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 810 depression patients and 416 health controls (HCs). The applied designs of these studies are mainly random control trial and pre-post designs. The MRI analytical methods are mainly (fractional) amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF/ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC), whereas a small subset of studies used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The most consistent functional MRI (fMRI) results showed increased N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratios, increased ALFF in the right precuneus, decreased ALFF in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and increased FC of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In contrast, no significant neurological changes were identified in any of the DTI or VBM studies. However, clear, reliable conclusions cannot be drawn due to the use of different designs, analytical methods, seed points selected, types of depression, acupuncture points, and so on. Improved report specifications, well-designed studies, consistent analytical methods, and larger sample sizes will enable the field to better elucidate the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture in depressed patients.

AB  - Introduction: The objective of this systematic review was to investigate whether electroencephalographic parameters can serve as a tool to distinguish between melancholic depression, non-melancholic depression, and healthy controls in adults.
   Methods: A systematic review comprising an extensive literature search conducted in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO in August 2020 with monthly updates until November 1st, 2020. In addition, we performed a citation search and scanned reference lists. Clinical trials that performed an EEG-based examination on an adult patient group diagnosed with melancholic unipolar depression and compared with a control group of non-melancholic unipolar depression and/or healthy controls were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed by the Strengthening of Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist.
   Results: A total of 24 studies, all case-control design, met the inclusion criteria and could be divided into three subgroups: Resting state studies (n = 5), sleep EEG studies (n = 10), and event-related potentials (ERP) studies (n = 9). Within each subgroup, studies were characterized by marked variability on almost all levels, preventing pooling of data, and many studies were subject to weighty methodological problems. However, the main part of the studies identified one or several EEG parameters that differentiated the groups.
   Conclusions: Multiple EEG modalities showed an ability to distinguish melancholic patients from non-melancholic patients and/or healthy controls. The considerable heterogeneity across studies and the frequent methodological difficulties at the individual study level were the main limitations to this work. Also, the underlying premise of shifting diagnostic paradigms may have resulted in an inhomogeneous patient population.

AB  - Background: This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence reporting epigenetic and/or neuro-immuno-endocrine embedding of adverse childhood events (ACEs) in children, with a particular focus on the short-term biological effect of those experiences.
   Methods: A search was conducted in PsycINFO (R), PubMed (R), Isi Web of Knowledge and Scopus, until July 2019, to identify papers reporting the short-term biological effects of exposure to ACEs.
   Results: The search identified 58 studies, that were included in the review. Regarding exposure, the type of ACE more frequently reported was sexual abuse (n = 26), followed by life stressors (n = 20) and physical abuse (n = 19). The majority (n = 17) of studies showed a positive association between ACEs and biomarkers of the immune system. Regarding DNA methylation 18 studies showed more methylation in participants exposed to ACEs. Two studies presented the effect of ACEs on telomere length and showed that exposure was associated with shorter telomere length.
   Conclusion: Overall the associations observed across studies followed the hypothesis that ACEs are associated with biological risk already at early ages. This is supporting evidence that ACEs appear to get "under the skin " and induce physiological changes and these alterations might be strongly associated with later development of disease.

Reviewing recent research on static and dynamic visual cues, we discuss how people extrapolate judgments of competence and performance from visual information. We highlight how these two streams of research contribute to understanding performance perceptions and offer future avenues for research integrating the consideration of both static and dynamic visual cues.

AB  - The habenula is a small bilateral epithalamic structure that plays a key role in the regulation of the main monoaminergic systems. It is implicated in many aspects of behavior such as reward processing, motivational behavior, behavioral adaptation, and sensory integration. A role of the habenula has been indicated in the pathophysiology of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Neuromodulation of the habenula using deep brain stimulation (DBS) as potential treatment has been proposed and a first successful case of habenula DBS was reported a decade ago. To provide an overview of the current state of habenula DBS in human subjects for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders we conducted a systematic review of both the published literature using PUBMED and current and past registered clinical trials using ClinicalTrials.gov as well as the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Using PRISMA guidelines five articles and five registered clinical trials were identified. The published articles detailed the results of habenula DBS for the treatment of schizophrenia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Four are single case studies; one reports findings in two patients and positive clinical outcome is described in five of the six patients. Of the five registered clinical trials identified, four investigate habenula DBS for the treatment of depression and one for obsessive-compulsive disorder. One trial is listed as terminated, one is recruiting, two are not yet recruiting and the status of the fifth is unknown. The planned enrollment varies between 2 to 13 subjects and four of the five are open label trials. While the published studies suggest a potential role of habenula DBS for a number of indications, future trials and studies are necessary. The outcomes of the ongoing clinical trials will provide further valuable insights. Establishing habenula DBS, however, will depend on successful randomized clinical trials to confirm application and clinical benefit of this promising intervention.>

AB  - The recovery of upper-limb impairment and dysfunction post-stroke is often incomplete owing to the limited time in therapy focused on upper-limb recovery and the severity of the impairment. In these cases, motor imagery (MI) may be used as a precursor to physical therapies to initiate rehabilitation early on when it would be otherwise impossible to engage in therapy, as well as to increase the dose of therapy when MI is used in adjunct to physical therapy. While previous reviews have shown MI to be effective as a therapeutic option, disparity in findings exists, with some studies suggesting MI is not an effective treatment for post-stroke impairment and dysfunction. One factor contributing to these findings is inconsistency in the dose of MI applied. To explore the relationship between MI dose and recovery, a scoping review of MI literature as a treatment for adult survivors of stroke with chronic upper-limb motor deficit was performed. Embase, Medline and CINHAL databases were searched for articles related to MI and stroke. Following a two-phase review process, 21 papers were included, and data related to treatment dose and measures of impairment and function were extracted. Effect sizes were calculated to investigate the effect of dosage on motor recovery. Findings showed a high degree of variability in dosage regimens across studies, with no clear pattern for the effect of dose on outcome. The present review highlights the gaps in MI literature, including variables that contribute to the dose-response relationship, that future studies should consider when implementing MI.

AB  - Arsenic (As) contamination and its adverse consequences on rice agroecosystem are well known. Rice has the credit to feed more than 50% of the world population but concurrently, rice accumulates a substantial amount of As, thereby compromising food security. The gravity of the situation lays in the fact that the population in theAs uncontaminated areas may be accidentally exposed to toxic levels of As from rice consumption. In this review, we are trying to summarize the documents on the impact of As contamination and phytotoxicity in past two decades. The unique feature of this attempt is wide spectrum coverages of topics, and that makes it truly an interdisciplinary review. Aprat from the behaviour of As in rice field soil, we have documented the cellular and molecular response of rice plant upon exposure to As. The potential of various mitigation strategies with partic-ular emphasis on using biochar, seed priming technology, irrigation management, transgenic variety develop-ment and other agronomic methods have been critically explored. The review attempts to give a comprehensive and multidiciplinary insight into the behaviour of As in Paddy -Water - Soil - Plate prospective from molecular to post-harvest phase. From the comprehensive literature review, we may conclude that considerable emphasis on rice grain, nutritional and anti-nutritional components, and grain quality traits under arsenic stress condition is yet to be given. Besides these, some emerging mitigation options like seed priming technology, adoption of nanotechnological strategies, applications of biochar should be fortified in large scale without interfering with the proper use of biodiversity.

AB  - Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) produced from various pyrogenic and petrogenic sources in the environment has been linked to a variety of toxic effects in the human body. Genome-wide analyses have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can function as novel and minimally invasive biomarkers of environmental exposure to PAHs. The objective of this study is to explore miRNA signatures associated with early health effects in response to chronic environmental exposure to PAHs. We systematically searched Scopus and PubMed databases for studies related to exposure of PAHs with changes in miRNA expression patterns that represent early health effects in the exposed population. Based on previous studies, we included 15 cell-based and 9 each of animal model and human population-based studies for assessment. A total of 11 differentially expressed PAH-responsive miRNAs were observed each in two or more cell-based studies (miR-181a and miR-30c-1), animal model studies (miR-291a and miR-292), and human population-based studies (miR-126, miR-142-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-27a-3p, miR-28-5p, and miR-320b). In addition, miRNAs belonging to family miR-122, miR-199, miR-203, miR-21, miR-26, miR-29, and miR-92 were found to be PAH-responsive in both animal model and cell-based studies; let-7, miR-126, miR-146, miR-30, and miR-320 in both cell-based and human population-based studies; and miR-142, miR-150, and miR-27 were found differentially expressed in both animal model and human population-based studies. The only miRNA whose expression was found to be altered in all the three groups of studies is miR-34c. Association of environmental exposure to PAHs with altered expression of specific miRNAs indicates that selective miRNAs can be used as early warning biomarkers in PAH-exposed population.

AB  - Shyness, which is characterized by social withdrawal behaviours and approaching-withdrawal conflicted social motivations, is suggested to influence children's social-emotional development. This study examined the association between shyness and social-emotional development among Chinese children aged 3 to 12. A systematic search of both Chinese and international databases for relevant research between 1990 and 2020 yielded 23 studies (n = 9,009 children), which were systematically reviewed. Among them, 15 studies (n = 6,303 children) were included in the meta-analyses. Results from random-effects models indicated that shyness was positively associated with internalizing problems (r=.21,p<.01), externalizing problems (r=.14,p<.01), peer victimization (r=.23,p<.05), and asocial behaviours (r=.47,p<.05), and negatively associated with peer preference (r=-.19,p<.01) and school social competence (for school-aged children r=-.19,p<.01; for preschool children r=-.22,p<.01) in the Chinese context. Further, analyses revealed that the relationship between shyness and social-emotional development was moderated by children's characteristics (e.g., gender, age, receptive vocabulary, and emotional competence), social relationship (e.g., teacher-child relationship and parent-child attachment), and situational context (e.g., interpersonal similarity). This study suggests that shyness generally exerts negative influences on Chinese children's social-emotional development, but the influences are unique to particular social-emotional domains and moderated by both children's characteristics and environmental factors.

AB  - Pervasive pregnancy denial is a misunderstood reproductive anomaly which compromises the health of both mother and the developing fetus. Because in extreme cases, the death of the neonate at the hands of his/her mother has criminal repercussions, research has attempted to explain the origins of this clinical phenomenon. The purpose of this review is to analyze the evolution of understanding the association between pregnancy denial and neonaticide. This paper identifies the consistent similarities in symptom presentation, particularly dissociation, when a denied pregnancy ends with the death of the newborn. The common thread across the progression of the literature over time serves as a foundation for considering the development of diagnostic criteria for future inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This paper reviews the seminal research from 1969 to current research up to 2020 addressing pregnancy denial and its connection to neonaticide. Peer reviewed and published articles related to key terms around "pregnancy denial," "pregnancy concealment," "neonaticide," and "dissociation" were retrieved from major databases such as PubMed, PsychINFO, JSTOR, ProQEST, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Reference lists of relevant articles were also scanned to search for further papers pertaining to similarities in symptom presentation across demographic profiles. Papers were excluded if they were not available in English, or if they did not contribute to identifying consistencies in clinical presentation when a pregnancy is denied. There are clear repetitive markers that occur across studies which pertain not only to the frequent absence of certain expected indicators of pregnancy, (i.e. no morning sickness, weight gain, or sensations of fetal movement), but also the misattribution of pregnancy-related symptoms, and the consistent experience of a dissociative episode while giving birth that can unintentionally result in neonaticide. This paper concludes that dissociation is a consistently seen symptom in pervasive pregnancy denial. Dissociation, in addition to other commonly seen symptoms across cases, suggests specific diagnostic criteria that lend themselves to inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune-mediated disease that damages the central nervous system. MS pathophysiological features are not entirely understood, but the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) possibly causes myelin and oligodendrocyte degeneration. ROS-increased production generates new compounds through oxidative modifications, including advanced oxidative protein products (AOPPs). The AOPPs are oxidative stress biomarkers and inflammatory mediators commonly formed by hypochlorous acid oxidative action on albumin. Considering that AOPPs accumulation produces ROS and induces neuronal apoptosis, these may represent a new target for drug development to MS treatment and a possible biomarker to monitor the severity of the disease. Thus, this review aims to investigate if there is an alteration in the AOPPs levels in MS and its possible involvement in patient disability. The second objective is to analyze whether drugs or compounds used in MS treatment could modify the AOPPs levels. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020203268). The databases' search yielded 327 articles. We excluded 259 duplicated articles and evaluated 68 articles by the title and abstract. We full-text analyzed 17 articles and included 13 articles. The AOPPs levels were increased in not-treated MS patients. Furthermore, the increase in disability status was associated with AOPPs accumulation in not-treated MS patients. Additionally, the AOPPs levels were reduced in MS patients after treatment. Therefore, AOPPs seem to play a role in MS pathophysiology and may become a new target for drug development and help MS diagnosis or treatment follow-up.

Design A systematic literature search was conducted. In all, 46 studies were included in the review. Among these, 16 studies were compared with a meta-analytical approach in order to 1) estimate the effect size of state disgust on screening intention and attendance; 2) examine whether methodological characteristics moderate the effect of state disgust on screening behaviour; 3) estimate the effect sizes of trait disgust and type of exam kit on state disgust. Results In the reviewed studies, state disgust was often associated with CRC screening and especially with CRC screening avoidance. The meta-analysis confirmed low-to-moderate negative effects of state disgust on screening intention and attendance. Population sampling strategy was the only significant moderator of the effect of state disgust on screening attendance, i.e. studies that used convenience (versus random/representative) samples found a significantly lower effect size. Trait disgust and type of exam kit exerted a large and a moderate-to-large positive effect, respectively, on state disgust. Conclusions Disgust can boost CRC screening avoidance. Further studies and interventions must be designed to help patients in overcoming this emotional barrier.

AB  - Objective This review synthesizes the literature on benefit-finding and growth (BFG) among youth with medical illnesses and disabilities and their parents. Specifically, we summarized: (a) methods for assessing BFG; (b) personal characteristics, personal, and environmental resources, as well as positive outcomes, associated with BFG; (c) interventions that have enhanced BFG; and (d) the quality of the literature. Methods A medical research librarian conducted the search across PubMed, Scopus, Psyclnfo, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Studies on BFG among children ages 0-18 with chronic illnesses and disabilities, or the parents of these youth were eligible for inclusion. Articles were uploaded into Covidence; all articles were screened by two reviewers, who then extracted data (e.g., study characteristics and findings related to BFG) independently and in duplicate for each eligible study. The review was based on a systematic narrative synthesis framework and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020189339). Results In total, 110 articles were included in this review. Generally, BFG capabilities were present across a range of pediatric health conditions and disabilities. Correlates of both youth and parent BFG are presented, including personal and environmental resources, coping resources, and positive outcomes. In addition, studies describing interventions aimed at enhancing BFG are discussed, and a quality assessment of the included studies is provided. Conclusions Recommendations are provided regarding how to assess BFG and with whom to study BFG to diversify and extend our current literature.

AB  - Culinary-based self-care programs are innovative and increasingly utilized models for catalyzing behavior change and improving health and well-being. The content, duration, and delivery of existing programs vary considerably. Between January and August 2019, we developed a teaching kitchen and self-care curriculum, which was administered as part of a year-long worksite well-being program to employees at an academic healthcare system. The curriculum domains included culinary skills, nutrition, physical activity, yoga, stress management, mindful eating, and ethnobotany. An informal systematic literature search was performed to assemble and evaluate key principles and practices related to self-care domains, learning methodologies, and programmatic design considerations. Here, we provide a qualitative summary of the evidence-informed development of the curriculum intervention.

KW  - COUNTRY
AB  - Introduction The cultural determinants of health centre an Indigenous definition of health, and have been linked to positive health and wellbeing outcomes. There is growing evidence for the importance of the cultural determinants of health; however, to date, no high-level overview of the evidence-base has been provided. Synthesising existing literature on cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal peoples in a single manuscript will highlight what we know, and what needs to be explored in future research. It will also contribute to global efforts to capture the evidence of cultural determinant approaches amongst Indigenous populations. We therefore endeavoured to identify cultural determinants and highlight their impact on Aboriginal health and wellbeing outcomes, and outline the relationship and interconnection of different cultural determinants of health. Methods An overview of reviews was conducted. Medline (Ovid) and Scopus were searched using terms related to 'cultural determinants of health' and an 'Aboriginal definition of health'. The database search was complemented by a web-based search of grey literature. Nine reviews were retrieved and included in our overview. Results Family/community, Country and place, cultural identity and self-determination were strongly identified across reviews as having a positive impact on the health and wellbeing outcomes of Aboriginal peoples. Family/community and Country and place were found to be components of 'culture' that shaped cultural identity. Self-determination was outlined as a requirement for Aboriginal peoples to pursue their cultural, social, and economic rights. Discussion/conclusions Cultural determinants are associated with health benefits for Indigenous peoples. A causal framework, developed to discuss the relationship and interconnection of the cultural determinants of health, demonstrates that cultural identity at an individual-level is important to benefiting from other cultural determinants of health. While self-determination and connection to culture and community-controlled organisations are integral factors to increase Aboriginal resilience and resistance and improve health and wellbeing outcomes. Further research is required to shift towards a multi-level understanding of the cultural determinants of health and to develop an Indigenous-led evidence-base around causal pathways. Such a shift would ensure priorities important to Indigenous peoples are captured in policy and practice.

AB  - Previous studies on the development of executive functions (EFs) in middle childhood have traditionally focused on cognitive, or "cool," EFs: working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. However, knowledge of the development of socio-emotional, or "hot," EFs, such as delay of gratification, decision-making and theory of mind, is more limited. The main aims of this systematic review were to characterize the typical development of both the primary cool and hot EFs in middle childhood, and to identify the main tools for evaluating EFs as a whole. We conducted a systematic search on studies of cognitive and socio-emotional EFs published in the last 5 years in Pubmed, PsycInfo, and WoS databases. Of 44 studies selected, we found a variety of tasks measuring cool EFs, while measures of hot EFs were limited. Nevertheless, the available data suggest that cool and hot components follow distinct, but related, developmental trajectories during middle childhood.

AB  - Job-related stress may affect smoking initiation, progression, and intensity, therefore, it is important to have a better understanding of these associations to design targeted and effective workplace cessation programs. In this study, we aimed to synthesize existing literature concerning the relationship between job-related stress and tobacco use among adult workers (18 years and older). We searched articles indexed in six major databases (Scopus, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Ovid) between 1997 and March 2020. We included cross-sectional and cohort studies published in English that examined self-reported smoking status or change in smoking status as exposure variables, and job-related status as the outcome variable consistent with the Demand Control Support and Effort-Reward Imbalance models. We searched the databases using combinations of keywords including "occupational stress," or "job stress" or "work stress" or "job strain" and "smoking" or "tobacco use" or "tobacco consumption" or "cigarettes." Of 906 identified articles, 19 (n = 240,787 participants) were included in this review. Findings showed no clear association between job-related stress and smoking status (smoking vs nonsmoking) and smoking cessation. However, the findings suggest an association between job-related stress and changing smoking habits, toward heavier smoking. Our findings indicate that job-related stress may lead to increased smoking intensity.

AB  - Background: Stress disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are attracting much attention. However, the relationship between traumatic stress and inflammation is rarely discussed.
   Subjects and Methods: As studies have linked PTSD to altered susceptibility to various diseases, such a psychiatric condition may lead to long-term systematic changes in physiological functions. We searched PubMed with the keywords "traumatic stress," "stress disorders," "post-traumatic stress disorder," and "inflammation."
   Results: Based on 65 previously published studies, we reviewed the long-term effects of PTSD, as well as traumatic events, on inflammatory function from both epidemiological and biological perspectives. Post-traumatic stress disorder is related to the immune response, including an increase in inflammatory factors and a reduction in anti-inflammatory factors. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that traumatic stress disorder and immune disease share a common genetic basis at the gene expression level.
   Conclusions: Understanding this relationship is of great significance for optimizing treatment plans for patients with PTSD.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by neuronal impairment and loss of function, and with the major shared histopathological hallmarks of misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins inside or outside cells. Some genetic and environmental factors contribute to the promotion of the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. It has been revealed that bidirectional communication exists between the brain and the gut. The gut microbiota is a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem and can be modified by genetic and environmental factors. The gut microbiota provides potential therapeutic targets that can be regulated as new interventions for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss genetic and environmental risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, summarize the communication among the components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and discuss the treatment strategy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT is a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and restoration of the gut microbiota to a premorbid state is a novel goal for prevention and treatment strategies.

AB  - The transition to parenthood is a high-risk time in a person's mental health and requires significant psychological adaptation to incorporate the parental role and creates a unique opportunity for intervention. This period has critical significance for infant development and for the emerging attachment relationship. The aim of this review was to identify and describe the effects of psychological interventions delivered in pregnancy which support the transition to parenthood and prepare parents for early parenting. A search of four key databases for papers published since 2000 identified only 13 eligible publications describing seven interventions. The included interventions involved variable treatment approaches, target outcomes and measures, and while they showed important applications of theoretical knowledge in empirical form, the results were highly mixed and aside from one intervention, were not replicated with a variety of samples over time. There are only a limited number of studies available despite strong theoretical and clinical knowledge which suggests these types of interventions would likely to beneficial and extremely important in preventing significant long-term issues. Significantly more research is needed to determine effective interventions which can be implemented in the antenatal period to prepare first-time parents for parenting and to avoid early relational trauma and attachment difficulties.

AB  - Introduction: Sialorrhoea, or excessive salivation, is common in psychiatric patients. This can be distressing because of its physical and psychosocial complications. Sialorrhoea due to psychotropic drugs has been reported repeatedly in the literature. Clozapine is the antipsychotic most commonly associated with sialorrhoea. Objective: The objective of this review was to examine and discuss the existing literature on all psychotropic drugs associated with sialorrhoea, except clozapine. Methods: Google Scholar and PubMed were searched for the literature on psychotropic-induced sialorrhoea. The search terms used were sialorrhoea, antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizer, and benzodiazepines. Case reports on patients suffering from psychotropic-induced sialorrhoea except clozapine are reviewed in this study. Results: The pathophysiology behind psychotropic-induced sialorrhoea, the population susceptible to sialorrhoea, and the exact duration from the start of sialorrhoea the drug course to the onset of sialorrhoea are unknown. Also, sialorrhoea is not associated with drug toxicity and is observed even in patients receiving normal doses of psychotropic medications. Treatment involves dose reduction, discontinuation of drugs responsible for the adverse effect, or adding anticholinergic drugs. Conclusion: Sialorrhoea due to clozapine has been reported in the literature. Many other antipsychotics, antidepressants such as sertraline, and other psychotropic drugs such as lithium have also been reported to cause sialorrhoea. No increase in the risk of sialorrhoea was seen in any of the age groups, and no association was found with treatment duration. In cases of lithium-induced sialorrhoea, no relationship was observed between serum levels of lithium and sialorrhoea.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are one of the major health threats to human characterized by selective and progressive neuronal loss. The mechanisms of NDs are still not fully understood. The study of genetic defects and disease-related proteins offers us a window into the mystery of it, and the extension of knowledge indicates that different NDs share similar features, mechanisms, and even genetic or protein abnormalities. Among these findings, PARK7 and its production DJ-1 protein, which was initially found implicated in PD, have also been found altered in other NDs. PARK7 mutations, altered expression and posttranslational modification (PTM) cause DJ-1 abnormalities, which in turn lead to downstream mechanisms shared by most NDs, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, autophagy defects, and so on.

AB  - Successful clinical translation of stem cell-based therapy largely relies on the scalable and reproducible preparation of donor cells with potent therapeutic capacities. In this study, midbrain organoids were yielded from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to prepare cells for Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy. Neural stem/precursor cells (NSCs) isolated from midbrain organoids (Og-NSCs) expanded stably and differentiated into midbrain-type dopamine(mDA) neurons, and an unprecedentedly high proportion expressed midbrain-specific factors, with relatively low cell line and batch-to-batch variations. Single cell transcriptome analysis followed by in vitro assays indicated that the majority of cells in the Og-NSC cultures are ventral midbrain (VM)-patterned with low levels of cellular senescence/aging and mitochondrial stress, compared to those derived from 2D-culture environments. Notably, in contrast to current methods yielding mDA neurons without astrocyte differentiation, mDA neurons that differentiated from Og-NSCs were interspersed with astrocytes as in the physiologic brain environment. Thus, the Og-NSC-derived mDA neurons exhibited improved synaptic maturity, functionality, resistance to toxic insults, and faithful expressions of the midbrain-specific factors, in vitro and in vivo long after transplantation. Consequently, Og-NSC transplantation yielded potent therapeutic outcomes that are reproducible in PD model animals. Collectively, our observations demonstrate that the organoid-based method may satisfy the demands needed in the clinical setting of PD cell therapy.

AB  - rhythm recorded as an extracellular synchronous field potential is generated in a number of brain sites including the hippocampus. The physiological occurrence of hippocampal theta rhythm is associated with the activation of a number of structures forming the ascending brainstem-hippocampal synchronizing pathway. Experimental evidence indicates that the supramammillary nucleus and posterior hypothalamic nuclei, consid-ered as the posterior hypothalamic area, comprise a critical node of this ascending pathway. The posterior hypothalamic area plays an important role in movement control, place-learning, memory processing, emotion and arousal. In the light of multiplicity of functions of the posterior hypothalamic area and the influence of theta field oscillations on a number of neural processes, it is the authors' intent to summarize the data concerning the involvement of the supramammillary nucleus and posterior hypothalamic nuclei in the modulation of limbic theta rhythmicity as well as the ability of these brain structures to independently generate theta rhythmicity.

AB  - As a major eukaryotic cell clearing machinery, autophagy grants cell proteostasis, which is key for neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival. In line with this, besides neuropathological events, autophagy dysfunctions are bound to synaptic alterations that occur in mental disorders, and early on, in neurodegenerative diseases. This is also the case of methamphetamine (METH) abuse, which leads to psychiatric disturbances and neurotoxicity. While consistently altering the autophagy machinery, METH produces behavioral and neurotoxic effects through molecular and biochemical events that can be recapitulated by autophagy blockade. These consist of altered physiological dopamine (DA) release, abnormal stimulation of DA and glutamate receptors, as well as oxidative, excitotoxic, and neuroinflammatory events. Recent molecular insights suggest that METH early impairs the autophagy machinery, though its functional significance remains to be investigated. Here we discuss evidence suggesting that alterations of DA transmission and autophagy are intermingled within a chain of events underlying behavioral alterations and neurodegenerative phenomena produced by METH. Understanding how METH alters the autophagy machinery is expected to provide novel insights into the neurobiology of METH addiction sharing some features with psychiatric disorders and parkinsonism.

The number of empirical studies on positive potentials of mindfulness is comparatively less, and their known status in academia is ambiguous. Hence, the current paper aimed to review the studies where mindfulness-based interventions had integrated positive psychology variables, in order to produce positive functioning.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the databases of PubMed, Scopus, and PsycNet and manual search in Google Scholar. From the 3831 articles, irrelevant or inaccessible studies were eliminated, reducing the number of final articles chosen for review to 21. Interventions that contribute to enhancement of eudaimonia, hedonia, and other positive variables are discussed.
   Results: Findings include the potential positive qualities of MBIs in producing specific positive outcomes within limited circumstances, and ascendancy of hedonia and other positive variables over eudaimonic enhancement.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, exigency of modifications in the existing MBIs to bring about exclusively positive outcomes was identified, and observed the necessity of novel interventions for eudaimonic enhancement and elevation of hedonia in a comprehensive manner.

AB  - A growing number of adolescents who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) have been reported worldwide. Despite numerous investigations about NSSI, this self-harming behavioral process mostly found among adolescents has not been examined much in non-western countries like the Philippines. This grounded theory study purports to investigate and understand the dynamic process of deliberate self-harm among 20 Filipino adolescents performing non-suicidal self-injury. Field texts were analyzed using repertory grid and with-in and cross-case analysis. Thick description of data and saturation, prolonged engagement, member checking technique, triangulation, theoretical sampling, bracketing, peer debriefers, self-reflective journals, and audit trails were likewise employed to ensure trustworthiness of findings. Results of the individual interviews conducted were able to explain the phenomenon and a four-phased process surfaced to characterize non-suicidal self-injury. The R.I.S.E. of the Phoenix illustrates how Filipino adolescents experience engaging with non-suicidal self-injury in four phases: (1) ruining, (2) impassing, (3) separating, and (4) emerging. Considering this process may equip psychological health personnel with the knowledge on relevant interventions in providing comprehensive support to Filipino adolescent self-harmers.

AB  - Background Increasing number of service users diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychosis are being discharged from specialist secondary care services to primary care, many of whom are prescribed long-term antipsychotics. It is unclear if General Practitioners (GPs) have the confidence and experience to appropriately review and adjust doses of antipsychotic medication without secondary care support. Aim To explore barriers and facilitators of conducting antipsychotic medication reviews in primary care for individuals with no specialist mental health input. Design & setting Realist review in general practice settings. Method A realist review has been conducted to synthesise evidence on antipsychotic medication reviews conducted in primary care with service users diagnosed with schizophrenia or psychosis. Following initial scoping searches and discussions with stakeholders, a systematic search and iterative secondary searches were conducted. Articles were systematically screened and analysed to develop a realist programme theory explaining the contexts (C) and mechanisms (M) which facilitate or prevent antipsychotic medication reviews (O) in primary care settings, and the potential outcomes of medication reviews. Results Meaningful Antipsychotic medication reviews may not occur for individuals with only primary care medical input. Several, often mutually reinforcing, mechanisms have been identified as potential barriers to conducting such reviews, including low expectations of recovery for people with severe mental illness, a perceived lack of capability to understand and participate in medication reviews, linked with a lack of information shared in appointments between GPs and Service Users, perceived risk and uncertainty regarding antipsychotic medication and illness trajectory. Conclusions The review identified reciprocal and reinforcing stereotypes affecting both GPs and service users. Possible mechanisms to counteract these barriers are discussed, including realistic expectations of medication, and the need for increased information sharing and trust between GPs and service users.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to present the current state of evidence regarding the mental health literacy of paramedics and student paramedics and whether mental health literacy affects the care that paramedics provide to their patients with mental illness. Design/methodology/approach Embase, PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar were searched for recent (2010-2020) English language published articles using the key phrases paramedic AND/OR ambulance AND mental health AND mental health literacy. Additional searches of the reference lists of included articles were undertaken. A descriptive thematic analysis was used to arrive at a narrative synthesis of the study findings. Findings The emergency medical services system has taken a primary role in the care of patients with mental illness but has limited capacity for non-emergency psychosocial situations. Negative and judgemental attitudes amongst paramedics towards patients with mental illness is a significant issue and remains a barrier to patients seeking medical care for mental illness. Improved care provision and patient engagement might result from specific education aimed to better enhance paramedics' mental health literacy. Originality/value This literature review provides insights into the current practice of mental health training for Australian undergraduate paramedic science students and the implications for patient care. Recommendations for educational strategies are provided.

AB  - Caffeine has been identified as emerging contaminant of concern due to its widespread occurrence in the aquatic environment and potential to be biologically active. Recently, these concerns have been translated in an increasing research on its occurrence and effects on biota. However, there is still a limited knowledge on seawater matrices and the implications of caffeine presence in coastal and marine ecosystems are not fully known. The present review aims to fill these knowledge gaps, analysing the existing literature regarding the occurrence, effects and potential risks of caffeine residues to coastal ecosystems, contributing to the risk assessment of this psychoactive drug in the aquatic environment. The analysed literature reported caffeine concentrations in the coastal ecosystems, raising high concerns about the potential adverse impacts on the ecological safety and human health. Caffeine has been found in tissues from coastal and marine biota including microalgae, coral reefs, bivalves and fish due to bioaccumulation after chronic, long-term exposures in a contaminated environment. Additionally, caffeine residues had been demonstrated to have adverse impacts on aquatic organisms, at environmentally realistic concentrations, inducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, neurotoxicity, changing energy reserves and metabolic activity, affecting reproduction and development and, in some cases, causing mortality. Considering the increasing adverse impacts of caffeine pollution in the coastal environment, this review highlights the urgent need to minimize the increasing load of caffeine to the aquatic ecosystems; being imperative the implementation of scientific programs and projects to classify effectively the caffeine as a high-priority environmentally hazardous emerging pollutant.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are progressive and ultimately fatal. NDD onset is influenced by several factors including heredity and environmental cues. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNA molecules with: (i) lengths greater than 200 nucleotides, (ii) diverse biological functions, and (iii) highly conserved structures. They directly interact with molecules such as proteins and microRNAs and subsequently regulate the expression of their targets at the genetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels. Emerging studies indicate the important roles of lncRNAs in the progression of neurological diseases including NDDs. Additionally, improvements in detection technologies have enabled quantitative lncRNA detection and application to circulating fluids in clinical settings. Here, we review current research on lncRNAs in animal models and patients with NDDs. We also discuss the potential applicability of circulating lncRNAs as biomarkers in NDD diagnostics and prognostics. In the future, a better understanding of the roles of lncRNAs in NDDs will be essential to exploit these new therapeutic targets and improve noninvasive diagnostic methods for diseases.

KW  - Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS)
AB  - Introduction Worldwide, one in five children and adolescents suffer from mental health disorders, while facing limited opportunities for treatment and recovery. Growing up, they face multiple challenges that might contribute to the development of mental disorders. Uganda is a developing country with a history of prolonged civil and regional wars associated with child soldiers, large numbers of refugees and internally displaced people due to natural disasters and unrests, and a large infectious disease burden mainly due to acute respiratory tract infections, malaria and HIV/AIDS. Objective This paper aims to examine the current status of child and adolescent mental health services in Uganda. Methodology A scoping review approach was used to select studies on child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in Uganda. A search of MEDLINE, Wiley and PubMed databases was conducted using eligibility criteria. The papers were summarized in tables and then synthesized using the Frameworks for monitoring health systems performance designed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This was done according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and M-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Results Twelve studies were identified; five of them used qualitative methods and focused mostly on the current limitations and strengths of CAMHS in Uganda, while six quantitative studies investigated the effects of new interventions. One study used a mixed-methods approach. In summary, the papers outlined a need for collaboration with the primary health sector and traditional healers to ensure additional human resources, as well as the need to focus on groups such as orphans, HIV/AIDS-affected youth, former child soldiers and refugees. Conclusion Relatively few studies have been conducted on CAMHS in Uganda, and most of those that exist are part of larger studies involving multiple countries. CAMHS in Uganda require improvement and needs to focus especially on vulnerable groups such as orphans, HIV/AIDS-affected youth and former child soldiers.

AB  - The literature on the application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is unclear, even though its neuromodulatory effects on underlying neural circuitry involved in BPD symptoms suggest that it could be a potential treatment option. We sought to review the evidence on rTMS as a treatment option in BPD. PubMed (for Medline database), Google Scholar, and Scopus were systematically searched following the PRISMA guidelines for studies of any design examining the application of the rTMS treatment in adult patients with precise and primary diagnosis of BPD written in the English language. The systematic review has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020215927). Forty one records were screened, and eight fulfilled inclusion criteria (total of 63 patients). The existing studies suggest that rTMS is a well-tolerated treatment in patients with BPD. Double-blind randomized controlled studies are necessary to help elucidate the effects of rTMS in the different symptoms in BPD and establish efficacy and the best cortical targets and stimulation protocols. Longitudinal studies that combine evidenced based psychotherapy with rTMS may be a future line of investigation that could potentially improve outcomes for this population.

AB  - Objective: Both yoga practice and spirituality are associated with beneficial mental health outcomes. Within yoga research, however, spirituality is still a widely neglected area. The present systematic review aims to explore empirical studies, which do, in fact, investigate the relationship between yoga and spirituality in order to provide an overview and future directions for research on this topic. The review examines whether available empirical research supports an association between yoga practice and spirituality and, if so, which specific aspects of spirituality are associated with yoga practice.
   Methods: The systematic review followed the PRISMA guideline (Prospero registration number: CRD42020155043). Empirical studies written in English, German, or Hungarian language were selected from a database search in Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and Science Direct. A total of 30 studies met the final inclusion criteria.
   Results: According to the quantitative and qualitative studies reviewed, yoga practice seems to be positively associated with spirituality. This association concerns various aspects of spirituality, such as spiritual aspirations, a search for insight/wisdom, an integrative worldview, a sense of meaning and peace, faith, hope, compassion, and happiness within. To harness the potential spiritual benefits of yoga, regular practice appears to be essential. Yoga practitioners seem to have both physical and spiritual motives for practicing. At least in Western societies, however, physical intentions are more prevalent than spiritual ones. The meaning of spirituality for yoga practitioners is also discussed. Due to risk of bias of the majority of the reviewed studies, however, outcomes must be taken with caution.
   Conclusion: Yoga practice may be positively associated with several aspects of spirituality. For more evidence, further investigation of the topic is suggested. Particularly, we propose the inclusion of holistic forms of yoga practice and a comparison of Eastern and Western approaches to yoga.

AB  - The benefits of mindfulness are widely recognized, and it has received increasing research attention. Recently, researchers have extended the concept and practice of mindfulness to the parent-child relationship and proposed the construct of mindful parenting, that is, parenting with mindfulness. However, mindful parenting is a relatively new concept in the field of family studies, and the contents, psychometrically robust measures, outcomes, and cultivation methods of mindful parenting warrant in-depth exploration. This article presents a systematic review of mindful parenting. We first conceptualized mindful parenting by consolidating the existence of this construct. Then, we summarized various measurements to assess this construct, and reviewed theoretical models and empirical research on the roles of mindful parenting. We also illustrated the ways to enhance mindful parenting and provided current evidence regarding these methods. Further, we discussed the limitations in this field and proposed future research directions.

AB  - The Australian and Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines for children and youth synthesized studies in English and French or other languages (if able to be translated with Google translate) and found very few studies published in English from Arabic countries that examined the relationship between objectively measured sedentary behaviour (SB), sleep and physical activity (PA) and health indicators in children aged 5-12 years. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the relationships between 24-hour movement behaviours and health indicators in school-aged children from Arab-speaking countries. Online databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTdiscus, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Scopus were searched for English, French and Arabic studies (written in English), while Saudi Digital Library, ArabBase, HumanIndex, KSUP, Pan-Arab Academic Journal, e-Marefa, Al Manhal eLibrary and Google Scholar were searched for Arabic studies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence for each health indicator. A total of 16 studies, comprising 15,346 participants from nine countries were included. These studies were conducted between 2000 and 2019. In general, low levels of PA and sleep and high SB were unfavourably associated with adiposity outcomes, behavioural problems, depression and low self-esteem. Favourable associations were reported between sleep duration and adiposity outcomes. SB was favourably associated with adiposity outcomes, withdrawn behaviour, attention and externalizing problems. PA was favourably associated with improved self-esteem and adiposity outcomes. Further studies to address the inequality in the literature in the Arab-speaking countries to understand the role of 24-hour movement behaviours and its positive influence on health outcomes across childhood are urgently needed.

AB  - Pneumoconiosis, or occupational lung disease, is one of the world's most prevalent work-related diseases. Silicosis, a type of pneumoconiosis, is caused by inhaling respirable crystalline silica (RCS) dust. Although silicosis can be fatal, it is completely preventable. Hundreds of thousands of workers globally are at risk of being exposed to RCS at the workplace from various activities in many industries. Currently, in Australia and internationally, there are a range of methods used for the respiratory surveillance of workers exposed to RCS. These methods include health and exposure questionnaires, spirometry, chest X-rays, and HRCT. However, these methods predominantly do not detect the disease until it has significantly progressed. For this reason, there is a growing body of research investigating early detection methods for silicosis, particularly biomarkers. This literature review summarises the research to date on early detection methods for silicosis and makes recommendations for future work in this area. Findings from this review conclude that there is a critical need for an early detection method for silicosis, however, further laboratory- and field-based research is required.

AB  - There is an increasing call for recovery-oriented services but few reviews have been undertaken regarding such interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on recovery services to improve the lives of adults living with severe mental illness. An integrative review methodology was used. We searched published literature from seven databases: Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Mixed-methods synthesis was used to analyse the data. Out of 40 included papers, 62.5% (25/40) used quantitative data, 32.5% used qualitative and 5% (2/40) used mixed methods. The participants in the included papers were mostly adults with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. This review identified three recovery-oriented services-integrated recovery services, individual placement services and recovery narrative photovoice and art making. The recovery-oriented services are effective in areas such as medication and treatment adherence, improving functionality, symptoms reduction, physical health and social behaviour, self-efficacy, economic empowerment, social inclusion and household integration. We conclude that mental health professionals are encouraged to implement the identified recovery services to improve the recovery goals of consumers.

AB  - Background Road traffic injuries, which are responsible for premature deaths and functional losses, are the leading causes of unintentional injuries in Ethiopia. As most studies on road traffic injuries, so far, have been either local or regional, it is believed that combining the regional or local data to get nationally representative information could help programme implementers in setting priorities. Objective The aim of this review was to estimate the proportion of road traffic injuries, mortality and risk factors for the problem among all age groups in Ethiopia. Data sources A systematic review of articles using MEDLINE/PubMed SCOPUS Web of Science and science direct was conducted. Additional studies were identified via manual search. Study selection Only studies that reported road traffic injuries and/or mortalities for all age groups were included in this review. Data synthesis All pooled analyses were based on random-effect models. Twenty-six studies for the prevalence of RTIs (n=37 424), 24 studies for road traffic injuries (RTI) mortality, (n=38 888), 9 studies for prevalence of fracture among RTIs (n=2817) and 5 studies for the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (n=1733) met our inclusion criteria. Driving in the dark increased severity of injury by 1.77, 95% CI 1.60 to 1.95). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Conclusion In this review, the burden of road traffic injuries and mortalities remains high in Ethiopia. Human factors are the most common causes of the problem in Ethiopia. The existing safety regulations should be re-evaluated and supported by continuous behavioural interventions. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019124406.

AB  - Police, ambulance and mental health tri-response services are a relatively new model of responding to people experiencing mental health crisis in the community, but limited evidence exists examining their efficacy. To date there have been no systematic reviews that have examined the association between the tri-response model and rates of involuntary detentions. A systematic review examining co-response models demonstrated possible reduction in involuntary detention, however, recommended further research. The aim of this protocol is to describe how we will systematically review the evidence base around the relationship of the police, ambulance mental health tri-response models in reducing involuntary detentions. We will search health, policing and grey literature databases and include clinical evaluations of any design. Risk of bias will be determined using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool and a narrative synthesis will be undertaken to synthesis key themes. Risk of bias and extracted data will be summarized in tables and results synthesis tabulated to identify patterns within the included studies. The findings will inform future research into the effectiveness of tri-response police, ambulance, and mental health models in reducing involuntary detentions.

AB  - The Japanese population is rapidly aging, with fewer proportion of children, and its production-age population has decreased correspondingly, with a resulting shortage in nursing-care service providers. To cope with this situation, the Japanese government has focused on developing and deploying nursing-care robots to compensate for the shortage of human resources. As most nursing-care services are intended for the elderly and disabled, they are traditionally considered as human services. To implement nursing-care robots on a large scale, numerous approaches and measures have been considered, such as modeling the approaches to effectively use nursing-care robots in nursing-care fields, rewarding highly useful nursing-care robots with greater nursing-care compensations, and responding to consultations at nursing-care sites by building a platform to develop, demonstrate, and deploy nursing-care robots. However, nursing-care services using robots are still not popular because of prevailing anxieties about and resistance to such technologies; therefore, the promotion of nursing-care services using robot technologies remains a challenge. Presently, a system capable of supporting not only a single nursing-care scenario but also a series of nursing-care operations is highly desired. In the future, nursing-care services have to be made more rewarding using robots, for which it is vitally important to provide support in the form of evidence-based, scientific, and effective nursing-care services.

AB  - Poor oral health affects quality of life and daily functioning in the general population and especially in patients with mental health disorders. Due to the high burden of oral health-related quality of life in patients with a mental health disorder, it is important for nurses to know how they can intervene in an early phase. The aim of this systematic scoping review was to identify and appraise oral health interventions in patients with a mental health disorder. A systematic scoping review with a critical appraisal of the literature was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews and their checklists. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and reference lists were searched from their inception until December 2020. Results: Eleven quantitative studies were included in the review: four randomized controlled trials, six quasi-experimental studies and one cohort study. Studies focused on interventions for patients (n = 8) or focused on patients together with their professionals (n = 3). Four types of oral health interventions in mental health were found: (I) educational interventions; (II) physical interventions; (III) interventions combining behavioural and educational elements and (IV) interventions combining educational and physical elements. All studies (n = 11) had an evaluation period <= 12 months. Nine studies showed an effect on the short term (<= 12 months) with regard to oral health knowledge, oral health behaviour, or physical oral health outcomes (e.g., plaque index). Two studies showed no effects on any outcome. Overall, the methodological insufficient to good. Conclusion: Four types of interventions with positive effects (<= 12 months) on oral health knowledge, oral health behaviour, and physical oral health outcomes in different diagnostic patient groups were found. Due to the heterogeneity in both interventions, diagnostic groups and outcomes, one golden standard oral health intervention cannot be advised yet, although the methodological quality of studies seems sufficient. Developing an integrated oral health toolkit might be of great importance in mental health considering its potential effect on oral health-related quality of life.

AB  - Microglia are the first line of defense at the level of the central nervous system (CNS). Phenotypic change in microglia can be regulated by various factors, including the orexin system. Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory process mediated by cytokines, by the lack of interaction between neurotransmitters and their specific receptors, caused by systemic tissue damage or, more often, associated with direct damage to the CNS. Chronic activation of microglia could lead to long-term neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to explore how tocopherol (vitamin E) and the orexin system may play a role in the prevention and treatment of microglia inflammation and, consequently, in neurodegenerative diseases thanks to its antioxidant properties. The results of animal and in vitro studies provide evidence to support the use of tocopherol for a reduction in microglia inflammation as well as a greater activation of the orexinergic system. Although there is much in vivo and in vitro evidence of vitamin E antioxidant and protective abilities, there are still conflicting results for its use as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases that speculate that vitamin E, under certain conditions or genetic predispositions, can be pro-oxidant and harmful.

AB  - Introduction: Thiamine is a water-soluble vitamin and is necessary for energy metabolism. Critically ill patients are at particular risk of developing thiamine deficiency and related complications. One of the complications that can occur is delirium. Delirium is a disorder that affects the body's response to treatment, length of stay in the ward, mortality, long-term cognitive impairment, and significantly increases treatment costs. In addition, studies show that delirium medication is more effective in preventing than in treating delirium. Given its low cost, availability, and minimal risk of side effects, thiamine supplementation could prove to be a relevant strategy in the prevention and treatment of delirium. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Ovid, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched using relevant keywords that focus on the use of thiamine to prevent or treat delirium in critically ill patients. Results: Seven articles were included in the analysis. Conclusion: The small number of studies and considerable heterogeneity prevent conclusions supporting the use of thiamine as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of delirium among critically ill patients. There is a need for high-quality, large-scale randomized clinical trials to confirm the beneficial effects of thiamine in the prevention and treatment of delirium.

TI  - A Vertiginous Experience: Historical Ethics and Practice in the Age of Trump
AB  - This essay considers Christopher Tomlins' thoughts-as expressed in his In the Matter of Nat Turner: A Speculative History-on historical ethics and practice in the context of recent and ongoing controversies concerning the history of race and slavery in the American past. Tomlins endeavors to recover as much as he can relating to Nat Turner and his mentalite at the time of the infamous 1831 rebellion. He also promises a self-conscious engagement with the creation of history as an intellectual practice, and invites readers to reflect on their standpoint in the histories they create. For Tomlins this practice means a close reading of Turner's "confession" through the work of social theorists, an approach that will likely prove controversial for some readers. For those who stay with him, however, Tomlins provides a bravura demonstration of historical methodology with implications for current debates and divisions within the wider field.

AB  - Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor in all living organisms. It is involved in a large number of biochemical processes functioning either as an activator of molecules with carbonyl groups or as a carrier of acyl moieties. Together with its thioester derivatives, it plays a central role in cell metabolism, post-translational modification, and gene expression. Furthermore, recent studies revealed a role for CoA in the redox regulation by the S-thiolation of cysteine residues in cellular proteins. The intracellular concentration and distribution in different cellular compartments of CoA and its derivatives are controlled by several extracellular stimuli such as nutrients, hormones, metabolites, and cellular stresses. Perturbations of the biosynthesis and homeostasis of CoA and/or acyl-CoA are connected with several pathological conditions, including cancer, myopathies, and cardiomyopathies. In the most recent years, defects in genes involved in CoA production and distribution have been found in patients affected by rare forms of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review, we will summarize the most relevant aspects of CoA cellular metabolism, their role in the pathogenesis of selected neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and recent advancements in the search for therapeutic approaches for such diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of a specific subset of dopamine-producing neurons. This triggers problems with movement as dopamine is key in regulating motor control. To date, available treatments compensate for dopamine deficiency but are not able to reverse the progressive neuronal cell damage. The exact cause of the loss of these neurons remains to be determined, although it has been linked to environmental factors, genetic predisposition and modifications to vital molecular pathways. Recent evidence shows that events causing reductions in oxygen supply (hypoxia) to these neurons might also be related to PD development. This review explores the link between hypoxia and Parkinson's disease as well as promising new therapeutic strategies based on HIF-1 alpha, a protein that controls the cellular response to hypoxia. Parkinson's disease affects around 6 million people, and it constitutes the fastest growing brain disorder worldwide. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to define its causes and investigate new therapies. Hypoxia is a condition characterized by insufficient tissue oxygenation, which results in impaired oxidative energy production. A reduction in cellular oxygen levels induces the stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-1 alpha), master regulator of the molecular response to hypoxia, involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and driving hypoxic adaptation through the control of gene expression. Due to its high energy requirement, the brain is particularly vulnerable to oxygen shortage. Thus, hypoxic injury can cause significant metabolic changes in neural cell populations, which are associated with neurodegeneration. Recent evidence suggests that regulating HIF-1 alpha may ameliorate the cellular damage in neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, the hypoxia/HIF-1 alpha signaling pathway has been associated to several processes linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) including gene mutations, risk factors and molecular pathways such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and protein degradation impairment. This review will explore the impact of hypoxia and HIF-1 alpha signaling on these specific molecular pathways that influence PD development and will evaluate different novel neuroprotective strategies involving HIF-1 alpha stabilization.

AB  - Aim Early Intervention in Psychosis teams (EITs) are a growing entity internationally, yet they remain under-researched given challenges facing their delivery. Model adaptations include stand-alone services, a hub-and-spoke model with various bases and integrating specialist staff into existing mental health teams. The present critical review focuses on reviewing the evidence base for the delivery of EITs in rural areas, first pertaining to evidence for model adherence and second to clinically outcomes. Method A systematic literature search was undertaken, finding 53 papers of interest. Nine papers met the inclusion criteria. A critical appraisal tool was used to consider the quality of the evidence and a narrative review of their findings is presented. Results The five studies reporting clinical outcomes of rural EITs demonstrate positive outcomes of a hub-and-spoke and stand-alone EIT on reducing hospital admissions, psychotic symptoms and improving quality of life. One study directly comparing hub-and-spoke to stand-alone EIT found that hub-and-spoke EIT had more positive outcomes than a stand-alone service. Of the studies attempting to promote adherence to EIT model in rural areas, services show low overall adherence and report issues pertaining to funding and managerial support for practical barriers to implementation. Conclusions EIT services in rural areas may show similar positive outcomes to urban areas and adaptations to suit rural populations appear acceptable, such as using a hub-and-spoke model, though further research is required. Adherence to EIT service models in rural areas may be limited and training programmes to promote adherence benefit from managerial and financial support.

AB  - Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an adapted form of cognitive behavioural therapy. ACT focuses on how thinking affects behaviour and promotes psychological flexibility. The prevalence of psychological distress among people living with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is high, and ACT may offer an alternative treatment approach. This scoping review explored the use of ACT as an intervention to support adults living with CVD and/or T2DM. A systematic search of the literature resulted in the inclusion of 15 studies. Studies were reviewed using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach to conducting scoping reviews. Most studies (n = 13) related to people living with T2DM, and most (n = 10) used a pre-post design, four studies were randomised controlled trials, and one was a qualitative study. Eight studies reported an improvement in the outcome(s) assessed post-intervention, suggesting that ACT was an acceptable and valid intervention to support people living with CVD or T2DM. However, studies were underpowered and only limited studies involved people living with CVD. ACT was assessed as a valuable approach to improve a range of patient-reported outcomes for those living with CVD or T2DM, and further research involving robust study designs and larger cohorts are warranted.

AB  - The known theories discussing the essence of consciousness have been recently updated. This prompts an attempt to integrate these explanations concerning several distinct components of the consciousness phenomenon such as the ego, and qualia perceptions. Therefore, it is useful to consider the latest publications on the 'Orch OR' and 'cemi' theories, which assume that quantum processing occurs in microtubules and that the brain's endogenous electromagnetic field is important. The authors combine these explanations with their own theory describing the neural circuits realizing imagery. They try to present such an interdisciplinary, integrated theoretical model in a manner intuitively understandable to people with a typical medical education. In order to do this, they even refer to intuitively understandable metaphors. The authors maintain that an effective comprehension of consciousness is important for health care professionals because its disorders are frequent medical symptoms in emergencies, during general anesthesia and in the course of cognitive disorders in elderly people. The authors emphasize the current possibilities to verify these theses regarding the essence of consciousness thanks to the development of functional brain imaging methods-magnetoencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation-as well as clinical studies on the modification of perceptions and feelings by such techniques as mindfulness and the use of certain psychoactive substances, especially among people with self-awareness and identity disorders.

AB  - Along with the burden commonly experienced by informal caregivers (ICs) of people with dementia (PwD), associated with the progressive decline that accompanies dementia, the lockdown due to the public health crisis has had a great negative impact on the emotional wellbeing, physical health, and social relationships of ICs. Support interventions through telemedicine represent an opportunity for ICs to learn the skills required for the care and maintenance of social networks. In this work, a narrative review of the effects of e-health training and social support interventions was carried out. A literature search was conducted using the ProQuest, Ovid, and Scopus databases. Information regarding social support (SS), psychological interventions, and training for the management of medications and behavioral changes was extracted. One hundred and nine studies were included in this review. Forums and training platforms were the main tools for ICs. The most effective platforms to improve SS include the participation of both ICs and health professionals. However, no significant improvements in objective caring skills were identified. Platforms developed specifically for ICs should be based in tools that ICs are familiar with, because many ICs have not yet incorporated Information and Communication Technologies in many activities of their daily lives. Education in the digitalization to ICs of PwD should be one of the priority objectives in telehealth interventions.

AB  - Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP), including gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE), characterize a major cause of maternal and prenatal morbidity and mortality. In this systematic review, we tested the hypothesis that occupational factors would impact the risk for HDP in pregnant workers. MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched for studies published between database inception and 1 April 2021. All observational studies enrolling > 10 pregnant workers and published in English were included. Un-experimental, non-occupational human studies were excluded. Evidence was synthesized according to the risk for HDP development in employed women, eventually exposed to chemical, physical, biological and organizational risk factors. The evidence quality was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Out of 745 records identified, 27 were eligible. No definite conclusions could be extrapolated for the majority of the examined risk factors, while more homogenous data supported positive associations between job-strain and HDP risk. Limitations due to the lack of suitable characterizations of workplace exposure (i.e., doses, length, co-exposures) and possible interplay with personal issues should be deeply addressed. This may be helpful to better assess occupational risks for pregnant women and plan adequate measures of control to protect their health and that of their children.

AB  - Simple Summary The clustering of metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors is becoming more prevalent in young people (up to the age of 19 years) leading to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases in early adulthood. The impact of MetS risk factors on cardiac autonomic modulation (CAM) or vice versa have been noted to track from childhood to pre-adolescence and adolescence. Understating associations in this age group may help improve the clinical outcomes of the MetS, even when MetS symptoms are not visible. Potential damage from each individual MetS component and the ability to predict early cardiac damage or upcoming cardiovascular events is very important. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the associations between CAM and MetS risk factors individually to verify which MetS risk components were significantly correlated with which heart rate variability (HRV) indices before or at the onset of the MetS among young people. The purpose of this review was to outline the importance of potentially screening HRV indices in young people even with only one MetS risk factor, as a pre-indicator for early cardiovascular risk stratification. Cross-sectional studies that examined the relationship of MetS risk factors with HRV indices were searched using four databases including PubMed, the Cochrane clinical trials library, Medline and the Web of Science. Correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and random effects meta-analyses of the association between MetS risk factors with HRV indices were performed. Our results propose that lipid profiles including high density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TGs), waist circumference (WC) and blood pressure (BP) are associated with CAM in young people up to the age of 19 years. The use of HRV indices to predict future MetS risk, and relationships with individual risk factors including HDL, BP, WC and TGs, were established. Furthermore, arterial pressure, respiration, stress and physical activity must be taken into consideration for future studies along with CAM related to young people (up to the age of 19 years), and it is recommended to explore further the associations reported here, as CAM is not the only determinant of neurovisceral regulation. Background: the clustering of metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors is becoming more prevalent in children, leading to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases in early adulthood. The impact of MetS risk factors on cardiac autonomic modulation (CAM) or vice versa has been noted to track from childhood to pre-adolescence and adolescence. Understating associations in this age group may help to improve the clinical outcomes of the MetS, even when MetS symptoms are not visible. Potential damage from each individual MetS component and the ability to predict early cardiac damage or upcoming cardiovascular events is very important. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the associations between CAM and MetS risk factors individually to verify which of the MetS risk components were significantly correlated with heart rate variability (HRV) indices before or at the onset of the MetS among young people. The purpose of this review was to outline the importance of potentially screening HRV indices in young people even with only one MetS risk factor, as a pre-indicator for early cardiovascular risk stratification.
   Methods: cross-sectional studies that examined the relationship of MetS risk factors with HRV indices were searched using four databases including PubMed, the Cochrane clinical trials library, Medline and the Web of Science. Correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and random effects meta-analyses of the association between MetS risk factors with HRV indices were performed. Results: out of 14 cross-sectional studies and one case-control study, 8 studies (10 data sets) provided association data for the meta-analysis. Our results indicated significant positive correlations for systolic blood pressure (SBP) (correlation coefficient 0.13 (95%CI: 0.06; 0.19), I-2 = 47.26%) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (correlation coefficient 0.09 (95%CI: -0.01; 0.18), I-2 = 0%) with a Low Frequency/High Frequency ratio (LF/HF). Significant negative correlations for waist circumference (WC) (correlation coefficient -0.12 (95%CI: -0.19; -0.04), I-2 = 51.50%), Triglycerides (TGs) (correlation coefficient -0.09 (95%CI: -0.15; -0.02), I-2 = 0%) and >= 2 MetS risk factors (correlation coefficient -0.10 (95%CI: -0.16; -0.03), I-2 = 0%); with high frequency (HF) were revealed. Significant positive correlations for high density lipoprotein (HDL) (correlation coefficient 0.08 (95%CI: 0.05; 0.11), I-2 = 0%) and significant negative correlations of >= 2 MetS risk (correlation coefficient -0.04 (95%CI: -0.12; 0.03), I-2 = 0.0%) with low frequency (LF) were revealed. Significant negative correlations for TGs (correlation coefficient -0.09 (95%CI: -0.23; 0.05), I-2 = 2.01%) with a mean square root of the sum of differences between mean time between two successive intervals (rMSSD) and significant positive correlation of HDL (correlation coefficient 0.09 (95%CI: -0.01; 0.19), I-2 = 0.33%) with standard deviation of the time between two successive intervals (SDNN) were also revealed. An Egger's test indicated that there was no obvious publication bias for any of the above relationships except for TGs and rMSSD. The significance level stipulated for the meta-analysis was p < 0.05. Conclusions: lipid profiles (HDL and TGs), WC and BP were associated with CAM in young people up to the age of 19 years. The use of HRV indices to predict future MetS risk, and relationships with individual risk factors including HDL, BP, WC and TGs, were established. Future studies related to young people (up to the age of 19 years) are recommended to explore the associations reported here further.

AB  - Decision making is a complex cognitive phenomenon commonly used in everyday life. Studies have shown differences in behavioral strategies in risky decision-making tasks over the course of aging. The development of functional neuroimaging has gradually allowed the exploration of the neurofunctional bases of these behaviors. The purpose of our study was to carry out a meta-analysis on the neural networks underlying risky decision making in healthy older adults. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched for fMRI studies of decision making in older adults using risky decision-making tasks. To perform the quantitative meta-analysis, we used the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm. A total of 620 references were selected for initial screening. Among these, five studies with a total of 98 cognitively normal older participants (mean age: 69.5 years) were included. The meta-analysis yielded two clusters. Main activations were found in the right insula, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Despite the limited number of studies included, our meta-analysis highlights the crucial involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation and the decision to act. However, in contrast to the literature on young adults, our results indicate a different pattern of hemispheric lateralization in older participants. These activations can be used as a minimum pattern of activation in the risky decision-making tasks of healthy older subjects.

AB  - Over the last few decades, work in affective neuroscience has increasingly investigated the neural basis of emotion. A central debate in the field, when studying individuals with brain damage, has been whether emotional processes are lateralized or not. This review aims to expand this debate, by considering the need to include a hierarchical dimension to the problem. The historical journey of the diverse literature is presented, particularly focusing on the need to develop a research program that explores the neural basis of a wide range of emotional processes (perception, expression, experience, regulation, decision making, etc.), and also its relation to lateralized cortical and deep-subcortical brain structures. Of especial interest is the study of the interaction between emotional components; for example, between emotion generation and emotion regulation. Finally, emerging evidence from lesion studies is presented regarding the neural basis of emotion-regulation strategies, for which the issue of laterality seems most relevant. It is proposed that, because emotion-regulation strategies are complex higher-order cognitive processes, the question appears to be not the lateralization of the entire emotional process, but the lateralization of the specific cognitive tools we use to manage our feelings, in a range of different ways.

AB  - Emergency departments (EDs) are high-risk settings for workplace violence, but interventions to prevent violent incidents and to prepare staff are not yet consistently implemented, and their effectiveness is often unclear. This study aims to summarise evidence on workplace violence prevention interventions that were implemented in EDs to reduce violent incidents caused by patients/relatives or to increase the knowledge, skills or feelings of safety of ED staff. A systematic review was conducted. The databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycINFO were searched for studies dated between January 2010 and May 2021. Interventional and observational studies reporting on behavioural, organisational or environmental interventions among healthcare workers in hospital EDs were included. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Johanna Briggs Institute Tools. Key findings of studies were summarised narratively. Fifteen studies were included, of which eleven examined behavioural interventions (classroom, online or hybrid training programmes) on de-escalation skills, violent person management or self-defence techniques. Four studies included in addition, organisational and environmental interventions. Most studies showed that interventions had a positive effect in the form of a reduction of violent incidents or an improvement in how prepared staff were to deal with violent situations; however, evidence is still sparse. Further studies should consider in particular, environmental and organisational interventions and ensure a high methodological quality.

AB  - Objective This study aims to assess the dose-response relationship between serum ferritin (SF) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the two sexes.
   Methods We searched for articles on PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and the Web of Science databases that were published from 1950 to 2020. The summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the association between SF and MetS were estimated using a random-effects model through a meta-analysis. Based on the methods described by Greenland and Longnecker, we explored the dose-response relationship between the two sexes.
   Results This study included 14 studies and 74,710 samples. The results of the classical meta-analysis showed that SF was positively associated with MetS (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.59-1.98). Regarding the components of MetS (8 studies included), the results showed that SF was positively associated with abdominal obesity (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.24-1.62), elevated fasting plasma glucose (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.50-2.25), elevated blood pressure (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.08-1.26), elevated triglycerides (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.72-2.54), and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.19-1.49). In the linear dose-response meta-analysis, the ORs of males, females, and postmenopausal females were 1.14 (95% CI: 1.13-1.16), 1.32 (95% CI: 1.26-1.39), and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.22-1.47), respectively.
   Conclusions Our study shows that SF is significantly and positively associated with MetS, and the risk in the male population is higher than that in the female population. This finding also supports the recommendation of using SF as an early warning marker of MetS.

AB  - Cognitive decline (CD), which related to vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and diabetes mellitus, is a growing health concern that has a great impact on the patients' quality of life. Although extensive efforts, the mechanisms of CD are still far from being clarified, not to mention the effective treatment and prevention strategies. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a trans-membrane protein, is a major component of the caveolae structure and scaffolding proteins. Recently, ample evidence depicts a strong correlation between Cav-1 and CD, however, the specific role of Cav-1 in CD has not been clearly examined and how they might be connected have yet to be identified. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview about how Cav-1 modulates pathogeneses of CD-associated diseases. In summary, Cav-1 can promote structural and functional plasticity of neurons, improve neurogenesis, relieve mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibit inflammation and suppress oxidative stress, which have shed light on the idea that Cav-1 may be an efficacious therapeutic target to treat CD.

AB  - Seed-based restoration often experiences poor success due to a range of edaphic and biotic issues. Seed enhancement technologies (SETs) are a novel approach that can alleviate these pressures and improve restoration success. Broadly, SETs have been reviewed for agricultural and horticultural purposes, for specific types of SETs such as coating or priming, or for focal ecosystems. However, information is lacking for SETs within a restoration focused context, and how they are being used to alleviate certain barriers. This review aimed to synthesise the current literature on SETs to understand what SETs are being tested, in which sectors and locations they are being tested, what issues are faced within restoration using SETs, and how SETs are being used to approach these issues. Priming was highlighted as the main SET investigated. Inoculation, pesticide application and magnetic fields were also commonly tested (SETs we termed 'prospective techniques'). SET research mainly occurred in the agricultural sector. More recently, other sectors, such as restoration and rangeland management, have increased efforts into SET research. The restoration sector has focused on extruded pelleting and coating (with activated carbon), in combination with herbicide application, to overcome invasive species, and coating with certain additives to alleviate edaphic issues. Other sectors outside restoration were largely focused on evaluating priming for overcoming these barriers. The majority of priming research has been completed on crop species and differences between these species and ecosystems must be considered in future restoration efforts that focus on native seed use. Generally, SETs require further refinement, including identifying ideal additives and their optimum concentrations to target certain issues, refining formulations for coating and extruded pelleting and developing flash flaming. A bet-hedging approach using multiple SETs and/or combinations of SETs may be advantageous in overcoming a wide range of barriers in seed-based restoration. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 2011, Cohen and Blanc-Goldhammer introduced a new unbounded version of the number line estimation task which they argued to overcome limitations of its 'traditional' bounded counterpart. In line with this proposition, there is increasing evidence that the unbounded number line estimation task may indeed reflect a purer measure of the underlying representation of number magnitude. However, only few studies used this task version yet. In the present literature review, we aimed at evaluating all studies employing the unbounded task version so far to provide an overview of the current state of research. To identify all relevant articles and to evaluate the validity of the task, we conducted a systematic literature search in different databases following the PRISMA guidelines in May 2021. Methodological differences and commonalities of the 16 studies that met the inclusion criteria are discussed here. Our evaluation indicated considerable differences between studies with respect to the number range covered or methodological features such as display size. Additionally, five studies observed evidence for estimation biases in the unbounded task as well. Nevertheless, this review also substantiated the claim that the unbounded task version might indeed be a more valid and purer measure of the mental representation of number magnitude as the results of 14 studies confirmed this hypothesis.

AB  - Background A systematic understanding of how multimorbidity has been constructed and measured is unavailable. This review aimed to examine the definition and measurement of multimorbidity in peer-reviewed studies internationally. Methods We systematically reviewed studies on multimorbidity, via a search of nine bibliographic databases (Ovid [PsycINFO, Embase, Global Health, and MEDLINE], Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global), from inception to Jan 21, 2020. Reference lists and tracked citations of retrieved articles were hand-searched. Eligible studies were full-text articles measuring multimorbidity for any purpose in community, primary care, care home, or hospital populations receiving a non-specialist service. Abstracts, qualitative research, and case series were excluded. Two reviewers independently reviewed the retrieved studies with conflicts resolved by discussion or a third reviewer, and a single researcher extracted data from published papers. To assess our objectives of how multimorbidity has been measured and examine variation in the chronic conditions included (in terms of number and type), we used descriptive analysis (frequencies, cross-tabulation, and negative binomial regression) to summarise the characteristics of multimorbidity studies and measures (study setting, source of morbidity data, study population, primary study purpose, and multimorbidity measure type). This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD420201724090. Findings 566 studies were included in our review, of which 206 (36middot4%) did not report a reference definition for multimorbidity and 73 (12middot9%) did not report the conditions their measure included. The number of conditions included in measures ranged from two to 285 (median 17 [IQR 11-23). 452 (79middot9%) studies reported types of condition within a single multimorbidity measure; most included at least one cardiovascular condition (441 [97middot6%] of 452 studies), metabolic and endocrine condition (440 [97middot3%]), respiratory condition (422 [93middot4%]), musculoskeletal condition (396 [87middot6%]), or mental health condition (355 [78middot5%]) in their measure of multimorbidity. Chronic infections (123 [27middot2%]), haematological conditions (110 [24middot3%]), ear, nose, and throat conditions (107 [23middot7%]), skin conditions (70 [15middot5%]), oral conditions (19 [4middot2%]), and congenital conditions (14 [3middot1%]) were uncommonly included. Only eight individual conditions were included by more than half of studies in the multimorbidity measure used (diabetes, stroke, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure), with individual mental health conditions under-represented. Of the 566 studies, 419 were rated to be of moderate risk of bias, 107 of high risk of bias, and 40 of low risk of bias according to the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool. Interpretation Measurement of multimorbidity is poorly reported and highly variable. Consistent reporting of measure definitions should be required by journals, and consensus studies are needed to define core and study-dependent conditions to include in measures of multimorbidity.

AB  - Introduction: Individual participant data meta-analyses (IPD-MAs) include the raw data from relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and involve secondary analyses of the data. Performed since the late 1990s, similar to 50 such meta-analyses have been carried out in psychiatry, mostly in the field of treatment. IPD-MAs are particularly relevant for three objectives: (1) evaluation of the average effect of an intervention by combining effects from all included trials, (2) evaluation of the heterogeneity of an intervention effect and sub-group analyses to approach personalised psychiatry, (3) mediation analysis or surrogacy evaluation to replace a clinical (final) endpoint for the evaluation of new treatments with intermediate or surrogate endpoints. The objective is to describe the interest and the steps of an IPD-MA method applied to the field of psychiatric therapeutic research.
   Method: The method is described in three steps. First, the identification of the relevant trials with an explicit description of the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the RCT to be incorporated in the IPD-MA and a definition of the intervention, the population, the context and the relevant points (outcomes or moderators). Second, the data management with the standardisation of collected variables and the evaluation and the assessment of the risk-of-bias for each included trial and of the global risk. Third, the statistical analyses and their interpretations, depending on the objective of the meta-analysis. All steps are illustrated with examples in psychiatry for treatment issues, excluding study protocols.
   Conclusion: The meta-analysis of individual patient data is challenging. Only strong collaborations between all stakeholders can make such a process efficient. An "ecosystem" that includes all stakeholders (questions of interest prioritised by the community, funders, trialists, journal editors, institutions, ... ) is required. International medical societies can play a central role in favouring the emergence of such communities.

AB  - BackgroundCommunity engagement and volunteering are essential for the public response to COVID-19. Since March 2020 a large number of people in the UK have been regularly doing unpaid activities to benefit others besides their close relatives. Although most mutual aid groups emerged from local neighbourhoods and communities, official public institutions also fostered community volunteering, namely through the community champions scheme. By considering a broad definition of COVID-19 volunteering, this article describes a systematic review of the literature focused on one broad question: What have we learned about COVID-19 volunteering both at the UK national level and the more local community level?MethodsA rapid review of the literature in peer-reviewed databases and grey literature was applied in our search, following the PRISMA principles. The search was conducted from 10 to 16 of October 2020, and sources were included on the basis of having been published between January and October 2020, focusing on COVID-19 and addressing community groups, volunteering groups, volunteers, or community champions in the UK.ResultsAfter initial screening, a total of 40 relevant sources were identified. From these, 27 were considered eligible. Findings suggest that food shopping and emotional support were the most common activities, but there were diverse models of organisation and coordination in COVID-19 volunteering. Additionally, community support groups seem to be adjusting their activities and scope of action to current needs and challenges. Volunteers were mostly women, middle-class, highly educated, and working-age people. Social networks and connections, local knowledge, and social trust were key dimensions associated with community organising and volunteering. Furthermore, despite the efforts of a few official public institutions and councils, there has been limited community engagement and collaboration with volunteering groups and other community-based organisations.ConclusionsWe identified important factors for fostering community engagement and COVID-19 volunteering as well as gaps in the current literature. We suggest that future research should be directed towards deepening knowledge on sustaining community engagement, collaboration and community participation over time, during and beyond this pandemic.

AB  - Seaweeds are valuable marine resources having multifaceted usages in modern agriculture. Extracts from different seaweeds have been used since many years in agriculture practice to improve plant growth and to enhance the yield. At present, the excessive use of synthetic chemicals and fertilizers imposes a global health hazard and pollutes agricultural lands worldwide. Thus, promoting the use of natural plant growth regulators and fertilizers, such as seaweeds, is recommended with promising outputs. Moreover, the seaweed extract-based biostimulants having plant growth -promoting capacity and aiding in improving the overall plant resilience are highly desirable. In addition, the seaweed extracts can improve the soil health and soil fertility. In this review, the different methods of obtaining the seaweed extract-based biostimulants are discussed. Additionally, the role of such biostimulants in plant growth promotion, mitigating plant abiotic and biotic stresses, and improving soil quality is illustrated and the underlying mechanism is discussed. In addition, some important applications of the seaweed extracts in other than agricultural area have been discussed in brief. Moreover, the future prospects of the seaweed extract-based biostimulants are presented with emphasizing on the economic significance.

AB  - The oxytocin system may be different in autistic people, which could explain some of the deficits in social behavior and cognition associated with autism spectrum disorder. However, studies comparing oxytocin levels in autistic and neurotypical individuals have shown conflicting results and a 2016 meta-analysis on seven studies concluded that there was no significant difference. Here, we greatly expanded the sample of studies to 31, warranting a reassessment of this finding. We searched Web of Science with MEDLINE(R), SciELO Citation Index, and BIOSIS Citation Index for articles that measured oxytocin in plasma/serum (k = 26 studies), saliva (4), or cerebrospinal fluid (1) in autistic individuals (total n = 1233 participants) compared to neurotypical individuals (n = 1304). We found that oxytocin levels were significantly lower in autistic people (Cohen's d = -0.36, 95% confidence interval = [-0.61, -0.10], p = 0.007), with no evidence for publication bias. This overall effect was driven entirely by differences among children (k = 25, d = -0.44, 95% confidence interval = [-0.72, -0.16], p = 0.002) but not adults (k = 6, d = 0.03, 95% confidence interval = [-0.55, 0.61], p = 0.92). These results support further research into the use of oxytocin to treat social deficits in children. Lay abstract Oxytocin is a hormone that mediates interpersonal relationships through enhancing social recognition, social memory, and reducing stress. It is released centrally into the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as peripherally into the blood, where it can easily be measured. Some studies indicate that the oxytocin system with its social implications might be different in people with autism spectrum disorder. With summarizing evidence of 31 studies, this meta-analysis suggests that children with autism spectrum disorder have lower blood oxytocin levels compared to neurotypical individuals. This might not be the case for adults with autism spectrum disorder, where we could not find a difference. Our findings motivate further exploration of the oxytocin system in children with autism spectrum disorder. This could lead to therapeutic options in treating autism spectrum disorder in childhood.

AB  - Background: Rising population of elder people and associated rise in health problems, frailty and disabilities have significant socioeconomic and health care implications. Mental health related disability contributes significantly in the global disability statistics and is an important health and quality of life indicator. Assessment of disabilities in elderly is essential part of routine evaluation, further it also helps the clinicians in identifying current functional status and choosing and monitoring therapeutic interventions and need for social welfare schemes. Methods: In order to understand the process of disability assessment in geriatric psychiatry and to gather information about social welfare schemes a literature review in Google Scholar and PubMed electronic database, and website of various ministries under Government of India was done, using developed key search terms for articles published up to February 2021. The identified eligible articles were reviewed for ideas and concepts, which were then integrated and categorized under broader themes. Finally, the broad categories were discussed briefly based on the above framework. Results: Review findings are summarized under the following headings: concept of ageing and disability, assessment of disability, process of certification, and social welfare schemes. Conclusions: The process of disability assessment comprises of comprehensive clinical evaluation, use of standardized rating instruments and disability certification wherever warranted or asked for. It is now being acknowledged worldwide by provisions of various social welfare benefits, that living with disability and increased care needs should be an integral part of definition of successful ageing.

AB  - Teachers are largely affected by OS, during their most productive years, leading to catastrophic physical, psychological, and economic burden on themselves, families and society by large. Teachers are responsible for producing the workforce of any nation, and thus have a major impact indirectly on the economy and health of a nation. There are several individual-level interventions conducted to reduce occupational stress (OS) among teachers. This study was conducted to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of individual-level interventions to reduce occupational stress among teachers. This review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; Registration ID: CRD42020149277) and followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and Web of Science databases were searched using predefined search strategies covering the eligibility criteria. Studies were selected in four rounds. Risk of bias assessments were conducted with GRADE recommendations and ROBINS-I criteria for randomized and non-randomized interventions, respectively. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessments were performed independ ently by two reviewers with a third reviewer to resolve conflicts. Narrative synthesis of the findings were also performed. Clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity assessments were conduct ed. Meta-analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3 software using the "generic inverse variance method" with mean difference as the pooled estimate. Sensitivity analyses of the findings was also performed. At the initial search, 293 articles were identified and 29 subsequently selected for synthesis of findings. The findings of the meta-analysis indicated that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and relaxation interventions significantly reduced OS among teachers with an effect size of 6.2 (p < 0.001). Effect size was highest for combined CBT and relaxation interventions which was 6.57 (p < 0.001). Relaxation interventions only and CBT interventions only had effect sizes of 3.35 (p < 0.001) and 3.12 (p = 0.002) respectively. In sensitivity analysis, after removing low-quality studies, CBT interventions only, combined CBT and relaxation interventions and overall effect size were 6.31 (p < 0.00001), 17.36 (p < 0.00001), and 14.55 (p < 0.00001), respectively, ie, substantially greater than with low-quality studies included. Inconclusion, CBT and relaxation interventions reduce OS among teachers and it's most effective when those individual-level interventions are conducted together.

AB  - Background Educational interventions engage youth using visual, literary and performing arts to combat stigma associated with mental health problems. However, it remains unknown whether arts interventions are effective in reducing mental-health-related stigma among youth and if so, then which specific art forms, duration and stigma-related components in content are successful. Methods We searched 13 databases, including PubMed, Medline, Global Health, EMBASE, ADOLEC, Social Policy and Practice, Database of Promoting Health Effectiveness Reviews (DoPHER), Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI), EPPI-Centre database of health promotion research (Bibliomap), Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Scopus for studies involving arts interventions aimed at reducing any or all components of mental-health-related stigma among youth (10-24-year-olds). Risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Data were extracted into tables and analysed using RevMan 5.3.5. Results Fifty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria (n = 41,621). Interventions using multiple art forms are effective in improving behaviour towards people with mental health problems to a small effect (effect size = 0.28, 95%CI 0.08-0.48; p = 0.007) No studies reported negative outcomes or unintended harms. Among studies using specific art forms, we observed high heterogeneity among intervention studies using theatre, multiple art forms, film and role play. Data in this review are inconclusive about the use of single versus multiple sessions and whether including all stigma components of knowledge, attitude and behaviour as intervention content are more effective relative to studies focused on these stigma components, individually. Common challenges faced by school-based arts interventions included lack of buy-in from school administrators and low engagement. No studies were reported from low- and middle-income countries. Conclusion Arts interventions are effective in reducing mental-health-related stigma to a small effect. Interventions that employ multiple art forms together compared to studies employing film, theatre or role play are likely more effective in reducing mental-health-related stigma.

AB  - Study objective: Evidence syntheses perform rigorous investigations of the primary literature and they have played a vital role in generating evidence-based recommendations for governments worldwide during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, there has not yet been an attempt to organize them by topic and other characteristics. This study performed a systematic mapping exercise of non-clinical evidence syntheses pertaining to Covid-19. Methods: This study conducted a systematic search on December 5, 2020 across 10 databases and servers: CINAHL (EBSCO Information Services, Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States), Embase (Elsevier, Aalborg, Denmark), Global Health (EBSCO Information Services, Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States), Healthstar (NICHSR and AHA, Bethesda, United States), MEDLINE (NLM, Bethesda, United States), PsychINFO (APA, Washington, DC, United States), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, London, UK), Research Square (Research Square, Durham, North Carolina), MEDRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, United States), and PROSPERO (NIHR, York, United Kingdom). Only full evidence syntheses published in a peer-reviewed journal or preprint server were included. Results: This study classified all evidence syntheses in the following topics: health service delivery (n = 280), prevention and behavior (n = 201), mental health (n = 140), social epidemiology (n = 31), economy (n = 22), and environment (n = 19). This study provides a comprehensive resource of all evidence syntheses categorized according to topic. Conclusions: This study proposes the following research priorities: governance, the impact of Covid-19 on different populations, the effectiveness of prevention and control methods across contexts, mental health, and vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - Lithium (Li) remains the first line long-term treatment of bipolar disorders notwithstanding a high interindividual variability of response. Significant research effort has been undertaken to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Li cellular and clinical effects in order to identify predictive biomarkers of response. Li response has been shown to be partly heritable, however mechanisms that do not rely on DNA variants could also be involved. In recent years, modulation of epigenetic marks in relation with the level of Li response has appeared increasingly plausible. Recent results in this field of research have provided new insights into the molecular processes involved in Li effects. In this review, we examined the literature investigating the involvement of three epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation, noncoding RNAs and histone modifications) in Li clinical efficacy in bipolar disorder.
