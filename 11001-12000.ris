AB  - To persist in extreme environments, some meiofaunal taxa have adopted outstanding resistance strategies. Recent years have seen increased enthusiasm for understanding extreme-resistance mechanisms evolved by tardigrades, nematodes and rotifers, such as the capability to tolerate complete desiccation and freezing by entering a state of reversible suspension of metabolism called anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis, respectively. In contrast, the less common phenomenon of diapause, which includes encystment and cyclomorphosis, is defined by a suspension of growth and development with a reduction in metabolic activity induced by stressful environmental conditions. Because of their unique resistance, tardigrades and rotifers have been proposed as model organisms in the fields of exobiology and space research. They are also increasingly considered in medical research with the hope that their resistance mechanisms could be used to improve the tolerance of human cells to extreme stress. This review will analyse the dormancy strategies in tardigrades, rotifers and nematodes with emphasis on mechanisms of extreme stress tolerance to identify convergent and unique strategies occurring in these distinct groups. We also examine the ecological and evolutionary consequences of extreme tolerance by summarizing recent advances in this field.

AB  - Background Socioecological models highlight the potential direct and indirect effects of multiple levels of influence in explaining physical activity (PA). Social cognitive theories, however, position individual cognitions as the mediator of external factors such as the built environment when explaining PA.
   Purpose To appraise the evidence for direct and indirect associations between the built environment and social cognition to predict PA.
   Methods Literature searches were concluded in February 2019 using five common databases. Eligible studies were in the English language that included any direct and indirect tests of individual perceptions and the built environment with PA.
   Results The initial search yielded 18,521 hits, which was reduced to 46 independent studies of primarily medium quality after screening for eligibility criteria. Findings were grouped by type of PA then grouped by the type of individual and built environment constructs within the model, and subdivided by adult and youth samples. There was evidence that self-efficacy/perceived control accounted for the covariance between environmental accessibility/convenience and total PA, while habit accounted for the covariance in this relationship for transport PA, particularly in adult samples. There was no evidence that the built environment had a direct association with PA after controlling for individual-level factors.
   Conclusions The results provide initial support for the mediation tenet in social cognition models for the relationship between individual, built environment, and PA. In practice, these findings highlight the need for coordinated interventions of individual and environmental change.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to systematically review the evidence on the accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test for evaluating the presence of cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia and to outline the quality and quantity of research evidence available about the accuracy of MoCA in this population. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review, searching four databases from inception until April 2020. Results: We identified only three cross-sectional studies, two case - control studies, three studies comparing MoCA with Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE) and four prevalence studies that met the inclusion criteria. Publication period ranged from 2012 to 2020. Conclusions: In patients with schizophrenia, the MoCA test provides information about general cognitive func- tioning disturbances. A lower threshold than the original cut-off of 26 is probably more useful for optimal screening, as it lowers false positive rates and improves diagnostic accuracy. Nonetheless, more studies are necessary in this direction.

AB  - Objectives: Symptoms of insomnia are highly prevalent in the elderly. A significant number of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions exist, but, up-to-date, their comparative efficacy and safety has not been sufficiently assessed.
   Methods: We integrated the randomized evidence from every available treatment for insomnia in the elderly (>65 years) by performing a network meta-analysis. Several electronic databases were searched up to May 25, 2019. The two primary outcomes were total sleep time and sleep quality. Data for other 6 efficacy and 8 safety outcomes were also analyzed.
   Results: Fifty-three RCTs with 6832 participants (75 years old on average) were included, 43 of which examined the efficacy of one or more drugs. Ten RCTs examined the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions and were evaluated only with pairwise meta-analyses because they were disconnected from the network. The overall confidence in the evidence was very low primarily due to the small amount of data per comparison and their sparse connectedness. Several benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and z-drugs performed better in both primary outcomes, but few comparisons had data from more than one trial. The limited evidence on non-pharmacological interventions suggested that acupressure, auricular acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction program, and tart cherry juice were better than their control interventions. Regarding safety, no clear differences were detected among interventions due to large uncertainty.
   Conclusions: Insufficient evidence exists on which intervention is more efficacious for elderly patients with insomnia. More RCTs, with longer duration, making more direct interventions among active treatments and presenting more outcomes are urgently needed.

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, both traumatic and neurodegenerative, are characterized by impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and often disturbed mitochondrial dynamics. The dysregulation observed in these pathologies leads to defective respiratory chain function and reduced ATP production, thereby promoting neuronal death. As such, attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction through induction of mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) is a promising, though still underexplored, therapeutic strategy. MB is a multifaceted process involving the integration of highly regulated transcriptional events, lipid membrane and protein synthesis/assembly and replication of mtDNA. Several nuclear transcription factors promote the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial import and export systems, antioxidant defense and mitochondrial gene transcription. Of these, the nuclear-encoded peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) is the most commonly studied and is widely accepted as the 'master regulator' of MB. Several recent preclinical studies document that reestablishment of mitochondrial homeostasis through increased MB results in inhibited injury progression and increased functional recovery. This perspective will briefly review the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the propagation of CNS diseases, while also describing current research strategies that mediate mitochondrial dysfunction and compounds that induce MB for the treatment of acute and chronic neuropathologies.

AB  - Background and objective: Some studies have shown that the Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a promising tool for the diagnosis, treatment and cognitive improvement in people with dementia. The objective was to make a bibliometric analysis to reflect on VR and dementia research from 1998 until 2018, identifying its intellectual structure and emerging trends.
   Methods: Data encompassing 356 documents and 19,238 citations collated between 1998 and 2018 from Web-of-Science and Scopus databases was analyzed through CiteSpace.
   Results: There is an increasing growth of VR research as an instrument of diagnosis and intervention in dementia. Both databases show differences in terms of scope, the volume of data, and coverage policies. The Journal of Alzheimer's Disease is the top source. Giuseppe Riva is the most productive author. The USA and the UK are leading contributors. There is a dynamic shift in the focus of research over time and some new topics are now catching the attention of researchers. The results showed the relevance of VR in improving the health of patients with dementia and they found that the use of VR in people with dementia had a precious applicability, fundamentally, as a tool in diagnosis, treatment, cognitive improvement, or rehabilitation.
   Conclusion: The co-citation and co-authorship network analysis, the identification of critical papers, and the development of new emerging tendencies highlights the priorities in this field, pointing to new opportunities to guide researchers.

AB  - Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), known in the past as "Microwave syndrome", is a clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of a wide spectrum of non-specific multiple organ symptoms, typically including central nervous system symptoms, that occur following the patient's acute or chronic exposure to electromagnetic fields in the environment or in occupational settings. Numerous studies have shown biological effects at the cellular level of electromagnetic fields (EMF) at magnetic (ELF) and radio-frequency (RF) frequencies in extremely low intensities. Many of the mechanisms described for Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) apply with modification to EHS. Repeated exposures result in sensitization and consequent enhancement of response. Many hypersensitive patients appear to have impaired detoxification systems that become overloaded by excessive oxidative stress. EMF can induce changes in calcium signaling cascades, significant activation of free radical processes and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells as well as altered neurological and cognitive functions and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Magnetite crystals absorbed from combustion air pollution could have an important role in brain effects of EMF. Autonomic nervous system effects of EMF could also be expressed as symptoms in the cardiovascular system. Other common effects of EMF include effects on skin, microvasculature, immune and hematologic systems. It is concluded that the mechanisms underlying the symptoms of EHS are biologically plausible and that many organic physiologic responses occur following EMF exposure. Patients can have neurologic, neuro-hormonal and neuro-psychiatric symptoms following exposure to EMF as a consequence of neural damage and over-sensitized neural responses. More relevant diagnostic tests for EHS should be developed. Exposure limits should be lowered to safeguard against biologic effects of EMF. Spread of local and global wireless networks should be decreased, and safer wired networks should be used instead of wireless, to protect susceptible members of the public. Public places should be made accessible for electro-hypersensitive individuals.

AB  - Background: Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) are one of the most commonly used classes of insecticides in the U.S., and metabolites of OPs have been detected in the urine of >75% of the U.S. population. While studies have shown that OP exposure is associated with risk of neurological diseases and some cancers, the relationship between OP exposure and breast cancer risk is not well understood. Methods: The aim of this rapid review was to systematically evaluate published literature on the relationship between OP exposure and breast cancer risk, including both epidemiologic and laboratory studies. Twenty-seven full-text articles were reviewed by searching on Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Results: Some human studies showed that malathion, terbufos, and chlorpyrifos were positively associated with human breast cancer risk, and some laboratory studies demonstrated that malathion and chlorpyrifos have estrogenic potential and other cancer-promoting properties. However, the human studies were limited in number, mostly included agricultural settings in several geographical areas in the U.S., and did not address cumulative exposure. Conclusions: Given the mixed results found in both human and laboratory studies, more research is needed to further examine the relationship between OP exposure and breast cancer risk, especially in humans in non-agricultural settings.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and acceptability of antidepressants, psychotherapies, and their combination for acute treatment of children and adolescents with depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis
KW  - CONSISTENCY
KW  - PLACEBO
AB  - Background Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents. Antidepressants, psychotherapies, and their combination are often used in routine clinical practice; however, available evidence on the comparative efficacy and safety of these interventions is inconclusive. Therefore, we sought to compare and rank all available treatment interventions for the acute treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.
   Methods We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ProQuest, CINAHL, LiLACS, international trial registries, and the websites of regulatory agencies for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials from database inception until Jan 1, 2019. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 16 antidepressants, seven psychotherapies, and five combinations of antidepressant and psychotherapy that are used for the acute treatment of children and adolescents (<= 18 years old and of both sexes) with depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. Trials recruiting participants with treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, treatment duration of less than 4 weeks, or an overall sample size of fewer than ten patients were excluded. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy of outcome measures, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using validated methods. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in depressive symptoms) and acceptability (treatment discontinuation due to any cause). We estimated summary standardised mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with credible intervals (CrIs) using network meta-analysis with random effects. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015020841.
   Findings From 20 366 publications, we included 71 trials (9510 participants). Depressive disorders in most studies were moderate to severe. In terms of efficacy, fluoxetine plus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was more effective than CBT alone (-0.78, 95% CrI-1.55 to -0.01) and psychodynamic therapy (-1.14, -2.20 to -0.08), but not more effective than fluoxetine alone (-0.22, -0.86 to 0.42). No pharmacotherapy alone was more effective than psychotherapy alone. Only fluoxetine plus CBT and fluoxetine were significantly more effective than pill placebo or psychological controls (SMDs ranged from -1.73 to -0.51); and only interpersonal therapy was more effective than all psychological controls (-1.37 to -0.66). Nortriptyline (SMDs ranged from 1.04 to 2.22) and waiting list (SMDs ranged from 0.67 to 2.08) were less effective than most active interventions. In terms of acceptability, nefazodone and fluoxetine were associated with fewer dropouts than sertraline, imipramine, and desipramine (ORs ranged from 0.17 to 0.50); imipramine was associated with more dropouts than pill placebo, desvenlafaxine, fluoxetine plus CBT, and vilazodone (2.51 to 5.06). Most of the results were rated as "low" to "very low" in terms of confidence of evidence according to Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis.
   Interpretation Despite the scarcity of high-quality evidence, fluoxetine (alone or in combination with CBT) seems to be the best choice for the acute treatment of moderate-to-severe depressive disorder in children and adolescents. However, the effects of these interventions might vary between individuals, so patients, carers, and clinicians should carefully balance the risk-benefit profile of efficacy, acceptability, and suicide risk of all active interventions in young patients with depression on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - The comorbidity of depression and addiction has become a serious public health issue, and the relationship between these two disorders and their potential mechanisms has attracted extensive attention. Numerous studies have suggested that depression and addiction share common mechanisms and anatomical pathways. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has long been considered a key brain region for regulating many behaviors, especially those related to depression and addiction. In this review article, we focus on the association between addiction and depression, highlighting the potential mediating role of the NAc in this comorbidityviathe regulation of changes in the neural circuits and molecular signaling. To clarify the mechanisms underlying this association, we summarize evidence from overlapping reward neurocircuitry, the resemblance of cellular and molecular mechanisms, and common treatments. Understanding the interplay between these disorders should help guide clinical comorbidity prevention and the search for a new target for comorbidity treatment.

AB  - Recently, interest in sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) and their applications in food, agriculture, and biomedical fields have increased mainly due to the significant antibacterial and anticancer activity of these nanomaterials. However, with these applications, there is a growing concern regarding the biological effects and the possible risks to the environment and health by the use of sulfur nanoparticles. In this regard, recent research has been published based on the investigation of the potential effects of SNPs on plant and animal cells. However, little is known about the mechanism of action of SNPs on other microorganisms and human cells. The purpose of this review is to better understand the applicability of these nanomaterials by discussing not only the role of sulfur, but also recent publications related to the synthesis, properties, characterization, and biological applications of SNPs.

AB  - BackgroundMigrants experience disparities in healthcare quality, in particular women migrants. Despite international calls to improve healthcare quality for migrants, little research has addressed this problem. Patient-centred care (PCC) is a proven approach for improving patient experiences and outcomes. This study reviewed published research on PCC for migrants.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review by searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for English-language qualitative or quantitative studies published from 2010 to June 2019 for studies that assessed PCC for adult immigrants or refugees. We tabulated study characteristics and findings, and mapped findings to a 6-domain PCC framework.ResultsWe identified 581 unique studies, excluded 538 titles/abstracts, and included 16 of 43 full-text articles reviewed. Most (87.5%) studies were qualitative involving a median of 22 participants (range 10-60). Eight (50.0%) studies involved clinicians only, 6 (37.5%) patients only, and 2 (12.5%) both patients and clinicians. Studies pertained to migrants from 19 countries of origin. No studies evaluated strategies or interventions aimed at either migrants or clinicians to improve PCC. Eleven (68.8%) studies reported barriers of PCC at the patient (i.e. language), clinician (i.e. lack of training) and organization/system level (i.e. lack of interpreters). Ten (62.5%) studies reported facilitators, largely at the clinician level (i.e. establish rapport, take extra time to communicate). Five (31.3%) studies focused on women, thus we identified few barriers (i.e. clinicians dismissed their concerns) and facilitators (i.e. women clinicians) specific to PCC for migrant women. Mapping of facilitators to the PCC framework revealed that most pertained to 2 domains: fostering a healing relationship and exchanging information. Few facilitators mapped to the remaining 4 domains: address emotions/concerns, manage uncertainty, make decisions, and enable self-management.ConclusionsWhile few studies were included, they revealed numerous barriers of PCC at the patient, clinician and organization/system level for immigrants and refugees from a wide range of countries of origin. The few facilitators identified pertained largely to 2 PCC domains, thereby identifying gaps in knowledge of how to achieve PCC in 4 domains, and an overall paucity of knowledge on how to achieve PCC for migrant women.

AB  - Whilst it is well documented that cyberbullying is linked to poor mental health outcomes, limited research has examined how cyberbullying may influence brain development adolescents, and the influence of each of these factors. The article's primary objective was to develop an understanding of research to date that addresses any relationship between adolescent brain development and cyberbullying. The current article reviews any existing literature regarding the impact of cyberbullying on adolescent brain development, paying particular attention to research using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Whilst brain studies have examined neural mechanisms associated with conduct disorders, antisocial behavior, and aggression in young people; there is a paucity of research examining these factors specifically in relation to cyberbullying. In particular, little research has examined how MRI research could help understand how the brain is affected by cyberbullying, not only in bullies and victims but also bystanders. This article highlights the gaps in the cyberbullying field in relation to neuroscience research, and the need for further, longitudinal research examining cyberbullying and how it may affect brain development in young people. This article concludes by suggesting a framework for future research, and highlights the importance of future findings for developing interventions and understanding short and long term effects.

AB  - Biological neural network models whereby brains make minds help to understand autonomous adaptive intelligence. This article summarizes why the dynamics and emergent properties of such models for perception, cognition, emotion, and action are explainable, and thus amenable to being confidently implemented in large-scale applications. Key to their explainability is how these models combine fast activations, or short-term memory (STM) traces, and learned weights, or long-term memory (LTM) traces. Visual and auditory perceptual models have explainable conscious STM representations of visual surfaces and auditory streams in surface-shroud resonances and stream-shroud resonances, respectively. Deep Learning is often used to classify data. However, Deep Learning can experience catastrophic forgetting: At any stage of learning, an unpredictable part of its memory can collapse. Even if it makes some accurate classifications, they are not explainable and thus cannot be used with confidence. Deep Learning shares these problems with the back propagation algorithm, whose computational problems due to non-local weight transport during mismatch learning were described in the 1980s. Deep Learning became popular after very fast computers and huge online databases became available that enabled new applications despite these problems. Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, algorithms overcome the computational problems of back propagation and Deep Learning. ART is a self-organizing production system that incrementally learns, using arbitrary combinations of unsupervised and supervised learning and only locally computable quantities, to rapidly classify large non-stationary databases without experiencing catastrophic forgetting. ART classifications and predictions are explainable using the attended critical feature patterns in STM on which they build. The LTM adaptive weights of the fuzzy ARTMAP algorithm induce fuzzy IF-THEN rules that explain what feature combinations predict successful outcomes. ART has been successfully used in multiple large-scale real world applications, including remote sensing, medical database prediction, and social media data clustering. Also explainable are the MOTIVATOR model of reinforcement learning and cognitive-emotional interactions, and the VITE, DIRECT, DIVA, and SOVEREIGN models for reaching, speech production, spatial navigation, and autonomous adaptive intelligence. These biological models exemplify complementary computing, and use local laws for match learning and mismatch learning that avoid the problems of Deep Learning.

AB  - With the increase in the number of internet users, the problems associated with excessive internet use have become increasingly obvious. Internet addiction can alter neurobiology, and its symptoms can be alleviated through exercise, but whether exercise exerts these effects through neurobiological pathways is unclear. Here, we reviewed the neurobiological mechanisms of exercise-based interventions against internet addiction by searching PubMed and Google Scholar for relevant research using such keywords as "exercise", "internet addiction", "hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis", "neurotrophin", and "dopamine". This review summarizes advances in our understanding of the neurobiological processes through which exercise can reduce internet addiction, and our analysis strengthens the idea that exercise-based interventions can be effective in this regard. The available evidence suggests that exercise can increase the levels of neurotrophic factors, cortisol, and neurotransmitters; improve the morphology of specific parts of the central nervous system, such as by stimulating hippocampal neurogenesis; protect the autonomic nervous system; and control the reward urge. In other words, exercise appears to mitigate internet addiction by regulating the neurobiology of the central and autonomic nervous systems. In this way, exercise-based interventions can be recommended for reducing internet addiction.

AB  - Objective: Suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour are both regarded as important risk factors for suicide, but it is usually believed that suicidal ideation is less strongly linked to suicide than suicidal behaviours. In this study, we assessed and compared the strengths of the associations that suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour have with later suicide using meta-analysis of primary studies reporting both these independent variables and the dependent variable of suicide. Methods: A total of 51 English language publications describing cohort or controlled studies that reported on both the association between suicidal ideation and suicide and the association between suicidal behaviours and suicide were located using searches for titles in PubMed containing variants of the word suicide (suicid*). Suicides were considered to include reported suicides and open verdicts from mortality registers. The strengths of the two associations were examined in separate random effects meta-analyses and were then compared using mixed effects meta-regression. Subgroups were examined according to study characteristics including the definitions of suicidal ideation or behaviour used, setting (psychiatric or non-psychiatric), diagnostic mix of the study population, study design (cohort or control) and study quality. Results: Suicidal ideation (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% confidence interval = 2.51, 3.86) and suicidal behaviours (odds ratio = 4.09, 95% confidence interval = 3.05, 5.49) were both significantly associated with suicide but there was no significant difference in the strengths of association (p = 0.14). Nor were there significant differences in the strengths of the two associations in multiple subgroup analyses. Conclusion: Suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour are both moderately associated with suicide. Existing data cannot conclusively demonstrate that suicidal behaviours are more strongly associated with suicide than suicidal ideation. Clinicians should not strongly prioritise suicidal behaviour over suicidal ideation when considering suicide risk.

AB  - Involuntary musical imagery (INMI) refers to a conscious mental experience of music that occurs without deliberate efforts to initiate or sustain it. This experience often consists of the repetition of a short fragment of a melody, colloquially called an "earworm." Here, we present the first comprehensive, qualitative review of published empirical research on INMI to date. We performed an extensive literature search and discovered, in total, 47 studies from 33 peer-reviewed articles that met the inclusion criteria for the review. In analyzing the content of these studies, we identified four major research themes, which concern thephenomenology, dynamics, individual differences,andmusical featuresof INMI. The findings answer many questions of scientific interest-for instance, what is typical in terms of INMI frequency, duration, and content; which factors influence INMI onset; and whether demographic and personality factors can explain individual differences in susceptibility and responses to INMI. This review showcases INMI as a well-established phenomenon in light of a substantial body of empirical studies that have accumulated consistent results. Although the populations under study show an unfavorable bias towards Western, educated participants, the evidence depicts INMI as a universal psychological phenomenon, the possible function of which we do not yet fully understand. The concluding section introduces several suggestions for future research to expand on the topic.

AB  - The objective of the current study was to systematically review the available literature on the relation between behavioral and cardiac indicators used to measure distress in toddlerhood. After ascertaining the eligibility of 2,424 articles through a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) guided search process, 22 articles (N= 2,504) that investigated associations between behavioral and cardiac indicators of distress in toddlerhood were identified. The narrative synthesis described the overall relation (direction [positive, negative], strength [Cohen'sD]) between behavioral and cardiac indicators and was organized by cardiac indicator (i.e., heart rate [HR], heart period, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, pre-ejection period) and type of behavior measured (i.e., coding for expressed emotion behaviors vs. emotion regulation behaviors). Methodological characteristics (i.e., timing of measurement for behavioral and cardiac indicators [concurrent, predictive], length of measurement epochs, inclusion of covariates and moderators) were also described. HR was consistently positively (D= .05 to .54) related to expressed emotion behaviors. No other cardiac and behavioral indicators were consistently related. Methodological differences related to behavioral and cardiac indicators utilized, timing of measurement, and length of measurement epochs may be responsible for heterogeneity in findings. The findings suggest that researchers might get divergent results depending on whether distress is measured with cardiac or behavioral indicators of distress in toddlerhood. Suggestions for future psychophysiological research with young children are offered.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are characterized by a progressive loss of selective neuron subtypes in the central nervous system (CNS). Although various factors account for the initiation and development of these diseases, accumulating evidence shows that impaired mitochondrial function is a prominent and common mechanism. Mitochondria play a critical role in neurons and are involved in energy production, cellular metabolism regulation, intracellular calcium homeostasis, immune responses, and cell fate. Thus, cells in the CNS heavily rely on mitochondrial integrity. Many aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction are manifested in neurodegenerative diseases, including aberrant mitochondrial quality control (mitoQC), mitochondrial-driven inflammation, and bioenergetic defects. Herein, we briefly summarize the molecular basis of mitoQC, including mitochondrial proteostasis, biogenesis, dynamics, and organelle degradation. We also focus on the research, to date, regarding aberrant mitoQC and mitochondrial-driven inflammation in several common neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we outline novel therapeutic strategies that target aberrant mitoQC in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - This review and meta-analysis explores the experimental effects of expansive and contractive motor displays on affective, hormonal, and behavioral responses. Experimental studies were located through systematic literature searches. Studies had to manipulate motor displays to either expansive or contractive displays and investigate the effect of the displays on affect, hormones, or overt behavior. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the pooled, standardized mean differences between the effects of motor displays on affective, hormonal, and behavioral responses. From 5,819 unique records, 73 relevant studies were identified. Robust differences between expansive and contractive displays emerged for affective responses and overt behavioral responses across contexts, type of manipulation, and methods of measurement. The results suggest that the effects are driven by the absence of contractive motor displays (contractive vs. neutral displays: Hedges'sg= 0.45) rather than the presence of expansive displays (expansive vs. neutral displays:g= 0.06). The findings stand as a corrective to previous research, as they indicate that it is the absence of contractive displays rather than the presence of expansive displays that alters affective and behavioral responding. Future research should include neutral control groups, use different methods to assess hormonal change, and investigate these effects in the context of ideographic goals.

AB  - Objectives This study aims to systematically review research on the association between resilience as a personality trait and mental health in older adults and to meta-analytically quantify this relation. Methods We included studies assessing older adults (mean age 60 years or older), measuring trait resilience with a version of the Resilience Scale (RS) by Wagnild and Young and mental health. We conducted a comprehensive search in Medline, Web of Science, PsycInfo, PubPsych, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Full Text database and the theses database of the German National Library for eligible studies. Study data on associations between resilience and mental health were aggregated using a random-effects model. Results Twenty-seven studies with 13 444 participants were included. Trait resilience and mental health were strongly interrelated (r = 0.40, 95% CI [0.36; 0.44]) with substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 83%). Published studies revealed larger associations between resilience and mental health (r = 0.41 [0.37; 0.45]) than unpublished studies (r = 0.25 [0.11; 0.38]). Conclusions Higher levels of resilience are associated with better mental health in older persons. Because associations were solely assessed cross-sectionally, longitudinal studies are highly needed to draw causal inferences.

AB  - Neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction causes primary mitochondrial diseases and likely contributes to neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been documented in neurodevelopmental disorders such as tuberous sclerosis complex and autism spectrum disorder. Only symptomatic treatments exist for neurodevelopmental disorders, while neurodegenerative diseases are largely untreatable. Altered mitochondrial function activates mitochondrial retrograde signalling pathways, which enable signalling to the nucleus to reprogramme nuclear gene expression. In this review, we discuss the role of mitochondrial retrograde signalling in neurological diseases. We summarize how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to neurodegenerative disease and neurodevelopmental disorders. Mitochondrial signalling mechanisms that have relevance to neurological disease are discussed. We then describe studies documenting retrograde signalling pathways in neurons and glia, and in animal models of neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction and neurological disease. Finally, we suggest how specific retrograde signalling pathways can be targeted to develop novel treatments for neurological diseases.

AB  - The association between intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety has proved robust in neurotypical populations and has led to effective interventions targeting intolerance of uncertainty. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate this association in autistic people, given the high prevalence of anxiety in this population and the limited effectiveness of therapies used currently to treat anxiety in autism. A protocol was published on the Prospero database (CRD42019125315), and electronic databases were searched using terms related to intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety and autism. Included in the systematic review were 12 studies, of which 10 were included in a meta-analysis. Results showed that anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty were consistently elevated in autistic participants. Examining the correlation between these two constructs, the meta-analysis revealed a large sample-weighted effect size,r = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = [0.52, 0.71],p < 0.001. The strength of this association was comparable to meta-analyses conducted on neurotypical populations, and therefore, it was concluded intolerance of uncertainty may be an appropriate target for intervention for autistic individuals. However, conclusions were limited due to the small number of relevant studies that were available and due to issues with methodological quality. Lay abstract People who find it especially hard to cope with the unexpected or unknown are said to have an intolerance of uncertainty. Autistic individuals often report a preference for certainty and experience levels of anxiety that can interfere with their daily life. Understanding more about the link between the intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety in autistic people might lead to better treatments for anxiety being developed. Therefore, this work aimed to review previous research in order to explore this link. Twelve studies were found and their results were compared and contrasted. The autistic people who participated in the studies completed questionnaires that suggested a large number of them experienced very high levels of anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty. Of 10 studies that used relevant statistics, nine found a statistically significant link between anxiety and the intolerance of uncertainty. In general, the strength of the link was about the same as previous research found in people who did not have a diagnosis of autism. This might mean that interventions that aim to help people who are intolerant of uncertainty could be effective for autistic individuals.

AB  - The increasing number of asylum seekers and refugees in Europe calls for even more professionals to take care of refugees' mental health. Although different studies claim that migration could be a potential risk factor for self-harming behaviours, an in-depth exploration of the presence and characteristics of self-harm in the context of asylum is needed. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted across the databases Scopus, PubMed, Web of Knowledge and PsycArticles, regarding the main features of self-harming behaviour among refugees in Europe. Twelve articles and 3 main trajectories were identified: (1)A context at-risk: self-harm and detention centres; (2)A target at-risk: self-harm and unaccompanied minors; (3)A comparison between the mental health of asylum seekers and natives. Research on this topic in Europe is still underdeveloped and disorganised. Studies have mainly carried out wider quantitative investigations on mental health, usually overlapping self-harm with suicide. Detention centres emerged as the most widely investigated context and the one with the highest risk for self-harming behaviours. Instead, unaccompanied minors emerged as a particularly vulnerable category. Research in this field should be improved, combining quantitative and qualitative methods for a deeper understanding of the meanings of self-harm across cultures.

AB  - Autism is a grand challenge in global mental health to be dealt with on a priority basis. Phenotypic knowledge, biological understanding, and evidence-based intervention studies are all from western countries. We know very little about autism in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Lack of infrastructure and difficulties in operationalizing research has widened the knowledge gap. We performed a comprehensive scoping review of research in Autism Spectrum Disorder in India to have an overall impression, identify gaps, and formulate evidence-based recommendations for further study. We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library to identify relevant Indian studies. A hundred and fifty-nine publications met the inclusion criteria. Most of the research contribution in autism is from few tertiary care medical centres, technological institutes, and not-for-profit organizations. We identified various themes of research like clinical profile, interventions, biomarkers, psychological, social, epidemiological, and risk factors. Evidence-based intervention studies, translation and adaptation of standard diagnostic instruments, and qualitative research on the experience of autism appeared to be state of the art. However, epidemiological studies, biomarkers identification, risk assessment studies were of low quality. There is a need for nationwide studies with representative sampling on epidemiology, biomarkers, and risk factors for a complete evaluation of the actual burden and biology of autism in India. Also, there is a need to design implementation research to evaluate the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions in routine healthcare settings. We recommend that future research should fill these gaps in understanding autism and improving its outcome in India.

AB  - Children and adults with autism spectrum disorder are less accurate in facial emotion recognition, which is thought to contribute to impairment in social functioning. Although many interventions have been developed to improve facial emotion recognition, there is no consensus on how to best measure facial emotion recognition in people with autism spectrum disorder. This lack of agreement has led to wide variability in how facial emotion recognition is measured and, subsequently, inconsistent findings related to impact of intervention targeting facial emotion recognition impairment. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the extant research on measurement of facial emotion recognition in the context of treatment. We conducted an electronic database search to identify relevant, peer-reviewed articles published between January 1998 and November 2019 to identify studies evaluating change in facial emotion recognition in autism spectrum disorder. Sixty-five studies met inclusion criteria, utilizing a total of 36 different assessment measures for facial emotion recognition in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Only six of the measures were used in multiple studies conducted by different investigative teams. The outcomes of the studies are reported and summarized with the goal of informing future research. Lay Abstract Children and adults with autism spectrum disorder show difficulty recognizing facial emotions in others, which makes social interaction challenging. While there are many treatments developed to improve facial emotion recognition, there is no agreement on the best way to measure such abilities in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The purpose of this review is to examine studies that were published between January 1998 and November 2019 and have measured change in facial emotion recognition to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments. Our search yielded 65 studies, and within these studies, 36 different measures were used to evaluate facial emotion recognition in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Only six of these measures, however, were used in different studies and by different investigators. In this review, we summarize the different measures and outcomes of the studies, in order to identify promising assessment tools and inform future research.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this article is to provide a narrative overview of theories that are available in the published literature on wayfinding in interior environments. Background: Wayfinding is an issue in healthcare facilities, and it has been documented that wayfinding problems have negative impacts on patients, visitors, caregivers' time, and the organization's bottom line. This issue can be more challenging for people with illness, low vision, cognitive disorders, and limited physical mobility. Wayfinding is a complex phenomenon depending on a variety of cognitive processes and behaviors. Methods: This article is a part of a broader literature review that searched for empirical studies on interior wayfinding. Four databases were systematically searched-PsychINFO, JSTOR, ProQuest, and EBSCO. A total of 81 articles satisfied all inclusion criteria for the broader study. Each article included in the broader study was reviewed to identify theory or theories, if any, that a study was founded on. Results: After an in-depth review of the theories, the authors proposed four categories of theories relating to human wayfinding. The four classes and the specific theories in those are articulated in this article, including major changes during their evolution. The four classes of theories explain four facets of wayfinding: (1) theories of perception, (2) theories of spatial knowledge development, (3) theories of mental representation of spatial knowledge, and (4) theories of spatial cognition. Conclusion: Since wayfinding is essentially a cognitive/problem-solving phenomenon, understanding the theoretical underpinnings of wayfinding may result in more meaningful and impactful design decisions.

AB  - Coral reefs are one of the most biodiverse and economically important ecosystems in the world, but they are rapidly degrading due to the effects of global climate change and local anthropogenic stressors. Reef scientists are increasingly studying coral reefs that occur in marginal and extreme environments to understand how organisms respond to, and cope with, environmental stress, and to gain insight into how reef organisms may acclimate or adapt to future environmental change. To date, there have been more than 860 publications describing the biology and/or abiotic conditions of marginal and extreme reef environments, most of which were published within the past decade. These include systems characterized by unusually high, low, and/or variable temperatures (intertidal, lagoonal, high-latitude areas, and shallow seas), turbid or urban environments, acidified habitats, and mesophotic depth, and focus on reefs geographically spread throughout most of the tropics. The papers in this special issue of Coral Reefs, entitledCoral Reefs in a Changing World: Insights from Extremes, build on the growing body of literature on these unique and important ecosystems, providing a deeper understanding of the patterns and processes governing life in marginal reef systems, and the implications that these insights may have for the future of tropical coral reefs in our rapidly changing world.

AB  - Racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric anesthesia health services could result in minority children being at increased risk of poor outcomes, such as pain, anxiety, or over-exposure to medications. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the literature on such disparities does not exist to date. The objective of this study is to describe health services disparities in pediatric anesthetic care in the pre-, intra-, or post-operative period by synthesizing current literature. We searched the National Library of Medicine's PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 2007, and May 9, 2020, to identify literature on racial and ethnic health services disparities in pediatric anesthesia. We used the Institute of Medicine's definition of disparities. Health services were related to pre-, intra-, or post-operative anesthetic care of pediatric patients (< 18 years old). Out of 2110 studies, 10 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Nine out of the ten articles were single-institutional observational studies, based at tertiary hospitals. Sample sizes ranged from 74 to 37,618 discrete participants, for a total of 69,350 subjects across all studies. Results of these studies present low-quality evidence and heterogeneous conclusions regarding pediatric anesthesia health services disparities. This review demonstrates the paucity and diversity of research on racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric anesthesia health services and suggests how future work might utilize improved data and rigorous study designs.

AB  - "Phytoplankton" is a loosely defined functional term, indicating a group of organisms distributed into several taxonomic groups ranging from oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria to a number of eukaryotic classes included in protists. The range of specializations and adaptations of phytoplankton to a wide variety of environmental conditions is astounding. This demonstrates the susceptibility of highly different populations to react rapidly to environmental changes generated by natural stressors and anthropogenic impacts. The aim of this work is to critically review the state of the art of knowledge about the impact of anthropogenic stress factors on phytoplankton composition and structure. At present, the two most important environmental stressors are represented by climate change and eutrophication, which act globally and at regional/local scales, respectively. Along with effects mediated by many other legacy and emerging stressors (briefly reviewed), the effects of these two main changes have been analysed at different levels of phytoplankton organization, i.e. individuals, populations and communities. It is stressed that a better knowledge will be obtained by extending the focus of studies from organisms detectable by light microscopy to the whole range of protists and microbial populations detected with the use of "omics" technologies, including e.g. next generation sequencing and ecological metabolomics.

AB  - Background Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common severe mental disorder among homeless people and is associated with an increased risk of disability and mortality from suicide, medical causes (including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis infection, hypertension, and tuberculosis), as well as substance use disorders. However, a systematic synthesis of the existing evidence on the subject is lacking. To fill this gap in the literature, this study aimed to carry out systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the consolidated prevalence of BD among homeless people. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus to identify pertinent studies that reported the prevalence of BD among homeless people in March 2019. Random effect meta-analysis was employed to pool data from the eligible studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis was conducted and Cochran's Q- and the I-2 test were utilized to quantify heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by using Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots. Results Of 3236 studies identified, 10 studies with 4300 homeless individuals were included in the final analysis. Among the 10 studies, five studies used the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM), three studies used Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), one study used Schedule for Clinical Assessment of Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), and one study used Composite International Neuropsychiatric Interview (CIDI) to assess BD among homeless individuals. Based on the results of the random effect model, the prevalence of BD among homeless people was 11.4% (95% CI; 7.5-16.9). The prevalence of BD was 10.0% (95% CI; 3.1-27.9) in Europe and it was 13.2% (95% CI; 8.9-19.3) in other countries. Moreover, the prevalence of BD was 11.5% (95% CI; 5.5-22.3) for studies that used DSM to assess BD and it was 11.0% (95% CI; 6.1-19.2) for studies that used other instruments (MINI, SCAN, and CIDI). Conclusion Our meta-analysis demonstrated that BD is highly prevalent among homeless individuals, underlying the importance of early screening and targeted interventions for BD among homeless individuals.

AB  - Purpose of Review The International Classification of Diseases-11th edition (ICD-11) is poised to make a dramatic change in the diagnosis of personality disorders by introducing a fully dimensionalized framework. In this paper, the history of this process is reviewed, along with international efforts taken to address some underlying concerns with this transition. Recent studies of this framework are also reviewed. Recent Findings Studies have concluded that the ICD-11 proposal is supported; however, there are a number of methodological limitations to these studies, including the utilization of measures that are not directly derived from the ICD-11 description of levels of personality severity and trait domains. There is a clear need for additional studies with measures that directly reflect the ICD-11 description of personality disorders. While there are some potentially positive effects of moving toward the dimensional model, there are a number of concerns remaining about the clinical utility of moving in this way.

AB  - Among various means of communication, the human face is utmost powerful. Persons suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hypomimia which often leads to reduction in facial expression. Hypomimia affects in social interaction and has a highly undesirable impact on patient's as well as his relative's quality of life. To track the longitudinal progression of PD, usually Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is used in clinical studies and item 3.2 (i.e., facial expression) of MDS-UPDRS defines hypomimia levels. Assessment of facial expressions has traditionally relied on an observer-based scale which can be time-consuming. Computational analysis techniques for facial expressions can assist the clinician in decision making. Intention of such techniques is to predict objective and accurate score for facial expression. The aim of this paper is to present up-to-date review on computational analysis techniques for measurement of emotional facial expression of people with PD (PWP) along with an overview on clinical applications of automated facial expression analysis. This led us to examine a pilot experimental work for masked face detection in PD. For the same, a deep learning-based model was trained on NVIDIA GeForce 920M GPU. It was observed that deep learning-based model yields 85% accuracy on the testing images.

Objective: The purpose of this review is to synthesize existing evidence on African American caregiver medication decision making (MDM) for children with ADHD. Method: Databases queried for this review included the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsychINFO, PubMed, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). Information regarding the unique culturally specific barriers and supports to MDM were examined through the relevant literature search. Results: Fourteen articles were included in this review (seven observational studies, four qualitative studies, three mixed methods studies). Three main themes were identified which include (a) fundamental perspectives of ADHD, and cultural norms for child behavior; (b) the impact of fundamental perspectives on MDM in ADHD; and (c) ADHD diagnosis and treatment as forms of social control. Conclusion: Evidence-based recommendations for clinicians are provided, along with direction for future research.

AB  - Although many scholars deem non-invasive measures of neurophysiology to have promise in assessing learning, these measures are currently not widely applied, neither in educational settings nor in training. How can non-invasive neurophysiology provide insight into learning and how should research on this topic move forward to ensure valid applications? The current article addresses these questions by discussing the mechanisms underlying neurophysiological changes during learning followed by a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of non-invasive neurophysiology in learning and training. This type of analysis can provide a structured examination of factors relevant to the current state and future of a field. The findings of the SWOT analysis indicate that the field of neurophysiology in learning and training is developing rapidly. By leveraging the opportunities of neurophysiology in learning and training (while bearing in mind weaknesses, threats, and strengths) the field can move forward in promising directions. Suggestions for opportunities for future work are provided to ensure valid and effective application of non-invasive neurophysiology in a wide range of learning and training settings.

AB  - Radioisotopes have been used in earth and environmental sciences for over 150 years and provide unique tools to study environmental processes in great detail from a cellular level through to an oceanic basin scale. These nuclear techniques have been employed to understand coastal and marine ecosystems via laboratory and field studies in terms of how aquatic organisms respond to environmental stressors, including temperature, pH, nutrients, metals, organic anthropogenic contaminants, and biological toxins. Global marine issues, such as ocean warming, deoxygenation, plastic pollution, ocean acidification, increased duration, and intensity of toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs), and coastal contamination are all impacting marine environments, thereby imposing various environmental and economic risks. Being able to reliably assess the condition of coastal and marine ecosystems, and how they may respond to future disturbances, can provide vital information for society in the sustainable management of their marine environments. This paper summarizes the historical use of radiotracers in these systems, describes how existing techniques of radioecological tracing can be developed for specific current environmental issues and provides information on emerging issues that would benefit from current and new radiotracer methods. Current challenges with using radioecological tracers and opportunities are highlighted, as well as opportunities to maximize the application of these methods to greatly increase the ability of environmental managers to conduct evidence-based management of coastal and marine ecosystems.

AB  - Background:One of the most common problems associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is cognitive impairments (CIs) leading to reduced quality of life and treatment adherence in patients. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on cognitive function in CVD patients. Material and method:PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Ovid MEDLINE databases were searched for identification the relevant studies without language restriction. We included the studies published from root to August 2019, evaluating the effects of CR on at least one type of cognitive functions through valid neuropsychological tests. Finally, nine studies with different study designs were entered in this systematic review. The full texts of these studies were critically appraised with various quality assessment tools. Result:Patients were evaluated by different cognitive domains including global cognition, attention, executive function, memory and language prior to and following CR program among included studies. Most of the included studies reported significant cognitive improvement of the attention/executive function and memory domains. Two studies showed statistically significant improvement in global cognition using Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tools. Similar effects were not found in language domain. Conclusion:It seems that cognitive impairments in CVD patients can be improved with CR program. Because this review is limited by low number of included studies, and there were various study designs without control groups, the results should be generalized cautiously. Further studies are recommended.

AB  - Background In today's society, sleep disturbances and back pain are both common problems which threaten health. Although some studies have focused on the effects of sleep disturbances on back pain, no meta-analysis has been done. The purpose of this study is to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis on the effects of sleep disturbances on back pain.
   Methods A literature search in PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE with keywords until June 2019 was performed. The eligible articles were evaluated qualitatively and the results were pooled using random effects. The publication bias and the degree of heterogeneity were examined.
   Results In all, 21 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Sleep disturbances were associated with back pain (odds ratio 1.52; confidence interval [CI] 1.37-1.68;P < 0.001). In men, the odds ratio was 1.49 (CI 1.34-1.65;P < 0.001). In women, the odds ratio was 1.56 (CI 1.33-1.81; P < 0.001). Begg's test (P= 0.856) and Egger test (P= 0.188) did not show any publication bias. A funnel plot and trim-and-fill method showed publication bias, and heterogeneity was also high.
   Conclusions Sleep disturbance is associated with risk of back pain. Improving sleep can be a deterrent against back pain. Therefore, interventions to reduce sleep disturbances can help to improve health. On the other hand, the relationship between sleep disturbances and back pain can be two-sided, and back pain can also lead to sleep disturbances. Not only in view of the lifetime prevalence and the multifactorial impairments of those affected, but also in consideration of social and economic burdens, this issue will remain of considerable importance.

AB  - Background Permanent supportive housing and income assistance are valuable interventions for homeless individuals. Homelessness can reduce physical and social wellbeing, presenting public health risks for infectious diseases, disability, and death. We did a systematic review, meta-analysis, and narrative synthesis to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of permanent supportive housing and income interventions on the health and social wellbeing of individuals who are homeless in high-income countries.
   Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Epistemonikos, NIHR-HTA, NHS EED, DARE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to Feb 10, 2020, for studies on permanent supportive housing and income interventions for homeless populations. We included only randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and cost-effectiveness studies from high-income countries that reported at least one outcome of interest (housing stability, mental health, quality of life, substance use, hospital admission, earned income, or employment). We screened studies using a standardised data collection form and pooled data from published studies. We synthesised results using random effects meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.
   Findings Our search identified 15 908 citations, of which 72 articles were included for analysis (15 studies on permanent supportive housing across 41 publications, ten studies on income interventions across 15 publications, and 21 publications on cost or cost-effectiveness). Permanent supportive housing interventions increased long-term (6 year) housing stability for participants with moderate support needs (one study; rate ratio [RR] 1.13 [95% CI 1.01-1.26]) and high support needs (RR 1.42 [1.19-1.69]) when compared with usual care. Permanent supportive housing had no measurable effect on the severity of psychiatric symptoms (ten studies), substance use (nine studies), income (two studies), or employment outcomes (one study) when compared with usual social services. Income interventions, particularly housing subsidies with case management, showed long-term improvements in the number of days stably housed (one study; mean difference at 3 years between intervention and usual services 8.58 days; p<0.004), whereas the effects on mental health and employment outcomes were unclear.
   Interpretation Permanent supportive housing and income assistance interventions were effective in reducing homelessness and achieving housing stability. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of housing and income interventions on physical and mental health, substance use, and quality-of-life outcomes. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Although sexual minority stress remains the dominant perspective for understanding disproportionate substance use among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations, social norms are among the most predictive and commonly targeted substance use antecedents in other high-risk groups. This scoping review seeks to bring clarity to the body of norms-focused alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) research conducted with LGBs over the past 20 years, identify intervention implications, and present priority directions for future research. Fifty-two peer-reviewed studies published between June 1999 and June 2019 were identified from searches of PubMed, PsycINFO, and Medline databases using combinations of terms related to: social norms; sexual orientation or sexual minority status; and, the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. A far greater number of studies focused on actual ATOD norms than perceived ATOD norms or discrepancies between actual or perceived norms, illuminating the need for additional research focused on these levels of analysis. Taken together, this literature suggests that: (a) perceived ATOD norms are reliable predictors of LGBs' ATOD use; (b) actual ATOD use norms are low among LGBs participating in representative, population-based survey studies; and (c) LGBs overestimate the ATOD use of peers. Thus, intervention strategies including personalized normative feedback, psychoeducation, and social branding may hold promise in reducing LGBs substance use. However, additional research is needed to increase our understanding of injunctive ATOD norms, identify meaningful LGB reference groups, elucidate environmental influences on ATOD norms, and examine relationships between stigma experiences, perceived norms, and ATOD use.

AB  - Although there is growing interest in the use of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as a treatment for suicidality, efficacy data in this area, and knowledge of potential treatment mechanisms, remains limited. The first objective of this study was to systematically review clinical trial data examining the effectiveness of TMS as a treatment for suicidal ideation. Our secondary objective was to investigate the extent to which changes in suicidality are independent of improvements in depression in a clinical sample of veterans who received TMS treatment. In Study 1, we searched the Pubmed and biRxiv databases from inception until July 2019 to identify studies that examined the efficacy of TMS for suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors. Data regarding sample characteristics, treatment parameters, and results were synthesized from six randomized controlled trials and five unblinded trials (total n = 593). Our systematic review indicated that while TMS was consistently associated with reduced depression, its impact on suicidality is unclear. Interpretation of results related to suicidality were complicated by study design elements and modest sample sizes. In Study 2, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 43 patients who received care for depression in a neuromodulation clinic at a Veteran's Affairs hospital. Results found significant decreases in suicidal ideation, and depressive symptom change did not always account for improvements in ideation. Taken together, our literature review and clinic study indicate preliminary promise of TMS for suicide, and underscore the need for more fine-grained, suicide-specific TMS research.

Methods: A meta-synthesis. Inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed qualitative single studies of fathers' experiences during the first week after early discharge (defined as less than 72 hours postpartum) from hospital after the birth of a healthy singleton baby born between weeks 37 and 40. Databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, Maternity and Infant Care, Joanna Briggs, SweMed+ and PsycInfo were searched in May 2015 and May 2018. Of the 940 titles scanned for eligibility, three articles met the inclusion criteria. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research checklist was used. Findings: All included studies were conducted in Sweden during the period 2002-2012. The total sample of participants in the meta-synthesis comprised 35 fathers. Analysis of the included studies generated two themes: building confidence and coping with responsibility. Conclusions: The fathers' experiences were affected by the emotional support of midwives, which boosted their confidence. This seems to be a premise for taking and coping with responsibility during the first days at home. Good cooperation between hospitals and municipalities is vital, and midwives must be available and present in order to ensure continuity in maternity care.

AB  - The risk of suicide is significant during the transition of care; the highest in the first few weeks after discharge from a healthcare facility. This systematic review summarizes the evidence for interventions providing care during this high-risk period. In January 2019, PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched using the search terms: Suicide AND (Hospital OR Emergency department) AND Discharge. Articles relevant to interventions targeting suicidal behaviors during the transition of care were selected after the title and abstract screening followed by full-text screening. This review article included 40 articles; with a total patient population of 24,568. The interventions included telephone contacts, letters, green cards, postcards, structured visits, and community outreach programs. An improvement in the engagement of patients in outpatient services was observed but the evidence for suicidal behaviors was conflicting. The reviewed interventions were efficacious in linking patients to outpatient services, reducing feelings of social isolation and helping patients in navigating the available community resources. For patients with repetitive suicidal behaviors, psychosocial interventions such as dialectical behavioral therapy can be helpful. Patients should be followed by targeted interventions based on risk categorization of the patients by using evidence-based tools.

A systematic search of five databases along with manual searching and expert consultation was performed. A quality appraisal was conducted. A total of 29 articles were included. Prevalence of PDs in ED attendees varied depending on presenting complaint, Q(4) = 577.5, p < .01, with meta-analytic prevalence rates of suicide and self-harm at 35% and 22%, respectively. The assessment method had a significant effect on prevalence rates, Q(3) = 17.36, p < .01. Comorbid PD was a risk factor for repeating presenting complaint, subsequent ED return, and hospitalization. Better identification of PDs using screening tools in EDs could improve patient management and clinical outcomes. Future research should focus on PD prevalence in unselected ED populations using validated diagnostic interviews.

AB  - As a part of a larger Affectome Project (http://neuroqualia.org/background.php) with an overarching goal of mapping and redefining biological substrates of feelings and emotions, we explored the neural underpinnings for the functions of motivation and emotion. Historically emotion and motivation have been placed into distinct neural circuits and examined separately. We propose a novel view of significant neural convergence of emotion and motivation, in contrast to conventional neural-based frameworks emphasizing segregation. Evidence from diverse research areas in emotion and motivation was reviewed, pinpointing key neural regions of overlap. The findings support important neural sharing between emotion and motivation, suggesting that these two functions are tightly intertwined with one another in the brain. Neural overlap does not necessarily imply continuous functional overlap. Even if identical brain regions/systems are activated for motivation and emotion, this activation may involve distinct and unique patterns of connection and information flow as the network shifts functionality. This review highlights the crucial importance of further research to explicate the patterns and modes of responding of these overlapping systems.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic non-essential transition metal that poses a health risk for both humans and animals. It is naturally occurring in the environment as a pollutant that is derived from agricultural and industrial sources. Exposure to cadmium primarily occurs through the ingestion of contaminated food and water and, to a significant extent, through inhalation and cigarette smoking. Cadmium accumulates in plants and animals with a long half-life of about 25-30 years. Epidemiological data suggest that occupational and environmental cadmium exposure may be related to various types of cancer, including breast, lung, prostate, nasopharynx, pancreas, and kidney cancers. It has been also demonstrated that environmental cadmium may be a risk factor for osteoporosis. The liver and kidneys are extremely sensitive to cadmium's toxic effects. This may be due to the ability of these tissues to synthesize metallothioneins (MT), which are Cd-inducible proteins that protect the cell by tightly binding the toxic cadmium ions. The oxidative stress induced by this xenobiotic may be one of the mechanisms responsible for several liver and kidney diseases. Mitochondria damage is highly plausible given that these organelles play a crucial role in the formation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and are known to be among the key intracellular targets for cadmium. When mitochondria become dysfunctional after exposure to Cd, they produce less energy (ATP) and more ROS. Recent studies show that cadmium induces various epigenetic changes in mammalian cells, both in vivo and in vitro, causing pathogenic risks and the development of various types of cancers. The epigenetics present themselves as chemical modifications of DNA and histones that alter the chromatin without changing the sequence of the DNA nucleotide. DNA methyltransferase, histone acetyltransferase, histone deacetylase and histone methyltransferase, and micro RNA are involved in the epigenetic changes. Recently, investigations of the capability of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), and river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) to remove cadmium from polluted soil and water have been carried out. Moreover, nanoparticles of TiO2 and Al2O3 have been used to efficiently remove cadmium from wastewater and soil. Finally, microbial fermentation has been studied as a promising method for removing cadmium from food. This review provides an update on the effects of Cd exposure on human health, focusing on the cellular and molecular alterations involved.

   Methods PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to August 2, 2019, without language restriction. The random-effects model was used to summarize effect sizes.
   Results We retrieved 1,493 records, of which 22 studies met inclusion criteria. Our overall analyses revealed that individuals with ASD had significantly decreased levels of Met (22 studies; Hedges' g = -0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.89, -0.35), SAM (8 studies; Hedges' g = -0.60; 95% CI: -0.86, -0.34), and the SAM/SAH ratio (8 studies; Hedges' g = -0.98; 95% CI: -1.30, -0.66) and significantly increased levels of SAH (8 studies; Hedges' g = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.94). The findings of the overall analyses were quite stable after being verified by sensitivity analyses and in agreement with the corresponding outcomes of subgroup analyses. Additionally, our results from meta-analytic techniques confirmed that the effect estimates of this meta-analysis did not originate from publication bias.
   Conclusion Individuals with ASD have substantially aberrant peripheral blood levels of Met, SAM, SAH, and the SAM/SAH ratio, which supports the association between impaired methylation capacity and ASD. Therefore, further investigations into these indices as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic targets of ASD are warranted.

AB  - Functional cerebral asymmetries (FCAs) are a fundamental principle of brain organisation. While specific patterns of asymmetry are characteristic of healthy human brains, atypical or reduced FCAs have been reported for several psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and mood disorders. However, it is unclear whether atypical FCAs reflect a predisposition to psychotic disorders or a compensatory neural strategy for the progressive structural and functional changes in the brain associated with psychosis. A separate stream of research has demonstrated the antipsychotic effects of sex hormones in clinical populations. Moreover, modern neuroscience has shown that sex hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, can affect FCAs due to their organising effects (e.g., during prenatal development), and also by their activating effects throughout life (e.g., in younger women during the menstrual cycle or in post-menopausal women as a consequence of hormone therapy). By combining these research streams, this narrative literature review explores the relationship between the neuromodulatory properties of estrogen, FCAs and psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms. This research is not only of theoretical interest for the understanding of FCAs and psychotic symptoms, but might also be of clinical relevance for the development of stratified treatment approaches for women and men suffering from psychosis and mood disorders.

AB  - Nonhuman primate (NHP) studies are crucial to biomedical research. NHPs are the species most similar to humans in lifespan, body size, and hormonal profiles. Planning research requires statistical power evaluation, which is difficult to perform when lacking directly relevant preliminary data. This is especially true for NHP developmental programming studies, which are scarce. We review the sample sizes reported, challenges, areas needing further work, and goals of NHP maternal nutritional programming studies. The literature search included 27 keywords, for example, maternal obesity, intrauterine growth restriction, maternal high-fat diet, and maternal nutrient reduction. Only fetal and postnatal offspring studies involving tissue collection or imaging were included. Twenty-eight studies investigated maternal over-nutrition and 33 under-nutrition; 23 involved macaques and 38 baboons. Analysis by sex was performed in 19; minimum group size ranged from 1 to 8 (mean 4.7 +/- 0.52, median 4, mode 3) and maximum group size from 3 to 16 (8.3 +/- 0.93, 8, 8). Sexes were pooled in 42 studies; minimum group size ranged from 2 to 16 (mean 5.3 +/- 0.35, median 6, mode 6) and maximum group size from 4 to 26 (10.2 +/- 0.92, 8, 8). A typical study with sex-based analyses had group size minimum 4 and maximum 8 per sex. Among studies with sexes pooled, minimum group size averaged 6 and maximum 8. All studies reported some significant differences between groups. Therefore, studies with group sizes 3-8 can detect significance between groups. To address deficiencies in the literature, goals include increasing age range, more frequently considering sex as a biological variable, expanding topics, replicating studies, exploring intergenerational effects, and examining interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Suicide attempts are a significant global public health concern. Research into non-traditional factors, such as the presence of alexithymia, may shed light on the prediction of suicidal behaviours, which can aid intervention and prevention strategies. To ascertain whether alexithymia is a unique risk factor for suicide attempts, this article reviews the evidence on alexithymia related to suicidal ideation, attempts, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI).
   Methods: A literature search was conducted for original articles examining the general and psychiatric populations.
   Results: There is consistent evidence linking alexithymia with suicidal ideation and NSSI, but inconsistent evidence linking it to suicide attempts.
   Conclusion: The relationship between alexithymia and suicidality seems to differ based on whether the research focuses on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or NSSI. The relationship between alexithymia and suicidality can be understood within the context of multiple code theory and childhood trauma. Future research should explore the whether alexithymia can reliably distinguish between those with a single attempt and those with multiple suicide attempts as well as alexithymia levels pre- and post-intervention with suicide-related behavior as outcomes in treatment studies.

AB  - Cell-based respirometers, such as the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer, are valuable tools to assess the functionality of mitochondria within adherent neurons, as well as other cell types. The Mito Stress Test is the most frequently employed protocol of drug additions to evaluate mitochondrial bioenergetic function. Sequential exposure of cells to an ATP synthase inhibitor such as oligomycin and an uncoupler such as FCCP cause changes in oxygen consumption rate that allow estimation of the cellular efficiency and capacity for mitochondrial ATP synthesis. While a useful first step in assessing whether an experimental treatment or genetic manipulation affects mitochondrial energetics, the Mito Stress Test does not identify specific sites of altered respiratory chain function. This article discusses limitations of the Mito Stress Test, proposes a refined protocol for comparing cell populations that requires independent drug titrations at multiple cell densities, and describes a stepwise series of respirometry-based assays that "map" locations of electron transport deficiency. These include strategies to test for cytochrome c release, to probe the functionality of specific electron transport chain complexes within intact or permeabilized cells, and to measure NADH oxidation by the linked activity of Complexes I, III, and IV. To illustrate utility, we show that although UK5099 and ABT-737 each decrease the spare respiratory capacity of cortical neurons, the stepwise assays reveal different underlying mechanisms consistent with their established drug targets: deficient Complex I substrate supply induced by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibitor UK5099 and cytochrome c release induced by the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein inhibitor ABT-737.

AB  - Contradictory findings in reviews that assess the relationship between the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) and cognitive functioning have been attributed to heterogeneity in the criteria used to assess MedDiet and cognition, and differences in the location or cultural habits of the populations studied. Few reviews have examined the relationship between dietary adherence and cognition or considered the impact of sex differences. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the relationship between adherence to the MedDiet and cognitive functioning of healthy older adults (50+). We included isolated data from Mediterranean regions and considered differential outcomes based on sex. A search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science from 2011 to 2018 identified five longitudinal cohort studies (n=3368) and one randomized controlled trial (RCT; n=239 intervention; n=95 controls). The primary outcome of interest was global cognitive functioning. Meta-analysis of cohort studies revealed a significant association between MedDiet adherence and cognitive functioning (n=3368, r=0.09, p=0.012), an effect greater than previously reported. Meta-regression demonstrated that the effect size was stronger with improved quality of study reporting (p= 0.01). Sex did not impact cognitive outcomes, but sex differences in levels of adherence were reported in individual studies. There might be a stronger association between MedDiet and cognitive functioning for older adults from Mediterranean countries compared to other geographical locations, perhaps due to higher adherence and/or longer exposure over the life course. Results are compared to those of prior meta-analyses, and the impact of sources of heterogeneity is considered. The potential influence of sex and gender, as biological and social constructs, on dietary adherence is discussed.

AB  - Recently, biological markers of maternal prenatal stress, hair cortisol, along with saliva, blood, and urine cortisol, have received attention. However, it is necessary to validate measuring hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) as a biomarker of perceived stress among healthy and high-risk pregnant women. This study aimed to confirm the correlation between HCC and the perceived stress of pregnant women over 18 years of age. In this systematic review, we used various search engines to extract relevant articles using specific keywords related to pregnancy, hair cortisol, and psychological stress. Four out of 3639 studies met the inclusion criteria. We conducted a quality assessment with the help of three independent reviewers using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement. The correlation between HCC and perceived stress was confirmed in one study. There was only one study on hair washing, shampoo, conditioner, and hair structure that could affect hair samples. In four studies, hair samples differed in length, methods of storage, and laboratory analysis. The review was limited to confirming the relationship between HCC and perceived stress in pregnant women based on the current evidence. Studies on hair cortisol need regulated and standardized methods for collection, storage, and analysis of hair samples.

AB  - The population is aging in developed countries. This aging process results in many changes, both physical and mental. Over the years, there has been a gradual decline in the level of cognitive functions closely related to the ageing process, which is most often connected with ageing diseases such as dementia. So far, pharmacological treatment has not yet been able to cure this neurological disorder. Health policies around the world seek to find alternative programs and strategies to help a healthy population prevent cognitive decline and prolong active life. One such strategy appears to be physical activity. The aim of this review is to discuss the impact of physical activity on cognitive performance among healthy older individuals. The methodology of this study is based on a systematic electronic literature search of available studies found in three databases: PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. The findings suggest that any physical activity in older age seems to have a positive impact on the improvement of cognitive function. Furthermore, it appears that dancing, due to its multiple mechanisms, might have the biggest effect on the enhancement of cognitive performance in healthy older individuals. However, controlled clinical trials of physical activity intervention in older adults are rare. Therefore, further research in this area (particularly on the amount of physical activity, its intensity and type) is needed.

AB  - Background: Social firms-a type of social enterprise-offer people with severe disabilities the possibility of employment and integration into the labor market. Since 01 January 2018, social firms in Germany are obligated to provide health promotion interventions for their employees. Therefore, the study aims to provide an overview of the current state of research on working conditions, coping strategies, work- and health-related outcomes, and health promotion interventions in social firms to derive recommendations for action. Methods: The databases PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched. The study selection was based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria in the time period between 2000 and 2019. The quality of the studies was critically appraised in a standardized way using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: A total of 25 studies were included. The current state of research indicated that employees with disabilities were provided with several environmental resources like social support, flexibility, structured work tasks or options for training. A mix of environmental and personal resources impacted several work- and health-related outcomes like well-being, job satisfaction, productivity, work engagement, the motivation to work, or job tenure. Conclusions: There is a need for further (longitudinal) research concerning the work and health situation of employees working in social firms and the development of health promotion interventions.

AB  - (1) Introduction. A recent viral outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its global public health concern. There has been an aggressive growth in the number of emerging cases suggesting rapid spread of the virus. Since the first reported case of CoVID-19, there has been vast progress in understanding the dynamics of CoVID-19. However, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas, with rural areas having minimal pandemic preparedness and their own healthcare challenges. Therefore, this review aims to provide insight on the pathogenesis and the transmission dynamics of CoVID-19 along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies to mitigate the clinical manifestation of this virus. This review also aims to assess existing challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural areas based on past pandemic experiences and the effect on rural population. (2) Methods. A literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, along with information from governmental organizations such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). (3) Results. The causative virus, with its likely zoonotic origin, has demonstrated high pathogenicity in humans through increasing human-to-human transmission leading to extensive mitigation strategies, including patient quarantine and mass "social distancing" measures. Although the clinical manifestation of symptoms is mild in majority of the virus-inflicted population, critical patients may present with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, exacerbated by pre-existing comorbidities, eventually leading to death. While effective coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-specific vaccines and drugs are under clinical trials, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been adapted to manage symptoms and curtail the effect of the virus to prevent increasing morbidity and mortality. Several persisting challenges have been noted for mitigating CoVID-19 in rural areas, including the poor healthcare infrastructure, health literacy, pandemic preparedness along with the fact that majority of rural population are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities. (4) Discussion. The increasing rate of incidence of CoVID-19 presents its own challenges, burdening healthcare institutions and the global economy, and impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide. Given the clinical insights into CoVID-19 and the challenges presented in this review for the U.S. rural population, mitigation strategies should be designed accordingly to minimize the morbidity and mortality of this contagion.

AB  - Background Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the fastest growing proportion of older adults in the world, the majority of whom are women. Global health agendas, however, continue to deprioritise older women's health issues, including the incidence of and mortality from non-communicable disease (NCDs). This is the first systematic review to address the health, wellbeing and healthcare utilization of older SSA women.
   Methods Studies with primary analysis of health, wellbeing and/or healthcare utilization outcomes for women over the age of 50 from SSA countries were included. Databases searched include EMBASE, Scopus and Psycinfo.
   Findings About 26 studies from six SSA countries met inclusion criteria. Studies regarding NCDs predominated (n = 12), followed by healthcare utilization (n = 4), disability (n = 4), wellbeing (n = 2), depression (n = 2) and HIV (n = 2). Every study indicated significantly lower self-rated health and wellbeing, higher rates of depression, hypertension, obesity, disability or weakness for women compared with men. The studies also indicated that older women use healthcare more often, and choose public over private facilities more often.
   Interpretation The studies in the review had large, diverse samples. This review demonstrates the need for more gender-specific studies to better understand the unique challenges older women face in managing NCDs in particular.

AB  - Children with emotional and behavioral problems are often managed using medications or behavioral therapy, but in some countries, there is no structured parenting intervention to equip parents from different cultural backgrounds with adequate parenting skills to help these children. This paper aims to synthesize key findings from previous research on multicultural parenting programs and produce a comprehensive integrated view by looking into three separate themes: effective multicultural parenting programs, ethnocultural groups and cultural adaptation process. Literature search through Scopus and Google Scholar from 1999 to 2019 was conducted using the terms "effective parenting program", "effective parenting intervention", "effective multicultural parenting program", "effective multicultural parenting intervention", "multicultural parenting program", "multicultural parenting intervention", "parenting program and ethnic groups", "parenting intervention and ethnic groups", "adapted parenting program", "adapted parenting intervention", "cultural adaptation of parenting program'' and "cultural adaptation of parenting intervention". By applying the "Literature Review Synthesis Process", authors conducted cross-analysis, integrated possibilities, and prioritized the synthesized information gearing towards highly probable solutions for improving multicultural parenting programs to manage emotional and behavioral problems in children better. Development of a culturally fit parenting intervention and its implications on existing parenting programs are also discussed. The findings highlight the need 1) to engage with ethnocultural groups of parents during development of a new multicultural parenting program, and 2) to incorporate specific measures for engaging with parents during multicultural parenting program implementation. This paper contributes in acknowledging cultural components in future parenting intervention programs. Finally, recommendations are made for future directions of research.

The benefits of this involvement are well known, however, it is important to consider the ethical aspects. This paper suggests how further research could explore and potentially mitigate adverse outcomes. Method A literature search evaluating the role of patients and carer involvement in psychiatric education was undertaken to summarise existing evidence relating to the following: methods of involvement, evidence of usefulness, patient's/carer's views and learners' views. Results The Medline search produced 231 articles of which 31 were included in the literature review based on the key themes addressed in the paper. Discussion/conclusion The available evidence is generally positive regarding the use of patients and carers in psychiatric education. However, available research is varied in approach and outcome with little information on the ethical consequences. More research is required to inform policies on teaching regarding potential adverse effects of service user involvement.

AB  - Permeability is important parameter in petroleum explorations because it controls the production rate of hydrocarbons. Economic estimation of petroleum accumulations requires the best knowledge of the distribution of the permeability at subsurface. Acquiring the much realistic permeability has been a controversial and disputed subject. Petroleum companies typically measure permeability at surface conditions. However, this does not represent the actually buried permeability. The integration of measuring the surface permeability of plug samples using TinyPermll device compared to other methods that consider the buried permeability at reservoir condition, and investigating the micro-parameters under microscope can help to establish the controls on permeability and estimate the change per unit of each facies with depths. Porosity, connectivity, grains size, shape, sorting, mineralogical composition, diagenesis process including cementation and growth of authigenic minerals, mechanical and chemical compaction are the main controls on permeability. Typically, permeability decreases with depth due to increasing the overburden and effective stress. However, the change in permeability per unit depends on facies characteristics. Therefore, a combination of permeability measurements under confining pressure with different facies type can help to predict the permeability of sandstone bodies at natural condition compared to reservoir conditions; this would allow petrophysicists to constrain the fluid models and simulations.

AB  - The depletion of global fishery stock has posted significant effects to the world capture fishery industry. Constant environmental issues and fluctuation of fish meal (FM) costs have pushed the aquafeed industry to seek for alternative protein sources to sustain the huge demand of feed in aquaculture production. Insect meal (IM) has already started to gain global attention as an alternative for FM replacement. Substantial feeding trials have revealed its promising application not only beneficial as in protein replacement but also playing a vital role as a functional ingredient that boosting immunostimulatory effects in a wide range of aquatic animals. Here, we compiled and categorized several major groups of insects, for example black soldier fly, yellow mealworm, housefly, silkworm, alongside a minor group of insect species widely used as the alternative diet in aquaculture. Critically, we discuss the functional properties of the IMs, their immunomodulatory, and physiological effects in aquatic species. Biological parameters include oxidative stress, serum biochemical, hematological parameters, and immune-related genes are also further discussed in this review. In short, we suggest that low levels of IM supplementation could improve survival, immunity, and feed conversion efficiency of targeted aquaculture species. Chitin and its derivatives alongside active substances in insect exoskeleton, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an essential role in the immunomodulation of aquatic organisms. Knowledge of this area is still in infancy. Therefore, it is a critical need to further address the mechanism of immunomodulation focusing on the isolated components from IMs.

AB  - Objective purpose: This review synthesized the literature examining the effects of virtual reality (VR)-based exercise on physiological, psychological, and rehabilitative outcomes in various populations. Design: A systematic review. Data sources: 246 articles were retrieved using key words, such as "VR", "exercise intervention", "physiological", "psychology", and "rehabilitation" through nine databases including Academic Search Premier and PubMed. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: 15 articles which met the following criteria were included in the review: (1) peer-reviewed; (2) published in English; (3) randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials or causal-comparative design; (4) interventions using VR devices; and (5) examined effects on physiological, psychological, and/or rehabilitative outcomes. Descriptive and thematic analyses were used. Results: Of the 12 articles examining physiological outcomes, eight showed a positive effect on physical fitness, muscle strength, balance, and extremity function. Only four articles examined the effects on psychological outcomes, three showed positive effects such that VR exercise could ease fatigue, tension, and depression and induce calmness and enhance quality of life. Nine articles investigated the effects of VR-based exercise on rehabilitative outcomes with physiological and/or psychological outcomes, and six observed significant positive changes. In detail, patients who suffered from chronic stroke, hemodialysis, spinal-cord injury, cerebral palsy in early ages, and cognitive decline usually saw better improvements using VR-based exercise. Conclusion: The findings suggest that VR exercise has the potential to exert a positive impact on individual's physiological, psychological, and rehabilitative outcomes compared with traditional exercise. However, the quality, quantity, and sample size of existing studies are far from ideal. Therefore, more rigorous studies are needed to confirm the observed positive effects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical entity identified in 1980s, considered as an intermediate stage between normal ageing and dementia, which is characterized by a cognitive decline more severe than expected in normal ageing. Although the scientific community has shown interest in MCI, the forensic implications of MCI have been poorly investigated. Forensic implications are huge, affecting all aspects of the so-called ability to act. Health care professionals, and, more often, forensic experts, have to discriminate if MCI patients sufficiently perform in different actions with important legal relapses. But the question is: are there means or parameters you may use in order to decide about MCI subjects' competence? The primary aim of the article was to describe the state of the art providing a systematic review of the scientific literature on decision-making capacity.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This is the first research that provides a systematic review on the field, focusing exclusively on MCI patients.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: This review highlights lack of uniformity in methods of judgment and in their interpretation about MCI competency, as well as showing the absence of papers about some key areas such as the testamentary capacity.
   CONCLUSIONS: MCI seems to affect deeply decision-making capacity, causing social, personal and family problems, at different levels.

AB  - Introduction: Even though anomalies on brain metabolites have been found in schizophrenia, researches about subjects with high risk (HR) show heterogeneous results. Thus, this meta-analysis aims to characterize the metabolic profile of HR subjects, first, compared to controls (HC) and then compared to people with schizophrenia.
   Methods: After a systematic database search, means and standard deviations were extracted to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD). Cerebral metabolites levels were compared between HR subjects and HC or patients with schizophrenia in all regions of interest investigated in included studies. Meta-regressions were performed to explore the influence of demographic and clinical variables on metabolites level's SMDs.
   Results: Thirty-nine studies were included in this meta-analysis. A higher level of glutamine + glutamate (Glx) was found in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (p < 0.01) and potentially in the basal ganglia (p = 0,05) as well as a higher level of myo-inositol (mI) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (p = 0.04) in HR subjects compared to HC. A higher level of choline (Cho) was found in people with schizophrenia compared to HR subjects in the DLPFC (p < 0.001) and the medial temporal lobe (p = 0.02). Meta-regression analyses showed negative associations between SMD for Cho concentration, the percentage of females or the age (p = 0.01).
   Conclusions: The present meta-analysis provides evidence that some brain metabolites concentrations are disrupted before the transition to psychosis and could be considered like a vulnerability.

KW  - Fluorosis

KW  - Drinking water
KW  - Treatment
KW  - Mitigation
AB  - When safe and adequate exposure of an essential trace element is exceeded it becomes potentially toxic. Fluoride is one classic example of such a double edged sword which both plays a fundamental role in the normal growth and development of the body for example the consumption of levels between 0.5-1.0 ppm via drinking water is beneficial for prevention of dental caries but its excessive consumption leads to development of fluorosis.Purpose of ReviewThe abundance of fluorine in the environment as well as in drinking water sources are the major contributors to fluorosis. It is a serious public health concern as it is a noteworthy medical problem in 24 nations including India yet the threat of fluorosis has not been rooted out. The review focuses on recent findings related to skeletal fluorosis and role of oxidative stress in its development. The fluoride mitigation strategies adopted in recent years are also discussed.Recent Findings Based on Case StudiesRecent findings revealed that consumption of fluoride at concentrations of 1.5 ppm is majorly responsible for skeletal fluorosis. The sampling from rural areas showed that 80% villages are having fluoride concentrations more than the WHO permissible limits and people residing in such areas are affected by the skeletal fluorosis and also in the regions of Africa and Asia endemic fluorosis have been accounted in the majority of the region affecting approximately 100 million people. Various mitigation programmes and strategies have been conducted all over the world using defluoridation.SummaryFluorosis is a slow and progressive malady affecting our body and a serious concern to be taken into consideration and to be dealt with effectively. The fluoride toxicity although reversible, is a slow process and the side effects lack treatment options. The treatment options available are either not approachable or affordable in the rural areas commonly suffering from the fluoride toxicity. No specific treatments are available to date to treat skeletal fluorosis affectively; therefore, prevention is one of most safest and best approach to fight fluorosis. The current review lays emphasis on the skeletal fluorosis and its prevalence in recent years. It also includes the recent findings as well as the current strategies related to combat skeletal fluorosis and provides findings that might be helpful to promote the research in the field of effective treatment for fluorosis as well as development of easy and affordable methods of fluoride removal from water.

AB  - Experimental studies highlight profound effects of sleep disruptions on pain, showing that sleep deprivation (SD) leads to hyperalgesic pain changes. On the other hand, given that sleep helps normalizing bodily functions, a crucial role of restorative sleep in the overnight restoration of the pain system seems likely. Thus, a systematic review of experimental studies on effects of recovery sleep (RS; subsequently to SD) on pain was performed with the aim to check whether RS resets hyperalgesic pain changes occurring due to SD. Empirical animal and human studies including SD-paradigms, RS and pain assessments were searched in three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO) using a predefined algorithm. 29 studies were included in this review. Most results indicated a reset of enhanced pain sensitivity and vulnerability following RS, especially when total SD was implemented and pressure pain or painful symptoms (human studies) were assessed. Further research should focus on whether and how recovery is altered in chronic pain patients, as this yields implications for pain treatment by enhancing or stabilizing

AB  - Persistent use of cannabis in persons with psychosis is associated with poor symptomatic and functional outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Face-to-face psychological interventions (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy- [CBT], Motivation Enhancement Therapy- [MET]) are widely used in treating problematic cannabis use. We aimed to comprehensively review the efficacy of technology-based psychological interventions (TBPIs) in decreasing cannabis use, the design of TBPIs, and TBPI-related preferences in individuals with psychosis. For the systematic review, we searched six major databases from their inception to November 27, 2019. We included empirical articles of quantitative and qualitative methodologies related to TBPIs in individuals with psychosis and cannabis misuse and used narrative synthesis to report results. Only eight articles were found showing that technology-based motivational and psycho-education interventions and cognitive enhancement therapy were minimally efficient in achieving cannabis abstinence or decreasing frequency of use. Qualitative exploratory methods and participatory action research were used to elicit patient and clinician preferences and TBPIs were tailored accordingly to improve cannabis use related outcomes. Research on TBPIs in individuals with psychosis and cannabis misuse is in its early phases. A significant research effort is needed for the development of adapted interventions for CUD to capitalize on the potential of web-based applications.

AB  - Background: Active games based on virtual reality have been widely used in the rehabilitation of many clinical conditions. However, studies on the use of Xbox/Kinect are rare, and technology application in stroke treatment is not clear yet. Objective: To verify the outcomes (O) analyzed in randomized controlled trials (C; S) that investigated the use of Xbox/Kinect (I) in patients with stroke (P). Methods: This is a systematic literature review that meets PRISMA standards and the eligibility criteria according to the PICOS strategy. The search procedure was performed by two researchers. The research strategy was repeated in case of divergence. Effect size was calculated by Cohen's formula and Hopkins rank. The risk of individual bias was assessed using PEDro Score and Higgins Classification. Results: The main outcomes were postural balance and activities of daily living, with four studies addressing these variables. However, only one study showed the effect of Xbox/Kinect intervention on balance as large, as in two other studies evaluating manual dexterity and depression, respectively. Conclusion: The greater use of Xbox/Kinect in treating patients after stroke is in recovery of balance and motor function, and the evidence support its application. These findings enable the use of virtual reality technology-through Xbox/Kinect in rehabilitation programs, focusing on postural balance and motor skills. However, conclusive results are still not possible. Therefore, caution in the use of this technology is required.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a serious complication of pregnancy that could cause adverse health effects on both mothers and fetuses, and its prevalence has been increasing worldwide. Experimental and epidemiological studies suggest that air pollution may be an important risk factor of GDM, but conclusions are inconsistent. To provide a comprehensive overview of ambient air pollution on GDM, we summarized existing evidence concerning biological linkages between maternal exposure to air pollutants and GDM based on mechanism studies. We also performed a quantitative meta-analysis based on human epidemiological studies by searching English databases (Pubmed, Web of Science and Embase) and Chinese databases (Wanfang, CNKI). Asa result, the limited mechanism studies indicated that beta-cell dysfunction, neurohormonal disturbance, inflammation, oxidative stress, imbalance of gut microbiome and insulin resistance may be involved in air pollution-GDM relationship, but few studies were performed to explore the direct biological linkage. Additionally, a total of 13 epidemiological studies were included in the meta-analysis, and the air pollutants considered included PM2.5, PM10, SO2,(NO2)-N-  and O-3. Most studies were retrospective and mainly conducted in developed regions. The results of meta-analysis indicated that maternal first trimester exposure to SO2 increased the risk of GDM (standardized odds ratio (OR) = 1.392, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.010, 1.773), while pre-pregnancy O-3 exposure was inversely associated with GDM risk (standardized OR = 0.981, 95% CI: 0.977, 0.985). No significant effects were observed for PM2.5, PM10 and NO2. In conclusion, additional mechanism studies on the molecular level are needed to provide persuasive rationale underlying the air pollution-GDM relationship. Moreover, other important risk factors of GDM, including maternal lifestyle and road traffic noise exposure that may modify the air pollution-GDM relationship should be considered in future epidemiological studies. More prospective cohort studies are also warranted in developing countries with high levels of air pollution. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   Method Review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
   Results A search for articles investigating cognitive insight in ARMS in the MEDLINE and ScienceDirect databases revealed five studies including 303 ARMS and 376 controls. Regarding BCIS subscales, ARMS individuals displayed significant higher scores for self-certainty than controls with a small-to-moderate effect size (ESg = 0.45 [0.23;0.67], P < .005), whereas no significant difference was observed for self-reflectiveness (ESg = -0.56 [-0.18;1.29], P = .14). No significant differences were observed between ARMS and controls for overall cognitive insight abilities as indexed by the BCIS composite score (ESg = -0.24 [-0.43;0.91], P = .45).
   Conclusions Self-certainty abnormalities seem to predate the expression of full-blown psychotic episode and to be higher in ARMS than in healthy controls. By contrast, ARMS did not display abnormal self-reflectiveness and overall cognitive insight abilities.

AB  - Halophila stipulacea is a small tropical seagrass, native to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean. It invaded the Mediterranean Sea 150 years ago as a Lessepsian migrant, but so far has remained in insulated, small populations across this basin. Surprisingly, in 2002 it was reported in the Caribbean Sea, where within less than two decades it spread to most of the Caribbean Island nations and reaching the South American continent. Unlike its invasion of Mediterranean, in the Caribbean H. stipulacea creates large, continuous populations in many areas. Reports from the Caribbean demonstrated the invasiveness of H. stipulacea by showing that it displaces local Caribbean seagrass species. The motivation for this review comes from the necessity to unify the existing knowledge on several aspects of this species in its native and invasive habitats, identify knowledge gaps and develop a critical strategy to understand its invasive capacity and implement an effective monitoring and conservation plan to mitigate its potential spread outside its native ranges. We systematically reviewed 164 studies related to H. stipulacea to create the "Halophila stipulacea database." This allowed us to evaluate the current biological, ecological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular knowledge of H. stipulacea in its native and invasive ranges. Here we (i) discuss the possible environmental conditions and plant mechanisms involved in its invasiveness, (ii) assess the impact of H. stipulacea on native seagrasses and ecosystem functions in the invaded regions, (iii) predict the ability of this species to invade European and transoceanic coastal waters, (iv) identify knowledge gaps that should be addressed to better understand the biology and ecology of this species both in its native and non-native habitats, which would improve our ability to predict H. stipulacea's potential to expand into new areas in the future. Considering the predicted climate change scenarios and exponential human pressures on coastal areas, we stress the need for coordinated global monitoring and mapping efforts that will record changes in H. stipulacea and its associated communities over time, across its native, invasive and prospective distributional ranges. This will require the involvement of biologists, ecologists, economists, modelers, managers, and local stakeholders.

AB  - Background: Suicide is one of the most pressing problems worldwide, one of the main social challenges. In Spain, suicide mortality is the leading cause of external death, maintaining the suicide rate relatively stable or even increasing in some age groups in a context in which the mortality of the population due to external causes follows a decreasing trend. Despite the alarming figures, in Spain there is no National Plan for Suicide Prevention, being the main initiatives to address this problem of regional or local court. The objective of the present study was to present the state of the matter regarding the approach to suicide in Spain.
   Methods: A review was carried out in the main search engines, both general (Google) and specialized (Psicodoc, Psicyinfo), introducing several key words. The results were filtered excluding local court initiatives, incorporating interventions at the community level. Their content was analyzed and the foundations of each strategy were presented.
   Results: A total of 22 interventions were found in 16 autonomous communities (all except Murcia).
   Conclusions: We can conclude the serious lack of treatment related to this problem. For the most part, strategies for working suicide are incorporated into Mental Health plans. The need to continue working on the design of effective and comprehensive interventions, focused on prevention that address the phenomenon from a multidisciplinary approach, specifically focused on the problem, is evident.

AB  - Background There exists little literature on situational health literacy - that is, how an individual's health literacy varies across different health literacy environments. However, one can consider the role of stress when examining the relationship between health situations and decision-making ability, and by proxy health literacy. The aim of this study was to assess the strength of the evidence on the relationship between health situations and patient stress, considered in the context of health professional perception, and determine what health situations act to influence patient stress. Methods A systematic review of English articles using PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Embase databases was conducted. Search terms focused on 'patient', 'stress', and 'health care situations'. Only peer-reviewed original research with data on patient stress in the context of a health facility environment was included. Studies were screened and critically appraised by both authors. Study elements for extraction were defined by RO and extracted by JY. Results Twenty-four studies were included for narrative synthesis. Patients in Intensive Care Units were more stressed about factors relating to their physical discomfort, with some agreement from health care professionals. Parents of children in Intensive Care Units were more concerned with stressors relating to their child's appearance and behaviour, and alteration in their parental role. Few studies examined health settings other than Intensive Care Units, and those that did varied greatly in terms of study design and population characteristics, lacking generalisability. Conclusions Overall, the findings of what patients find most stressful in Intensive Care Units can guide health care professionals practicing best practice care. However, the evidence on how patient stress is influenced by non-Intensive Care Unit health care settings is weak. Further research is needed to enhance current understanding of the interaction between patient stress and health care environments in both hospital and primary care settings.

   The purpose of this paper is to provide a narrative review of the literature on mental health resilience and other positive mental health capacities of urban and internal migrants.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The methodology for this narrative review included a search of articles published up to 2017. The abstracts were screened and relevant articles studied and discussed. Literature on the particular mental health challenges of urban migrants in India was also studied. References found in the literature relating to neurourbanism were also followed up to explore broader historical and conceptual contexts.
   Findings
   Several key sources and resources for mental health resilience were identified - including familial and community networks and individual hope or optimism. Nevertheless, much of the literature tends to focus at the level of the individual person, even though ecological systems theory would suggest that mental health resilience is better understood as multi-layered, i.e. relevant to, and impacted by, communities and broader societal and environmental contexts.
   Originality/value
   This paper provides insight into an aspect of migrant mental health that has tended to be overlooked hitherto: the mental health resilience and positive mental health capacities of urban migrants. This is particularly relevant where professional "expert" mental health provision for internal migrant communities is absent or unaffordable. Previous work has tended to focus predominantly on mental health risk factors, despite growing awareness that focusing on risk factors along can lead to an over-reliance on top-down expert-led interventions and overlook positive capacities for mental health that are sometimes possessed by individuals and their communities.

AB  - Historically, preclinical pain research has been dominated by studies in male subjects. Jeffrey Mogil describes recent trends towards the inclusion of male and female subjects in research and the subsequent identification of qualitative sex differences in the mechanisms of pain processing.
   Although most patients with chronic pain are women, the preclinical literature regarding pain processing and the pathophysiology of chronic pain has historically been derived overwhelmingly from the study of male rodents. This Review describes how the recent adoption by a number of funding agencies of policies mandating the incorporation of sex as a biological variable into preclinical research has correlated with an increase in the number of studies investigating sex differences in pain and analgesia. Trends in the field are analysed, with a focus on newly published findings of qualitative sex differences: that is, those findings that are suggestive of differential processing mechanisms in each sex. It is becoming increasingly clear that robust differences exist in the genetic, molecular, cellular and systems-level mechanisms of acute and chronic pain processing in male and female rodents and humans.

AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems characterized by foundation species, such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and mangrove forests, are rich in biodiversity and support a range of ecosystem services including coastal protection, food provisioning, water filtration, carbon sequestration, recreational opportunities, cultural value, among others. These ecosystems have experienced degradation and a net loss of total area in regions around the world due to a host of anthropogenic stressors, resulting in declines in the associated ecosystem services they provide. Because of the extensive degradation in many locations, increasing attention has turned to ecosystem restoration of these marine habitats. Restoration techniques for marine and coastal ecosystems are generally more expensive when compared to terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting locations that will provide the largest return on investment, not only for the probability and magnitude of restoration success, but also for ecosystem service outcomes. However, site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration receive relatively lithe attention in the scientific literature, suggesting a need to better study how spatial planning tools could be incorporated into restoration practice. To the degree that site selection has been formally evaluated in the literature, the criteria have tended to focus more on environmental conditions beneficial for the restored habitat, and less on ecosystem service outcomes once the habitat is restored, which may vary considerably from site to site, or with more complex landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of connectivity. Here we (1) review recent (2015-2019) scientific peer-reviewed literature for several marine ecosystems (seagrass beds, salt marshes, and mangrove forests) to investigate how commonly site selection or spatial planning principles are applied or investigated in scholarly research about marine ecosystem restoration at different spatial scales, (2) provide a conceptual overview of the rationale for applying spatial planning principles to marine ecosystem restoration, and (3) highlight promising analytical approaches from the marine spatial planning and conservation planning literatures that could help improve restoration outcomes. We argue that strategic site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration, particularly applied at larger spatial scales and accounting for ecosystem service outcomes, can help support more effective restoration.

AB  - Neuronal homeostasis depends on both simple and complex sugars (the glycoconjugates), and derangement of their metabolism is liable to impair neural function and lead to neurodegeneration. Glucose levels boost glycation phenomena, a wide series of non-enzymatic reactions that give rise to various intermediates and end-products that are potentially dangerous in neurons. Glycoconjugates, including glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans, contribute to the constitution of the unique features of neuron membranes and extracellular matrix in the nervous system. Glycosylation defects are indeed frequently associated with nervous system disturbances and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Neurons present intracytoplasmic inclusions of alpha-synuclein aggregates involved in the disease pathogenesis together with the impairment of the autophagy-lysosome function, oxidative stress, and defective traffic and turnover of membrane components. In the present review, we selected relevant recent contributions concerning the direct involvement of glycation and glycosylation in alpha-synuclein stability, impaired autophagy and lysosomal function in PD, focusing on potential models of PD pathogenesis provided by genetic variants of glycosphingolipid processing enzymes, especially glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Moreover, we collected data aimed at defining the glycomic profile of PD patients as a tool to help in diagnosis and patient subtyping, as well as those pointing to sugar-related compounds with potential therapeutic applications in PD.

AB  - Aim Physical health inequalities experienced by people with mental health conditions are labelled an international scandal; due to the 15 to 30-year gap in life expectancy, driven mostly by physical health conditions. Lifestyle interventions are recommended to prevent the onset of poor physical health in people with mental illness. Yet, there is less high-quality evidence for adolescents, particularly those in inpatient settings. We aimed to assess existing literature reporting physical health or lifestyle interventions conducted on adolescent mental health inpatient units.
   Method An electronic search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and AMED was conducted on 13th June 2019. Eligible studies included peer-reviewed English language research articles of physical health interventions delivered within child and adolescent mental health inpatient services. A narrative synthesis was conducted on the data.
   Results Only three studies were identified implementing health interventions for adolescent inpatients. The interventions consisted of two physical health interventions aiming to increase activity levels within routine care (one gym-based, one sports led) and a yoga intervention. Outcome measurements varied and benefits were observed in relation to overall health (HONOSCA), physical health (waist, hip and chest circumference) and behaviour.
   Conclusions Although preliminary results suggest lifestyle interventions may be feasible and beneficial for this group, more work is needed to fully understand the best way to implement these interventions within adolescent clinical settings. Adolescent inpatients are an important target for such interventions, affording the opportunity to prevent the onset of physical comorbidities.

AB  - Due to their postmitotic status, the potential for neurons to undergo senescence has historically received little attention. This lack of attention has extended to some non-postmitotic cells as well. Recently, the study of senescence within the central nervous system (CNS) has begun to emerge as a new etiological framework for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The presence of senescent cells is known to be deleterious to non-senescent neighboring cells via development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) which includes the release of inflammatory, oxidative, mitogenic, and matrix-degrading factors. Senescence and the SASP have recently been hailed as an alternative to the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the selective killing of senescence cells by senolytic drugs as a substitute for amyloid beta (Ass) targeting antibodies. Here we call for caution in rejecting the amyloid cascade hypothesis and to the dismissal of Ass antibody intervention at least in early disease stages, as Ass oligomers (AssO), and cellular senescence may be inextricably linked. We will review literature that portrays AssO as a stressor capable of inducing senescence. We will discuss research on the potential role of secondary senescence, a process by which senescent cells induce senescence in neighboring cells, in disease progression. Once this seed of senescent cells is present, the elimination of senescence-inducing stressors like Ass would likely be ineffective in abrogating the spread of senescence. This has potential implications for when and why AssO clearance may or may not be effective as a therapeutic for AD. The selective killing of senescent cells by the immune system via immune surveillance naturally curtails the SASP and secondary senescence outside the CNS. Immune privilege restricts the access of peripheral immune cells to the brain parenchyma, making the brain a safe harbor for the spread of senescence and the SASP. However, an increasingly leaky blood brain barrier (BBB) compromises immune privilege in aging AD patients, potentially enabling immune infiltration that could have detrimental consequences in later AD stages. Rather than an alternative etiology, senescence itself may constitute an essential component of the cascade in the amyloid cascade hypothesis.

AB  - Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a naturally occurring mycotoxin mostly found in food items including grains and coffee beans. It induces DNA single-strand breaks and has been considered to be carcinogenic. It is recognized as a serious threat to reproductive health both in males and females. OTA is highly nephrotoxic and carcinogenic, and its potency changes evidently between species and sexes. There is a close association between OTA, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and genotoxicity, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Reports regarding genotoxic effects in relation to OTA which leads to the induction of DNA adduct formation, protein synthesis inhibition, perturbation of cellular energy production, initiation of oxidative stress, induction of apoptosis, influences on mitosis, induction of cell cycle arrest, and interference with cytokine pathways. All these mechanisms are associated with nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, teratotoxicity, immunological toxicity, and neurotoxicity. OTA administration activates various mechanisms such as p38 MAPK, JNKs, and ERKs dysfunctions, BDNF disruption, TH overexpression, caspase-3 and 9 activation, and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation which ultimately lead to Alzheimer disease (AD) progression. The current review will focus on OTA in terms of recent discoveries in the field of molecular biology. The main aim is to investigate the underlying mechanisms of OTA in regard to genotoxicity and epigenetic modulations that lead to AD. Also, we will highlight the strategies for the purpose of attenuating the hazards posed by OTA exposure.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on specific sleep quality domains and to determine its prevalence. A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase until January 2018 to obtain eligible studies. Score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used as the outcome measurement, and weight mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. In total, eight studies were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 658 RA patients and 485 healthy controls. In this meta-analysis, each domain of the PSQI score: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, use of sleep medication, daytime dysfunction and the total score were higher in RA patients than healthy controls. In addition, the relative risk of sleep disturbances among people with RA was 2.37 (95% CI: 1.80, 3.11) compared with people without RA.In conclusion, RA patients scored higher in each dimension of PSQI, and sleep disturbances was more prevalent in RA patients than in controls. Further research is needed to identify effective strategies for preventing and treating sleep disturbances among RA patients.

AB  - BackgroundCommon mental disorders are frequent psychiatric comorbid conditions among people with HIV/AIDS. The presence of such psychiatric disorders negatively affects the treatment adherence, viral load suppression, quality of life, treatment outcomes and functionality of people with HIV/AIDS. However, available studies in Ethiopia have a great variation and inconsistency of reported results have been observed regarding the magnitude and associated factors of common mental disorder. Thus, conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literatures can have a paramount importance to show its summarized figure.MethodsLiteratures search was performed using databases (PubMed/Medline, Science Direct and PsycINFO. Grey literatures were also searched from Google and Google Scholar. Data were extracted from primary studies using a data extraction format prepared in Microsoft Excel and exported to STATA-version 14 statistical software for analysis. The I-2 test was used to assess the heterogeneity of primary articles. The result of the test showed that there was heterogeneity between primary studies. This leads us to execute a random effect meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of common mental disorder with corresponding 95% confidence interval.ResultsA total of 13 primary studies comply with the inclusion criteria were included in this systematic review. The pooled prevalence of common mental disorder was found to be 28.83% (95% CI: 17.93, 39.73) among people with HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia. The highest prevalence of common mental disorder (35.20%) was observed among studies in which Kessler-10 was used as a screening tool. Single marital status (OR=1.83; 95%CI: 1.03, 3.27), HIV/AIDS-related stigma (OR=2.21; 95%CI: 1.68, 2.90) and current job unavailability (OR=1.38; 95%CI: 1.01, 1.88) had statistically significant association with common mental disorder.ConclusionThe result of this review showed that nearly one among three individuals with HIV/AIDS is suffering from common mental disorder in Ethiopia. This calls a need to integrate the mental health and psycho-social support into the HIV/AIDS care.Trial registrationPROSPERO- CRD42019132402. Registered on 05/08/2019.

AB  - Introduction/Purpose:Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and in the United States alone, CVD causes nearly 840,000 deaths annually. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a tool to assess brain activity, researchers have identified some brain-behavior connections and predicted several self-management behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the sample characteristics of individuals with CVD who participated in fMRI studies. Methods:A literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus. No date or language restrictions were applied and research methodology filters were used. In October 2017, 1659 titles and abstracts were identified. Inclusion criteria were: (1) utilized an empirical study design, (2) used fMRI to assess brain activity, and (3) focused on patients with CVD-related chronic illness. Articles were excluded if they: were theory or opinion articles, focused on mental or neuropathic illness, included non-human samples, or were not written in English. After duplicates were removed (230), 1,429 titles and abstracts were reviewed based on inclusion criteria; 1,243 abstracts were then excluded. A total of 186 studies were reviewed in their entirety; after additional review, 142 were further excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Forty-four articles met criteria and were included in the final review. An evidence table was created to capture the demographics of each study sample. Results:Ninety eight percent of the studies did not report the racial or ethnic composition of their sample. Most studies (66%) contained more men than women. Mean age ranged from 38 to 78 years; 77% reported mean age >= 50 years. The most frequently studied CVD was stroke (86%), while hypertension was studied the least (2%). Conclusion:Understanding brain-behavior relationships can help researchers and practitioners tailor interventions to meet specific patient needs. These findings suggest that additional studies are needed that focus on populations historically underrepresented in fMRI research. Researchers should thoughtfully consider diversity and purposefully sample groups by including individuals that are: women, from diverse backgrounds, younger, and diagnosed with a variety of CVD-related illnesses. Identifying and addressing these gaps by studying more representative samples will help healthcare providers reduce disparities and tailor interventions for all CVD populations.

AB  - Objectives: The present review aims to present and discuss the consistent and inconsistent evidence regarding the associations between mitochondrial dysfunction and several neuropathic models, including trauma-induced, chemotherapy-induced, diabetes-induced and HIV-associated sensory neuropathy. Methods: The searching strategy and inclusion criteria for this review are all research articles in the PubMed database published before July 2019. We used the search terms 'mitochondria' and 'neuropathy' for the present review and non-English articles were excluded. Results: Damage to mitochondria via trauma, chemotherapy drugs, hyperglycaemia and HIV infection has been widely discussed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuropathy. Several mechanisms of mitochondrial damages have been proposed. Conclusion: The damage of mitochondria results in cellular apoptosis, which appears to be one of the key factors in the pathogenesis of neuropathy. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria could be a potential therapeutic target in neuropathy.

AB  - Problem Identification: This systematic review will examine the social support needs of bereaved parents in the specific context of pediatric cancer by synthesizing the qualitative evidence. Social support encompasses emotional, practical, informational, and meaning-making support needs. Literature Search: The Joanna Briggs Institute procedures for conducting qualitative systematic reviews guided every stage of this review. Four databases (PsychInfo, CINAHL, Pubmed, and ASSIA) were systematically searched, in addition to the gray literature and scoping review. Through a five-step critical appraisal process 11 out of 668 potential articles were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Data Evaluation/Synthesis: Relevant findings were synthesized with a thematic-synthesis approach. Findings, which follow the journey of bereaved parents integrated under the core-category "Needs." This encompasses of four higher-level categories:
   Last days: Parent needs when caring for their dying child Rest in peace: Parent needs during the child's death Feeling abandoned: Parent needs for contact after the child's death Searching for Meaning: Parents needs when making sense of loss Conclusion: Informational support needs is largely unexplored in academic literature. Staff in the treating-hospital are central in offering bereavement-support to parents, who may otherwise feel that they have lost their second home (hospital) and second family (staff).

AB  - Despite claims that lesional mania is associated with right-hemisphere lesions, supporting evidence is scarce, and association with specific brain areas has not been demonstrated. Here, we aimed to test whether focal brain lesions in lesional mania are more often right- than left-sided, and if lesions converge on areas relevant to mood regulation. We thus performed a systematic literature search (PROSPERO registration CRD42016053675) on PubMed and Web-Of-Science, using terms that reflect diagnoses and structures of interest, as well as lesional mechanisms. Two researchers reviewed the articles separately according to PRISMA Guidelines, selecting reports of adult-onset hypomania, mania or mixed state following a focal brain lesion, for pooled-analyses of individual patient data. Eligible lesion images were manually traced onto the corresponding MNI space slices, and lesion topography analyzed using standard brain atlases. Using this approach, data from 211 lesional mania patients was extracted from 114 reports. Among 201 cases with focal lesions, more patients had lesions involving exclusively the right (60.7%) than exclusively the left (11.4%) hemisphere. In further analyses of 56 eligible lesion images, while findings should be considered cautiously given the potential for selection bias of published lesion images, right-sided predominance of lesions was confirmed across multiple brain regions, including the temporal lobe, fusiform gyrus and thalamus. These, and several frontal lobe areas, were also identified as preferential lesion sites in comparisons with control lesions. Such pooled-analyses, based on the most comprehensive dataset of lesional mania available to date, confirm a preferential association with right-hemisphere lesions, while suggesting that several brain areas/circuits, relevant to mood regulation, are most frequently affected.

AB  - BackgroundAccessibility of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in many lower-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) and humanitarian settings remains limited, particularly for young people. Young people facing humanitarian crises are also at higher risk for mental health problems, which can further exacerbate poor SRH outcomes. This review aimed to explore, describe and evaluate SRH interventions for young people in LMIC and humanitarian settings to better understand both SRH and psychosocial components of interventions that demonstrate effectiveness for improving SRH outcomes.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of studies examining interventions to improve SRH in young people in LMIC and humanitarian settings following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) standards for systematic reviews. Peer-reviewed journals and grey literature from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2018 were included. Two authors performed title, abstract and full-text screening independently. Data was extracted and analyzed using a narrative synthesis approach and the practice-wise clinical coding system.ResultsThe search yielded 813 results, of which 55 met inclusion criteria for full-text screening and thematic analysis. Primary SRH outcomes of effective interventions included: contraception and condom use skills, HIV/STI prevention/education, SRH knowledge/education, gender-based violence education and sexual self-efficacy. Common psychosocial intervention components included: assertiveness training, communication skills, and problem-solving.ConclusionsFindings suggest that several evidence-based SRH interventions may be effective for young people in humanitarian and LMIC settings. Studies that use double blind designs, include fidelity monitoring, and focus on implementation and sustainability are needed to further contribute to this evidence-base.

There is a need to understand what interventions are effective to improve outcomes for people who have experienced ACEs.MethodsSystematic review of systematic reviews. We searched 18 database sources from 2007 to 2018 for systematic reviews of effectiveness data on people who experienced ACEs aged 3-18, on any intervention and any outcome except incidence of ACEs. We included reviews with a summary quality score (AMSTAR) of 5.5 or above.ResultsTwenty-five reviews were included. Most reviews focus on psychological interventions and mental health outcomes. The strongest evidence is for cognitive-behavioural therapy for people exposed to abuse. For other interventions - including psychological therapies, parent training, and broader support interventions - the findings overall are inconclusive, although there are some positive results.ConclusionsThere are significant gaps in the evidence on interventions for ACEs. Most approaches focus on mitigating individual psychological harms, and do not address the social pathways which may mediate the negative impacts of ACEs. Many negative impacts of ACEs (e.g. on health behaviours, social relationships and life circumstances) have also not been widely addressed by intervention studies.

AB  - Background PTSD is a chronic condition with high rates of comorbidity, but current treatment options are limited and not always effective. One novel approach is MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for people diagnosed with treatment-resistant PTSD, where MDMA is used as a catalyst to facilitate trauma processing during psychotherapy. The aim was to review all current research into MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. Methods Articles were identified through PubMed and Science Direct for items published up to 31st March 2019 using terms "treatments for PTSD", "drug treatments for PTSD", "MDMA", "MDMA pathway", "MDMA-assisted psychotherapy" and "MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD". Articles were identified through Google Scholar and subject-specific websites. Articles and relevant references cited in those articles were reviewed. Results Small-scale studies have shown reduced psychological trauma, however there has been widespread misunderstanding of the aims and implications of this work, most commonly the notion that MDMA is a 'treatment for PTSD', which to date has not been researched. This has harmful consequences, namely dangerous media reporting and impeding research progression in an already controversial field. Conclusions MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may help people who have experienced psychological trauma and who have not been able to resolve their problems through existing treatments, however more research is needed. If this is to get appropriate research attention, we must report this accurately and objectively.

AB  - Studies of the health effects of air pollution have traditionally controlled for ambient temperature as a con-founder, and vice versa. However, season might be an important factor contributing to adverse health effects of air pollution. Given the current inconsistencies in results of previous studies on the effect modification of air pollution on morbidity by season, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the current evidence on effects of season on air pollution and morbidity. The electronic databases including PubMed. Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang were used to identify papers published up to the 30st of November in 2019. We identified 4284 articles, after screening, eighty papers met the inclusion criteria. Significant effect modification of CO, O-3, SO2 and NO2 on morbidity by season was observed, with corresponding ratio of relative risk of 1.0009 (95% CI: 1.0001-1.0018), 1.0080 (95% CI: 1.0021-1.0138),0.9828 (95% CI: 0.9697-0.9962) and 0.9896 (95% CI: 0.9824-0.9968), respectively. Season significantly modified the effect of CO on pneumonia, the effect of SO2 on cardiovascular disease, the effect of PM10 on stroke, and the effect of O-3 on stroke, asthma and pneumonia. The effect modifications of air pollution by season were similar among males and females, while the effect estimates seem to be higher among children under 18 years old and the elderly aged 75 or over. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the seasonal variance of the effect of air pollutants on morbidity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In respect to ecological psychology processes of attunement and calibration, this critical review focusses on how exploratory behaviors may contribute to skilled perception and action, with particular attention to sport. Based on the theoretical insights of Gibson (The senses considered as perceptual systems, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1966) and Reed (Encountering the world: Toward an ecological psychology, Oxford University Press, New York, 1996), exploratory and performatory actions have been differentiated in numerous experiments to study the perception of opportunities of action. The distinction between exploratory and performatory actions has informed the study of infant behavior in developmental psychology. In the current article, we highlight limitations with this distinction in the study of sports performers. We propose that a dynamic view of exploratory behavior would reveal how individuals develop exploratory activity that generates information about the fit between environmental properties and action capabilities. In this aim, practitioners should: (1) give learners the opportunity to safely develop exploratory behaviors even when they act outside their action boundary; and (2) guide learners to search for more reliable information to develop exploratory behaviors that would enhance the transfer of skills to various performance contexts.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed an explosion in applications for neural recording and stimulation in the treatment of clinical disorders. Neuromodulatory approaches are now a mainstay of care for essential tremor and Parkinson's disease, and are expanding rapidly into a wide range of other neurological and psychiatric diseases. In parallel, advancements in endovascular approaches to cerebrovascular diseases have resulted in minimally invasive techniques that deliver devices to neural tissue in the central and peripheral nervous systems, with significantly improved safety and efficacy. In this review, we discuss the history of endovascular neural recording and stimulation, its current progress, and applications for neurological disease.

AB  - Introduction
   Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global psychiatric disorder with no established biomarker. There is growing evidence that functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has the ability to aid in the diagnosis and prediction of the treatment response of MDD. The aim of this review was to systematically review, and gather the evidence from existing studies that used fNIRS signals in the diagnosis of MDD, correlations with depression symptomatology, and the monitoring of treatment response.
   Methods
   PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for published English articles from 1980 to June 2019 that focused on the application of fNIRS for (i) differentiating depressed versus nondepressed individuals, (ii) correlating with depression symptomatology, and in turn (iii) monitoring treatment responses in depression. Studies were included if they utilized fNIRS to evaluate cerebral hemodynamic variations in patients with MDD of any age group. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale.
   Results
   A total of 64 studies were included in this review, with 12 studies being longitudinal, while the rest were cross-sectional. More than two-thirds of the studies (n = 49) had acceptable quality. fNIRS consistently demonstrated attenuated cerebral hemodynamic changes in depressed compared to healthy individuals. fNIRS signals have also shown promise in correlating with individual symptoms of depression and monitoring various treatment responses.
   Conclusions
   This review provides comprehensive updated evidence of the diagnostic and predictive applications of fNIRS in patients with MDD. Future studies involving larger sample sizes, standardized methodology, examination of more brain regions in an integrative approach, and longitudinal follow-ups are needed.

AB  - Purpose of Review This paper aims to acquaint child and adolescent psychiatrists with the field of pharmacogenomics (PGX) and review the most up-to-date evidence-based practices to guide the application of this field in clinical care. Recent Findings Despite much research being done in this area, the field of PGX continues to yield controversial findings. In the adult world, studies have focused on the impact of combinatorial gene panels that guide medication selection by providing reports that estimate the impact of multiple pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic genes, but to date, these have not been directly examined in younger patient populations. Pharmacokinetic genes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, and hypersensitivity genes, HLA-A and HLA-B, have the strongest evidence base for application to pharmacotherapy in children. Although the field is evolving, and the evidence is mixed, there may be a role for PGX testing in children to help guide dosing and monitoring strategies. However, evidence-based medicine, rather than PGX testing, continues to play the lead role in guiding medication selection in pediatric psychopharmacology.

AB  - Music has cognitive, psychosocial, behavioral and motor benefits for people with neurological disorders such as dementia, stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Here we discuss seven properties or 'capacities' of music that interact with brain function and contribute to its therapeutic value. Specifically, in its various forms, music can be engaging, emotional, physical, personal, social and persuasive, and it promotes synchronization of movement. We propose the Therapeutic Music Capacities Model (TMCM), which links individual properties of music to therapeutic mechanisms, leading to cognitive, psychosocial, behavioral and motor benefits. We review evidence that these capacities have reliable benefits for people with dementia, stroke, PD and ASD when employed separately or in combination. The model accounts for the profound value that music affords human health and well-being and provides a framework for the development of non-pharmaceutical treatments for neurological disorders.

AB  - Neural circuitry residing within the medullary ventral respiratory column nuclei and dorsal respiratory group interact with the Kolliker-Fuse and medial parabrachial nuclei to generate the core breathing rhythm and pattern during resting conditions. Triphasic eupnea consists of inspiratory [I], post-inspiratory [post-I], and late-expiratory [E2] phases. Mesencephalic zones exert modulatory influences upon respiratory rhythm-generating circuitry, sympathetic oscillators, and parasympathetic nuclei. The earliest evidence supporting the existence of midbrain control of breathing derives from studies conducted by Martin and Booker in 1878. These authors demonstrated electrical stimulation of the deep layers of the mesencephalic colliculi in the rabbit augmented ventilation and sequentially elicited chest wall tremors and tetany. Investigations performed during the past several decades would demonstrate stimlation of distributed zones within the midbrain reticular formation elicits starkly disparate effects upon respiratory phase switching. Schmid, Bohmer, and Fallert demonstrated electrical stimulation of the nucleus rubre and emanating axon bundles alternately elicits or inhibits the activity of medullary expiratory- or inspiratory-related units and phrenic nerve discharge with differential latency. A series of studies would later indicate the red nucleus mediates hypoxic ventilatory depression. Periaqueductal gray matter neurons exhibit extensive afferent and efferent interconnectivity with suprabulbar, brainstem, and spinal cord zones aptly positioning these units to modulate breathing, autonomic outflow, nociception locomotion, micturtion, and sexual behavior. Experimental stimulatory activation of the tectal colliculi and periaqueductal gray matter via electrical current or glutamate, D,L-homocysteinic acid, or bicuculline microinjections coordinately modulates neuromotor inspiratory bursting frequency and amplitude and discharge of pre-Botzinger complex, ventrolateral medullary late-I and post-I, and ventrolateral nucleus tractus solitarius decrementing early-I and augmenting and decrementing late-I neurons, elicits expiratory outflow and vocalization, and blunt the Hering-Breuer reflex in unanesthetzed decerebrate and anesthetized preprations of the cat and rat. Stimulation of the mesencephalic colliuli or dorsal divisions of the PAG potently amplifes renal sympathetic neural efferent activity, dynamic arterial pressure magnitude, and myocardial contraction frequency and elicits various behavioral defense responses. Elicited physiological effects exhibit extensive locoregional heterogeneity and variably enlist requisite contributions from the dorsomedial hypothalamus and/or lateral parabrachial nuclei. Stimulation of the dorsal mesencephalon occasionally elicits dynamic increases of arterial pressure magnitude exhibiting prominent oscillatory variability coherent with phrenic nerve discharge, perhaps by generating intra-neuraxial hysteresis, serving to intermittently deliver blood to organ vascular beds under high pressure in order to prevent organ edema, microcirculatory dysfunction, and downregulation of vascular smooth muscle alpha adrenergic receptors.
   Chemosensitive mesencephalic caudal raphe units and projections of hypoxia-sensitive units in the caudal hypothalamus to the periaqueductal gray matter may imply the existence of a diencephalo-smesencephalic chemosensitive network modulating breathing and sympathetic discharge.

AB  - The rapid increase in world population has generated the issues of hunger, poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition. To meet the challenge of increased food production of better quality, the farmers were compelled to use more chemical fertilizers, especially in developing countries. The higher use of chemical fertilizers interrupts the food chain through eutrophication, the polluting air and soil by incorporating metals. Trace metals have a deleterious effect on soil microbial and plant growth. To minimize metal toxicity and maximize the production of food, there are different approaches that can lead to lessen the use of chemical fertilizers. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are capable to enhance the plant growth and can remediate metal contaminated soils. PGPR has the ability to improve food production with diverse attributes e.g. producing siderophores that promote rhizosphere trace metal sequestration and production of organic and inorganic acids thus affecting trace metal bioavail-ability and plant induced systemic tolerance (IST) to limit the crop metal accumulation. In this review paper, we have discussed the biological approach which is environmentally friendly and cost-effective mean for metal polluted soils and gives some new insights for safety use of PGPR in trace metal contaminated fields.

AB  - Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are less likely to be physically active. Walking is important to public health, therefore understanding correlates of walking will inform the development of targeted interventions. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the correlates of walking among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus were searched up to February 2020 and titles/abstracts and full-texts were screened against eligibility criteria. Methodological quality was assessed. Correlates were synthesized when two or more comparisons were available. 35 studies were selected for synthesis. 21 examined overall walking, 16 examined leisure-time walking and 9 examined walking for transport (8 examined two or more types of walking). Employment status, home ownership, self-rated health, density or number of social ties, perceived neighborhood aesthetics, perceived walkability and perceived individual safety were positively associated with overall walking. Social support for physical activity from friends and family and perceived individual safety were positively associated with leisure-time walking. Objective walkability, perceived walkability and perceived individual safety were positively associated with walking for transport. Most studies were cross-sectional, did not report response rates and used a validated measure of physical activity. Strategies to improve self-rated health, social ties, neighborhood aesthetics, walkability and perceptions of individual safety should be the focus of interventions that aim to improve walking among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Recommendations for future studies include the need to focus on leisure-time walking and walking for transport; the correlates of walking in males; prospective longitudinal designs; psychological, cognitive and emotional variables; and social, behavioral attributes and skills.

AB  - Background Many patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experience dissociative symptoms. The question of whether these dissociative symptoms negatively influence the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD is unresolved. Aims To determine the influence of dissociative symptoms on psychotherapy outcome in PTSD. Method We conducted a systematic search in Cochrane, Embase, PILOTS, PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science for relevant clinical trials. A random-effects meta-analysis examined the impact of dissociation on psychotherapy outcome in PTSD (pre-registered at Prospero CRD42018086575). Results Twenty-one trials (of which nine were randomised controlled trials) with 1714 patients were included. Pre-treatment dissociation was not related to treatment effectiveness in patients with PTSD (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.04, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.13). Between-study heterogeneity was high but was not explained by moderators such as trauma focus of the psychotherapy or risk of bias score. There was no indication for publication bias. Conclusions We found no evidence that dissociation moderates the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. The quality of some of the included studies was relatively low, emphasising the need for high-quality clinical trials in patients with PTSD. The results suggest that pre-treatment dissociation does not determine psychotherapy outcome in PTSD.

AB  - The human "person" is a common percept we encounter. Research on person perception has been focused either on face or body perception-with less attention paid to whole person perception. We review psychological and neuroscience studies aimed at understanding how face and body processing operate in concert to support intact person perception. We address this question considering: a.) the task to be accomplished (identification, emotion processing, detection), b.) the neural stage of processing (early/late visual mechanisms), and c.) the relevant brain regions for face/body/person processing. From the psychological perspective, we conclude that the integration of faces and bodies is mediated by the goal of the processing (e.g., emotion analysis, identification, etc.). From the neural perspective, we propose a hierarchical functional neural architecture of face-body integration that retains a degree of separation between the dorsal and ventral visual streams. We argue for two centers of integration: a ventral semantic integration hub that is the result of progressive, posterior-to-anterior, face-body integration; and a social agent integration hub in the dorsal stream STS.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a major public health burden worldwide. Myocardial infarction is the most common form of cardiovascular disease resulting from low blood supply to the heart. It can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmia, toxic metabolite accumulation, and permanently infarcted areas. Honey is one of the most prized medicinal remedies used since ancient times. There is evidence that indicates honey can function as a cardioprotective agent in cardiovascular diseases. The present review compiles and discusses the available evidence on the effect of honey on cardiovascular diseases. Three electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE via EBSCOhost, were searched between January 1959 and March 2020 to identify reports on the cardioprotective effect of honey. Based on the pre-set eligibility criteria, 25 qualified articles were selected and discussed in this review. Honey investigated in the studies included varieties according to their geological origin. Honey protects the heart via lipid metabolism improvement, antioxidative activity, blood pressure modulation, heartbeat restoration, myocardial infarct area reduction, antiaging properties, and cell apoptosis attenuation. This review establishes honey as a potential candidate to be explored further as a natural and dietary alternative to the management of cardiovascular disease.

KW  - DEVICE
KW  - TOOL
AB  - A multitude of psychiatric disorders have been described in classification systems like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM V). Diagnosing a specific mental disorder requires memorising specific symptom criteria, and their improper recall may result in misdiagnosis. Clinicians may use mnemonics, considering them as narratives or anecdotes of the diagnostic criteria. A scoping review of previously described mnemonics for DSM diagnostic criteria was carried out. An electronic search was done in PubMed, Google Scholar, Google Books and Google Search engine using a prespecified search strategy. Reference lists of relevant articles and chapters were hand searched to identify original and additional articles. Mnemonics retrieved from websites were manually searched in Google to identify published journal articles or chapters for the same mnemonics. Additionally, some mnemonics were developed, modified or added based on the author's knowledge. The comprehensive search identified 93 records (44 journal articles, 45 books and 4 websites) eligible for the review. Most of the mnemonics retrieved were related in some way to the disorder itself. They were listed under the heading of their respective disorders and indexed in the same order as in DSM V. The mnemonics that reflect a facet of their respective disorders were elaborated in detail.

AB  - To examine the association between urinary metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs) and diabetes, online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched on July 17, 2019. Of the 668 articles identified through searching, six cross-sectional studies involving 24,406 participants were included. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model. Heterogeneity was measured by reporting the I-square index. Moreover, subgroup analysis according to types of metabolites was performed. We found a significantly higher odds of diabetes in the highest versus the lowest category of urinary naphthalene (NAP), fluorine (FLU), phenanthrene (PHEN), and total OH-PAH metabolites. The pooled OR (95% CI) was estimated at 1.47 (1.17, 1.78), 1.50 (1.29, 1.71), 1.41 (1.21, 1.60), and 1.61 (1.01, 2.21), respectively. We also found a significant association per 1-fold increase in FLU (OR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.00, 1.19]) and PHEN (OR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.08, 1.30]) metabolites. In subgroup analysis stratified by types of OH-PAH metabolites, A significant stronger odds of diabetes was observed in the highest versus the lowest category of 2-PHEN (OR = 1.66, 95% CI [1.32, 2.00]), 2-NAP (OR = 1.66, 95% CI [1.16, 2.17]), 2-FLU (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [1.28, 1.97]), and 9-FLU (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [1.21, 2.04]) metabolites. Furthermore, there was a meaningfully greater likelihood of diabetes per 1-fold increase in 2-FLU (OR = 1.34, 95% CI [1.10, 1.57]), 2-PHEN (OR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.14, 1.51]), and 3-PHEN (OR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.04, 1.34]) metabolites. In conclusion, our study suggests the significant odds of association between urinary OH-PAH metabolites and diabetes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aberrations in neurodevelopmental trajectories have been implicated in the neurobiology of several mental disorders and evidence indicates a pathophysiological and genetic overlap of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD). In this narrative review, we summarize findings related to developmental and perinatal factors as well as epidemiological, clinical, neuropsychological, brain imaging, postmortem brain and genomic studies that provide evidence for a putative neurodevelopmental pathogenesis and etiology of BD. Overall, aberrations in neurodevelopmental pathways have been more consistently implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia compared to BD. Nevertheless, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that dysfunctional neurodevelopmental pathways may be implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of at least a subset of individuals with BD particularly those with an early age of illness onset and those exhibiting psychotic symptoms. A heuristic neurodevelopmental model for the pathophysiology of BD based on the findings of this review is proposed. Furthermore, we critically discuss clinical and research implications of this model. Finally, further research directions for this emerging field are provided.

TI  - Emotional Creativity: A Meta-analysis and Integrative Review
KW  - INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES
KW  - INVENTORY
AB  - Emotional creativity (EC) is a pattern of cognitive abilities and personality traits related to originality and appropriateness in emotional experience. EC has been found to be related to various constructs across different fields of psychology during the past 30 years, but a comprehensive examination of previous research is still lacking. The goal of this review is to explore the reliability of use of the Emotional Creativity Inventory (ECI) across studies, to test gender differences and to compare levels of EC in different countries. Thirty-five empirical studies focused on EC were retrieved and the coefficients required for the meta-analysis extracted. The meta-analysis revealed that women showed significantly higher EC than men (total N = 3,555). The same gender differences were also found when testing scores from three ECI subscales, i.e. emotional novelty, emotional preparedness and emotional effectiveness/authenticity. When comparing EC in 10 different countries (total N = 4,375), several cross-cultural differences were revealed. The Chinese sample showed a significantly lower average ECI total score than all the other countries. Based on the integration of results, the avenues for future research on EC and the breadth of influence of the concept of EC across different fields of psychology are discussed.

The databases Web of Science, EBSCO, and CENTRAL were searched on May 15, 2019, May 16, 2019, and August 5, 2019, respectively. Eighteen randomized controlled trials (N = 2,050) met the inclusion criteria (i.e., hypochondriasis, illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder with elevated HA being assessed with validated interviews: use of standardized outcome measures). Two reviewers independently evaluated the studies' risk of bias using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for randomized trials (RoB-2) tool. Overall, psychological interventions were significantly more effective than waitlist, treatment-as-usual, or placebo post-treatment (g(SS) = 0.70, g(HA) = 1.11) and at follow-up (g(SS) = 0.33, g(HA)= 0.70). CBT outperformed other psychological interventions or pharmacotherapy for HA post- treatment (Hedge's g(HA) = 0.81). The number of sessions did not significantly predict the effect sizes. In sum, psychological interventions were effective for SHA, but the generalizability of the results for SS is limited, because only two high-quatity trials contributed to the comparison.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are challenging to recognize and treat effectively. Despite very effective nonpharmacologic strategies, there are cases where severe BPSD may require biological intervention. The purpose of this review was to clarify safe and evidence-based use of pharmacological agents based on available clinical trial evidence.
   METHODS: A structured search strategy was used in PubMed, Embase, and Psyclnfo to obtain the most relevant data regarding treatment of BPSD in patients with any-cause dementia.
   RESULTS: We screened 1,442 English-language abstracts. Following initial screening, we had 184 unique references to review. A secondary search of these and review articles gave a total of 117 to tabulate and discuss. We categorized the results based on the following classifications: antidepressants, first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers, sedatives, stimulants, steroid therapies, other medications, other medication strategies, and medication withdrawal.
   CONCLUSIONS: The judicious use of pharmacotherapy does seem to be appropriate in select cases where behavioral and psychological interventions have been partially effective or where symptoms confer imminent risk of harm.

AB  - A systematic review of autism spectrum disorder and substance use and abuse was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis protocol guidelines (an internationally recognized standardized methodological framework for conducting systematic review). The objectives of the review were to update and extend findings reported by Arnevik and Helverschou's review of the autism spectrum disorder and substance use literature by (1) evaluating study quality via the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool; (2) examining autism spectrum disorder and substance abuse diagnostic measures; (3) reporting on the prevalence of co-occurring autism spectrum disorder and substance abuse; and (4) identifying risk, protective, and positive treatment factors. Twenty-six studies on substance use and abuse in autism spectrum disorder were identified through a search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Average study quality score was 75.4%. Prevalence rates of substance abuse among samples with autism spectrum disorder ranged from 1.3% to 36%, but due to variability in sample characteristics and diagnostic measures, a general prevalence rate could not be established. Risk and protective factors, recognized in the general population, such as familial substance abuse and comorbid externalizing disorders, and factors, which may be more likely to occur in individuals with autism spectrum disorder compared to the general population, such as few social resources (i.e. sense of social belonging, breadth of social support networks, and level of social capital) and low sensation-seeking, were identified. One intervention study was identified; however, methodological limitations preclude any conclusion regarding positive treatment factors at this time. More research, using standardized measures and comparable samples, is needed to understand risk and protective factors and to determine the prevalence of co-occurring substance abuse and autism spectrum disorder.
   Lay Abstract
   Symptoms characteristic of autism spectrum disorder were initially believed to protect individuals with autism spectrum disorder from developing substance abuse. However, recent studies suggest that up to 36% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder may have a co-occurring issue with substance abuse. In addition, substance abuse may worsen the difficulties with daily functioning some individuals with autism spectrum disorder experience. It is important to understand occurrence rates, and risk, protective and positive treatment factors of co-occurring autism spectrum disorder and substance abuse in order to promote the best possible support for this special population. This review aimed to find and synthesize evidence regarding risk, protective and treatment factors, and determine a general prevalence rate of co-occurring autism spectrum disorder and substance abuse from all studies on substance use and abuse in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The review also aimed to assess study quality and identify a diagnostic measure for substance abuse in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Twenty-six studies on substance use and abuse in autism spectrum disorder were included in the review. The rates of substance abuse among those with autism spectrum disorder identified by included studies ranged from 1.3% to 36%, but due to large differences in study methods, a general prevalence rate could not be determined.
   Risk and protective factors, recognized in the general population, such as familial substance abuse and co-occurring mental health issues, and factors which may be more likely to occur in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, such as limited social resources and low sensation-seeking, were identified. No diagnostic measures specific to individuals with autism spectrum disorder and substance abuse were identified. This review identified only one exploratory study on an adapted intervention for co-occurring autism spectrum disorder and substance abuse. However, there were many methodological challenges in this study that limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the data. More research, using consistent methods, is needed to understand risk and protective factors and to determine the prevalence of substance abuse among individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The potential for co-occurring autism spectrum disorder and substance abuse should be considered by professional working in both autism spectrum disorder and substance abuse services, as finding suggests substance abuse is possible among individuals with autism spectrum disorder and may occur more frequently than previously believed. In addition, autism spectrum disorder and substance abuse service providers should be sensitive to specific risk and protective factors identified by the review that may impact substance abuse course and outcomes.

AB  - Background: Outpatient civil commitment (OCC), community treatment orders (CTOs) in European and Commonwealth nations, require the provision of needed-treatment to protect against imminent threats to health and safety. OCC-reviews aggregating all studies report inconsistent outcomes. This review, searches for consistency in OCC-outcomes by evaluating studies based on mental health system characteristics, measurement, and design principles.
   Methods: All previously reviewed OCC-studies and more recent investigations were grouped by their outcome-measures' relationship to OCC statute objectives. A study's evidence-quality ranking was assessed. Hospital and service-utilization outcomes were grouped by whether they represented treatment provision, patient outcome, or the conflation of both.
   Results: OCC-studies including direct health and safety outcomes found OCC associated with reduced mortality-risk, increased access to acute medical care, and reduced violence and victimization risks. Studies considering treatment-provision, found OCC associated with improved medication and service compliance. If coupled with assertive community treatment (ACT) or aggressive case management OCC was associated with enhanced ACT success in reducing hospitalization need. When outpatient-services were limited, OCC facilitated rapid return to hospital for needed-treatment and increased hospital utilization in the absence of a less restrictive alternative. OCC-studies measuring "total hospital days", "prevention of hospitalization", and "readmissions" report negative and/or no difference findings because they erroneously conflate their intervention (provision of needed treatment) and outcome.
   Conclusions: This investigation finds replicated beneficial associations between OCC and direct measures of imminent harm indicating reductions in threats to health and safety. It also finds support for OCC as a less restrictive alternative to inpatient care.

AB  - Objective: To ascertain the phenomenological characterisation of catatonia in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody encephalitis (NMDAr-AbE).
   Methods: A systematic review of case reports was undertaken in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Case reports of NMDAr-AbE containing sufficient information on the cases' clinical presentation and meeting the study's inclusion criteria were selected. Cases were searched for clinical data in keeping with core catatonic signs by applying the screening instrument of the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale. When two or more core signs were ascertained catatonia was considered to be present.
   Results: 2645 records were identified through the database search. Following screening and application of eligibility/inclusion criteria 139 articles were selected reporting on 189 individual subjects. Catatonia was present in 60% of these cases. The most prevalent signs were immobility/stupor (70%), mutism (67%), excitement (50%), posturing/catalepsy (34%), stereotypies (31%), and rigidity (30%). Immobility/stupor and excitement co-occurred in the same patient in 33% of cases.
   Conclusion: The phenomenological profile of catatonia in this sample of cases of NMDAr-AbE was characterised by a preponderance of signs in the hypokinetic spectrum. However, excitement often co-occurred in these patients suggesting that fluctuations in catatonic semiology may be frequent.

AB  - Aim This study summarised available evidence on the association between early and on-time retirement, compared with continued working, and mortality. Moreover, this study investigated whether and to what extent gender, adjustment for demographics and prior health status influence this association.
   Methods A systematic literature search of longitudinal studies was conducted. A qualitative analysis of the included studies was performed, followed by a meta-regression analysis to assess the influence of gender, prior health and demographics. Random-effects models were used in a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled effects for relevant subgroups identified in the meta-regression.
   Results In total, 25 studies were included. Adjustment for prior health and demographics influenced the association between retirement and mortality (p<0.05). The results of the meta-analysis of 12 studies are presented for 'insufficiently adjusted' and 'fully adjusted' subgroups. There was no association between early retirement and mortality compared with working until retirement (fully adjusted subgroup: HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28). On-time retirement was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with working beyond retirement (insufficiently adjusted subgroup: HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.73). However, in the subgroup that adjusted for prior health, on-time retirement was not associated with mortality (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.28).
   Conclusion Early retirement was not associated with a higher risk of mortality. On-time retirement was associated with a higher risk of mortality, which might reflect the healthy worker effect. It is important to consider information on prior health and demographics when studying the association between retirement and mortality to avoid biased findings.special-featureunlocked

AB  - Purpose of review Mental health and substance use problems are among the most prevalent and challenging problems faced by both high-income and low-income countries worldwide. This review will focus on summarizing scattered evidence of school-based interventions to promote well-being and prevent mental health problems and substance use disorders in children and adolescents. Recent findings We focus on two main areas of research: promotion of healthy school climate and prevention of bullying. Choosing among available interventions might be challenging, both because of the difficulties in assessing their efficacy and tailoring interventions to specific needs, but also because of the scarcity of intervention in low-resource settings. We provide some guidance on principles encompassed by the available evidence that can be used for policymakers and local communities aiming to integrate mental health promotion and prevention into their schools. Developing, implementing, scaling and sustaining school-based interventions is a necessity of our field if we want to move closer to sustainable development goals.

AB  - The search for more effective treatments for depression is a long-standing primary objective in both psychiatry and translational neuroscience. From initial models centered on neurochemical deficits, such as the monoamine hypothesis, research toward this goal has shifted toward a focus on network and circuit models to explain how key nodes in the limbic system and beyond interact to produce persistent shifts in affective states. To build these models, researchers have turned to two complementary approaches: neuroimaging studies in human patients (and their healthy counterparts) and neurophysiotogy studies in animal models, facilitated in large part by optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques. As the authors discuss, functional neuroimaging studies in humans have included largely task-oriented experiments, which have identified brain regions differentially activated during processing of affective stimuli, and resting-state functional MRI experiments, which have identified brain-wide networks altered in depressive states. Future work in this area will build on a multisite approach, assembling large data sets across diverse populations, and will also leverage the statistical power afforded by longitudinal imaging studies in patient samples. Translational studies in rodents have used optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to identify not just nodes but also connections within the networks of the limbic system that are both critical and permissive for the expression of motivated behavior and affective phenotypes. Future studies in this area wilt exploit mesoscale imaging and multisite electrophysiology recordings to construct network models with cell-type specificity and high statistical power, identifying candidate circuit and molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, are not a homogeneous population; their morphology, molecular profile, and even their ultrastructure greatly vary from one cell to another. Recent advances in the field of neuroimmunology have helped to demystify the enigma that currently surrounds microglial heterogeneity. Indeed, numerous microglial subtypes have been discovered such as the disease-associated microglia, neurodegenerative phenotype, and Cd11c-positive developmental population. Another subtype is the dark microglia (DM), a population defined by its ultrastructural changes associated with cellular stress. Since their first characterization using transmission electron microscopy, they have been identified in numerous disease conditions, from mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, fractalkine signaling deficiency to chronic stress, just to name a few. A recent study also identified the presence of cells with a similar ultrastructure to the DM in postmortem brain samples from schizophrenic patients, underlining the importance of understanding the function of these cells. In this minireview, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on the DM, from their initial ultrastructural characterization to their documentation in various pathological contexts across multiple species. We will also highlight the current limitations surrounding the study of these cells and the future that awaits the DM.

AB  - Bisphenols, particularly bisphenol A (4,4 '-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)-diphenol) (BPA), are suspected of inducing oxidative stress in humans, which may be associated with adverse health outcomes. We investigated the associations between exposure to bisphenols and biomarkers of oxidative stress in human studies over the last 12 years (20082019) related to six health endpoints and evaluated their suitability as effect biomarkers. PubMed database searches identified 27 relevant articles that were used for data extraction. In all studies, BPA exposure was reported, whereas some studies also reported other bisphenols. More than a dozen different biomarkers were measured. The most frequently measured biomarkers were 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-isoprostane) and malondialdehyde (MDA), which almost always were positively associated with BPA. Methodological issues were reported for MDA, mainly the need to handle samples with caution to avoid artefact formation and its measurements using a chromatographic step to distinguish it from similar aldehydes, making some of the MDA results less reliable. Urinary 8-OHdG and 8-isoprostane can be considered the most reliable biomarkers of oxidative stress associated with BPA exposure. Although none of the biomarkers are considered BPA- or organ-specific, the biomarkers can be assessed repeatedly and non-invasively in urine and could help to understand causal relationships.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-attribute neurodegenerative disorder combining motor and nonmotor symptoms without well-defined diagnostic clinical markers. The presence of primary motor features (bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes) are the most characteristic signs of PD that are also utilized to identify patients in current clinical practice. The successful implementation of levodopa treatment revealed that nonmotor features are the main contributors of patient disability in PD, and their occurrence might be earlier than motor symptoms during disease progression. Targeted detection of prodromal PD symptoms can open up new possibilities in the identification of PD patients and provide potential patient populations for developing novel neuroprotective therapies. In this review, the evolution of critical features in PD diagnosis is described with special attention to nonmotor symptoms and their possible detection.

AB  - The neurotoxicity of NO2 exposure is well-known and potentially causes impaired of neural functions. This review aimed to estimate associations between prenatal NO2 exposure and neurodevelopment for children. Articles published until May 2019 reported prenatal NO2 exposure and children's cognition, psychomotor, language, attention, IQ, and behavior function were searched according to all related terms. The main databases we retrieved included PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Coefficient was extracted, conversed, and synthesized by random effects meta-analysis. Meanwhile, qualitatively describe would be used for some studies which cannot be synthesized quantitatively for lack of quantity or methods inconsistency. Finally, a total of 3848 citations were searched, and only 10 studies were included. We estimated that per 10 mu g/m(3) increase of NO2 during pregnancy was associated with a - 0.76 point decrease in global psychomotor (95% CI, - 1.34, - 0.18) and a - 0.62 point decrease in fine psychomotor for children (95% CI, - 1.09, - 0.16). But no significant association found in general cognitive and language. In addition, through the literature review, it seemed that prenatal exposure to NO2 might cause adverse impacts on children's attention, IQ, and different behaviors, but this requires confirmation from further researches. Our study indicated that prenatal exposure to NO2 seems to be associated with impaired neural development for children, especially for fine psychomotor. However, further studies are needed for determining the effects of prenatal air pollution exposure on attention, IQ, and behavior.

AB  - Effective and prompt medication treatment is essential for schizophrenia patients to alleviate psychotic symptoms and improve prognosis. The treatment rate of schizophrenia usually varies greatly across studies. This is a meta-analysis that examined the overall treatment rate of schizophrenia in China. Both international (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science) and Chinese (CNKI, WanFang and Sinomed) databases were searched. The random effects model was used to analyze the data. Fifteen studies with 1,219,472 patients were included. This meta-analysis found that 73% (95%CI: 66%, 80%) of schizophrenia patients received treatment in any type of medical institutions, while 31.0% (95%CI = 21.0%, 41.0%) received treatment in psychiatric institutions. Studies conducted in middle region of China (76.8% for any type of medical institutions; 42.6% for psychiatric institutions) and those published before 2007 (74.6% for any type of medical institutions; 31.3% for psychiatric institutions) reported significantly higher treatment rates. Studies using combined diagnostic instruments had a higher treatment rate of schizophrenia (72.0%) in any type of medical institutions, while using the Chinese classification of Mental Disorders (47.7%) and including both rural and urban areas (35.7%) had higher treatment rates of schizophrenia in psychiatric institutions. The treatment rate of schizophrenia was relatively high in China, but most treatments were delivered in non-psychiatric medical institutions. Greater efforts should be made to improve the provision of accessible mental health services for schizophrenia patients in this part of the world.

AB  - BackgroundEarly intervention and conversation about a child's weight may offer an important chance of success in reducing weight and implementing a healthier lifestyle. This review explores the most effective ways to notify parents and children about the child's weight as well as their preferences and experiences around weight notification.MethodsWe systematically searched nine databases for relevant primary research. Records were independently screened by two authors. We extracted data into a form designed for this review. Effect data was analysed using narrative synthesis and qualitative data using a best-fit framework synthesis. We assessed our confidence in the evidence using GRADE and GRADE-CERQual.ResultsStudies of effect found that the format of feedback made little or no difference in parents attending further treatment, recognising their child as overweight or obese, reactions to the way the weight notification is given, motivation for lifestyle change, understanding how to reduce the risk of overweight, or taking any action. However, parents receiving feedback with motivational interviewing have somewhat greater satisfaction with the way the healthcare provider supports them.Qualitative studies found that parents had clear preferences for the format, timing, content and amount of information they wanted to receive in relation to both the weighing process and weight notification. They also had clear preferences for how they wanted health care providers to interact and communicate with them and their children. Both parents and children often felt that they were not receiving enough information and worried about how their results would be kept private. Many parents experienced an emotional response when told about their child's weight ranging from positive, disbelief and negative feelings. Those who reacted with disbelief or negatively were less likely to accept their child's weight status and/or act upon the notification letter.No studies reported results for children who were underweight.ConclusionsBased on these qualitative results people working with weight assessment and notification programs should consider parents' preferences when developing feedback formats, considering the mode of feedback they are going to use and provide parents and children with tailored feedback and personalized follow up once a child is identified as overweight or obese.

AB  - Mental time travel (MTT) is the ability that allows humans to mentally project themselves backwards in time to remember past events (i.e., episodic memory) or forwards in time to imagine future events (i.e., future thinking). Despite empirical evidence showing that animals might possess MTT abilities, some still claim that this ability is uniquely human. Recent debates have suggested that it is the temporal cognitive mechanism (i.e., ability to represent the sense of past and future) that makes MTT uniquely human. Advances in the field have been constrained by a lack of comparative data, methodological shortcomings that prevent meaningful comparisons, and a lack of clear conceptualizations of the temporal cognitive mechanism. Here I will present a comprehensive review into MTT in humans and animals-with a particular focus on great apes. I will examine three of the most prominent and influential theoretical models of human MTT. Drawing on these accounts, I suggest that a basic way of understanding time might be shared across species, however culture and language will play a critical role at shaping the way we elaborate mental representations about past and future events.

AB  - Understanding and modelling the development of lake phytoplankton communities is a desirable goal, given the importance of these organisms to their ecosystem. PROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental CHange) is one such model which attempts to do this and its applications over the last 10 years are reviewed here. These studies include: modelling very large lakes, linking catchment models to PROTECH, simulating oxygen concentrations, understanding the importance of nutrient source in moderating the influence of hydraulic retention time. Furthermore, the merits of ensemble lake modelling are considered, as are the limits of short term forecasting of blooms. Finally, climate change influences are examined with studies that include nutrient changes and an experiment that attempts to separate the influences of temperature and mixed depth.

AB  - Circulation patterns in the North Atlantic Ocean have changed and re-organized multiple times over millions of years, influencing the biodiversity, distribution, and connectivity patterns of deep-sea species and ecosystems. In this study, we review the effects of the water mass properties (temperature, salinity, food supply, carbonate chemistry, and oxygen) on deep-sea benthic megafauna (from species to community level) and discussed in future scenarios of climate change. We focus on the key oceanic controls on deep-sea megafauna biodiversity and biogeography patterns. We place particular attention on cold-water corals and sponges, as these are ecosystem-engineering organisms that constitute vulnerable marine ecosystems (VME) with high associated biodiversity. Besides documenting the current state of the knowledge on this topic, a future scenario for water mass properties in the deep North Atlantic basin was predicted. The pace and severity of climate change in the deep-sea will vary across regions. However, predicted water mass properties showed that all regions in the North Atlantic will be exposed to multiple stressors by 2100, experiencing at least one critical change in water temperature (+2 degrees C), organic carbon fluxes (reduced up to 50%), ocean acidification (pH reduced up to 0.3), aragonite saturation horizon (shoaling above 1000 m) and/or reduction in dissolved oxygen (> 5%). The northernmost regions of the North Atlantic will suffer the greatest impacts. Warmer and more acidic oceans will drastically reduce the suitable habitat for ecosystem-engineers, with severe consequences such as declines in population densities, even compromising their long-term survival, loss of biodiversity and reduced biogeographic distribution that might compromise connectivity at large scales. These effects can be aggravated by reductions in carbon fluxes, particularly in areas where food availability is already limited. Declines in benthic biomass and biodiversity will diminish ecosystem services such as habitat provision, nutrient cycling, etc. This study shows that the deep-sea VME affected by contemporary anthropogenic impacts and with the ongoing climate change impacts are unlikely to withstand additional pressures from more intrusive human activities. This study serves also as a warning to protect these ecosystems through regulations and by tempering the ongoing socio-political drivers for increasing exploitation of marine resources.

AB  - Objective: This paper aims to synthesise the broader perspectives of Maori patients and their whanau (extended family, family group) of their treatment within the public health system. Our research question was 'What are the experiences of Maori in the public health and/or hospital system in Aotearoa New Zealand?'
   Methods: A systematic search using PRISMA protocols and reflexive typology organised around the categories of Maori, public healthcare and qualitative research identified 14 papers that covered all three categories. We undertook a qualitative metasynthesis on these papers using a critical community psychology approach.
   Results: Maori patients and whanau from the included papers mention both barriers and facilitators to health. We categorised barriers as organisational structures, staff interactions and practical considerations. Facilitators were categorised as the provision of whanau support in the form of practical assistance, emotional care and health system navigation.
   Conclusions: For many Maori, the existing public health system is experienced as hostile and alienating. Whanau members provide support to mitigate this, but it comes as a cost to whanau.

AB  - Eye contact is a fundamental aspect of nonverbal communication and therefore important for understanding human interaction. Eye contact has been the subject of research in many disciplines, including communication sciences, social psychology, and psychiatry, and a variety of techniques have been used to measure it. The choice of measurement method has consequences for research outcomes and their interpretation. To ensure that research findings align with study aims and populations, it is essential that methodological choices are well substantiated. Therefore, to enhance the effective examination of eye contact, we performed a literature review of the methods used to study eye contact. We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for empirical peer-reviewed articles published in English that described quantitative studies on human eye contact and included a methodological description. The identified studies (N = 109) used two approaches to assess eye contact: direct, i.e., assessing eye contact while it is occurring, and indirect, i.e., assessing eye contact retrospectively (e.g., from video recordings). Within these categories, eight specific techniques were distinguished. Variation was found regarding the reciprocity of eye contact between two individuals, the involvement of an assessor and the behavior of participants while being studied. Measures not involving the interactors in assessment of eye contact and have a higher spatial and temporal resolution, such as eye tracking, have gained popularity. Our results show wide methodological diversity regarding the measurement of eye contact. Although studies often define eye contact as gaze towards an exact location, this may not do justice to the subjective character of eye contact. The various methodologies have hardly ever been compared, limiting the ability to compare findings between studies. Future studies should take notice of the controversy surrounding eye contact measures.

AB  - Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic and psychedelic compound, has revolutionized the field of psychopharmacology by showing robust, and rapid-acting antidepressant activity in patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), suicidal tendencies, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine's efficacy, however, is transient, and patients must return to the clinic for repeated treatment as they experience relapse. This is cause for concern because ketamine is known for its abuse liability, and repeated exposure to drugs of abuse often leads to drug abuse/dependence. Though the mechanism(s) underlying its antidepressant activity is an area of current intense research, both clinical and preclinical evidence shows that ketamine's effects are mediated, at least in part, by molecular adaptations resulting in long-lasting synaptic changes in mesolimbic brain regions known to regulate natural and drug reward. This review outlines our limited knowledge of ketamine's neurobiological and biochemical underpinnings mediating its antidepressant effects and correlates them to its abuse potential. Depression and addiction share overlapping neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms, and though speculative, repeated use of ketamine for the treatment of depression could lead to the development of substance use disorder/addiction, and thus should be tempered with caution. There is much that remains to be known about the long-term effects of ketamine, and our lack of understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects is a clear limiting factor that needs to be addressed systematically before using repeated ketamine in the treatment of depressed patients.

AB  - Background: Obesity is a major public health problem whose prevalence has been rapidly increasing in the United States (U.S), and globally. It is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths globally and contributes to the development of many diseases.
   Methods: The search was limited to studies published in English and other languages involving both animal and human subjects. Articles selected included preclinical studies, randomized clinical trials RCTs, observational studies, meta-analyses, narrative and systemic reviews providing primary quantitative data with a measure of obesity or food addiction as an outcome. Over 5000 articles were found in the first round of search which was filtered to 506 articles.
   Results: Oxidative stress plays a critical role in food addiction and is both a cause and mediator of obesity. Reactive oxygen species play a direct role in adipogenesis and oxidative stress modulates all factors involved in obesity including genetics, sleep, gut microbiome, insulin, ghrelin, inflammation, adipokines, leptin, stress, HPA axis, and the hypothalamus.
   Conclusions: The idea of thinking of combating obesity from the lens of calorie count, low carbohydrate, high or low-fat, vegetarian, vegan, plant-based, or animal-based diet is fundamentally wrong. The best way to look at obesity is through the framework of systemic redox homeostasis. Since redox homeostasis is tilted towards increased reactive oxygen species production, and excessive antioxidant intake can result in oxidative stress, an antioxidant and prooxidant food ratio of 2:3 per meal is the ideal nutritional ratio for good health and ideal weight. A ratio of 3:4 is ideal for obese individuals because of their state of chronic oxidative stress and inflammation. Physical activity, sleep quality, psychological stress, maternal prenatal diet and oxidative stress promoting disease conditions are important modulators of oxidative stress and obesity.

AB  - Introduction The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) G-308A gene is the most studied regarding susceptibility to major depressive disorder (MDD). However, results have been controversial perhaps due to the heterogeneous genetic backgrounds influenced by race as well as subtypes of depression.
   Methods and materials A systematic MEDLINE search was performed to retrieve all published studies that identified the connection between the TNF-alpha G-308A gene polymorphism and the risk of MDD.
   Results There was no statistical difference between the allele frequencies or genotypes of TNF-alpha G-308A gene and the depressive patients or healthy subjects in the five models tested. Further, subgroup analyses showed that the TNF-alpha G-308A gene polymorphism also did not confer susceptibility to poststroke, late-life, maternal, or major depression. Publication bias analysis showed p values were more than .05, suggesting that the 9 articles included in the current analysis had no publication bias.
   Conclusion Neither the allele frequencies nor genotypes of TNF-alpha G-308A gene could be served as an independent risk factor of depression.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss. Although AD neuropathological hallmarks are extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular tau tangles, the best correlate of disease progression is synapse loss. What causes synapse loss has been the focus of several researchers in the AD field. Synapses become dysfunctional before plaques and tangles form. Studies based on early-onset familial AD (eFAD) models have supported that synaptic transmission is depressed by beta-amyloid (A beta) triggered mechanisms. Since eFAD is rare, affecting only 1% of patients, research has shifted to the study of the most common late-onset AD (LOAD). Intracellular trafficking has emerged as one of the pathways of LOAD genes. Few studies have assessed the impact of trafficking LOAD genes on synapse dysfunction. Since endocytic traffic is essential for synaptic function, we reviewed A beta-dependent and independent mechanisms of the earliest synaptic dysfunction in AD. We have focused on the role of intraneuronal and secreted A beta oligomers, highlighting the dysfunction of endocytic trafficking as an A beta-dependent mechanism of synapse dysfunction in AD. Here, we reviewed the LOAD trafficking genes APOE4, ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, PICALM, EPH1A, and SORL1, for which there is a synaptic link. We conclude that in eFAD and LOAD, the earliest synaptic dysfunctions are characterized by disruptions of the presynaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis and of postsynaptic glutamate receptor endocytosis. While in eFAD synapse dysfunction seems to be triggered by A beta, in LOAD, there might be a direct synaptic disruption by LOAD trafficking genes. To identify promising therapeutic targets and biomarkers of the earliest synaptic dysfunction in AD, it will be necessary to join efforts in further dissecting the mechanisms used by A beta and by LOAD genes to disrupt synapses.

   In the literature, 65 years is commonly used as the age to designate an older person in the community. When studying older prisoners, there is much variation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how researchers define older offenders and for what reasons.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors reviewed articles on health and well-being of older offenders to assess terminology used to describe this age group, the chosen age cut-offs distinguishing younger offenders from older offenders, the arguments provided to support this choice as well as the empirical base cited in this context.
   Findings
   The findings show that the age cut-off of 50 years and the term "older" were most frequently used by researchers in the field. The authors find eight main arguments given to underscore the use of specific age cut-offs delineating older offenders. They outline the reasoning provided for each argument and evaluate it for its use to define older offenders.
   Originality/value
   With this review, it is hoped to stimulate the much-needed discussion advancing towards a uniform definition of the older offender. Such a uniform definition would make future research more comparable and ensure that there is no ambiguity when researchers state that the study population is "older offenders".

AB  - Aging is a condition that may be characterized by a decline in physical, sensory, and mental capacities, while increased morbidity and multimorbidity may be associated with disability. A wide range of clinical conditions (e.g., frailty, mild cognitive impairment, metabolic syndrome) and age-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, cancer, sarcopenia, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases) affect older people. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel and promising tool for assessment and rehabilitation in older people. Usability is a crucial factor that must be considered when designing virtual systems for medicine. We conducted a systematic review with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines concerning the usability of VR clinical systems in aging and provided suggestions to structure usability piloting. Findings show that different populations of older people have been recruited to mainly assess usability of non-immersive VR, with particular attention paid to motor/physical rehabilitation. Mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative tools together) is the preferred methodology; technology acceptance models are the most applied theoretical frameworks, however senior adapted models are the best within this context. Despite minor interaction issues and bugs, virtual systems are rated as usable and feasible. We encourage usability and user experience pilot studies to ameliorate interaction and improve acceptance and use of VR clinical applications in older people with the aid of suggestions (VR-USOP) provided by our analysis.

AB  - Problems are raised with the global workspace hypothesis of consciousness, for example about exactly how global the workspace needs to be for consciousness to suddenly be present. Problems are also raised with Carruthers's (2019) version that excludes conceptual (categorical or discrete) representations, and in which phenomenal consciousness can be reduced to physical processes, with instead a different levels of explanation approach to the relation between the brain and the mind advocated. A different theory of phenomenal consciousness is described, in which there is a particular computational system involved in which Higher Order Syntactic Thoughts are used to perform credit assignment on first order thoughts of multiple step plans to correct them by manipulating symbols in a syntactic type of working memory. This provides a good evolutionary reason for the evolution of this kind of computational module, with which, it is proposed, phenomenal consciousness is associated. Some advantages of this HOST approach to phenomenal consciousness are then described with reference not only to the global workspace approach, but also to Higher Order Thought (HOT) theories. It is hypothesized that the HOST system which requires the ability to manipulate first order symbols in working memory might utilize parts of the prefrontal cortex implicated in working memory, and especially the left inferior frontal gyrus, which is involved in language and probably syntactical processing. Overall, the approach advocated is to identify the computations that are linked to consciousness, and to analyze the neural bases of those computations.

AB  - Two decades ago, the observation of a rapid and sustained antidepressant response after ketamine administration provided an exciting new avenue in the search for more effective therapeutics for the treatment of clinical depression. Research elucidating the mechanism(s) underlying ketamine's antidepressant properties has led to the development of several hypotheses, including that of disinhibition of excitatory glutamate neurons via blockade of N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Although the prominent understanding has been that ketamine's mode of action is mediated solely via the NMDA receptor, this view has been challenged by reports implicating other glutamate receptors such as AMPA, and other neurotransmitter systems such as serotonin and opioids in the antidepressant response. The recent approval of esketamine (SpravatoT) for the treatment of depression has sparked a resurgence of interest for a deeper understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying ketamine's actions and safe therapeutic use. This review aims to present our current knowledge on both NMDA and non-NMDA mechanisms implicated in ketamine's response, and addresses the controversy surrounding the antidepressant role and potency of its stereoisomers and metabolites. There is much that remains to be known about our understanding of ketamine's antidepressant properties; and although the arrival of esketamine has been received with great enthusiasm, it is now more important than ever that its mechanisms of action be fully delineated, and both the short- and long-term neurobiological/functional consequences of its treatment be thoroughly characterized.

AB  - Background The homeostasis of metal ions, such as iron, copper, zinc and calcium, in the brain is crucial for maintaining normal physiological functions. Studies have shown that imbalance of these metal ions in the brain is closely related to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly. Main body Erroneous deposition/distribution of the metal ions in different brain regions induces oxidative stress. The metal ions imbalance and oxidative stress together or independently promote amyloid-beta (A beta) overproduction by activating beta- or gamma-secretases and inhibiting alpha-secretase, it also causes tau hyperphosphorylation by activating protein kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), cyclin-dependent protein kinase-5 (CDK5), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), etc., and inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The metal ions imbalances can also directly or indirectly disrupt organelles, causing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress; mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunctions, which can cause or aggravate A beta and tau aggregation/accumulation, and impair synaptic functions. Even worse, the metal ions imbalance-induced alterations can reversely exacerbate metal ions misdistribution and deposition. The vicious cycles between metal ions imbalances and A beta/tau abnormalities will eventually lead to a chronic neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits, such as seen in AD patients. Conclusion The metal ions imbalance induces A beta and tau pathologies by directly or indirectly affecting multiple cellular/subcellular pathways, and the disrupted homeostasis can reversely aggravate the abnormalities of metal ions transportation/deposition. Therefore, adjusting metal balance by supplementing or chelating the metal ions may be potential in ameliorating AD pathologies, which provides new research directions for AD treatment.

   Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: Both researchers searched for published articles in scientific databases until May 2019. Then, the articles were screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results were combined, and analyses of subgroups and reviewing the bias of the publication were performed as well.
   Results: Seventeen longitudinal studies included in the meta-analysis were from three continents: Europe, Asia, and America. The risk ratio (RR) of mortality based on job strain was equal to 1.20, with a confidence interval (CI) of 1.04-1.37 (P = 0.00.10). In men, the RR is 1.21, and the CI is 1.02-1.44 (P = 0.032), and in women, the RR is 0.97 and CI is 0.84-1.12 (P = 0.686). Evaluation of publication bias indicated nothing significant.
   Discussion: Based on the findings, it was found that job strain was a risk factor for mortality, and this finding was more appropriate for men. Hence, reducing job strain can be a deterrent against the dangers that threaten health. (c) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The format of the original Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was unstructured: only general instructions were provided for rating individual items. Over the years, a number of modified versions of the HAM-D have been proposed. They differ not only in the number of items, but also in modalities of administration. Structured versions, including item definitions, anchor points and semi-structured or structured interview questions, were developed. This comprehensive review was conducted to examine the clinimetric properties of the different versions of the HAM-D. The aim was to identify the HAM-D versions that best display the clinimetric properties of reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change. The search was conducted on MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, and yielded a total of 35,473 citations, but only the most representative studies were included. The structured versions of the HAM-D were found to display the highest inter-rater and test-retest reliability. The Clinical Interview for Depression and the 6-item HAM-D showed the highest sensitivity in differentiating active treatment from placebo. The findings indicate that the HAM-D is a valid and sensitive clinimetric index, which should not be discarded in view of obsolete and not clinically relevant psychometric criteria. The HAM-D, however, requires an informed use: unstructured forms should be avoided and the type of HAM-D version that is selected should be specified in the registration of the study protocol and in the methods of the trial.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, which relates to not only motor symptoms, but also cognitive, autonomic, and mood impairments. The literature suggests that pharmacological or surgical treatment has a limited effect on providing relief of the symptoms and also restricting its progression. Recently, research on non-pharmacological interventions for people living with PD (pwPD) that alleviate their motor and non-motor features has shown a new aspect in treating this complex disease. Numerous studies are supporting exercise intervention as being effective in both motor and non-motor facets of PD, such as physical functioning, strength, balance, gait speed, and cognitive impairment. Via the lens of the physical profession, this paper strives to provide another perspective for PD treatment by presenting exercise modes categorized by motor and non-motor PD symptoms, along with its effects and mechanisms. Acknowledging that there is no "one size fits all" exercise prescription for such a variable and progressive disease, this review is to outline tailored physical activities as a credible approach in treating pwPD, conceivably enhancing overall physical capacity, ameliorating the symptoms, reducing the risk of falls and injuries, and, eventually, elevating the quality of life. It also provides references and practical prescription applications for the clinician.

AB  - Residential mobility has become a common experience for people in most parts of the world. As the number of people moving to different cities, states, and countries increases, it is critical to understand how this residential mobility affects one's thoughts, emotions, and actions. Psychological research on residential mobility over a decade is such an endeavor. We briefly summarize the earlier research in psychology that demonstrated the importance of residential mobility in understanding important psychological constructs such as self-concepts, social relationships, and well-being. We then review recent evidence in psychology and relevant fields that replicated and extended the earlier research. We discuss what is missing in the current literature and what additional research is needed in the future.

AB  - During the menopausal period, sexual dysfunction is associated with the development or worsening of psychological conditions, causing deterioration in women's mental health and quality of life. This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of different exercise programs on sexual function and quality of sexual life related to menopausal symptoms. With this purpose, a systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Plus. A total of 1787 articles were identified in the initial search and 11 prospective studies (including 8 randomized controlled trials) were finally included. The most commonly recommended training programs are based on exercising pelvic floor muscles, as they seem to have the largest impact on sexual function. Mind-body disciplines also helped in managing menopausal symptoms. However, as far as the most traditional programs were concerned, aerobic exercises showed inconsistent results and resistance training did not seem to convey any benefits. Although positive effects have been found, evidence supporting physical exercise as a strategy to improve sexual function and quality of sexual life related to menopausal symptoms is limited, and further studies on this topic are needed.

AB  - A recently published correlational analysis has suggested a linear increase in the prevalence of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) as a function of increasing latitude. This was attributed to a misalignment of the circadian system leading to increased obsessive tendencies and perseverative thought. The present article sought to evaluate these claims in the data reported by those authors using a fully Bayesian meta-analytic approach testing both linear and non-linear effects. Findings were then validated against a sample of independently coded studies. Whereas re-analysis of the original data provided strong evidence in favour of a non-linear relation between latitude and OCD prevalence, analysis of the independently coded studies provided evidence against any statistical relation. In summary, the link between OCD prevalence and latitude is likely to be weaker than previously thought. Further research is required before firm conclusions can be drawn.

AB  - Calpain-1 and calpain-2 are involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways and neuronal functions in the brain. Our recent studies indicate that calpain-1 is required for hippocampal synaptic plasticity, including long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in field CA1. However, little is known regarding the contributions of calpain-1 to cerebellar synaptic plasticity. Low frequency stimulation (LFS, 5 Hz, 5 min)-induced LTP at parallel fibers to Purkinje cell synapses was markedly impaired in cerebellar slices from calpain-1 knock-out (KO) mice. Application of a selective calpain-2 inhibitor enhanced LFS-induced LTP in both wild-type (WT) and calpain-1 KO mice. Three protocols were used to induce LTD at these synapses: LFS (1 Hz, 15 min), perfusion with high potassium and glutamate (K-Glu) or dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a mGluR1 agonist. All three forms of LTD were impaired in calpain-1 KO mice. DHPG application stimulated calpain-1 but not calpain-2 in cerebellar slices, and DHPG-induced LTD impairment was reversed by application of a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, okadaic acid. As in hippocampus, BDNF induced calpain-1 activation and PH domain and Leucine-rich repeat Protein Phosphatase 1/suprachiasmatic nucleus oscillatory protein (PHLPP1/SCOP) degradation followed by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, as well as calpain-2 activation leading to degradation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) in cerebellar slices. The role of calpain-1 in associative learning was evaluated in the delay eyeblink conditioning (EBC). Calpain-1 KO mice exhibited significant learning impairment in EBC during the first 2 days of acquisition training. However, after 5 days of training, the percentage of conditioned responses (CRs) between calpain-1 KO and WT mice was identical. Both calpain-1 KO and WT mice exhibited typical extinction patterns. Our results indicate that calpain-1 plays critical roles in multiple forms of synaptic plasticity and associative learning in both hippocampus and cerebellum.

   Psychodynamic psychotherapy is increasingly adapted and used with individuals with intellectual disability (ID) and mental health difficulties. However, the evidence base is still small and largely based on case studies and small trials whose participants mainly have mild to moderate ID. This paper aims to review and critique the literature in regards to the adaptations; and the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy for those with severe and profound ID.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A systematic literature search of PsycINFO, Social Policy and Practice, Medline, Cumulative Index to nursing and allied health literature and applied social sciences index and abstracts was conducted. Six studies met inclusion criteria and underwent a quality evaluation and critical review.
   Findings
   Six papers (all case studies) met inclusion criteria and underwent a quality evaluation and critical review. Some adaptations to therapy were reported, such as a more flexible therapeutic frame and increased use of the physical environment as a therapeutic tool. Due to significant methodological weaknesses of the included studies, it is yet unclear whether psychodynamic psychotherapy is an effective intervention for individuals with severe and profound ID.
   Research limitations/implications - Only a small number of case studies met the inclusion criteria. Further research should use more robust outcome measures, larger samples and compare psychodynamic psychotherapy to alternative interventions.
   Originality/value
   This paper is the first to review the psychodynamic psychotherapy literature with regard to its effectiveness as a treatment specifically for individuals with severe and profound ID and mental health difficulties.

AB  - In the context of neurodegeneration and aging, the cerebellum is an enigma. Genetic markers of cellular aging in cerebellum accumulate more slowly than in the rest of the brain, and it generates unknown factors that may slow or even reverse neurodegenerative pathology in animal models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cerebellum shows increased activity in early AD and Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting a compensatory function that may mitigate early symptoms of neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Perhaps most notably, different parts of the brain accumulate neuropathological markers of AD in a recognized progression and generally, cerebellum is the last brain region to do so. Taken together, these data suggest that cerebellum may be resistant to certain neurodegenerative mechanisms.
   On the other hand, in some contexts of accelerated neurodegeneration, such as that seen in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) following repeated traumatic brain injury (TBI), the cerebellum appears to be one of the most susceptible brain regions to injury and one of the first to exhibit signs of pathology. Cerebellar pathology in neurodegenerative disorders is strongly associated with cognitive dysfunction. In neurodegenerative or neurological disorders associated with cerebellar pathology, such as spinocerebellar ataxia, cerebellar cortical atrophy, and essential tremor, rates of cognitive dysfunction, dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms increase. When the cerebellum shows AD pathology, such as in familial AD, it is associated with earlier onset and greater severity of disease. These data suggest that when neurodegenerative processes are active in the cerebellum, it may contribute to pathological behavioral outcomes.
   The cerebellum is well known for comparing internal representations of information with observed outcomes and providing real-time feedback to cortical regions, a critical function that is disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders such as intellectual disability, schizophrenia, dementia, and autism, and required for cognitive domains such as working memory. While cerebellum has reciprocal connections with non-motor brain regions and likely plays a role in complex, goal-directed behaviors, it has proven difficult to establish what it does mechanistically to modulate these behaviors. Due to this lack of understanding, it's not surprising to see the cerebellum reflexively dismissed or even ignored in basic and translational neuropsychiatric literature.
   The overarching goals of this review are to answer the following questions from primary literature: When the cerebellum is affected by pathology, is it associated with decreased cognitive function? When it is intact, does it play a compensatory or protective role in maintaining cognitive function? Are there theoretical frameworks for understanding the role of cerebellum in cognition, and perhaps, illnesses characterized by cognitive dysfunction? Understanding the role of the cognitive cerebellum in neurodegenerative diseases has the potential to offer insight into origins of cognitive deficits in other neuropsychiatric disorders, which are often underappreciated, poorly understood, and not often treated.

AB  - Background It is essential to provide comprehensive sexual and reproductive health (SRH) interventions to women affected by armed conflict, but there is a lack of evidence on effective approaches to delivering such interventions in conflict settings. This review synthesised the available literature on SRH intervention delivery in conflict settings to inform potential priorities for further research and additional guidance development. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using terms related to conflict, women and children, and SRH. We searched websites of 10 humanitarian organisations for relevant grey literature. Publications reporting on conflict-affected populations in low-income and middle-income countries and describing an SRH intervention delivered during or within 5 years after the end of a conflict were included. Information on population, intervention and delivery characteristics were extracted and narratively synthesised. Quantitative data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated, but no meta-analysis was undertaken. Results 110 publications met our eligibility criteria. Most focused on sub-Saharan Africa and displaced populations based in camps. Reported interventions targeted family planning, HIV/STIs, gender-based violence and general SRH. Most interventions were delivered in hospitals and clinics by doctors and nurses. Delivery barriers included security, population movement and lack of skilled health staff. Multistakeholder collaboration, community engagement and use of community and outreach workers were delivery facilitators. Reporting of intervention coverage or effectiveness data was limited. Discussion There is limited relevant literature on adolescents or out-of-camp populations and few publications reported on the use of existing guidance such as the Minimal Initial Services Package. More interventions for gender-based violence were reported in the grey than the indexed literature, suggesting limited formal research in this area. Engaging affected communities and using community-based sites and personnel are important, but more research is needed on how best to reach underserved populations and to implement community-based approaches.

AB  - (1) Background: Welding fumes (WFs) are composed of fine and ultrafine particles, which may reach the distal airways and represent a risk factor for respiratory diseases. (2) Methods: In vitro and in vivo studies to understand WFs pathogenesis were selected. Epidemiological studies, original articles, review, and meta-analysis to examine solely respiratory disease in welders were included. A systematic literature search, using PubMed, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Technical Information Center (NIOSHTIC), and Web of Science databases, was performed. (3) Results: Dose, time of exposure, and composition of WFs affect lung injury. Inflammation, lung defense suppression, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and genotoxic effects were observed after exposure both to mild and stainless steel WFs. (4) Conclusions: The detection of lung diseases associated with specific occupational exposure is crucial as complete avoidance or reduction of the exposure is difficult to achieve. Further studies in the area of particle research may aid the understanding of mechanisms involved in welding-related lung disease and to expand knowledge in welding-related cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Many neurological diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration. Early diagnosis and new markers are necessary for prompt therapeutic intervention. Several studies have aimed to identify biomarkers in different biological liquids. Furthermore, it is being considered whether saliva could be a potential biological sample for the investigation of neurodegenerative diseases. This work aims to provide an overview of the literature concerning biomarkers identified in saliva for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Specifically, the studies have revealed that is possible to quantify beta-amyloid(1-42) and TAU protein from the saliva of AD patients. Instead, alpha-synuclein and protein deglycase (DJ-1) have been identified as new potential salivary biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD. Nevertheless, future studies will be needed to validate these salivary biomarkers in the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

AB  - Aims and objectives: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the key findings of empirical studies assessing the influence of maternal depression on child attachment security measured before 24 months after birth. Method: The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. A literature search was conducted on the EBSCO (Academic Search Complete; Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition; MEDLINE; PsycARTICLES) and PubMed databases, with infant attachment AND depression as search terms with Boolean operators. Study design or sample size did not affect inclusion. After screening, 29 of the 1510 unique publications originally identified were included in the review. Results: The studies reveal an equivocal association between maternal depression and child attachment security. Our findings indicate that depression had a significant influence on the attachment style almost only when diagnosed by structured interview: Depression measured by self-descriptive questionnaires was unrelated to attachment style. Furthermore, postpartum depression was found to be significant only when measured up to six months after childbirth. Conclusion: The relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment is both complex and dynamic, and the possible negative effects of depression might be compensated by maternal involvement in childcare. Therefore, further studies in this area should employ a reliable methodology for diagnosing depression and a suitable time point for measuring it; they should also adopt a multifactorial and prospective approach. It is important to note that breastfeeding/formula feeding was omitted as a factor in the majority of studies.

AB  - A coronavirus pandemic has recently become one of the greatest threats the world is facing. Older adults are under a high risk of infection because of weaker immune systems. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent scientific evidence that outlines the effects of exercise on influenza or pneumonia in older adults. An electronic literature search was conducted using the WEB OF SCIENCE, SCIENCEDIRECT and GOOGLE SCHOLAR databases using the following keywords, "Exercise," "Older adult," "Influenza," and "Pneumonia." Any randomized control trials, cross-sectional and observational studies that related to this topic were all included. Twenty studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. Thirteen randomized control trials investigated the effects of exercise on the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination: seven trials employed moderate aerobic exercise, three employed resistance exercise, and the remaining three used Asian martial arts or special home-based exercises. Five cross-sectional and two observational studies examined the associations between exercise/physical condition and influenza/pneumonia. Most of the current studies suggested that prolonged moderate aerobic exercise may help to reduce the risk of influenza-related infection and improve the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination in older adults. In addition, training in traditional Asian martial arts was also found to be beneficial. Future research should focus on the different effects of moderate and vigorous exercise on influenza-related diseases.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that can affect individuals across the entire lifespan. Dysregulations of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits may contribute to the pathophysiology of this disorder. Previous studies have used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to detect neurometabolic abnormalities in the CSTC circuits of OCD patients. In this study, we systematically reviewed studies that used 3 Tesla H-1-MRS to investigate neurometabolite concentrations in OCD patients versus healthy controls. We also reviewed associations between neurometabolite concentrations and symptom severity and the effect of treatment. Out of the 1161 articles that were identified by our literature search, 22 articles met our inclusion criteria for this review. Most studies did not demonstrate any neurometabolite abnormalities in OCD patients compared with controls, but some mixed results were found depending on the region of interest. The most consistent findings showed lower gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and higher choline concentrations in the thalamus of adult OCD patients compared to controls. Glutamate concentrations decreased after treatment in one study, but not in another. Some studies reported a correlation between neurometabolite concentrations and symptom severity, but the direction of this relation remains unclear and might be dependent on the brain region. These results do not provide strong evidence for OCD-related neurometabolite abnormalities. Because of the inconsistent results and the large heterogeneity between studies, more research is needed to investigate the exact role of neurochemistry in OCD and the utility of 1H-MRS to study it.

AB  - Heavy metal (HM) stress is a major hazard, which significantly affects plant growth and development. In order to confront HM stress, plants directly or indirectly regulate the levels of endogenous nitric oxide (NO), a redox-related signaling molecule involved in wide range of plant growth and development as well as in response to HM stress. In addition, there is now compelling experimental evidence that NO usually mediates signaling processes through interactions with different biomolecules like phytohormones to regulate HM tolerance. Apart from phytohormones, NO partly operates through post-translational modification of proteins, notably via S-nitrosylation in response to HM stress. Recently, the roles of S-nitrosylation as a regulator of plant responses to HM stress and S-nitrosylated candidates have also been established and detected. Here, we describe the roles of NO in confronting HM phytotoxicity in plants with a particular focus on the presentation and discussion of recent data obtained in this field, which involves in the function of various phytohormones and S-nitrosylation during plant responses to HM stress. Additionally, both importance and challenges of future work are outlined in order to further elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying the roles of NO in plant responses to HM stress.

AB  - In the last few years, the occupational health (OH) of healthcare workers (HCWs) has been shown increasing concern by both health departments and researchers. This study aims to provide academics with quantitative and qualitative analysis of healthcare workers' occupational health (HCWs+OH) field in a joint way. Based on 402 papers published from 1992 to 2019, we adopted the approaches of bibliometric and social network analysis (SNA) to map and quantify publication years, research area distribution, international collaboration, keyword co-occurrence frequency, hierarchical clustering, highly cited articles and cluster timeline visualization. In view of the results, several hotspot clusters were identified, namely: physical injuries, workplace, mental health; occupational hazards and diseases, infectious factors; community health workers and occupational exposure. As for citations, we employed document co-citation analysis to detect trends and identify seven clusters, namely tuberculosis (TB), strength training, influenza, healthcare worker (HCW), occupational exposure, epidemiology and psychological. With the visualization of cluster timeline, we detected that the earliest research cluster was occupational exposure, then followed by epidemiology and psychological; however, TB, strength training and influenza appeared to gain more attention in recent years. These findings are presumed to offer researchers, public health practitioners a comprehensive understanding of HCWs+OH research.

AB  - Cellular communication processes are highly dynamic and mediated, at least in part, by contacts between various membrane structures. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the major biosynthetic organelle of the cell, establishes an extensive network with other membrane structures to regulate the transport of intracellular molecules. Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), an ER-localized metazoan-specific protein, plays important roles in the formation of autophagosomes and communication between the ER and other organelles, including mitochondria, autophagosome precursor membranes, Golgi, lipid droplets, and endosomes. Increasing evidence has indicated that autophagy and ER-membrane communication at membrane contact sites are closely related to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we summarize the roles of VMP1 in autophagy and ER-membrane contacts and discuss their potential implications in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Background: Child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) policy is essential for the rational development of mental health systems for children and adolescents. However, there is a universal lack of CAMH policy, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Therefore, this review aims to identify challenges and lessons for LMICs to develop and implement CAMH policy.
   Methods: PubMed (1781-), MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1966-), and PsycINFO (1895-) were searched from inception to December 31, 2018, for publications on CAMH policy development and/or implementation. Abstracts and main texts of articles were double screened, and extracted data were analyzed through thematic synthesis.
   Results: A total of 31 publications were included through the systematic review. Six major challenges were identified for CAMH policy in LMICs: (i) poor public awareness and low political willingness; (ii) stigma against mental disorders; (iii) biased culture values toward children, adolescents and CAMH, from developmental nihilism to medicalization; (iv) the lack of CAMH data and evidence, from service statistics to program evaluation; (v) the shortage of CAMH resources, including human resources, service facilities, and funding; and (vi) unintended consequence of international support, including reducing local responsibilities, planning fragmentation, and unsustainability. Six lessons to overcome challenges were summarized: (i) rethinking the concept of CAMH, (ii) encouraging a stand-alone CAMH policy and budget, (iii) involving stakeholders, (iv) reinforcing the role of research and researchers in policy process, (v) innovating the usage of human and service resources, and (vi) maximizing the positive influence of international organizations and non-governmental organizations.
   Conclusion: Many LMICs are still facing various challenges for their CAMH policy development and implementation. To overcome the challenges, great and long-term efforts are needed, which include great determination of from domestic and global agents, multidisciplinary innovations, and collaboration and coordination from different sectors.

AB  - Objectives Smoking has many deleterious consequences on health, one of which can be sleep-related issues. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed with the aim of pooling results from studies on the relationship between smoking and sleep-related issues. Methods The present study follows PRISMA guidelines. Databases were searched by both researchers to find the articles. The review was done up to December 2018. In order to analyze the results of the screened articles, statistical indexes were converted to logarithms and the studies were combined with each other. Finally, several analyses were conducted with respect to various subgroups. In the subgroup analysis, the pool index of the studies was determined and the degree of heterogeneity in each subgroup was presented. Meta-regression was also used. Results Smoking is associated with a risk of developing sleep-related issues. Risk ratio (1.47; 1.20-1.79) for smokers was higher than for non-smokers. Egger's test and Begg's test indicated publication bias. Conclusions Smoking is associated with sleep-related issues. Informing smokers about the effects of smoking on sleep issues can be effective in reducing and preventing its consequences.

AB  - That certain cell types in the central nervous system are more likely to undergo neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease is a widely appreciated but poorly understood phenomenon. Many vulnerable subpopulations, including dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, have a shared phenotype of large, widely distributed axonal networks, dense synaptic connections, and high basal levels of neural activity. These features come at substantial bioenergetic cost, suggesting that these neurons experience a high degree of mitochondrial stress. In such a context, mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control play an especially important role in maintaining neuronal survival. In this review, we focus on understanding the unique challenges faced by the mitochondria in neurons vulnerable to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's and summarize evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to disease pathogenesis and to cell death in these subpopulations. We then review mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control mediated by activation of PINK1 and Parkin, two genes that carry mutations associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease. We conclude by pinpointing critical gaps in our knowledge of PINK1 and Parkin function, and propose that understanding the connection between the mechanisms of sporadic Parkinson's and defects in mitochondrial quality control will lead us to greater insights into the question of selective vulnerability.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder, leading to both physical and social morbidity. Despite its importance, the etiology of schizophrenia remains poorly understood. Furthermore, its mainstream treatments fail to address all aspects of the disorder and are associated with significant side-effects. Recently, there has been growing interest in the relationship between the gut microbiome and mental health, including in schizophrenia. In this article, we review the existing evidence implicating dysbiosis in schizophrenia and discuss how the presumed dysbiosis could fit within known hypotheses of its pathogenesis, focusing on inflammation, tryptophan metabolites, and BDNF levels. We also evaluate the clinical potential of manipulating the gut microbiome with probiotics and prebiotics as adjunctive treatments in schizophrenia, based on existing clinical and pre-clinical studies. Overall, the current data showing microbiome alterations in schizophrenia are highly discrepant and insufficient to conclude whether microbiome changes are associated with increased risk of the disorder, or are simply the result of external factors or treatment. Despite some encouraging results of pro/prebiotic supplementation, there is also inconclusive evidence for their efficacy in schizophrenia. Thus, further research and more clinical trials are needed to test the validity of manipulating the gut microbiome to improve the treatment of this disorder.

AB  - Objective:
   Understanding the effects of benzodiazepines (BZDs) on maternal/fetal health remains incomplete despite their frequent use. This article quantifies the effects of antenatal BZD exposure on delivery outcomes.
   Methods:
   Data Sources:
   Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched till June 30, 2018.
   Study Selection:
   English-language cohort studies comparing antenatal BZD exposure to an unexposed group on any delivery outcome were eligible. In all, 23,909 records were screened, 56 studies were assessed, and 14 studies were included.
   Data Extraction:
   Two reviewers independently assessed quality and extracted data. Estimates were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. Sub-analyses examined several potential moderators including timing of exposure.
   Results:
   There were 9 outcomes with sufficient data for meta-analysis. Antenatal BZD exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of 6 outcomes initially: spontaneous abortion (pooled odds ratio = 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43 to 2.42), preterm birth (1.96; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.08), low birth weight (2.24; 95% CI, 1.41 to 3.88), low Apgar score (2.19; 95% CI, 1.94 to 2.47), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission (2.61; 95% CI, 1.64 to 4.14), and induced abortion (2.04; 95% CI, 1.23 to 3.40). There was significant heterogeneity between studies for most outcomes without consistent moderators. Birth weight (mean difference [MD]: -151.35 g; 95% CI, -329.73 to 27.03), gestational age (-0.49 weeks; 95% CI, -1.18 to 0.19), and small for gestational age (SGA; 1.42; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.01) did not show significant associations although after adjusting for publication bias, gestational age, and SGA became significant, totaling 8 significant outcomes.
   Conclusions:
   Antenatal BZD exposure appears to be statistically associated with increased risk of several adverse perinatal outcomes. Although confounds cannot be ruled out, NICU admission does appear clinically relevant and consistent with the antidepressant literature.

AB  - Background and Aims:
   The purpose is to highlight the legal and ethical principles that inspired the reform of mental health care in Italy, the only country to have closed its psychiatric hospitals. The article will also try to verify some macro-indicators of the quality of care and discuss the crisis that the mental health care system in Italy is experiencing.
   Methods:
   Narrative review.
   Results:
   The principal changes in the legislation on mental health care in Italy assumed an important role in the evolution of morals and common sense of the civil society of that country. We describe three critical points: first, the differences in implementation in the different Italian regions; second, the progressive lack of resources that cannot be totally attributed to the economic crisis and which has compromised application of the law; and finally, the scarce attention given to measurement of change with scientific methods.
   Conclusion:
   Italy created a revolutionary approach to mental health care in a historical framework in which it produced impressive cultural expressions in many fields. At that time, people were accustomed to 'believing and doing' rather than questioning results and producing research, and this led to underestimating the importance of a scientific approach. With its economic and cultural crisis, Italy has lost creativity as well as interest in mental health, which has been guiltily neglected. Any future humanitarian approach to mental health must take the Italian experience into account, but must not forget that verification is the basis for any transformation in health care culture.

AB  - The two main pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease are loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and proteinaceous amyloid fibrils composed mostly of alpha-synuclein, called Lewy pathology. Levodopa to enhance dopaminergic transmission remains one of the most effective treatment for alleviating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (Olanow, Mov Disord 34:812-815, 2019). In addition, deep brain stimulation (Bronstein et al., Arch Neurol 68:165, 2011) to modulate basal ganglia circuit activity successfully alleviates some motor symptoms. MRI guided focused ultrasound in the subthalamic nucleus is a promising therapeutic strategy as well (Martinez-Fernandez et al., Lancet Neurol 17:54-63, 2018). However, to date, there exists no treatment that stops the progression of this disease. The findings that alpha-synuclein can be released from neurons and inherited through interconnected neural networks opened the door for discovering novel treatment strategies to prevent the formation and spread of Lewy pathology with the goal of halting PD in its tracks. This hypothesis is based on discoveries that pathologic aggregates of alpha-synuclein induce the endogenous alpha-synuclein protein to adopt a similar pathologic conformation, and is thus self-propagating. Phase I clinical trials are currently ongoing to test treatments such as immunotherapy to prevent the neuron to neuron spread of extracellular aggregates. Although tremendous progress has been made in understanding how Lewy pathology forms and spreads throughout the brain, cell intrinsic factors also play a critical role in the formation of pathologic alpha-synuclein, such as mechanisms that increase endogenous alpha-synuclein levels, selective expression profiles in distinct neuron subtypes, mutations and altered function of proteins involved in alpha-synuclein synthesis and degradation, and oxidative stress. Strategies that prevent the formation of pathologic alpha-synuclein should consider extracellular release and propagation, as well as neuron intrinsic mechanisms.

AB  - Aim Studies have demonstrated that a majority of the decline in health status and functioning emerges during the first few years following the onset of psychosis. This knowledge led to the development of specialized early intervention services (EIS) targeting patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis (FEP). The central component of EIS is often assertive case management delivered by a multidisciplinary team, where an appointed key worker is responsible for coordinating treatment and delivering various psychosocial interventions to service users. The aim of this scoping review was to examine how key workers can enhance the physical health outcomes in people with FEP by addressing the factors associated with increased mortality in this population. Methods The scoping review framework comprised a five-stage process developed by Arksey and O'Malley. The search process was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Results A total of 27 studies conducted across 10 countries were analysed. These studies discussed the various ways in which key workers can mediate enhancements in the various factors contributing to the increased mortality rates in FEP patients. Conclusions A broad range of key worker-mediated outcomes was identified, which were broadly classified into three themes: influences on lifestyle, influences on effects of psychosis and influences on organizational barriers. Our findings suggest that key workers primarily mediated the amelioration of psychosis-induced effects and the reduction of organizational barriers. Further trials of key worker interventions to enhance physical health outcomes in this cohort are warranted.

AB  - Background Depression is one of the leading causes of the global burden of disease, and it has particularly negative consequences for elderly patients. Antidepressants are the most frequently used treatment. We present the first single-group meta-analysis examining: 1) the response rates of elderly patients to antidepressants, and 2) the determinants of antidepressants response in this population. Methods We searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials on antidepressants in the elderly with major depressive disorder above 65 years (last search: December 2017). Response was defined as 50% improvement on validated rating scales. We extracted response rates from studies and imputed the missing ones with a validated method. Data were pooled in a single-group meta-analysis. Additionally, several potential moderators of response to antidepressants were examined by subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Results We included 44 studies with a total of 6373 participants receiving antidepressants. On average, 50.7% of the patients reached a reduction of at least 50% on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed a better response to treatment for patients in antidepressant-controlled trials compared to placebo-controlled trials. Mean age, study duration, percentage of woman, severity of illness at baseline, dose of antidepressants in fluoxetine equivalents, year of publication, setting (in- or out-patients), antidepressant groups (SSRI, TCA, SSNRI, alpha 2-antagonist, SNRI, MAO-inhibitor), ITT (intention-to-treat) analysis vs completer analysis, sponsorship and overall risk of bias were not significant moderators of response. Conclusions Our findings suggest an improvement in symptoms can be found in about 50% of the elderly with major depressive disorder treated with antidepressants.

   Aims:
   The aim of this article was to provide a scoping review of the literature on the topic of users' choice, request of change and preferences for the PMHP in community mental health services.
   Method:
   A search of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and PsycINFO for papers in English was performed. Additional relevant research articles were identified through the authors' personal bibliography.
   Results:
   A total of 2,774 articles were screened and 38 papers were finally included. Four main aspects emerged: (1) the importance, for users, to be involved in the choice of their PMHP; (2) the importance, for users, of the continuity of care in the relationship with their PMHP; (3) factors of the user/PMHP dyad influencing users' preferences; and (4) the effect of choice on the treatment outcomes.
   Conclusion:
   While it is generally agreed that it is important to consider users' preferences in choosing or requesting to change their PMHP, little research on this topic is available. PMHPs' and other stakeholders' views should also be explored in order to discuss ethical and practical issues.

AB  - Ocean acidification and warming are two of the many threats to coral reefs worldwide, and Caribbean reef-building corals are especially vulnerable. However, even within the Caribbean, experimental acidification and warming studies reveal a wide array of coral calcification responses across reef systems and among species, complicating efforts to predict how corals will respond to these global-scale stressors. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the calcification responses of Caribbean corals to experimentally induced seawater ocean acidification, ocean warming, and the combination of both stressors. Calcification rates were reduced for corals reared under warming alone, but acidification and the combination of both stressors did not clearly reduce calcification rates. Calcification responses of corals collected from the Florida Keys and Belize were compared for regional differences since a greater number of studies were performed on corals collected from these two regions. Notably, corals from the Florida Keys did not exhibit reduced calcification under acidification, warming, or the combination of both stressors, while corals from Belize exhibited reduced calcification under warming alone. Further investigation of these regional trends suggests that the warming and acidification treatments employed dictated calcification responses, rather than collection region. Results from this meta-analysis are constrained by the very few studies that have been conducted within the Caribbean to assess ocean acidification and warming and the large variation in experimental procedure among studies. This meta-analysis reveals existing gaps in our understanding of how corals will likely respond to projected acidification and warming and highlights ways to improve comparability among experimental studies conducted on corals within the same region to better predict coral calcification response under global change.

AB  - To determine the effectiveness of workplace interventions and the most effective methodological design for the improvement of employee productivity, work ability, and absenteeism. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of workplace interventions was conducted (PROSPERO, CRD42018094083). The PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched. RCTs from 2000 to 2017 and with employees (18-65 years) were selected. Then, intervention characteristics and work-related outcomes data were extracted. A total of 47 RCTs were included in the systematic review, and 19 RCTs (11 absenteeism, 7 productivity, and 5 work ability) were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the effectiveness of workplace interventions for absenteeism was -1.56 (95% CI, -2.67 to -0.44) and -2.65 (95% CI, -4.49 to -0.81) considering only moderate quality RCTs. In contrast, only a few studies of workplace interventions for productivity and work ability were included, which was insufficient for determining the effectiveness and best design for improving these work outcomes. The workplace is an interesting environment to reduce absenteeism, and individualized and counseling interventions with <10 sessions/total were the most effective workplace intervention methodological design for reducing the absenteeism of employees. Future high-quality RCTs that also consider health risks should be implemented to strengthen the results.

AB  - Given concerns over the public and individual health status of modern society and the scarcity of research on mobility and the health nexus, taking a personalist perspective grounded in spillover theory integrated with broaden-and-build theory, this study uses preventive science ideology and explores the links between tourism and public health through the illustration of the effects of travel on people's personal, mental, and social well-being (PMS-web). A comprehensive review of the literature which is based on themes initiated from WHO (1948) statement: "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" was adopted. Physical, mental, and social (PMS) well-being and tourism/travel keywords were used to search top tier journal articles via the Web of Science and google scholars' search engines. Findings revealed that a positive linkage exists between travel/tourism and the PMS well-being of individuals that contribute considerably to their state of health per se and is vital to the public health in societies. Although the reviewed tourism literature includes plentiful studies on health/medical tourism or the health issues of host/guests, the lack of focus on the nexus of tourism and public health is sensible.

AB  - Iron overload due to repeated blood transfusions in beta-thalassemia patients or in predisposed diseases like hemochromatosis may prove lethal. Regulation and deposition of iron is a significant process, which is been explored extensively in the past decade. Iron deposition in the body can cause cellular dysregulation, including neuronal damage. Significant research has been conducted in understanding how iron accumulation in the brain leads to neurodegeneration. Iron chelators have been tested pre-clinically and are in clinical trials for determining their potential role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimeros (AD) and Parkinsontis (PD). It has been reported that iron chelators show promising effects pre-clinically in the amelioration of neurodegenerative disorders. In the clinical setup, the main challenge for any drug is to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) and to show therapeutic action. Smaller anti-oxidant molecules that cross BBB, can be expended for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. This review exclusively presents an assessment of original research articles published from year 2017-2019. It also addresses the mechanism of brain iron accumulation focusing more on AD and PD, their genetic predispositions, the detrimental effects of iron overload leading to neurodegeneration, iron-induced neuronal apoptosis and treatment strategies for the same.

AB  - The high rate of injuries occurring in agricultural activities is of major concern in most countries, despite the ever-increasing efforts made at normative levels. In particular, the use of agricultural tractors is recognized as the most hazardous activity for farmers due to the large number of fatalities occurring every year. The aim of the present study was to investigate the recent developments in research activities dealing with tractor safety. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was carried out, taking into account engineering journal papers appearing in Scopus in the 2009-2019 period and focusing on tractor safety. As a result, 79 documents were selected and analyzed based on both their type (e.g., conceptual or empirical studies) and specific targets. They were then classified and discussed in accordance with a reference framework representing the main issues of agricultural tractor safety: mechanical hazards, protective devices, command and control, other hazards, ergonomics, information, conformity, and user behavior. The results of this analysis brought to light the need for a more human-centered approach when dealing with tractor safety. In addition, the lack of a reliable framework of technical standards was also stressed. Overall, despite the limitations due to the selection criteria, this study represents the first systematic literature review depicting the status of tractor safety in the engineering field, providing a basis for further research on the emerging themes outlined.

AB  - Universal, unconditional basic income is attracting increasing policy and academic interest. Income is a key health determinant, and a basic income could affect health through its effect on other determinants, such as employment. However, there is little evidence of its potential effects on public health, because no studies of interventions which meet the definition of basic income have been done. However, there is evidence from studies of interventions with similarities to basic income. Therefore, we aimed to identify these studies and to consider what can be learned from them about the potential effects of such interventions on health and socioeconomic outcomes. We did a systematic scoping review of basic income-like interventions, searching eight bibliographic and eight specialist databases from inception to July, 2019, with extensive hand searching. We included publications in English of quantitative and qualitative studies done in upper-middle-income or high-income countries, of universal, permanent, or subsistence-level interventions providing unconditional payments to individuals or families. We sought to identify the range of outcomes reported by relevant studies, and report health, education, employment, and social outcomes. We extracted and tabulated relevant data and narratively reported effects by intervention and outcome. We identified 27 studies of nine heterogeneous interventions, some universal and permanent, and many evaluated using randomised controlled trials or robust quasi-experimental methods. Evidence on health effects was mixed, with strong positive effects on some outcomes, such as birthweight and mental health, but no effect on others. Employment effects were inconsistent, although mostly small for men and larger for women with young children. There was evidence of spill-over effects in studies measuring effects on large populations. In conclusion, little evidence exists of large reductions in employment, and some evidence suggests positive effects on some other outcomes, including health outcomes. Evidence for macro-level effects is scarce. Quasi-experimental and dynamic modelling approaches are well placed to investigate such effects.

AB  - Objective: This study provides an estimate of the effect size of suicide prevention interventions and evaluates the possible synergistic effects of multilevel interventions.
   Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted of controlled studies evaluating suicide prevention interventions versus control published between 2011 and 2017 in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment according to ROBINS criteria were performed by independent assessors. Cohen's delta was calculated by a random meta-analysis on completed and attempted suicides as outcomes. Meta-regression explored a possible synergistic effect in multilevel interventions. PROSPERO ID number: CRD42018094373.
   Results: The search yielded 16 controlled studies with a total of 252,932 participants. The meta-analysis was performed in 15 studies with 29,071 participants. A significant effect was found for suicide prevention interventions on completed suicides (d = -0.535, 95% CI -0.898; -0.171, p = .004) and on suicide attempts (d = -0.449, 95% CI -0.618; -0.280, p < .001). Regarding the synergistic effect of multilevel interventions, meta-regression showed a significantly higher effect related to the number of levels of the intervention (p = .032).
   Conclusions: Suicide prevention interventions are effective in preventing completed and attempted suicides and should be widely implemented. Further research should focus on multilevel interventions due to their greater effects and synergistic potential. Further research is also needed into risk appraisal for completed versus attempted suicide, as the preferred intervention strategy differs with regard to both outcomes.

AB  - Purpose The evidence base for peer support work in mental health is established, yet implementation remains a challenge. The aim of this systematic review was to identify influences which facilitate or are barriers to implementation of mental health peer support work. Methods Data sources comprised online databases (n = 11), journal table of contents (n = 2), conference proceedings (n = 18), peer support websites (n = 2), expert consultation (n = 38) and forward and backward citation tracking. Publications were included if they reported on implementation facilitators or barriers for formal face-to-face peer support work with adults with a mental health problem, and were available in English, French, German, Hebrew, Luganda, Spanish or Swahili. Data were analysed using narrative synthesis. A six-site international survey [Germany (2 sites), India, Israel, Tanzania, Uganda] using a measure based on the strongest influences was conducted. The review protocol was pre-registered (Prospero: CRD42018094838). Results The search strategy identified 5813 publications, of which 53 were included. Fourteen implementation influences were identified, notably organisational culture (reported by 53% of papers), training (42%) and role definition (40%). Ratings on a measure using these influences demonstrated preliminary evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of the identified influences. Conclusion The identified influences provide a guide to implementation of peer support. For services developing a peer support service, organisational culture including role support (training, role clarity, resourcing and access to a peer network) and staff attitudes need to be considered. The identified influences provide a theory base to prepare research sites for implementing peer support worker interventions.

TI  - A Review of Human Error in Marine Engine Maintenance
KW  - OPERATIONS
AB  - Maritime safety involves minimizing error in all aspects of the marine system. Human error has received much importance, being responsible for about 80% of the maritime accident worldwide. Currently, more attention has been focused to reduce human error in marine engine maintenance. On-board marine engine maintenance activities are often complex, where seafarers conduct maintenance activities in various marine environmental (i.e. extreme weather, ship motions, noise, and vibration) and operational (i.e. work overload and stress) conditions. These environmental and operational conditions, in combination with generic human error tendencies, results in innumerable forms of error. There are numerous accidents that happened due to the human error during the maintenance activities of a marine engine. The most severe human error results in accidents due to is a loss of life. Moreover, there are other consequences too such as delaying the productivity of marine operations which results in the financial loss. This study reviews methods that are currently available for identifying, reporting and managing human error in marine engine maintenance. As a basis for this discussion, authors provide an overview of approaches for investigating human error, and a description of marine engine maintenance activities and environmental and operational characteristics.

AB  - Previous observational epidemiological studies have reported inconsistent findings regarding the association between anemia and the risk of maternal depression. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between anemia and the risk of maternal depression using a meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the bibliographies of relevant articles in May 2019. Three evaluators independently reviewed and selected the eligible studies based on the predetermined selection criteria. A random-effects model was employed to calculate meta-estimates of the association between anemia and maternal depression. Of the 1305 articles, 15 observational epidemiological studies (five case-control studies and 10 cohort studies) were included in the final analysis. A total of 32,792,378 women were included. Anemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of maternal depression in the random-effects meta-analysis of 15 studies (OR/RR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.32-1.78). The association was consistent in both antepartum (OR/RR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.07-1.72) and postpartum depression (OR/RR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.32-1.78). Subgroup meta-analyses based on definition of anemia, definition of depression, and methodological quality reported consistent findings. The current meta-analysis showed that anemia was associated with an increased risk of maternal depression.

AB  - Objective: Sleep problems are transdiagnostic symptoms that confer significant risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) in adults. However, less is known about the sleep-STB association in adolescence-a developmental period when rates of STBs increase drastically, and sleep problems may be particularly pernicious. This article provides a systematic review of research on the sleep-STB association in youth, an overview of changes in sleep regulation during adolescence that may make sleep problems particularly detrimental for youth, and a discussion of the clinical implications of the sleep-STB association for hospitalized youth.
   Method: The systematic review included all longitudinal studies in which sleep problems were examined as prospective predictors of STBs in adolescents (aged 10-24 years). The search was conducted on December 1, 2017 using PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science databases.
   Results: Ten studies qualified for inclusion in this review. Of these, seven studies found at least one type of sleep problem significantly predicted a STB outcome.
   Conclusions: Although findings are mixed, growing research suggests that sleep problems may be a unique risk factor for STBs in youth. Sleep problems may be particularly important intervention target because they are easily assessed across healthcare settings and are amenable to treatment.

AB  - Individuals with chronic pain are at an elevated risk of suicide, yet psychosocial factors that might be involved in increasing or decreasing vulnerability for suicidal ideation and behaviour have received little attention. Extant literature on the topic of suicide in individuals with chronic pain incorporates only a few of the wide array of known vulnerability and protective factors. This Review focuses on transdiagnostic psychological processes, (ie, those of relevance for both chronic pain and suicide). We reviewed a selection of published literature on chronic pain and suicide, concentrating on previously unexplored and underexplored lines of research, including future orientation, mental imagery, and psychological flexibility. A greater degree of crosspollination between the fields of chronic pain and suicide research is required to progress our understanding of why some people with chronic pain become suicidal and others do not.

AB  - Although effective treatments exist, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is, according to the views of patients and experts, still associated with chronicity, a term with no clear and consistent definition. To improve patient care and to foster research, a clear distinction between the various concepts of chronicity cited in the literature is crucial. The aim was thus to explicate central concepts related to courses and trajectories in OCD based on an explorative, scoping search of the existing literature. Our review revealed a considerable lack in content validity, as the concepts were operationalized inconsistently. Concepts related to symptom improvement were (complete) recovery, partial/full remission and partial/full response. Terms used in relation with symptom stability or worsening were chronic/continuous, intermittent and episodic course, waxing and waning, relapse, recurrence, deterioration and treatment-refractoriness. All concepts are explained and visualized as a result of the review. Further, based on authors' remarks, we present recommendations on how to enhance care for chronic OCD patients, namely training psychotherapists to apply CBT as intended, managing patient beliefs about disease and treatment, and adapting psychotherapy to OCD subtypes. Finally, we then propose a literature-based definition of treatment-refractory OCD.

AB  - Despite a growing body of research on the association between psychosis and homicide and between psychosis and sexual offending, research on psychosis and sexual homicide is limited. The objective of this review was to estimate the prevalence of psychosis in sexual homicide and to explore the extent to which prior research has investigated symptoms of psychosis as a motivating or causal variable leading to incidents of sexual homicide. We hypothesized that psychosis is present in a minority of sexual homicide cases. Articles were identified by searching literature databases (i.e., PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE) and references of relevant articles. Eight studies were included. The overall prevalence of psychosis among individuals who committed sexual homicide ranged from 0 to 27 percent as measured in a broad array of diverse samples. Given that five of the eight studies reported psychosis rates to be five percent or less, our findings suggest that psychosis occurs in a minority of sexual homicide cases. None of the studies directly examined the causal or motivational properties of psychosis in driving these types of offenses, and this represents an important area of inquiry for future research.

AB  - Obtaining sufficient sleep is a protective factor against mental and physical ill-health. However, evidence suggests that, among adolescents, the proliferation of mobile devices has contributed to a decline in sleep quality and duration over the past few decades. There is a paucity of research on the relationship between sleep and problematic smartphone use. Of the studies which have researched this association, all have relied on homogeneous samples within specific cultural contexts. Therefore, this systematic review provides an aggregative, critical review of the relationship between sleep and problematic smartphone use. Following a comprehensive search of academic databases, nine studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. These studies were then evaluated for methodological quality, methodological relevance and relevance to the current research question in line with Gough's (2007) Weight of Evidence framework. Evidence was found for a weak-to-moderate correlation between sleep quality and quantity and problematic smartphone use. Although this systematic review elucidates the relationship between sleep and problematic smartphone use, the findings must be considered tentative until the relationship between these variables is researched using objective measures and experimental designs.

AB  - This article presents a critical reflection on the conceptual perspectives in mental health, in the quest for new meanings for this concept and its implications in the context of achieving peace in Colombia. For this, an integrative review of the literature was conducted in seven bibliographic databases and search engines. As a result, five conceptual perspectives of mental health were identified: 1) biomedical and behavioral; 2) wellbeing and its potential; 3) cultural; 4) psychosocial; and 5) based on social determination, the epistemological foundations, contributions, criticisms, and limitations of which are described in each case. Finding more pertinence in the proposal of mental health from collective health/social medicine rather than from the classic public health for achieving peace in Colombia, a comprehensive view of mental health that takes into account its socio-cultural relevance from a critical and socio-historical position is proposed.

AB  - Iron is essential for brain development and health where its redox properties are used for a number of neurological processes. However, iron is also a major driver of oxidative stress if not properly controlled. Brain iron distribution is highly compartmentalised and regulated by a number of proteins and small biomolecules. Here, we examine heterogeneity in regional iron levels in 10 anatomical structures from seven post-mortem human brains with no apparent neuropathology. Putamen contained the highest levels, and most case-to-case variability, of iron compared with the other regions examined. Partitioning of iron between cytosolic and membrane bound iron was generally consistent in each region, with a slightly higher proportion (55 %) in the 'insoluble' phase. We expand on this using the Allen Human Brain Atlas to examine patterns between iron levels and transcriptomic expression of iron regulatory proteins and using quantitative size exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to assess regional differences in the molecular masses to which cytosolic iron predominantly binds. Approximately 60 % was associated with ferritin, equating to approximately 25 % of total tissue iron essentially in storage. This study is the first of its kind in human brain tissue, providing a valuable resource and new insight for iron biologists and neuroscientists, alike.

AB  - Safinamide is an approved drug for the treatment of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD). Scarce data are available on its use in clinical practice. A group of Spanish movement disorders specialists was convened to review the use of safinamide across different clinical scenarios that may guide neurologists in clinical practice. Eight specialists with recognized expertise in PD management elaborated the statements based on available evidence in the literature and on their clinical experience. The RAND/UCLA method was carried, with final conclusions accepted after a 2-round modified Delphi process. Higher level of agreement between panellists was reached for the following statements. Safinamide significantly improves mean daily OFF time without troublesome dyskinesias. Adjunctive treatment with safinamide is associated with motor improvements in patients with mid-to-late PD. The efficacy of safinamide on motor fluctuations is maintained at long-term, with no increase over time in dyskinesias severity. The clinical benefits of safinamide on pain and depression remain unclear. Safinamide presents a similar incidence of adverse events compared with placebo. The efficacy and safety of safinamide shown in the pivotal clinical trials are reproduced in clinical practice, with improvement of parkinsonian symptoms, decrease of daily OFF time, control of dyskinesias at the long term, and good tolerability and safety.

AB  - Background: The neurodevelopmental effects of high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) in children are well established. To what extent such effects exist at low-to-moderate doses is unclear. Considering the increasing exposure of the general population to low-to-moderate levels of IR, predominantly from diagnostic procedures, the study of these effects has become a priority for radiation protection.
   Objectives: We conducted a systematic review of the current evidence for possible effects of low-to-moderate IR doses received during gestation, childhood and adolescence on different domains of neurodevelopment.
   Data sources: Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and Psychinfo on the 6th of June 2017 and repeated in December 2018.
   Study eligibility criteria: We included studies evaluating the association between low-to-moderate IR doses received during gestation, childhood and adolescence, and neurodevelopmental functions.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies were evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool adapted to environmental sciences. A qualitative synthesis was performed.
   Results: A total of 26 manuscripts were finally selected. Populations analyzed in these publications were exposed to the following sources of IR: atomic bomb (Hiroshima and Nagasaki), diagnostic/therapeutic radiation, and Chernobyl and nuclear weapon testing fallout.
   There was limited evidence for an association between low-to-moderate doses of IR and a decrease in general cognition and language abilities, that is, a causal interpretation is credible, but chance or confounding cannot not be ruled out with reasonable confidence. Evidence for a possible stronger effect when exposure occurred early in life, in particular, during the fetal period, was inadequate. Evidence for an association between IR and other specific domains, including attention, executive function, memory, processing speed, visual-spatial abilities, motor and socio-emotional development, was inadequate, due to the very limited number of studies found.
   Limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings: Overall, depending on the domain, there was limited to inadequate evidence for an effect of low-to-moderate IR doses on neurodevelopment. Heterogeneity across studies in terms of outcome and exposure assessment hampered any quantitative synthesis and any stronger conclusion. Future research with adequate dosimetry and covering a range of specific neurodevelopmental outcomes would likely contribute to improve the body of evidence.
   Systematic review registration number: The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42018091902).

AB  - Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) has attracted wide attention as a serious clinical problem. So far, the field has accumulated a large amount of scientific research literature. To clarify the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of research resources, knowledge bases and research focuses, a visual analysis was performed on 5814 articles cited in the WoS databases from 2004 to 2019. This analysis was based on bibliometrics and mapping knowledge domain (MKD) analysis with VOSviewer, and CiteSpace 5.4.R4. The results can be elaborated from four aspects. First, the volume of publications in this area is on the rise. Second, the United States and China are the active regions. The USA is the central region of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion research. Third, the knowledge bases of IR have focused on five major areas of "Suitable small-animal models", "A framework with further study", "Molecular signaling targets by oxidative stress", "Finding new potential targets for therapy" and "Protective effect of multiple transient ischemia". Fourth, the research focuses consist of three representative areas: "Oxidative stress closelyd with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion", "Neuronal apoptosis and neuronal protection", and "Neuroprotective effect of the blood-brain barrier".

AB  - Synchrotron radiation (SR), as a result of its high-intensity, brilliant, monochromatic, and collimated beams, is becoming one of the most crucial components of research in various fields of materials science such as nanomaterials, biomaterials, and energy materials. SR-based characterization methods can be employed to analyze different systems such as powders, thin films, and bulk forms having complex crystalline or amorphous structures. In this review, peculiarities of SR are briefly explained. Moreover, various techniques carried out utilizing this instrument for material characterization such as X-ray powder diffraction, grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction, small/wide-angle X-ray scattering, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, different techniques of X-ray imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray microprobes/nanoprobes are presented. As a result, by shedding light on the advantages of SR and its superiority to the equivalent laboratory experiments, researchers are recommended to exploit the capabilities of this invaluable tool in their materials characterization.

AB  - Different animal and human studies from last two decades in the case of Parkinson's disease (PD) have concentrated on oxidative stress due to increased inflammation and cytokine-dependent neurotoxicity leading to induction of dopaminergic (DA) degeneration pathway in the nigrostriatal region. Chronic inflammation, the principle hallmark of PD, forms the basis of neurodegeneration. Aging in association with activation of glia due to neuronal injury, perhaps because of immune alterations and genetic predispositions, leads to deregulation of inflammatory pathways premising the onset of PD. A family of inducible transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), is found to show expression in various cells and tissues, such as microglia, neurons, and astrocytes which play an important role in activation and regulation of inflammatory intermediates during inflammation. Both canonical and non-canonical NF-kappa B pathways are involved in the regulation of the stimulated cells. During the prodromal/asymptomatic stage of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., PD and AD), chronic neuroinflammation may act silently as the driver of neuronal dysfunction. Though research has provided an insight over age-related neurodegeneration in PD, elaborative role of NF-kappa B in neuroinflammation is yet to be completely understood and thus requires more investigation. Polyphenols, a group of naturally occurring compound in medicinal plants, have gained attention because of their anti-oxidative and anti-neuroinflammatory properties in neurodegenerative diseases. In this aspect, this review highlights the role of NF-kappa B and the possible therapeutic roles of polyphenols in NF-kappa B-mediated neuroinflammation in PD.

   Methods: A literature search was conducted on Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wan Fang to identify relevant studies.
   Results: Seven studies, which enrolled a total of 1218 heart failure patients, were included in this review. These articles investigating the relationship between sleep and cognitive performance in patients with heart failure had inconsistent results. Five studies confirmed that sleep quality and insomnia were significantly associated with cognitive function, including global cognition, attention, and executive function, whereas the other two studies indicated no statistically significant relationship between sleep and cognitive function.
   Conclusion: Although limited evidence restricts the overall conclusions, this review might provide new opportunities to identify patients with heart failure that are at high risk for cognitive decline. Further studies across a longer period are needed to confirm the relationship between sleep and cognitive function in patients with heart failure.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can compromise health and may be more prevalent amongst individuals with gender dysphoria (GD). Symptoms such as attention or social difficulties can impact assessment of GD, understanding of health information, and engagement in clinical care. To ensure neurodevelopmental conditions are adequately considered in gender health services, we aimed to systematically review the literature examining the prevalence of ASD and ADHD amongst individuals with GD. In this systematic review based on the PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies examining the prevalence of ASD and/or ADHD in individuals with GD or investigated the rate of GD in cohorts with ASD or ADHD. All English peer-reviewed publications were included. The search strategy identified 179 studies. After applying exclusion criteria, a total of 30 studies were identified, 22 studies which examined the prevalence of ASD or ADHD in people with GD. A further 8 studies examined the reverse; prevalence of GD in people with ASD. The few studies employing diagnostic criteria for ASD suggest a prevalence of 6-26% in transgender populations, higher than the general population, but no different from individuals attending psychiatry clinics. Few studies examine prevalence of ADHD. Low-level evidence exists to suggest a link between ASD and GD. Further population-based and controlled studies using diagnostic criteria for ASD and ADHD are required.

AB  - Background Mental illness poses a large and growing disease burden worldwide. Its management is increasingly provided by primary care. The prescribing of psychotropic drugs in general practice has risen in recent decades, and variation in prescribing rates has been identified by a number of studies. It is unclear which factors lead to this variation. Aim To describe the variables that cause variation in prescribing rates for psychotropic drugs between general practices. Methods A narrative review was conducted in January 2018 by searching electronic databases using the PRISMA statement. Studies investigating causal factors for variation in psychotropic prescribing between at least two general practice sites were eligible for inclusion. Results Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Prescribing rates varied considerably between practices. Positive associations were found for many variables, including social deprivation, ethnicity, patient age and gender, urban location, co-morbidities, chronic diseases and GP demographics. However studies show conflicting findings, and no single regression model explained more than 57% of the variation in prescribing rates. Discussion There is no consensus on the factors that most predict prescribing rates. Most research was conducted in countries with central electronic databases, such as the United Kingdom; it is unclear whether these findings apply in other healthcare systems. More research is needed to determine the variables that explain prescribing rates for psychotropic medications.

AB  - Objective: Problems in childhood and adolescence are often present with recurring physical signs of illness, called somatoform symptoms. These symptoms are a common reason for consultation at both paediatric care and psychotherapeutic/psychiatric praxis. We propose that attachment is a possible predictive factor. This article provides a systematic overview of the existing research literature concerning the relationship between attachment and somatoform symptoms in children and adolescents.
   Methods: A systematic search for empirical articles from 1990 up to August 2018 focusing on this association was conducted. Out of six databases, 4994 studies were detected by using defined keywords. One study was added identified by checking reference lists. Finally, 15 studies were selected, which were the bases for the narrative review. Ten studies were included in meta-analysis.
   Results: Combining study results, we found that attachment cannot solely predict somatoforrn symptoms. Mixed results are shown. The quantitative analysis substantiated these narrative results, revealing a small but significant combined effect size of Delta approximate to .12 (95% CI .04-.19).
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that a relationship exists, but further investigations need to demonstrate that these are not only superficial. There are many developmental factors that affect the relationship between attachment and somatoform symptoms in children and adolescents. Further research should explore this interplay in order to gain a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to these correlations and to discover possible predicting factors.

AB  - Pictorial symbols have multiple layers of meaning: not only do they represent objects, events and ideas about the world, they also represent the intentions of artists as well as other artist attributes (age, skill, originality and knowledge, mood, style and sentience). Although children's developmental milestones of pictorial understanding have been extensively studied, their understanding of the relation between artists and pictures has often been neglected. The aim of this article was to conduct a systematic review on children's and adolescents' understanding of the relation between artists and pictures. PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were searched for English, Spanish, German, and Italian language empirical studies that examined this link in 2- to 18-year-olds. Forty-two citations (64 studies) from 14 different countries met the inclusion criteria. Results revealed the majority of the studies focused on the understanding of the artist's intention. Although research on children's and adolescents' understanding of other attributes is scarce, and there were inconsistencies across the methodologies used, it seems that they first acknowledge intention and only later become more aware of how artist's attributes are communicated through intention. The results of the review encourage subsequent research to provide a clearer conceptualised model of child and adolescent understanding of the artist-picture relationship. Such a model should be placed within a wider framework of the network of relationship between the artist, picture, world and beholder. Finally, consideration of how the development of understanding the artist-picture relationship is bi-directionally influenced with other developmental milestones in the child psychology is encouraged, particularly picture-production and theory of mind, and variations in atypical populations.

AB  - Effectiveness of N might be modified in rice cultivation under future climate change with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]). At present, limited information is available to understand how plant N uptake and N use efficiency respond to elevated [CO2] and/or temperature in Chinese double rice cropping systems. A four-year field experiment was therefore conducted using open-top chambers with varying [CO2] (ambient, ambient +60 mu mol mol(-1)) and varying temperature (ambient, ambient +2 degrees C) in Hubei Province, Central China. Compared with ambient conditions, elevated [CO2] increased plant N uptake and N use efficiency, as measured by fertilizer N recovery efficiency (NRE), N agronomic efficiency (NAE), N physiological efficiency (NPE) and apparent system N use efficiency (NUEsys), in both early rice and late rice. CO2 enrichment tended to decrease soil mineral N concentration since more N was assimilated by plants. Elevated temperature led to lower plant N uptake and decreased NRE and NAE in early rice, clue to a reduction in grain yield induced by heat injury. In contrast, warming increased plant N uptake and N use efficiency in late rice as no heat stress existed. Warming tended to increase soil mineral N concentration in early rice but had negligible effects in late rice. When elevated [CO2] and temperature were combined, the positive effects of CO2 enrichment for N utilization were able to compensate for the negative effects of warming in early rice, while the interaction was synergetic in late rice. Hence, co-elevation of [CO2] and temperature led to higher N use efficiency (64.6% for NUEsys across four years) and decreased annual N surplus by 23.6-36.5 kg N ha(-1) compared with ambient conditions. Our findings confirm that CO2 enrichment and air warming can improve N use efficiency at both crop level and system level in Chinese double rice cultivation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The association between incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) Of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and exposure to outdoor air pollution is under debate. We aimed to examine this relationship based on a systematic review with random-eftects meta-analysis.
   Methods: We screened the literature on long-term air pollution exposure assessment in the general population using an electronic search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to 20 October 2019. Observational studies investigating the association between long-term exposure to gaseous (CO, SO2, NO2, O-3) or particulate (PM2.5 or PM10) outdoor air pollutants and CKD, ESRD, or renal dysfunction were included, and summary risks were estimated.
   Results: Of 4419 identified articles, 23 met our inclusion criteria after screening and 14 were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled effect estimates had the following summary risk ratios (RRs) for CKD: 1.10 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.00, 1.21; derived from four studies) per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 and 1.16 (95% CI 1.05, 1.29; derived from four studies) for PM10; 131 (95% CI 0.36, 2.00; derived from two studies) per 10 ppm increase in CO; and 1.11 (95% CI 1.09, 1.14; derived from three studies) per 10 ppb increase in NO2. For the pooled effect on eGFR, increases in PM10 to and PM2.5 (of 10 mu g/m(2)) were associated with eGFR decline by -0.83 (95% CI -1.54, -0.12; derived from two studies) and -4.11 (95% CI -12.64, 4.42; derived from two studies) mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively.
   Conclusions: Air pollution was observed to be associated with CKD and renal function clecline. Although more longitudinal studies are required, we argue that air pollution is pernicious to kidney health. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Status epilepticus (SE) is a common neurologic emergency. The present study constitutes a meta-analysis of published randomized control trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of intravenous sodium valproate (VPA) in SE. Methods: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were comprehensively searched, while retrieved RCTs and meta-analyses were manually screened. Prespecified outcome measures included seizure-cessation, 24 h-efficacy, constitute (liver enzyme increase, arrhythmias, bone-marrow suppression, hypotension and respiratory depression) and severe (life-threatening) adverse events (AEs). Evidence synthesis was performed when appropriate, using Random-Effects (RE) or Fixed-Effects (FE) model based on heterogeneity between trials (homogeneity assumed when PQ > 0.1 and I-2 < 50%). Outcomes were assessed using Odds-Ratios (ORs) and 95%Confidence-Intervals (95% CIs). Every available comparison was investigated in terms of efficacy and tolerability. Results:Thirteen studies were retrieved and five comparisons were available, four of which involved two or more studies. Results were compatible with no significant difference between VPA and Phenytoin both in terms of efficacy and tolerability [seizure-cessation: FE-OR = 1.99, 95% CI = (0.83-4.75), 24 h-efficacy: FE-OR = 1.32, 95% CI = (0.60-2.89), composite AEs: FE-OR = 0.45, 95% CI = (0.17-1.21)]. Phenobarbital proved more commonly associated with composite AEs than VPA [seizure-cessation: RE-OR = 0.68, 95% CI = (0.05-9.44), 24 h-efficacy: RE-OR = 0.88, 95% CI = (0.02-33.9), composite AEs: FE-OR = 0.26, 95% CI = (0.09-0.82), severe AEs: FE-OR = 0.30, 95% CI = (0.04-2.28)]. Diazepam was determined inferior to VPA concerning safety issues [seizure-termination: FE-OR = 0.77, 95% CI = (0.34-1.79), severe respiratory depression: FE-OR = 0.06, 95% CI = (0.01-0.48), severe hypotension: FE-OR = 0.09, 95% CI = (0.01-0.72)]. The combination of Lorazepam (LZP) with VPA and the combination of LZP with Levetiracetam presented no difference in efficacy [24h-efficacy: FE-OR = 0.68, 95% CI = (0.37-1.24)]. Conclusions: Although, additional high-quality RCTs are warranted, according to our results, VPA can be considered a safe and effective option in the management of SE.

AB  - Rapid ocean warming due to climate change poses a serious risk to the survival of coral reefs. It is estimated that 70-90 percent of all reefs will be severely degraded by mid-century even if the 1.5 degrees C goal of the Paris Climate Agreement is achieved. However, one coral reef ecosystem seems to be more resilient to rising sea temperatures than most others. The Red Sea's reef ecosystem is one of the longest continuous living reefs in the world, and its northernmost portion extends into the Gulf of Aqaba. The scleractinian corals in the Gulf have an unusually high tolerance for the rapidly warming seawater in the region. They withstand water temperature anomalies that cause severe bleaching or mortality in most hard corals elsewhere. This uniquely resilient reef employs biological mechanisms which are likely to be important for coral survival as the planet's oceans warm. The Gulf of Aqaba could potentially be one of the planet's largest marine refuges from climate change. However, this unique portion of the Red Sea's reef will only survive and flourish if serious regional environmental challenges are addressed. Localized anthropogenic stressors compound the effects of warming seawater to damage corals and should be mitigated immediately. Reefs in the rest of the Red Sea are already experiencing temperatures above their thermal tolerance and have had significant bleaching, though they too would benefit from fewer local anthropogenic stressors. The countries bordering the entire Red Sea will need to cooperate to enable effective scientific research and conservation. The newly established Transnational Red Sea Center, based at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), can serve as the regionally inclusive, neutral organization to foster crucial regional scientific collaboration.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) technology, which is amongst the most used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques currently available, has developed rapidly from 2009 to 2018. However, reports on the trends of rTMS using bibliometric analysis are rare. The goal of the present bibliometric analysis is to analyze and visualize the trends of rTMS, including general (publication patterns) and emerging trends (research frontiers), over the last 10 years by using the visual analytic tool CiteSpace V. Publications related to rTMS from 2009 to 2018 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database, including 2,986 peer-reviewed articles/reviews. Active authors, journals, institutions, and countries were identified by WoS and visualized by CiteSpace V, which could also detect burst changes to identify emerging trends. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to analyze the time trend of annual publication outputs. The USA ranked first in this field. Pascual-Leone A (author A), Fitzgerald PB (author B), George MS (author C), Lefaucheur JP (author D), and Fregni F (author E) made great contributions to this field of study. The most prolific institution to publish rTMS-related publications in the last decade was the University of Toronto. The journal Brain Stimulation published most papers. Lefaucheur et al.'s paper in 2014, and the keyword "sham controlled trial" showed the strongest citation bursts by the end of 2018, which indicates increased attention to the underlying work, thereby indicating the research frontiers. This study reveals the publication patterns and emerging trends of rTMS based on the records published from 2009 to 2018. The insights obtained have reference values for the future research and application of rTMS.

AB  - The critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD), is well established. Compelling evidence indicates that Parkinson's proteins (e.g., alpha-synuclein, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, and LRRK2) are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in PD. Significantly, there is a possible central role of alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) in the occurrence of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress by the mediation of different signaling pathways. Also, tau, traditionally considered as the main component of neurofibrillary tangles, aggregates and amplifies the neurotoxic effects on mitochondria by interacting with alpha-Syn. Moreover, oxidative stress caused by mitochondrial dysfunction favors assembly of both alpha-Syn and tau and also plays a key role in the formation of protein aggregates. In this review, we provide an overview of the relationship between these two pathological proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction in PD, and also summarize the underlying mechanisms in the interplay of alpha-Syn aggregation and phosphorylated tau targeting the mitochondria, to find new strategies to prevent PD processing.

Paediatric medical psychologists address a myriad of problems by employing evidence-based evaluations and interventions in order to support the well-being of paediatric patients and their families. In this paper, we provide an overview of paediatric medical psychology including the education and training required to be a paediatric psychologist followed by common problems addressed by paediatric psychology, the settings paediatric psychologists work in, and the services they provide. Discussion concludes with future application of integrating paediatric psychology throughout the continuum of care to optimise adjustment and health of paediatric patients.

AB  - Autism research is heavily skewed toward western high-income countries. Culturally appropriate screening and diagnostic instruments for autism are lacking in most low- and middle-income settings where the majority of the global autism population lives. To date, a clear overview of the possible cultural and contextual factors that may affect the process of identifying and diagnosing individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is missing. This study aims to outline these factors by proposing a conceptual framework. A multidisciplinary review approach was applied to inform the development of the conceptual framework, combining a systematic review of the relevant autism research literature with a wider literature search spanning key texts in global mental health, cultural psychiatry, cross-cultural psychology, and intellectual disability research. The resulting conceptual framework considers the identification, help-seeking, and diagnostic process at four interrelated levels: (a) the expression; (b) recognition; (c) interpretation; and (d) reporting of autism symptoms, and describes the cultural and contextual factors associated with each of these levels, including cultural norms of typical and atypical behavior, culture-specific approaches to parenting, mental health literacy, cultural beliefs, attitudes and stigma, as well as the affordability, availability, accessibility, and acceptability of services. This framework, mapping out the cultural and contextual factors that can affect the identification, help-seeking, and diagnosis of ASD may function as a springboard for the development of culturally appropriate autism screening and diagnostic instruments, and inform future cross-cultural autism research directions. The framework also has relevance for clinicians and policy makers aiming to improve support for underserved autism populations worldwide.
   Lay Summary The vast majority of autism research is conducted in western high-income settings. We therefore know relatively little of how culture and context can affect the identification, help-seeking, and diagnosis of autism across the globe. This study synthesizes what is known from the autism research literature and a broader literature and maps out how culture and context may affect (a) the expression, (b) recognition, (c) interpretation, and (d) reporting of autism symptoms.

AB  - Seagrasses provide multiple ecosystem services including nursery habitat, improved water quality, coastal protection, and carbon sequestration. However, seagrasses are in crisis as global coverage is declining at an accelerating rate. With increased focus on ecological restoration as a conservation strategy, methods that enhance restoration success need to be explored. Decades of work in coastal plant ecosystems, including seagrasses, has shown that positive species relationships and feedbacks are critical for ecosystem stability, expansion, and recovery from disturbance. We reviewed the restoration literature on seagrasses and found few studies have tested for the beneficial effects of including positive species interactions in seagrass restoration designs. Here we review the full suite of positive species interactions that have been documented in seagrass ecosystems, where they occur, and how they might be integrated into seagrass restoration. The few studies in marine plant communities that have explicitly incorporated positive species interactions and feedbacks have found an increase in plant growth with little additional resource investment. As oceans continue to change and stressors become more prevalent, harnessing positive interactions between species through innovative approaches will likely become key to successful seagrass restoration.

AB  - Aggregation of particular proteins in the form of inclusion bodies or plaques followed by neuronal death is a hallmark of neurodegenerative proteopathies such as primary Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, and Huntington's chorea. Complex polygenic and environmental factors implicated in these proteopathies. Accumulation of proteins in these disorders indicates a substantial disruption in protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Proteostasis or cellular proteome homeostasis is attained by the synchronization of a group of cellular mechanisms called the proteostasis network (PN), which is responsible for the stability of the proteome and achieves the equilibrium between synthesis, folding, and degradation of proteins. In this review, we will discuss the different types of PN and the impact of PN component dysfunction on the four major neurodegenerative diseases mentioned earlier.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe mental illness characterized by persistent, intrusive and distressing obsessions and/or compulsions. Such symptoms have been conceptualized as resulting from a failure in source-monitoring processes, suggesting that patients with OCD fail to distinguish actions they perform from those they just imagine doing. In this study, we aimed to provide an updated and exhaustive review of the literature examining the relationship between source-monitoring and OCD. A systematic search in the literature through January 2019 allowed us to identify 13 relevant publications investigating source-monitoring abilities in patients with OCD or participants with subclinical compulsive symptoms. Most of the retrieved studies did not report any source-monitoring deficits in clinical and subclinical subjects compared with healthy volunteers. However, most of the studies reported that patients with OCD and subclinical subjects displayed reduced confidence in source-monitoring judgments or global cognitive confidence compared to controls. The present review highlighted some methodological and statistical limitations. Consequently, further studies are needed to explore source monitoring with regard to the subcategories of OCD symptoms (i.e., symmetry-ordering, contamination-washing, hoarding, aggressive obsession-checking, sexual-religious thoughts) and to clarify the relationship between source-monitoring subtypes (i.e., reality or internal source-monitoring) and confidence in these populations.

AB  - In the treatment of depression, when pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and the oldest brain stimulation techniques are deadlocked, the emergence of new therapies is a necessary development. The field of neuromodulation is very broad and controversial. This article provides an overview of current progress in the technological advances in neuromodulation and neurostimulation treatments for treatment-resistant depression: magnetic seizure therapy; focal electrically administered seizure therapy; low field magnetic stimulation; transcranial pulsed electromagnetic fields; transcranial direct current stimulation; epidural cortical stimulation; trigeminal nerve stimulation; transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation; transcranial focussed ultrasound; near infra-red transcranial radiation; closed loop stimulation. The role of new interventions is expanding, probably with more efficacy. Nowadays, still under experimentation, neuromodulation will probably revolutionise the field of neuroscience. At present, major efforts are still necessary before that these therapies are likely to become widespread.

AB  - The Mental Model concept has evolved from being a representation of reality to which we apply formal logic, to a type of logic with which we make decisions, learn, and adapt. This work uses bibliometric indicators to describe research on Mental Models from 1997 to 2017. The results show progressive growth since the late 1990s and a stationary trend starting in 2010. The existing research is dominated by the fields of individual and organizational psychology as well as education. Since 2007, a corpus of research (works that continue or are based on previous work) has been developed around the themes of memory, cognition, interpretation, and Johnson-Laird's work. In the late 2000s, another possible corpus emerged around team work. It is recommended to develop similar research in specific areas.

AB  - Alexithymia is of great interest as an outcome predictor of recovery from anorexia nervosa, since it may interfere with both treatment compliance and patients' ability to benefit from the adopted interventions. For this reason, in the last years new treatment approaches targeting emotion identification, expression, and regulation have been applied and tested. Using the PRISMA methodology, we performed a scoping review of the literature about treatment outcome in anorexia nervosa, in terms of changes in alexithymia as assessed by its most commonly used self-report measure, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS). The Medline and Scopus databases were searched, and articles were included if matching the following criteria: dealing with patients affected by anorexia nervosa, without limits of age; involving the application of any kind of targeted therapy or treatment; assessing alexithymia and the effect of a treatment intervention on alexithymia, using the TAS. Ten studies were eventually included; overall, according to the selected studies, alexithymia levels often remain high even after specific treatment. Further research aimed at a deeper understanding of the actual impact of alexithymia on the outcome of anorexia, as well as exploring alternative treatment strategies for alexithymia in eating disorders (EDs), are warranted.

AB  - There is an increasing acknowledgment that suicidal behaviors are negatively affected by school failure in adolescents and young adults. However, no systematic reviews with meta-analysis have been performed to evaluate the strength of this association. We assessed the magnitude of association of school failure as risk factor for suicide behavior in adolescents and young adults. Six international databases were searched up until January 2017. Inclusion criteria were: (1) assessment of suicide attempt or suicide; (2) case-control or cohort studies; (3) subjects aged 12-26 years; (4) school failure evaluated, which includes low academic performance, school dropout, school expulsion, and grade repetition. Random effect models were used; population attributable risks (PARs) were estimated. From 26,883 potentially eligible articles, 14 (62,298 individuals) were included. Meta-analyses could only be performed for suicide attempt. A history of school dropout (OR 6.44, 95% CI 3.03-13.65), low academic performance (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.22-1.81), and school failure (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.49-2.64) were significant risks of suicide attempts. Highest PAR estimates were 9.9% for school dropout, 5.1% for low academic performance, and 6.7% for any school failure. Only one study has been found for suicide, but results suggest an association with school dropout. Results show that the students who had school failure are at higher risk of suicide attempt and probably for suicide. The development of effective programs to prevent suicidal behaviors in educational settings may be an effective strategy to reduce these behaviors. However, reliable conclusions from this review are limited by the small amount of included studies for analysis. PROSPERO Registration Number CRD42013005775.

AB  - Background Treatment with thyroid hormones is occasionally used in the management of treatment-resistant depression. However, the evidence supporting this treatment is not fully established. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on the effect of adjunctive thyroid hormone in the management of treatment-resistant unipolar depression and to provide a pooled estimate of its efficacy.
   Methods The study is registered with PROSPERO (reg. no. CRD42018108088) and followed the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were carried out on June 24, 2019, in PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Each record was screened independently by at least two reviewers. In instances of discrepancies, consensus was reached upon discussion. Pooled efficacy estimates were calculated based on response rates (decrease of >= 50% on the primary outcome measure) using random effect statistics.
   Results The search yielded 1355 records. Based on the screening of these records, we identified 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria (total number of patients = 663). The comparison of response to thyroid hormones vs. placebo resulted in an odds ratio of 1.56 (95% CI: 0.50-4.84). Similarly, the comparison of response to thyroid hormones vs. lithium resulted in an odds ratio of 1.91 (95% CI: 0.85-4.26). Thus, adjunctive therapy with thyroid hormones was not superior to placebo or lithium in the management of treatment-resistant unipolar depression.
   Conclusion According to this review and meta-analysis, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of adjunctive thyroid hormones for treatment-resistant unipolar depression.

AB  - There is a growing interest in addressing spirituality in health care with evidence emerging that personal spiritual and religious practices, and support of these, can influence mental health in a positive way. However, there can be distinct challenges to spiritual expression and mental health issues for youth who identify as LGBT+. The goal of this paper was to undertake a systematic review of the available evidence to investigate the relationship between mental health, spirituality and religion as experienced by LGBT+ youth. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using medical and psychological databases that focused on spirituality, mental health and LGBT+ youth. The search yielded a total of ten articles published in English between May 2008 and June 2018. The key findings highlighted issues around discriminatory attitudes, shame related to disclosure, spirituality as a supportive resource, internalised conflict and external factors around sexual orientation concerns. The psychological, social and health implications are presented and discussed.

AB  - Cellular senescence is a homeostatic biological process characterized by a permanent state of cell cycle arrest that can contribute to the decline of the regenerative potential and function of tissues. The increased presence of senescent cells in different neurodegenerative diseases suggests the contribution of senescence in the pathophysiology of these disorders. Although several factors can induce senescence, DNA damage, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and altered proteostasis have been shown to play a role in its onset. Oxidative stress contributes to accelerated aging and cognitive dysfunction stages affecting neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, connectivity, and survival. During later life stages, it is implicated in the progression of cognitive decline, synapse loss, and neuronal degeneration. Also, neuroinflammation exacerbates oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death through the harmful effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on cell proliferation and maturation. Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can induce DNA damage and alterations in DNA repair that, in turn, can exacerbate them. Another important feature associated with senescence is altered proteostasis. Because of the disruption in the function and balance of the proteome, senescence can modify the proper synthesis, folding, quality control, and degradation rate of proteins producing, in some diseases, misfolded proteins or aggregation of abnormal proteins. There is an extensive body of literature that associates cellular senescence with several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Down syndrome (DS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). This review summarizes the evidence of the shared neuropathological events in these neurodegenerative diseases and the implication of cellular senescence in their onset or aggravation. Understanding the role that cellular senescence plays in them could help to develop new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The adverse effect of increased environmental temperature during summer season on avian industry has received great global concern. High temperature leads to severe economic loss in poultry production, because it is considered as valuable stress factor. Several practical methods were used to alleviate the adverse impact of increased temperature; among them were dietary modifications. So, several types of herbs are supplemented to reduce the deleterious influences of thermal stress altitudes in various animals, and even to prevent their adverse impacts. Therefore, sustainable supports for dietary modification based on herbs supplementations are largely needed, particularly when consider the additional advantages of herbs such as availability, actual efficiency, low cost, as well as their free from residual impact and antibiotic resistance. Numerous types of herbs were concluded to their efficient properties by poultry breeders to overcome a variety of the harmful effects of high ambient temperature. The present article deliberates the different practical applications of several members of the traditional herbal wealth to improve the general health state of poultry particularly as thermoregulatory and immunomodulatory agents, and for countering the heat stress-associated immunosuppressive effects. Additionally, the antioxidant activity of herbal growth promoters and their influence on improvement of production performances were a special aim of this review. The reported information will be helpful for improvement of general production and health status of birds reared under the heat stress via enhancement of immune response and stress tolerance, and popularizes usage of herbs amongst poultry producers.

AB  - Studies of microplastics (MPs) have highlighted their ubiquity in various environments. Recently, microplastics have been observed in atmospheric fallout collected fromsome cities. Although the studies are limited, some researches have shown that synthetic textiles are main source of airborne microplastics, and fibers are the dominant shape of microplastics in the atmosphere. Due to their small size, airborne microplastics can be directly inhaled posing health risks to humans, particularly to industry workers. Meteorological conditions and human activities affect the distribution and deposition of airborne microplastics. Furthermore, airborne microplastics are contributors to microplastic pollution in aquatic environments. We summarized the current knowledge and provide insights into further research to better understand airborne microplastics and their risks to human. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Self-identified race/ethnicity is largely used to identify, monitor, and examine racial/ethnic inequalities. A growing body of work underscores the need to consider multiple dimensions of race - the social construction of race as a function of appearance, societal interactions, institutional dynamics, stereotypes, and social norms. One such multidimensional measure is socially-assigned race, the perception of one's race by others, that may serve as the basis for differential or unfair treatment and subsequently lead to deleterious health outcomes. We conducted a scoping review to systematically appraise the socially-assigned race and health literature. A systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science, 28 EBSCO databases and 24 Proquest databases up to September 2019 was conducted and supplemented by a manual search of reference lists and grey literature. Quantitative and qualitative studies that examined socially-assigned race and health or health-related outcomes were considered for inclusion. Eighteen articles were included in the narrative synthesis. Self-rated health and mental health were among the most frequent outcomes studied. The majority of studies were conducted in the United States, with fewer studies conducted in New Zealand, Canada, and Latin America. While most studies demonstrate a positive association between social assignment as a disadvantaged racial or ethnic group and poorer health, some studies did not document an association. We describe key conceptual and methodological considerations that should be prioritized in future studies examining socially-assigned race and health. Socially-assigned race can provide additional insight into observed differential health outcomes among racial/ethnic groups in racialized societies based upon their lived experiences. Studies incorporating socially-assigned race warrants further investigation and may be leveraged to examine nuanced patterns of racial health advantage and disadvantage.

AB  - Despite the fact that astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells, critical for brain function, few studies have dealt with their possible role in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). This article explores relevant evidence on the involvement of astrocytes in experimental PD neurodegeneration from a molecular signaling perspective. For a long time, astrocytic proliferation was merely considered a byproduct of neuroinflammation, but by the time being, it is clear that astrocytic dysfunction plays a far more important role in PD pathophysiology. Indeed, ongoing experimental evidence suggests the importance of astrocytes and dopaminergic neurons' cross-linking signaling pathways. The Wnt-1 (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 1) pathway regulates several processes including neuron survival, synapse plasticity, and neurogenesis. In PD animal models, Frizzled (Fzd) neuronal receptors' activation by the Wnt-1 normally released by astrocytes following injuries leads to beta-catenin-dependent gene expression, favoring neuron survival and viability. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) capsaicin receptor also participates in experimental PD genesis. Activation of astrocyte TRPV1 receptors by noxious stimuli results in reduced inflammatory response and increased ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) synthesis, which enhances neuronal survival and differentiation. Another major pathway involves I kappa B kinase (IKK) downregulation by ARL6ip5 (ADP-ribosylation-like factor 6 interacting protein 5, encoded by the cell differentiation-associated, JWA, gene). Typically, IKK releases the proinflammatory NF-kappa B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) molecule from its inhibitor. Therefore, by downregulating NF-kappa B inhibitor, ARL6ip5 promotes an anti-inflammatory response. The evidence provided by neurotoxin-induced PD animal models guarantees further research on the neuroprotective potential of normalizing astrocyte function in PD.

AB  - Introduction
   Core psychopathy is characterized by grandiosity, callousness, manipulativeness, and lack of remorse, empathy, and guilt. It is often comorbid with conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Psychopathy is present in forensic as well as prison and general populations. In recent years, an increasing amount of neuroimaging studies has been conducted in order to elucidate the obscure neurobiological etiology of psychopathy. The studies have yielded heterogenous results, and no consensus has been reached. Aims
   This study systematically reviewed and qualitatively summarized functional and structural neuroimaging studies conducted on individuals with psychopathic traits. Furthermore, this study aimed to evaluate whether the findings from different MRI modalities could be reconciled from a neuroanatomical perspective. Materials and Methods
   After the search and auditing processes, 118 neuroimaging studies were included in this systematic literature review. The studies consisted of structural, functional, and diffusion tensor MRI studies. Results
   Psychopathy was associated with numerous neuroanatomical abnormalities. Structurally, gray matter anomalies were seen in frontotemporal, cerebellar, limbic, and paralimbic regions. Associated gray matter volume (GMV) reductions were most pronounced particularly in most of the prefrontal cortex, and temporal gyri including the fusiform gyrus. Also decreased GMV of the amygdalae and hippocampi as well the cingulate and insular cortices were associated with psychopathy, as well as abnormal morphology of the hippocampi, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. Functionally, psychopathy was associated with dysfunction of the default mode network, which was also linked to poor moral judgment as well as deficient metacognitive and introspective abilities. Second, reduced white matter integrity in the uncinate fasciculus and dorsal cingulum were associated with core psychopathy. Third, emotional detachment was associated with dysfunction of the posterior cerebellum, the human mirror neuron system and the Theory of Mind denoting lack of empathy and persistent failure in integrating affective information into cognition. Conclusions
   Structural and functional aberrancies involving the limbic and paralimbic systems including reduced integrity of the uncinate fasciculus appear to be associated with core psychopathic features. Furthermore, this review points towards the idea that ASPD and psychopathy might stem from divergent biological processes.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by selective and severe degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta and the locus coeruleus (LC), which underlies the most prominent symptoms. Although alpha-synuclein accumulation has long been established to play a causal role in the disease, it alone cannot explain the selective degenerative pattern. Recent evidence shows that the selective vulnerability could arise due to the large presence of cytosolic catecholamines and Ca2+ ions in the substantia nigra pars compacta and LC specifically that can be aberrantly affected by alpha-synuclein accumulation. Moreover, each has its own toxic potential, and disturbance of one can exacerbate the toxic effects of the others. This presents a mechanism unique to these areas that can lead to a vicious degenerative cycle. Interestingly, in familial variants of PD, the exact same brain areas are affected, implying the underlying process is likely the same. However, the exact disease mechanisms of many of these genetic variants remain unclear. Here, we review the effects of the PD-related genes Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1. We establish that these mutant varieties can set in motion the same degenerative process involving alpha-synuclein, cytosolic catecholamines and Ca2+. Additionally, we show indications that model organisms might not accurately represent all components of this central mechanism, explaining why Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 model organisms often lack a convincing PD-like phenotype.

AB  - Background:
   There is a consensus that adoptees and immigrants both experience more mental health problems than their peers. The two groups share many risk factors for psychosis, but an increased risk for psychotic illness has only been demonstrated for immigrants.
   Aims:
   The aim of this review is to describe psychosis risk factors in adoptees, with a focus on difficulties with identity formation, identification with in-groups, attachment to parents, and coping with loss and with discrimination.
   Method:
   The literature in these five areas is reviewed as it pertains to adoption and psychosis.
   Results:
   There are no clear findings because the relevant studies have not been done, but the literature suggests that adopted children face challenges very similar to those of immigrants to a new country.
   Conclusion:
   The immigration field and the adoption field have much to learn from each other. It is recommended that a prevention strategy analogous to increased neighbourhood ethnic density be implemented with adoptees - that they be intentionally exposed from early childhood and throughout adolescence to age peers who share a similar background and with whom they can readily identify. It is also recommended that immigrants be welcomed into their host country with the same open arms as adoptive parents welcome their new children.

AB  - Academic achievement is a strong preventive factor against marginalization. Children at risk of academic failure and drop out can benefit from out-of-school-time academic (OSTA) interventions. Wide-scaled implementation and sustainment of effective interventions remain a struggle across education, welfare, and health. The need for approaches to increase implementability, effectiveness, and efficiency of interventions is pressing. Advancements in the field of education and mental health suggest identifying and studying discrete elements that are common across interventions for the purpose of hypothesis generation, intervention optimization, design improvement, and implementation. This review identified OSTA interventions for primary school children at risk of academic failure. Common elements methodology was used to code practice elements (n = 62), process elements (n = 49), and implementation elements (n = 36) in 30 effective and six ineffective OSTA interventions in matrices. Based on frequency counts, common practice, process, and implementation elements across the interventions were identified, and given frequency count values (FV) reflecting how often elements were included in effective studies as opposed to in ineffective studies. The five common practice elements with the highest FVs were homework support, training in positive parental school involvement, positive reinforcement, structured tutoring, and psychoeducation. The most common process element was regular support to intervention receiver, and the most common implementation element was quality monitoring. Common combinations of elements were also identified and given FVs. Results from this review can inform efforts to design or optimize OSTA interventions, and inform education, implementation, and practice to improve academic achievement for children at risk.

AB  - Postpartum psychosis is a serious disorder that can result in adverse consequences for the mother and baby. It is important that we understand the experiences of women, to develop effective interventions during this critical period. The aim of this systematic review was to conduct a metasynthesis of qualitative research exploring women's experiences of postpartum psychosis and factors involved in recovery from the perspective of women and family members. A comprehensive literature search of five databases was conducted and the findings were appraised and synthesised, following a thematic synthesis approach. Fifteen studies, capturing the views of 103 women and 42 family members, met the inclusion criteria. Four main themes incorporating 13 subthemes were identified following synthesis: (1) Experiencing the unspeakable, (2) Loss and disruption, (3) Realigning old self and new self and the integrative theme of (4) Social context. The findings offer new insight into the unique experience of postpartum psychosis and demonstrate that recovery does not follow a linear path. To improve clinical outcomes, a more integrative and individualised approach is needed which incorporates long-term psychological and psychosocial support, and considers the needs of the family. Further areas for staff training, service development and future research are highlighted.

AB  - This study aimed to systemically review the literature regarding self-harm, emotion regulation, and experiential avoidance. Articles were identified through systematic searches of several databases using combinations of the phrases "emotion regulation" AND "experiential avoidance" AND "self-harm," or "self-injury," and "BPD" or "Borderline Personality Disorder." Additional searches were conducted inclusive of terms related to experiential avoidance and emotion regulation, as well as other disorders related to self-harm. 17 articles were identified and reviewed. Results tentatively support the role of experiential avoidance in self-harm; some studies described phenomena similar to experiential avoidance without using the term. Poor emotion regulation was often cited as a reason for engagement in self-harm. Several gaps in the literature were identified and discussed.

AB  - Competence to stand trial (CST) evaluations are a critical part of certain criminal proceedings, and competence-related evaluation and treatment are an increasing part of public mental health services. Whereas more research describes the defendants undergoing competence evaluations, less research has examined the actual reports detailing those competence evaluations. This study reviewed 3,644 court-ordered CST evaluation reports submitted by 126 evaluators in Virginia since Virginia initiated an oversight system allowing for comprehensive review. The base rate of incompetence opinions was 38.8%, but these rates varied significantly across evaluation type (initial versus post-restoration efforts) and evaluators (ranging from 9.1% to 76.8% incompetence rate). Results suggest generally strong compliance with state statutes guiding CST evaluations, but also highlight marked variability in forensic conclusions and reveal a few areas in which some reports fell short of statutory requirements and practice guidelines.

AB  - Endosomes and lysosomes (endolysosomes) are membrane bounded organelles that play a key role in cell survival and cell death. These acidic intracellular organelles are the principal sites for intracellular hydrolytic activity required for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Endolysosomes are involved in the degradation of plasma membrane components, extracellular macromolecules as well as intracellular macromolecules and cellular fragments. Understanding the physiological significance and pathological relevance of endolysosomes is now complicated by relatively recent findings of physical and functional interactions between endolysosomes with other intracellular organelles including endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, plasma membranes, and peroxisomes. Indeed, evidence clearly indicates that endolysosome dysfunction and inter-organellar signaling occurs in different neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disease (HAND), Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as various forms of brain cancer such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). These findings open new areas of cell biology research focusing on understanding the physiological actions and pathophysiological consequences of inter-organellar communication. Here, we will review findings of others and us that endolysosome de-acidification and dysfunction coupled with impaired inter-organellar signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of AD, HAND, PD, and GBM. A more comprehensive appreciation of cell biology and inter-organellar signaling could lead to the development of new drugs to prevent or cure these diseases.

AB  - Armed conflict and internal displacement of persons create new health challenges for women in Africa. To outline the research literature on this population, we conducted a review of studies exploring the health of internally displaced persons (IDP) women in Africa. In collaboration with a health research librarian and a review team, a search strategy was designed that identified 31 primary research studies with relevant evidence. Studies on the health of displaced women have been conducted in South- Central Africa, including Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); and in Eastern, East central Africa, and Western Africa, including Eritrea, Uganda, and Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, and Nigeria. We identified violence, mental health, sexual and reproductive health, and malaria and as key health areas to explore, and observed that socioeconomic power shifts play a crucial role in predisposing women to challenges in all four categories. Access to reproductive health services was influenced by knowledge, geographical proximity to health services, spousal consent, and affordability of care. As well, numerous factors affect the mental health of internally displaced women in Africa: excessive care-giving responsibilities, lack of financial and family support to help them cope, sustained experiences of violence, psychological distress, family dysfunction, and men's chronic alcoholism. National and regional governments must recommit to institutional restructuring and improved funding allocation to culturally appropriate health interventions for displaced women.

AB  - The global refugee crisis is at its most critical state in history; Syria alone has produced 12 million internally displaced persons, with another 5 million refugees seeking protection across the globe. Faced with the heavy burden of mental distress carried by a massive refugee influx, many host nations lack the service capacity to respond adequately. While mobile mental health (mMHealth) applications and platforms have the potential to augment screenings and interventions for vulnerable populations, an insufficient gender and cultural adaptation of technology may drastically hamper its uptake in Arab refugees. Reporting only papers originating from Middle Eastern and/or Arab nations or refugee host nations, this systematic review evaluates the available literature published between 2000 and 2019 on the usage acceptability of mMHealth in Syrian refugees and other vulnerable Arab populations. We conducted a systematic review in PubMed, PsychInfo, Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify studies that addressed mMHealth implementation in these populations; of a total of 607 articles identified, only 10 (1.6%) available, unique articles met our search criteria. These studies discussed the feasibility and efficacy of mMHealth applications and the barriers to their uptake. The few existing studies show positive impacts of mMHealth on the access to services and on treatment outcomes but also reveal a paucity of literature on mMHealth for vulnerable Arab populations. These findings indicate a critical need for research on the barriers to mMHealth uptake, to bolster service capacity in the Arab Region and in the refugee diaspora of other, non-Arab host countries.

AB  - Mitigating the environmental impact of nonpoint source pollution from intensively managed urban and agricultural landscapes is of paramount concern to watershed managers. Golf course turfgrass systems, which receive significant fertilizer inputs, have been cited as significant sources of nutrient loading to groundwater and surface water, but a contemporary synthesis of golf course nutrient export rates is lacking. This review of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss from golf courses and the factors affecting it aims to support watershed management efforts and decision making. We discuss previous literature reviews, examine seven golf course studies that quantify nutrient export from delineated drainage areas, and analyze the results of 40 turfgrass plot experiments. Studies were collected systematically and selected based on predetermined inclusion criteria. Combining evidence from both watershed- and plot-scale studies, typical inorganic N and P losses from golf courses via leaching and runoff are on the order of 2-12 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.1-1.0 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Typical total N and P losses are around 2-20 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1.5-5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. However, the potential for large variation in export rates across 2-3 orders of magnitude must be emphasized. The body of turfgrass literature stresses the importance of best management practices (BMPs) related to applying fertilizer to match plant needs and reducing opportunities for its transport. Accounting for all sources of nutrients, especially soil P, in determining fertilizer application rates and avoiding excessive irrigation to prevent leaching of nutrients from the rootzone is particularly important. BMPs can also reduce nutrient leaching and runoff by controlling the movement of water across the landscape and promoting natural nutrient attenuation, such as with vegetative stream buffers.

AB  - Adolescents detained within the criminal justice system are affected by complex health problems, health-risk behaviours, and high rates of premature death. We did a global synthesis of the evidence regarding the health of this population. We searched Embase, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, PubMed, Web of Science, CINCH, Global Health, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Campbell Library, the National Criminal Justice Reference System Abstract Database, and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed journal articles, including reviews, that reported the prevalence of at least one health outcome (physical, mental, sexual, infectious, and neurocognitive) in adolescents (aged <20 years) in detention, and were published between Jan 1, 1980, and June 30, 2018. The reference lists of published review articles were scrutinised for additional relevant publications. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, and three reviewed full texts of relevant articles. The protocol for this Review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016041392). 245 articles (204 primary research articles and 41 reviews) were included, with most primary research (183 [90%]) done in high-income countries. A high lifetime prevalence of health problems, risks, and conditions was reported in detained adolescents, including mental disorders (0-95%), substance use disorders (22-96%), self-harm (12-65%), neurodevelopmental disabilities (2-47%), infectious diseases (0-34%), and sexual and reproductive conditions (pregnant by age 19 years 20-37%; abnormal cervical screening test result 16%). Various physical and mental health problems and health-risk behaviours are more common among adolescents in detention than among their peers who have not been detained. As the social and structural drivers of poor health overlap somewhat with factors associated with exposure to the criminal justice system, strategies to address these factors could help to reduce both rates of adolescent detention and adolescent health inequalities. Improving the detection of mental and physical disorders, providing appropriate interventions during detention, and optimising transitional health care after release from detention could improve the health outcomes of these vulnerable young people.

Moreover, we explored the potential moderators of the associations between prematurity and temperament. A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Twenty-two studies were analyzed. Preterm children showed a higher Activity level as well as lower Attentional Focusing and Attention Span/Persistence, in comparison with their full-term counterparts. Extremely preterm children showed a higher Activity level than other preterm levels. These findings support the conclusion that preterm children present with a less regulated temperament relative to those born full term.

AB  - How the animal regulates its internal environment is a central question in physiology. In recent years, the account of biological functions known as Bayesian enactivism has been extended from neuroscience to address processes of physiological regulation. Enactivism understands sensory action cycles of perception and behaviour to entail expectations of the causes of sensations received from the environment. Enactivism is Bayesian in that the organism strives to update expectations to better match the sensations it experiences through actions. The review starts with a brief examination of the historical development of the concepts of homeostasis, homeorhesis and allostasis. To better align the historical concepts of physiological regulation with Bayesian enactivism it is suggested that homeorhesis and allostasis function as opposing effectors modulating, respectively, robustness and plasticity of phenotype to render homeostatic balance of the animal with its changing environment. In this formulation, the expectations of the environment embedded within the form and functions of the animal that develop under homeorhetic control during morphogenesis and morphostasis are updated by allostasis to better match the animal's phenotype with its contemporary environment. Just as morphogens shape development and persistence of anatomical form during morphogenesis and morphostasis, anticipatory behaviours can be understood to structure the animal's pattern of environmental engagement in a manner that shapes the development and persistence of homeostasis. Further empirical and theoretical analyses should help clarify whether homeorhesis and allostasis are aspects of a common underlying process or are opposing effectors mediating a Bayesian dialogue between expectation and experience.

AB  - In contrast to well-documented deficits in the core social cognitive domains of social perception and theory of mind (ToM), how Parkinson's disease (iPD) affects one's empathic capacity remains poorly understood. The current study provides the first meta-analytic review of both ToM and empathy as broad constructs, and also breaks these constructs down to clearly differentiate their overlapping (affective ToM and cognitive empathy) and distinct (affective empathy and cognitive ToM) components. A total of 38 studies contributed to these analyses, with results revealing that, relative to controls, PD is associated with significant and substantial deficits in the domain of cognitive ToM (g = -0.78), as well as the overlapping domains of affective ToM/cognitive empathy (g = -0.69). However, no group differences were identified for affective empathy (g = -0.08). These data speak to there being a potential preservation of affective empathic processing in PD, but because of the relatively limited research base on this topic, recommendations for future research are highlighted.

AB  - Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia are at least three times more likely to develop a substance use disorder than controls. These patients are frequently prescribed benzodiacepines as a coadjuvant drug, which have a high potential for addiction. We performed a literature review aiming to gather evidence on various topics concerning the use of benzodiacepines in schizophrenia, with a focus on possible abuse: 1) Prevalence of prescripted and non-prescripted benzodiacepine use among patients, 2) Prevalence of abusers, 3) Effects of long-term benzodiacepine abuse in schizophrenia prognosis, 4) Possible management strategies for benzodiacepine abuse in this population.
   Our search revealed there is a high variability (up to 20%) in benzodiacepine abuse among patients, with cannabis and stimulants being more frequent, and no clear demographic traits have been identified among these patients. Patients with affective symptoms are more likely to abuse benzodiazepines. Its long-term effects on prognosis have been debated, with some papers hinting at a higher mortality rate. Tapering benzodiacepines has been associated with an improvement in some cognitive functions. Management strategies for potential abuse do not differ greatly for this population, and no specific pharmacological aid can be indicated, but an integral approach is proposed.

AB  - Near infrared or infrared A (IRA) accounts for over 40% of the solar spectrum (SS) and is able to reach subcutaneous tissue as well as the retina. Outdoor workers are occupationally exposed to solar radiation (SR), but the level of exposure may differ widely depending on the job performed, time spent outdoors, latitude, altitude, season, personal protection, etc. Until now, risk assessment and management for outdoor workers has focused on the prevention of both acute and long-term effects on the eye and the skin due to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) with little consideration of the other components of the SS (a possible exception is represented by visible radiation with reference to the eye). A growing body of evidence coming from in vitro studies indicates that IRA is involved in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and may interfere with the respiratory chain in the mitochondria. Moreover, it can modulate gene expression and some metabolic pathways. The biological action of IRA is only partly attributable to a thermal mechanism, should it be also involved in photochemical ones. The cellular and molecular pathways affected by IRA are partly similar and partly different with respect to those involved in the case of visible ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Consequently, the net effect of the SS is very difficult to predict at different levels of the biological organization, making more difficult the final balance of health risk and benefits (for the skin, eye, immune system, blood pressure, etc.) in a given exposure situation. Moreover, few in vivo studies and no epidemiological data are presently available in this regard. Investigating this topic may contribute to better defining the individual exposome. More practically, it is expected to bring benefits to the risk assessment and management for outdoor workers exposed to SS, contributing to: (1) better definition of the individual profiles of susceptibility, (2) more focused preventive and protective measures, (3) better implementation of the health surveillance and (4) a more effective information and training.

AB  - To explore the necessity and feasibility of early anti-depressive therapies in acute stroke patients, we conducted a meta-analysis of currently available randomized control studies (RCTs). Literature search in six databases was done with keywords of cerebrovascular accident, depression and prevention. Only RCTs that met the inclusion criteria were enrolled for further analysis. Twelve eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. Prophylactic anti-depressive therapies following acute stroke were shown to reduce the incidence of depression in the patients (RR = =0.33, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.43, p < 0.001), improve symptoms of depression (WMD: 5.73, 95% CI: 4.18 to 7.29, p < 0.001), improve motor function (WMD: 12.56, 95%Cl: 9.07 to 16.04,p < 0.001) and neurological function (WMD: 1.13, 95,/oCI: 0.57 to 1.69,p < 0.001). However, anti-depressive therapies showed no effects on mortality (RR = 1.63, 95%CI: 0.55 to 4.85, p = 0.377) and adverse events incidence (RR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.53 to 1.64,p = 0.806). Anti-depressive therapies following acute stroke is effective thus deserves to be advocated.

AB  - The last decade has witnessed an exponentially growing interest in gut microbiota and the gut-brain axis in health and disease. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical research indicate that gut microbiota, and their associated microbiomes, may influence pathogenic processes and thus the onset and progression of various diseases, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. In fact, gut dysbiosis (microbiota dysregulation) has been associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and motor neuron disease, as well as multiple sclerosis. The gut microbiota constitutes a dynamic microbial system constantly challenged by many biological variables, including environmental factors. Since the gut microbiota constitute a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem, they provide potential therapeutic targets that can be modulated as new interventions for dysbiosis-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the evidence for environmental modulation of gut microbiota and its relevance to brain disorders, exploring in particular the implications for neurodegenerative diseases. We will focus on three major environmental factors that are known to influence the onset and progression of those diseases, namely exercise, diet and stress. Further exploration of environmental modulation, acting via both peripheral (e.g. gut microbiota and associated metabolic dysfunction or 'metabolopathy') and central (e.g. direct effects on CNS neurons and glia) mechanisms, may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches, such as enviromimetics, for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Objective: Medical events such as myocardial infarction and cancer diagnosis can induce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The optimal treatment of PTSD symptoms in this context is unknown.
   Methods: A literature search of 6 biomedical electronic databases was conducted from database inception to November 2018. Studies were eligible if they used a randomized design and evaluated the effect of treatments on medical event-induced PTSD symptoms in adults. A random effects model was used to pool data when two or more comparable studies were available.
   Results: Six trials met full inclusion criteria. Studies ranged in size from 21 to 81 patients, and included patients with PTSD induced by cardiac events, cancer, HIV, multiple sclerosis, and stem cell transplantation. All trials assessed psychological interventions. Two trials comparing a form of exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with assessment-only control found that CBT resulted in lower PTSD symptoms [Hedges's g = -0.47, (95% CI -0.82 - -0.12), p = .009]. A third trial compared imaginal exposure (another form of exposure-based COT) with an attention control and found a trend toward reduced PTSD symptoms. Three trials compared eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) with active psychological treatments (imaginal exposure, conventional CBT, and relaxation therapy), and found that EMDR was more effective.
   Conclusion: CBT and EMDR may be promising approaches to reducing PTSD symptoms due to medical events. However, additional trials are needed in this patient population.

AB  - Twin studies have shown that a substantial proportion of the variance for sleep variables is due to genetic factors. However, there is still considerable heterogeneity among research reports. Our main objectives were to: 1) Review the twin literature regarding sleep quality and duration, as well as their behavioural correlates; 2) Estimate the mean heritability of subjective sleep quality and sleep duration; 3) Assess heterogeneity among studies on these topics; and 4) Search for moderator variables. Two parallel meta-analyses were carried out for sleep quality and sleep duration. Seventeen articles were included in the meta-analysis. Mean MZ correlations were consistently higher than DZ correlations. A mean heritability of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.41) was found for subjective sleep quality (range: 0-0.43) and 0.38 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.56) for sleep duration (range: 0-1). Heterogeneity indexes were significant for both sleep quality (I-2 = 98.77, p < .001) and sleep duration (I-2 = 99.73, p < .001). The high heterogeneity warrants further research considering possible moderators that may affect heritability.

AB  - Intrabodies (both single-chain Fv and single-domain VH, VHH, and VL nanobodies) offer unique solutions to some of the challenges of delivery and target engagement posed by immunotherapeutics for the brain and other areas of the nervous system. The specificity, which includes the recognition of post-translational modifications, and capacity for engineering that characterize these antibody fragments can be especially well-focused when the genes encoding only the binding sites of the antibody are expressed intracellularly. Multifunctional constructs use fusions with peptides that can re-target antigen-antibody complexes to enhance both pharmacodynamic activity and intracellular solubility simultaneously. Fusions with proteolytic targeting signals, such as the PEST degron, greatly enhance potency in some cases. Stem cell transplants can be protected from exogenous misfolded proteins by stable transfection with intrabodies. Tandem expression to target two or more misfolding proteins in one treatment may be especially valuable for proteostatic disruptions due to genetic, aging, or toxic triggers. Advances in bioinformatics, screening protocols, and especially gene therapy are showing great promise for intrabody/nanobody treatments of a full range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and related tau dementias, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body diseases, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases, among others.

AB  - Health-promoting and health-endangering humor styles as measured with the Humor Styles Questionnaire have been repeatedly associated with personality traits. Yet, a comprehensive meta-analysis of all currently available studies on this topic as well as an exploration of the highly heterogeneous effect sizes found in this literature is still missing. We provide an updated overview of the literature, synthesize its results in a random effects model meta-analysis, and explore possible moderators. An extensive literature search identified 24 studies from 13 countries (N = 11,791). Health-promoting humor styles were positively correlated with extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, and negatively correlated with neuroticism. Health-endangering humor styles were positively associated with neuroticism and negatively associated with agreeableness and conscientiousness. Between-study heterogeneity ranged from I-2 = 41% to 96% and could be only partially explained by moderator variables. The effects appear robust with respect to individual studies, publication bias, and measurement error, and appear mostly generalizable across sexes, sample composition, and continent. Further research is required to examine these associations in less developed countries, possible moderators for the high amount of effect size heterogeneity, and the development of these associations across the lifespan.

AB  - Microplastics are ubiquitous environmental contaminants leading to inevitable human exposure. Even so, little is known about the effects of microplastics in human health. Thus, in this work we review the evidence for potential negative effects of microplastics in the human body, focusing on pathways of exposure and toxicity. Exposure may occur by ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact due to the presence of microplastics in products, foodstuff and air. In all biological systems, microplastic exposure may cause particle toxicity, with oxidative stress, inflammatory lesions and increased uptake or translocation. The inability of the immune system to remove synthetic particles may lead to chronic inflammation and increase risk of neoplasia. Furthermore, microplastics may release their constituents, adsorbed contaminants and pathogenic organisms. Nonetheless, knowledge on microplastic toxicity is still limited and largely influenced by exposure concentration, particle properties, adsorbed contaminants, tissues involved and individual susceptibility, requiring further research.

AB  - The number of trials aimed at evaluating treatments for autism spectrum disorder has been increasing progressively. However, it is not clear which outcome measures should be used to assess their efficacy, especially for treatments which target core symptoms. The present review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview regarding the outcome measures used in clinical trials for people with autism spectrum disorder. We systematically searched the Web of Knowledge(SM) database between 1980 and 2016 to identify published controlled trials investigating the efficacy of interventions in autism spectrum disorder. We included 406 trials in the final database, from which a total of 327 outcome measures were identified. Only seven scales were used in more than 5% of the studies, among which only three measured core symptoms (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Childhood Autism Rating Scale, and Social Responsiveness Scale). Of note, 69% of the tools were used in the literature only once. Our systematic review has shown that the evaluation of efficacy in intervention trials for autism spectrum disorder relies on heterogeneous and often non-specific tools for this condition. The fragmentation of tools may significantly hamper the comparisons between studies and thus the discovery of effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder. Greater consensus regarding the choice of these measures should be reached.

AB  - Background: Since the last Western great recession of 2008, an increasing interest on the effects of Active Labour Market Policies (ALMPs) on improving health has emerged. The aim of our review is to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of ALMPs and whether some types of ALMP are more effective. Methods: Using the Scoping review methodology, we conducted a literature review in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science and selected articles published between 1990 and 2017 in high income countries. We applied four sequential phases of document screening to the list of retrieved articles. Results: Of the 416 documents detected in the search, 36 documents were finally selected. Most of them focused on mental health and related components (72.2%) and found positive results at least in one outcome (80.6%). The ALMPs reported mainly attempt to build capacity through job search assistance (31.6%) with a component on mental health, showing positive results on health; some offer job training (16.7%) and few subsidized employment (8.3%), showing more controversial results, although mostly positive. The rest include a combination of different types of ALMPs. Conclusions: This review shows that ALMPs have a positive impact on health and quality of life. There are relatively few studies of the impact of ALMPs on general health, and most of the studies found are focused on Anglo-Saxon and Nordic countries. The most significant knowledge gaps are the mechanisms involved in achieving this improvement, and above all the differential health impacts according to axes of inequality and welfare state.

AB  - Purpose Musicians' practice and performance routines reportedly lead to musculoskeletal complaints and disorders (MCD) that impact their wellbeing and performance abilities. This systematic review aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, prevention and effectiveness of treatments for MCD in professional musicians and consider the methodological quality of the included studies. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in December 2017 using electronic databases and supplemented by a hand search. Case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, interventional studies and case reports investigating the prevalence, risk factors, prevention or treatment effects of MCD in professional musicians or music students (age >= 16 years) were included. Quality assessments of the included studies were performed using an adapted version of the "Study Quality Assessment Tools" from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Results One case-control study, 6 cohort studies, 62 cross-sectional studies, 12 interventional studies and 28 case reports were included and assessed for methodological quality. The study designs, terminology, and outcomes were heterogeneous, as the analyses mostly did not control for major confounders, and the definition of exposure was often vague. Therefore, evidence that being a professional musician is a risk factor for MCD as well as the causal relationship between these factors remains low despite the fact that a large number of studies have been performed. Conclusions Studies with high internal and external validity regarding the prevalence, risk factors and effectiveness of the prevention or treatment of MCD in professional musicians are still missing. Further high-quality observational and interventional studies are required.

AB  - For the past 2 decades, clinically severe obesity (operationalized as a body mass index >= 40 kg/m(2)) has increased at a more pronounced rate that less severe obesity. As a result, the surgical treatment of obesity (bariatric surgery) has become a more widely accepted, yet still underutilized, treatment for persons with severe obesity and significant weight-related health problems. Psychologists play a central role on the multidisciplinary team involved in the preoperative assessment and postoperative management of patients. They also have played a central role in clinical research which has enhanced understanding of the psychosocial and behavioral factors that contribute to the development of severe obesity as well as how those factors and others contribute to postoperative outcomes. This article, written specifically for psychologists and other mental health professionals who currently work with these patients or are considering the opportunity to do so in the future, reviews these contributions over the past 20 years. The article highlights how this work has become a fundamental part of international clinical care guidelines, which primarily focus on preoperative psychosocial screening. The article also outlines avenues for future research in the field, with a specific focus on the need for additional behavioral and psychosocial interventions to promote lifelong success after bariatric surgery.

AB  - The body's microbiome represents an actively regulated network of novel mechanisms that potentially underlie the etiology and pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases. For complex brain disorders such as schizophrenia, understanding the cellular and molecular pathways that intersect the bidirectional gut-brain axis is anticipated to lead to new methods of treatment. The means by which the microbiome might differ across neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders are not known. Brain disorders as diverse as schizophrenia, major depression, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis appear to share a common pathology of an imbalanced community of commensal microbiota, often measured in terms of a leaky gut phenotype accompanied by low level systemic inflammation. While environmental factors associated with these disease states might contribute to intestinal pathologies, products from a perturbed microbiome may also directly promote specific signs, symptoms and etiologies of individual disorders. We hypothesize that in schizophrenia, it is the putatively unique susceptibility related to genes that modulate the immune system and the gut-brain pleiotropy of these genes which leads to a particularly neuropathological response when challenged by a microbiome in dysbiosis. Consequences from exposure to this dysbiosis may occur during pre- or post-natal time periods and thus may interfere with normal neurodevelopment in those who are genetically predisposed. Here, we review the evidence from the literature which supports the idea that the intersection of the microbiome and immune gene susceptibility in schizophrenia is relevant etiologically and for disease progression. Figuring prominently at both ends of the gut-brain axis and at points in between are proteins encoded by genes found in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), including select MHC as well as non-MHC complement pathway genes.

AB  - Neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease are serious clinical problems that affect millions of people worldwide. The majority of clinical trials for these common conditions have failed, and there is a critical need to understand why treatments in preclinical animal models do not translate to patients. Many patients with these conditions are middle-aged or older, however, the majority of preclinical studies have used only young-adult animals. Considering that aging involves biological changes that are relevant to the pathobiology of neurological diseases, the lack of aged subjects in preclinical research could contribute to translational failures. This paper details how aging affects biological processes involved in neurological conditions, and reviews aging research in the context of traumatic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. We conclude that aging is an important, but often overlooked, factor that influences biology and outcomes in neurological conditions, and provide suggestions to improve our understanding and treatment of these diseases in aged patients.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify and appraise evidence on the direct and indirect impacts of high indoor temperatures on health; the indoor temperature threshold at which the identified health impacts are observed; and to summarise the evidence for establishing a maximum indoor temperature threshold for health.
   Study design: This is a systematic literature review and narrative synthesis.
   Methods: A review of the published literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and GreenFILE databases was conducted. The search criteria were kept broad to capture evidence from all countries and contexts; no date or study design limits were applied, except English language limits. We included studies that specifically measured indoor temperature and examined its effect on physical or mental health outcomes. Evidence was graded using the National Institutes of Health framework.
   Results: Twenty-two articles were included in the review, including 11 observational, seven cross-sectional and three longitudinal cohort studies and one prospective case-control study. Eight main health effects were described: respiratory, blood pressure, core temperature, blood glucose, mental health and cognition, heat-health symptoms, physical functioning and influenza transmission. Five studies found respiratory symptoms worsened in warm indoor environments, with one reporting indoor temperatures higher than 26 degrees C, which was associated with increased respiratory distress calls being made to paramedics (odds ratio = 1.63, P = 0.056). Core symptoms of schizophrenia and dementia were found to be significantly exacerbated by indoor heat (the latter above a 26 degrees C cumulative exposure threshold). The absorption of insulin doses in people with type one diabetes was also significantly accelerated in hot indoor environments. Only five studies reported the temperatures at which health outcomes worsened, with thresholds ranging between 26 degrees C and 32 degrees C. However, owing to insufficient data and the heterogeneity of the included studies (design, population, setting, exposure measures, outcomes and location), meta-analysis and an upper threshold determination was not feasible.
   Conclusions: High indoor temperatures affect aspects of human health, with the strongest evidence for respiratory health, diabetes management and core schizophrenia and dementia symptoms. Exacerbation of symptoms in warm indoor environments has clinical relevance to at-risk groups and those caring for them. Care staff and facility managers need to be vigilant of high temperatures in care environments and should incorporate indoor overheating into their risk management and sustainability and/or climate change adaptation plans. The indoor temperature threshold at which adverse effects begin to occur remains unclear as studies seldom report the exposure-response relationship over a temperature continuum. Until there is extensive scientific data to support a maximum indoor temperature threshold, 26 degrees C may be the most suitable indoor temperature for at-risk groups in keeping with the existing guidance documents.

AB  - Objective Tactical personnel (Military, Law Enforcement, Emergency Responders) require physical fitness levels sufficient for training and occupational duty. Physical conditioning aimed at increasing fitness levels during training presents an injury risk, but unfit trainees may struggle to meet occupational performance standards, further increasing injury risk to themselvesor others. Therefore, the aim of this review was to determine if fitness, as quantified by tactical fitness tests, effectively predicts injury risk during training.
   Methods Literature databases were search and relevant articles extracted. 27 Publications were included for qualitative review and seven studies reporting a timed run were included in meta analysis.
   Results The combined risk ratio was 2.34 (95% CI 2.02 to 2.70). Muscular endurance tests were less conclusive in their predictive abilities. Functional strength or power tests were effective predictors, but few studies reported on strength or power, indicating a need for further study in this area.
   Conclusions The meta-analysis results are supported by the occupational relevance of run tests; tactical trainees are required to perform frequent bouts of distance weight bearing activity. However, given the diverse physical requirements of tactical personnel, measures of strength and power should also be evaluated, especially given their effectiveness in the studies that included these measures.

AB  - Circulating microRNAs (cimiRNAs) are a class of non-encoding RNAs found in bodily fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tears. CimiRNAs have been implicated as promising biomarkers for central nervous system (CNS) disorders because they are actively secreted as messengers and are profoundly involved in fine-tuning of developmental and differentiation processes. Furthermore, they are attractive biomarkers because they are extremely stable, tissue enriched and can be determined in a quantitative manner. This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on the current progress regarding the potential value of cimiRNAs as CNS biomarkers. Within this framework five CNS disorders are explored which share a common pathological hallmark namely cognitive impairment. The CNS disorders include Major depression disorder (MDD), Bipolar disorder (BD), Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The similarities and differences between altered cimiRNAs in the different disorders are described. The miR-29 family, miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p are discussed as common dysregulated cimiRNAs found in the CNS disorders. Furthermore, it is shown that the type of bodily fluid used for measuring cimiRNAs is important as inconsistencies in cimiRNAs expression directions are found when comparing CSF, blood cell-free and blood cell-bound samples.

AB  - This review brought together research investigating barriers asylum seekers and refugees (AS&R) face in accessing and negotiating mental health (MH) services. The candidacy framework (CF) was used as synthesizing argument to conceptualize barriers to services (Dixon-Woods et al. in BMC Med Res Methodol 6:35, 2006). Five databases were systematically searched. Twenty-three studies were included and analyzed using the CF. The seven stages of the framework were differentiated into two broader processes-access and negotiation of services. Comparatively more data was available on barriers to access than negotiation of services. The Identification of Candidacy (access) and Appearances at Services (negotiation) were the most widely discussed stages in terms of barriers to MH care. The stage that was least discussed was Adjudications (negotiation). The CF is useful to understand inter-related barriers to MH care experienced by AS&R. A holistic approach is needed to overcome these barriers together with further research investigating understudied areas of candidacy.

AB  - Sharing information about oneself, or self-disclosing, is a fundamental interpersonal process that facilitates the attainment of key developmental milestones during adolescence. Changes in self-disclosure behaviors may reflect or support the social reorientation that sees children become increasingly reliant on peers for social and emotional support. Neuroimaging research has highlighted protracted maturation of the structure and function of brain regions that support social cognitive and reward processes underlying self-disclosure during adolescence. This review explores behavioral and neural trends in self-disclosure during adolescence, including research that uses novel experimental paradigms to extend the field beyond self-report measures. Findings show that certain aspects of self-disclosure behavior have adapted to changing social environments, but they remain intrinsically valued across the adolescent period and are essential for relationship development, identity formation and overall self-worth and well-being.

AB  - Background Personality disorders are now internationally recognised as a mental health priority. Nevertheless, there are no systematic reviews examining the global prevalence of personality disorders. Aims To calculate the worldwide prevalence of personality disorders and examine whether rates vary between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Method We systematically searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed from January 1980 to May 2018 to identify articles reporting personality disorder prevalence rates in community populations (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017065094). Results A total of 46 studies (from 21 different countries spanning 6 continents) satisfied inclusion criteria. The worldwide pooled prevalence of any personality disorder was 7.8% (95% CI 6.1-9.5). Rates were greater in high-income countries (9.6%, 95% CI 7.9-11.3%) compared with LMICs (4.3%, 95% CI 2.6-6.1%). In univariate meta-regressions, significant heterogeneity was partly attributable to study design (two-stage v. one-stage assessment), county income (high-income countries v. LMICs) and interview administration (clinician v. trained graduate). In multiple meta-regression analysis, study design remained a significant predictor of heterogeneity. Global rates of cluster A, B and C personality disorders were 3.8% (95% CI 3.2, 4.4%), 2.8% (1.6, 3.7%) and 5.0% (4.2, 5.9%). Conclusions Personality disorders are prevalent globally. Nevertheless, pooled prevalence rates should be interpreted with caution due to high levels of heterogeneity. More large-scale studies with standardised methodologies are now needed to increase our understanding of population needs and regional variations.

AB  - In recent years, nanomaterials have been widely applied in electronics, food, biomedicine and other fields, resulting in increased human exposure and consequent research focus on their biological and toxic effects. Mitochondria, the main target organelle for nanomaterials (NM), play a critical role in their toxic activities. Several studies to date have shown that nanomaterials cause alterations in mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and mitochondrial respiratory function, and promote cytochrome C release. An earlier mitochondrial toxicity study of NMs additionally reported induction of mitochondrial dynamic changes. Here, we have reviewed the mitochondrial toxicity of NMs and provided a scientific basis for the contribution of mitochondria to the toxicological effects of different NMs along with approaches to reduce mitochondrial and, consequently, overall toxicity of NMs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim The prevalence of mental disorders increases sharply during adolescence. Therefore, school teachers are in a good position to provide initial assistance to students with mental health problems. Although effects of a number of mental health literacy programs aimed at teachers have been reported, they have not yet been reviewed in a systematic manner. This study conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of mental health literacy programs for teachers. Methods PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Web of Science and reference lists of included studies were searched in September 2018. Studies that quantitatively measured at least one of the main components of mental health literacy, including (a) knowledge of mental illnesses, (b) stigma towards mental illnesses, (c) confidence in helping students, and (d) behaviour of helping students, were included regardless of study design. Risk of bias was rated for each included study according to the Cochrane tool for randomized studies and the Cochrane tool, for raondomized studies, and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS), for nonrandomized studies. Results Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT), 2 cluster RCTs, 1 controlled before-and-after study and 12 case series. Most of the studies claimed significant improvement of knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and/or confidence. However, the overall quality for all outcomes was relatively low; 15 studies had high/unclear risk of bias due to lack of allocation concealment, not controlling for confounders, and/or inadequate analysis for attrition. Conclusions More high quality evidence is required before the effectiveness of mental health literacy programs for teachers can be established.

AB  - Aims: Voluntary admission rates of schizophrenia vary widely across studies. In order to make the topic be informed by evidence, it is important to have accurate estimates. This meta-analysis examined the worldwide prevalence of voluntary admissions for patients with schizophrenia.
   Method: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Medline databases were systematically searched, from their commencement date until 19th November 2018. Meta-analysis of included studies was performed using the random-effects model.
   Results: Thirty-five studies with 134,100 schizophrenia patients were included. The overall voluntary admission rate of schizophrenia was 61.9 % (95 %CI: 52.3 %-70.7 %), while the involuntary rate was 43.0 % (95 %CI: 34.8 %-51.7 %). Subgroup analyses revealed that patients in Europe had significantly higher voluntary admission rates, while their North American counterparts were more likely admitted involuntarily. Papers published prior to 2008 reported higher involuntary admission rates. Meta-regression analyses showed that higher male percentage and higher study quality were significantly associated with higher voluntary admission rate.
   Conclusion: Although the worldwide prevalence of voluntary admissions was higher than that of involuntary admissions, the latter was common for schizophrenia. With the continuing liberalization of mental health laws broadening community-based psychiatric services, the rate of voluntary psychiatric admissions is expected to further increase over time.

AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) released from plastics into water, soil and air are significant environmental and health problem. Continuous exposure of humans to these substances results not only from the slow biodegradation of plastics but also from their ubiquitous use as industrial materials and everyday products. Exposure to POPs may lead to neurodegenerative disorders, induce inflammation, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, insulin resistance, allergies, metabolic diseases, and carcinogenesis. This has spurred an increasing intense search for natural compounds with protective effects against the harmful components of plastics. In this paper, we discuss the current state of knowledge concerning the protective functions of polyphenols against the toxic effects of POPs: acrylonitrile, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, phthalates and bisphenol A. We review in detail papers from the last two decades, analyzing POPs in terms of their sources of exposure and demonstrate how polyphenols may be used to counteract the harmful environmental effects of POPs. The protective effect of polyphenols results from their impact on the level and activity of the components of the antioxidant system, enzymes involved in the elimination of xenobiotics, and as a consequence - on the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Polyphenols present in daily diet may play a protective role against the harmful effects of POPs derived from plastics, and this interaction is related, among others, to the antioxidant properties of these compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first extensive review of in vitro and in vivo studies concerning the molecular mechanisms of interactions between selected environmental toxins and polyphenols.

AB  - Background: Eating disorders (EDs) during the transition to adulthood can derail social, psychological, and vocational development. Effective treatment is of paramount importance, yet young adults' treatment needs are typically less well met than those of adolescents. In recent years, there has been a considerable shift in how developmental psychologists understand the transition to adulthood, with this life-phase reconceptualized as "emerging adulthood" (EA) (similar to 18-25 years). Engagement with burgeoning developmental research is likely key to providing more effective care for young people experiencing EDs.
   Aims: To review ED research which has utilized the concept of EA, and to assess the usefulness of this concept for ED research and practice.
   Methods: A systematic scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines for scoping reviews. Three databases (Psychinfo, PubMed, Embase) were searched for papers which explicitly focused on EDs during EA. No restrictions as to publication type, language, study design, or participants were applied. Included studies were assessed for developmental "informedness," and findings were qualitatively synthesized.
   Results: Thirty-six studies (N = 25,475) were included in the review. Most studies used quantitative methodologies, were cross-sectional in design and focused on identifying psychological and social factors which contribute to etiology of EDs. Many studies (N = 22) used well-defined samples of emerging adults (EAs); few studies (N = 8) included developmental measures relevant to EAs. Findings indicate that whilst factors implicated in EDs in adolescence and adulthood are relevant to EAs, EA-specific factors (e.g., identity exploration) may also contribute. Conventional ED services and treatments present difficulties for EAs, whilst those adapted to EAs' needs are feasible, acceptable, and more effective than treatment-as-usual. Directions for future research and clinical implications are discussed.
   Conclusion: Existing research indicates that the EA concept is relevant for understanding EDs during the transition to adulthood, and ED services should implement adaptations which exploit the opportunities and overcome the challenges of this developmental stage. EA is currently an underused concept in ED research, and future engagement with the developmental literature by both researchers and clinicians may be key to understanding and treating EDs during transition to adulthood.

KW  - Systematic review
AB  - Background Despite the widespread reliance on mobile clinics for delivering health services in humanitarian emergencies there is little empirical evidence to support their use. We report a narrative systematic review of the empirical evidence evaluating the use of mobile clinics in humanitarian settings. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Health Management Information Consortium, and The Cochrane Library for manuscripts published between 2000 and 2019. We also conducted a grey literature search via Global Health, Open Grey, and the WHO publication database. Empirical studies were included if they reported on at least one of the following evaluation criteria: relevance/appropriateness, connectedness, coherence, coverage, efficiency, effectiveness, and impact. Findings Five studies met the inclusion criteria: all supported the use of mobile clinics in the particular setting under study. Three studies included controls. Two studies were assessed as good quality. The studies reported on mobile clinics providing non-communicable disease interventions, mental health services, sexual and reproductive health services, and multiple primary health care services in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Haiti, and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Studies assessed one or more of the following evaluation domains: relevance/appropriateness, coverage, efficiency, and effectiveness. Four studies made recommendations including: i) ensure that mobile clinics are designed to complement clinic-based services; ii) improve technological tools to support patient follow-up, improve record-keeping, communication, and coordination; iii) avoid labelling services in a way that might stigmatise attendees; iv) strengthen referral to psychosocial and mental health services; v) partner with local providers to leverage resources; and vi) ensure strong coordination to optimise the continuum of care. Recommendations regarding the evaluation of mobile clinics include carrying out comparative studies of various modalities (including fixed facilities and community health workers) in order to isolate the effects of the mobile clinics. In the absence of a sound evidence base informing the use of mobile clinics in humanitarian crises, we encourage the integration of: i) WASH services, ii) nutrition services, iii) epidemic surveillance, and iv) systems to ensure the quality and safety of patient care. We recommend that future evaluations report against an established evaluation framework. Conclusion Evidence supporting the use of mobile clinics in humanitarian emergencies is limited. We encourage more studies of the use of mobile clinics in emergency settings.

AB  - Although the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology remains unknown, oxidative stress (OS) has been recognized as a prodromal factor associated to its progression. OS refers to an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant systems, which usually consist in an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) which overwhelms the intrinsic antioxidant defenses. Due to this increased production of ROS and RNS, several biological functions such as glucose metabolism or synaptic activity are impaired. In AD, growing evidence links the ROS-mediated damages with molecular targets including mitochondrial dynamics and function, protein quality control system, and autophagic pathways, affecting the proteostasis balance. In this scenario, OS should be considered as not only a major feature in the pathophysiology of AD but also a potential target to combat the progression of the disease. In this review, we will discuss the role of OS in mitochondrial dysfunction, protein quality control systems, and autophagy associated to AD and suggest innovative therapeutic strategies based on a better understanding of the role of OS and proteostasis.

AB  - Sensory abnormalities are commonly recognized as diagnostic criteria in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as reported in the last edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-V). About 90% of ASD individuals have atypical sensory experiences, described as both hyper- and hypo-reactivity, with abnormal responses to tactile stimulation representing a very frequent finding. In this review, we will address the neurobiological bases of sensory processing in ASD, with a specific focus of tactile sensitivity. In the first part, we will review the most relevant sensory abnormalities detected in ASD, and then focus on tactile processing deficits through the discussion of recent clinical and experimental studies. In the search for the neurobiological bases of ASD, several mouse models have been generated with knockout and humanized knockin mutations in many ASD-associated genes. Here, we will therefore give a brief overview of the anatomical structure of the mouse somatosensory system, and describe the somatosensory abnormalities so far reported in different mouse models of ASD. Understanding the neurobiological bases of sensory processing in ASD mouse models may represent an opportunity for a better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying sensory abnormalities, and for the development of novel effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is localized in cellular organelles of most neurons, but many of its physiological functions are only partially understood. alpha-syn accumulation is associated with Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy as well as other synucleinopathies; however, the exact pathomechanisms that underlie these neurodegenerative diseases remain elusive. In this review, we describe what is known about alpha-syn function and pathophysiological changes in different cellular structures and organelles, including what is known about its behavior as a prion-like protein. We summarize current knowledge of alpha-syn and its pathological forms, covering its effect on each organelle, including aggregation and toxicity in different model systems, with special interest on the mitochondria due to its relevance during the apoptotic process of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, we explore the effect that alpha-syn exerts by interacting with chromatin remodeling proteins that add or remove histone marks, up-regulate its own expression, and resume the impairment that alpha-syn induces in vesicular traffic by interacting with the endoplasmic reticulum. We then recapitulate the events that lead to Golgi apparatus fragmentation, caused by the presence of alpha-syn. Finally, we report the recent findings about the accumulation of alpha-syn, indirectly produced by the endolysosomal system. In conclusion, many important steps into the understanding of alpha-syn have been made using in vivo and in vitro models; however, the time is right to start integrating observational studies with mechanistic models of alpha-syn interactions, in order to look at a more complete picture of the pathophysiological processes underlying alpha-synucleinopathies.

AB  - Background: Despite several studies focusing on the negative aspects of general medicine, the speciality seems attractive for students. Researchers from the European General Practice Research Network created a group to study job satisfaction in general practice. The aim of this eight-country European study was to determine which positive view students have about general practice. Method: Systematic review of the literature from Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases. Articles published between 01/01/2000 and 12/31/2018 were searched and analysed by two researchers working blind. The data on satisfaction factors were extracted from the full text article used as verbatims. Then the data were coded with a thematic analysis. Results: 24 articles out of 414 were selected. Satisfaction factors were classified: teaching of general practice, workplace and organisational freedom, quality of life, variety in practice, workload balance and income. The analysis highlighted intellectual stimulation and the relationship built with patients and other professionals. Conclusion: Literature on the appeal of general practice for students revealed many factors of job satisfaction in general practice. It is possible to create a global view of a satisfied GP on the students' opinion. Courses and clerkships in general practice with positive role models are determining factors in career choice.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species are generated as a by-product of routine biochemical reactions. However, dysfunction of the antioxidant system or mutations in gene function may result in the elevated production of the pro-oxidant species. Modified endogenous molecules due to chemical interactions with increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the cellular microenvironment can be termed as biomarkers of oxidative stress. 3-Nitrotyrosine is one such promising biomarker of oxidative stress formed due to nitration of protein-bound and free tyrosine residues by reactive peroxynitrite molecules. Nitration of proteins at the subcellular level results in conformational alterations that damage the cytoskeleton and result in neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarized the role of oxidative/nitrosative processes as a contributing factor for progressive neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease and Prion disease. The selective tyrosine protein nitration of the major marker proteins in related pathologies has been discussed. The alteration in 3-Nitrotyrosine profile occurs well before any symptoms appear and can be considered as a potential target for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the reduction in 3-Nitrotyrosine levels in response to treatment with neuroprotective has been highlighted which is indicative of the importance of this particular marker in oxidative stress-related brain and central nervous system pathologies.

AB  - Background: The transition from psychiatric hospital to community is often hindered by challenges that influence community adjustment and continuity of care. Transitional interventions with bridging components are provided prior to discharge and continue beyond inpatient care. They provide continuity of care and may be effective in preventing readmission. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of transitional interventions with predischarge and postdischarge components in reducing readmissions and improving health-related or social outcomes of patients discharged from psychiatric hospitals.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Psyndex) and included randomized, nonrandomized, and one-group study designs. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting data on readmission rates. Other study designs were synthesized qualitatively.
   Results: After screening 2,673 publications, 16 studies (10 RCTs, three quasi-experimental, and three cohort studies) were included and nine RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The tested interventions included components from case management, psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and peer support. All studies with significant improvements in at least one outcome provided elements of case management, most frequently in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoeducation. Readmission rates during follow-up ranged between 13% and 63% in intervention groups and 19% and 69% in control groups. Overall, we found an odds ratio of 0.76 (95% confidence interval = 0.55-1.05) for readmission due to transitional interventions. Heterogeneity was low at only 31% (p = 0.17) and the funnel plot indicated no obvious publication biases.
   Conclusions: We observed that transitional interventions with bridging components were no more effective in reducing readmission than treatment as usual; however, these results are based on limited evidence. Therefore, additional high-quality research is required to conclude the effectiveness of transitional interventions. Nevertheless, transitional interventions with bridging components are preferred by service users and could be an alternative to strategies regularly employed.

AB  - The use of biomarkers in medicine is a common and valuable approach in several clinical fields. Understanding the relationship between measurable biological processes and clinical outcomes not only is indispensable in the face of understanding physiological processes in healthy as well as in diseased organisms but also for understanding and evaluating treatment effects. Therefore, also in the context of forensic psychiatry, biomarkers and their potentially beneficial effects are of growing interest. The objective of this review is to examine if there are biomarkers that may serve as a tool to support diagnostic process, treatment evaluation, and risk assessment of pedophilic individuals and child sexual offenders. In the first part, we present an overview of the current neurobiological, as well as physiological and psychophysiological approaches to characterize pedophilia and child sexual offending. Secondly, we discuss and evaluate the impact of these approaches on the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, therapy, and risk assessment in pedophilic subjects and child sexual offenders. We conclude that a lot of research has already enhanced our neurobiological knowledge about pedophilia and child sexual offending. Although there surely exist promising parameters and approaches, in our view currently none of these is ready yet to serve as a clinically applicable diagnostic, response, or predictive biomarker for pedophilia and child sexual offending. Therefore, further work remains to be done. The development of a composite diagnostic biomarker to assess deviant sexual interest, combining several measures like functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, eye tracking, and behavioral approaches seems to be most promising. A valid and reliable measurement of deviant sexual interest, insensitive to manipulations could significantly support clinical diagnostic process. Similarly, regarding therapy evaluation and risk assessment, a composite biomarker to assess inhibitory control functions seems to be promising. Furthermore, the application of the Research Domain Criteria-approach, a new approach for investigating and classifying mental disorders, offers the possibility to take research to a new level.

AB  - At present, prevention is particularly important when there is no effective treatment for cognitive decline. Since the adverse events of pharmacological interventions counterbalance the benefits, nonpharmacological approaches seem desirable to prevent cognitive decline. To our knowledge, no meta-analyses have been published on nonpharmacological interventions preventing cognitive decline. To investigate whether nonpharmacological interventions play a role in preventing cognitive decline among older people, we searched related trials up to March 31, 2019, in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials and the Cochrane library databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they enrolled participants older than 60 years of age who had a risk of cognitive decline, and the interventions were nonpharmacological. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the quality of evidence. Heterogeneity was quantified with I-2. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to research the sources of heterogeneity. Influence analyses were used to detect and remove extreme effect sizes (outliers) in our meta-analysis. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger test. Primary outcomes were the incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores. Second outcomes were activities of daily living (ADL) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. A total of 22 studies with 13,264 participants were identified for analysis. In terms of prevention, nonpharmacological interventions appeared to be more effective than control conditions, as assessed by the incidence of MCI or dementia (RR, 0.73; CI, 0.55-0.96; moderate-certainty evidence), while the results of ADAS-Cog suggested no significant differences between two groups (MD, -0.69; CI, -1.52-0.14; very low-certainty evidence). Second outcomes revealed a significant improvement from nonpharmacological interventions versus control in terms of the change in ADL (MD, 0.73; CI, 0.65-0.80) and MMSE scores (posttreatment scores: MD, 0.25; CI, 0.02-0.47; difference scores: MD, 0.59, CI, 0.29-0.88). Univariable meta-regression showed association between lower case of MCI or dementia and two subgroup factors (P = 0.013 for sample size; P = 0.037 for area). Multiple meta-regression suggested that these four subgroup factors were not associated with decreased incidence of MCI (P > 0.05 for interaction). The Naive RR estimate was calculated as 0.73. When the three studies that detected by outlier and influence analysis were left out, the Robust RR was 0.66. In conclusion, nonpharmacological therapy could have an indicative role in reducing the case of MCI or dementia. However, given the heterogeneity of the included RCTs, more preregistered trials are needed that explicitly examine the association between nonpharmacological therapy and cognitive decline prevention, and consider relevant moderators.

AB  - Background: Dual diagnosis (DD), as the co-occurrence of a substance use disorder and a psychiatric disorder, is underestimated, under-diagnosed and often poorly treated throughout the world, although it is highly prevalent in people suffering from a mental disorder. Aims and methods: This review analyzed 48 studies from a PubMed and PsycINFO databases search, in order to verify the state of the art regarding the organization of community health services for DD treatment. Results: Four macro-themes have been identified: service organization, critical issues, assessment tools and evidence-based interventions. An effective service recognizes the complexity of DD, promotes a common staff culture, and tailors the organization to local needs. The main critical issues in its implementation include the lack of specific staff training, the poor management of resources and the need for greater personalization of care plans, with attention to psychosocial interventions. Integrated service assessment tools can be used as a benchmark measure at the program level for implementation planning and at the national level to affect policy change. The integrated treatment model for DD should also aim to improve access to care and offer treatments based on scientific evidence. It is also evident that the integration of services can improve outcomes but it is not a guarantee for it. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to improve networking between mental health and addiction services in order to deal with DD and create new integrated intervention models, paying attention to an approach to the whole person, seen in his/her absolute uniqueness.

AB  - Molecular chaperones have a role to stabilize proteins or assist them in reaching their native fold. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of molecular chaperons that protect proteins from cellular stress during the assembly of protein complexes and also prevent the proteins from aggregation and disassembly. The immediate increase of HSPs is crucial for cellular adaptation to environmental changes and protection of other proteins from denaturation, thereby maintaining the cellular homeostasis and increasing the longevity of an organism. HSP70 and HSP90 are the most studied HSPs in this very large HSP family. Notably, HSP90 also stabilizes the disease-related proteins in neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, small molecules that inhibit the HSP90 but also increase the HSP70 has been tested as potential drugs for neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - How genes and environment interact to cause birth defects is not well understood, but key to developing new strategies to modify risk. The threshold model has been proposed to represent this complex interaction. This model stipulates that while environmental exposure or genetic mutation alone may not result in a defect, factors in combination increase phenotypic variability resulting in more individuals crossing the disease threshold where birth defects manifest. Many environmental factors that contribute to birth defects induce widespread cellular stress and misfolding of proteins. Yet, the impact of the stress response on the threshold model is not typically considered in discephering the etiology of birth defects. This mini-review will explore a potential mechanism for gene-environment interactions co-opted from studies of evolution. This model stipulates that heat shock proteins that mediate the stress response induced by environmental factors can influence the number of individuals that cross disease thresholds resulting in increased incidence of birth defects. Studies in the field of evolutionary biology have demonstrated that heat shock proteins and Hsp90 in particular provide a link between environmental stress, genotype and phenotype. Hsp90 is a highly expressed molecular chaperone that assists a wide variety of protein clients with folding and conformational changes needed for proper function. Hsp90 also chaperones client proteins with potentially deleterious amino acid changes to suppress variation caused by genetic mutations. However, upon exposure to stress, Hsp90 abandons its normal physiological clients and is diverted to assist with the misfolded protein response. This can impact the activity of signaling pathways that involve Hsp90 clients as well as unmask suppressed protein variation, essentially creating complex traits in a single step. In this capacity Hsp90 acts as an evolutionary capacitor allowing stored variation to accumulate and then become expressed in times of stress. This mechanism provides a substrate which natural selection can act upon at the population level allowing survival of the species with selective pressure. However, at the level of the individual, this mechanism can result in simultaneous expression of deleterious variants as well as reduced activity of a variety of Hsp90 chaperoned pathways, potentially shifting phenotypic variability over the disease threshold resulting in birth defects.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a progressive and heterogeneous inherited peripheral neuropathy. A myriad of genetic factors have been identified that contribute to the degeneration of motor and sensory axons in a length-dependent manner. Emerging biological themes underlying disease include defects in axonal trafficking, dysfunction in RNA metabolism and protein homeostasis, as well deficits in the cellular stress response. Moreover, genetic contributions to CMT can have overlap with other neuropathies, motor neuron diseases (MNDs) and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent progress in understanding the molecular biology of CMT and overlapping syndromes aids in the search for necessary therapeutic targets.

AB  - The popularity of social networking sites (SNSs) has prompted researchers to investigate the relationship between SNS use and various psychological variables, one being, self-esteem. There is a large literature, theoretical and empirical, supporting a relationship between these two variables, however, the conclusions are mixed; some research finds that SNS use and self-esteem are negatively associated, while some find that they are positively associated. To clarify this relationship, a meta-analysis was conducted. A systematic literature search identified 121 independent samples. An overall effect size of r = -.079 (N = 91,462, 95% CI [-.107, -.050]) was obtained, indicated a small, negative, and significant relationship between SNS use and self-esteem. Moderator analyses revealed that this relationship was stronger in studies investigating problematic SNS use. The authors argue that these results suggest a need for additional research investigating more nuanced classifications of SNS use, as well as positive aspects of SNS use.

AB  - Background Due to the restrictions and stigmatization of homosexuality in China, there has emerged the "Tongqi," or the wives of men who have sex with men (MSM). There are around 14 million Tongqi wives whose needs for support are often overshadowed. This phenomenon has been largely under researched, this review is the first to address the current data on the Tongqi. The aim of this systematic review is to begin to provide insight into the pre-existing data and the further support that is needed for the wives of MSM. Methods The researchers searched PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CNKI, Sinomed and WangFang databases from their inception date until June 7, 2019. Handsearching was also completed to provide a rich data set. Results The articles were summarized and analyzed for thematic clusters. From the selected article, five themes emerged, including Sexual Health Issues, Intimate Partner Violence, Mental Health Status, Marriage Dissatisfaction, and Coping Strategies. These themes often intersected to provide a complex understanding of the current gaps in support provided to Tongqi. Conclusion Tongqi wives remain a hidden population in Chinese mainstream society, who deserves a sensitive approach to support. The study revealed that the MSM wives suffer severe mental, physical, health, and life related harms. However, instead of situating them into the victim roles, many women take on an identity of empowerment and are working together, aiming to make social changes. In order to address the Tongqi phenomenon, it is also essential to reduce the discrimination toward homosexuality. Tongqi are a special group of Chinese women, they require further intensive research attention.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder with disabling motor symptoms and no available disease modifying treatment. The majority of the PD cases are of unknown etiology, with both genetics and environment playing important roles. Over the past 25 years, however, genetic analysis of patients with familial history of Parkinson's and, latterly, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have provided significant advances in our understanding of the causes of the disease. These genetic insights have uncovered pathways that are affected in both genetic and sporadic forms of PD. These pathways involve oxidative stress, abnormal protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal defects. In addition, newly identified PD genes and GWAS nominated genes point toward synaptic changes involving vesicles. This review will highlight the genes that contribute PD risk relating to intracellular vesicle trafficking and their functional consequences. There is still much to investigate on this newly identified and converging pathway of vesicular dynamics and PD, which will aid in better understanding and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for PD patients.

AB  - Background In recent years, the existence of possible developmental pathways from childhood Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to adult Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) has been suggested. The existence of common genetic factors has been described but there is little evidence on the role of environmental factors in the possible transition from one disorder to another throughout life. The main goal of this work is to review the literature about the existing evidence on childhood traumas as factors that mediate the risk of developing BPD in children with ADHD. Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Science Direct and PsychInfo databases. Criteria included studies of BPD and ADHD relationships and childhood traumas as environmental influences from epidemiological or clinical samples. Results The review only identified 4 studies that matched the search criteria. All studies retrospectively analyzed childhood traumas, and adult patients with BPD, with or without comorbid ADHD, were the most frequently mentioned. The analyzed evidence reinforces the relationship between the number of childhood traumas and higher clinical severity. Three of these analyzed studies describe an increased the risk of children with ADHD who report emotional and sexual traumatic experiences to develop BPD in adulthood. Conclusions The experience of traumatic childhood events, especially those of an emotional type, may have a mediating effect of an increased risk of developing adult BPD in childhood ADHD patients. However, to consider them as risk factors, more studies, and especially longitudinal studies, are necessary to clarify the probable transactional process between the two disorders. Evidence from these studies may be helpful to develop early intervention programs to reduce the functional impairment associated with the two disorders.

AB  - There are presently more than 18 known aflatoxins most of which have been insufficiently studied for their incidence, health-risk, and mechanisms of toxicity to allow effective intervention and control means that would significantly and sustainably reduce their incidence and adverse effects on health and economy. Among these, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) has been by far the most studied; yet, many aspects of the range and mechanisms of the diseases it causes remain to be elucidated. Its mutagenicity, tumorigenicity, and carcinogenicity-which are the best known-still suffer from limitations regarding the relative contribution of the oxidative stress and the reactive epoxide derivative (Aflatoxin-exo 8,9-epoxide) in the induction of the diseases, as well as its metabolic and synthesis pathways. Additionally, despite the well-established additive effects for carcinogenicity between AFB1 and other risk factors, e.g., hepatitis viruses B and C, and the hepatotoxic algal microcystins, the mechanisms of this synergy remain unclear. This study reviews the most recent advances in the field of the mechanisms of toxicity of aflatoxins and the adverse health effects that they cause in humans and animals.

AB  - Children and adolescents are not meeting the required federal physical activity (PA) guidelines established by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. It is critical that a regular pattern of PA is established in their youth to ensure ongoing PA into adulthood. However, many programs implemented during adolescence have shown limited effects, stressing the need for more innovative approaches to generate more interest and maintenance of PA behavior in this age group. Active video games (AVGs) or exergaming may prove to be an innovate process to improve PA in children and adolescents. A literature review was conducted to explore if active video games or exergaming could be an effective intervention to improve physical activity in adolescents. Active video games, also called "exergames", are a category of video games that require movement or physical exertion to play the game. The methodology consisted of searching Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, ERIC, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria involved only youth aged 12 to 19 years, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and studies within the last 12 years. The following search terms were used: exergaming or active video games; physical activity or exercise; adolescents or youth; RCT or randomized clinical trial. The outcome indicates that exergaming or active video games can be an effective tool to improve PA in adolescents that will be more acceptable and sustainable than many conventional approaches.

AB  - Objectives: Low back pain (LBP) has a major impact on health workers, and its prevalence and risk factors among them in Saudi Arabia have been investigated previously. However, the results have never been comprehensively reviewed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to identify the prevalence and risk factors of LBP among health workers in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Saudi peer-reviewed journals were searched for relevant literature. After quality assessment of the eligible articles, 18 studies targeting seven occupational categories, with a total number of 5345 health workers, were analyzed.
   Results: Pooled prevalence rates of 40.8% (n = 7 studies), 65.0% (n = 13 studies), and 81.4% (n = 2 studies) were obtained for week, year, and career, respectively, across all professional groups. Nurses and physical therapists were more susceptible to LBP, in that order, than the other categories considering week and career periods. Age, body mass index, and female gender were the most commonly reported individual risk factors. Occupational risk factors mainly included work-related activities requiring back bending and twisting, lifting and pulling objects, and manual patient-handling.
   Conclusions: The results of this review indicate that LBP is highly prevalent among health workers in Saudi Arabia when compared with international rates. Proper prophylactic measures are necessary to reduce LBP and minimize its consequences. Further high-quality research is needed in different Saudi regions to achieve a broader understanding of LBP prevalence and causes.

AB  - Background: In 2013, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) was introduced in the DSM-5 in part to curb the rapid rise in the rates of bipolar diagnosis among children and adolescents during the decade before the DSM-5 publication. DMDD proved to be a controversial diagnosis for many reasons.
   Objective: This brief review aims to provide an overview of the DMDD diagnosis and its origins and summarize available data on the impact of the introduction of the DMDD diagnosis on the rates of bipolar disorder among children and adolescents.
   Methods: Multiple scientific databases were searched using the related terms "DMDD", "Disruptive Mood Dysregulation", and "pediatric bipolar disorder" in combination with the terms "diagnosis" and "impact". The retrieved articles were reviewed carefully.
   Results: The DMDD diagnosis rates have steadily increased since its introduction. Furthermore, available data show a decrease in the rates of bipolar disorder diagnosis among children and adolescents over the past few years.
   Conclusion: The very limited available data since 2013 show a decline in the diagnosis of bipolar disorder among children and adolescents. More time and further research are needed to more accurately determine the impact of the DMDD diagnosis on the rates of bipolar disorder in this population.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease and related dementias lack effective treatment or cures and are major public health challenges. Risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is partially attributable to environmental factors. The heavy metals lead, cadmium, and manganese are widespread and persistent in our environments. Once persons are exposed to these metals, they are adept at entering cells and reaching the brain. Lead and cadmium are associated with numerous health outcomes even at low levels of exposure. Although manganese is an essential metal, deficiency or environmental exposure or high levels of the metal can be toxic. In cell and animal model systems, lead, cadmium, and manganese are well documented neurotoxicants that contribute to canonical Alzheimer's disease pathologies. Adult human epidemiologic studies have consistently shown lead, cadmium, and manganese are associated with impaired cognitive function and cognitive decline. No longitudinal human epidemiology study has assessed lead or manganese exposure on Alzheimer's disease specifically though two studies have reported a link between cadmium and Alzheimer's disease mortality. More longitudinal epidemiologic studies with high-quality time course exposure data and incident cases of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are warranted to confirm and estimate the proportion of risk attributable to these exposures. Given the widespread and global exposure to lead, cadmium, and manganese, even small increases in the risks of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias would have a major population impact on the burden on disease. This article reviews the experimental and epidemiologic literature of the associations between lead, cadmium, and manganese on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and makes recommendations of critical areas of future investment.

AB  - Purpose of review Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is prevalent, debilitating and clinically challenging. The evolving field of intervention and outcomes in BPD research is considered with a focus on recent research. Recent findings A pattern of clinical and functional improvement is to be expected in patients experiencing BPD. Specialized psychotherapies are shown to be beneficial, but generalist, low-intensity interventions in nonspecialized centres are also showing efficacy. Long-term naturalistic studies show that remission of the disorder is common and promising outcomes are not only possible, but likely. Training in vocational functioning, improving personal competence and promoting resilience needs to be further developed. BPD diagnosis does not need to overwhelm clinicians, nor does it require therapeutic pessimism. Targeted interventions, including meaningful psychoeducation, are helpful in promoting optimism and enhancing recovery-oriented treatments.

AB  - Objectives To estimate COVID-19 infections and deaths in healthcare workers (HCWs) from a global perspective during the early phases of the pandemic. Design Systematic review. Methods Two parallel searches of academic bibliographic databases and grey literature were undertaken until 8 May 2020. Governments were also contacted for further information where possible. There were no restrictions on language, information sources used, publication status and types of sources of evidence. The AACODS checklist or the National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools were used to appraise each source of evidence. Outcome measures Publication characteristics, country-specific data points, COVID-19-specific data, demographics of affected HCWs and public health measures employed. Results A total of 152 888 infections and 1413 deaths were reported. Infections were mainly in women (71.6%, n=14 058) and nurses (38.6%, n=10 706), but deaths were mainly in men (70.8%, n=550) and doctors (51.4%, n=525). Limited data suggested that general practitioners and mental health nurses were the highest risk specialities for deaths. There were 37.2 deaths reported per 100 infections for HCWs aged over 70 years. Europe had the highest absolute numbers of reported infections (119 628) and deaths (712), but the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest number of reported deaths per 100 infections (5.7). Conclusions COVID-19 infections and deaths among HCWs follow that of the general population around the world. The reasons for gender and specialty differences require further exploration, as do the low rates reported in Africa and India. Although physicians working in certain specialities may be considered high risk due to exposure to oronasal secretions, the risk to other specialities must not be underestimated. Elderly HCWs may require assigning to less risky settings such as telemedicine or administrative positions. Our pragmatic approach provides general trends, and highlights the need for universal guidelines for testing and reporting of infections in HCWs.

AB  - Homelessness is a devastating experience for children and their families. Families, the majority of whose members are children, now comprise more than one-third of the overall US homeless population. Most of these children are less than six years old. Various assumptions have driven policy and the allocation of resources to programs serving these families. Although decades of research and field experience suggest strategies for preventing and reducing this problem, perspectives differ, hindering the development of effective solutions. In this article, we explore some of these assumptions, including (a) definitions of homelessness used to count the numbers of families and determine resource allocation, (b) the needs of children and responses to the impact of adverse childhood experiences, and (c) whether services matter and should be integrated with affordable housing. We conclude by suggesting various directions to ensure that these children are protected and have the opportunity to grow and thrive.

AB  - Centuries of experience make it clear that establishing the effectiveness of a clinical innovation is not sufficient to guarantee its uptake into routine use. The relatively new field of implementation science has developed to enhance the uptake of evidence-based practices and thereby increase their public health impact.
   Implementation science shares many characteristics, and the rigorous approach, of clinical research. However, it is distinct in that it attends to factors in addition to the effectiveness of the clinical innovation itself, to include identifying and addressing barriers and facilitators to the uptake of evidence-based clinical innovations.
   This article reviews the definition, history, and scope of implementation science, and places the field within the broader enterprise of biomedical research. It also provides an overview of this Special Issue of Psychiatry Research, which introduces the principles and methods of implementation science to mental health researchers.

AB  - This review delineates core components of the social media ecosystem, specifying how online platforms complicate established social psychological effects. We assess four pairs of social media elements and effects: profiles and self-presentation; networks and social mobilization; streams and social comparison; and messages and social connectedness. In the process, we describe features and affordances that comprise each element, underscoring the complexity of social media contexts as they shift to a central topic within psychology. Reflecting on this transitional state, we discuss how researchers will struggle to replicate the effects of dynamic social environments. Consequently, we outline the obstacles in isolating effects that reoccur across platforms, as well as the challenges and opportunities that come with measuring contexts across periods. By centering on the elements that define the online ecosystem, psychological research can establish a more durable foundation for replicating the effects of social media and chronicling the evolution of social interaction.

AB  - Background There are reports of outbreaks of COVID-19 in prisons in many countries. Responses to date have been highly variable and it is not clear whether public health guidance has been informed by the best available evidence. We conducted a systematic review to synthesise the evidence on outbreaks of highly contagious diseases in prison. Methods We searched seven electronic databases for peer-reviewed articles and official reports published between 1 January 2000 and 28 July 2020. We included quantitative primary research that reported an outbreak of a given contagious disease in a correctional facility and examined the effects of interventions. We excluded studies that did not provide detail on interventions. We synthesised common themes using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guideline, identified gaps in the literature and critically appraised the effectiveness of various containment approaches. Results We identified 28 relevant studies. Investigations were all based in high-income countries and documented outbreaks of tuberculosis, influenza (types A and B), varicella, measles, mumps, adenovirus and COVID-19. Several themes were common to these reports, including the public health implications of infectious disease outbreaks in prison, and the role of interagency collaboration, health communication, screening for contagious diseases, restriction, isolation and quarantine, contact tracing, immunisation programmes, epidemiological surveillance and prison-specific guidelines in addressing any outbreaks. Discussion Prisons are high-risk settings for the transmission of contagious diseases and there are considerable challenges in managing outbreaks in them. A public health approach to managing COVID-19 in prisons is required. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020178827

AB  - The neurobiological underpinnings of stuttering, a speech disorder characterized by disrupted speech fluency, remain unclear. While recent developments in the field have afforded researchers the ability to pinpoint several genetic profiles associated with stuttering, how these specific genetic backgrounds impact neuronal circuits and how they generate or facilitate the emergence of stuttered speech remains unknown. In this study, we identified the large-scale cortical network that characterizes stuttering using functional connectivity MRI and graph theory. We performed a spatial similarity analysis that examines whether the topology of the stuttering cortical network intersects with genetic expression levels of previously reported genes for stuttering from the protein-coding transcriptome data of the Allen Human Brain Atlas. We found that GNPTG - a gene involved in the mannose-6-phosphate lysosomal targeting pathways - was significantly co-localized with the stuttering cortical network. An enrichment analysis demonstrated that the genes identified with the stuttering cortical network shared a significantly overrepresented biological functionality of Neurofilament Cytoskeleton Organization (NEFH, NEFL and INA). The relationship between lysosomal pathways, cytoskeleton organization, and stuttering, was investigated by comparing the genetic interactome between GNPTG and the neurofilament genes implicated in the current study. We found that genes of the interactome network, including CDK5, SNCA, and ACTS, act as functional links between lysosomal and neurofilament genes. These findings support the notion that stuttering is due to a lysosomal dysfunction, which has deleterious effects on the neurofilament organization of the speech neuronal circuits. They help to elucidate the intriguing, unsolved link between lysosomal mutations and the presence of stuttering.

AB  - Background: Wearable technology (WT) to measure and support social and non-social functioning in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been a growing interest of researchers over the past decade. There is however limited understanding of the WTs currently available for autistic individuals, and how they measure functioning in this population.
   Objective: This scoping review explored the use of WTs for measuring and supporting abilities, disabilities and functional skills in autistic youth.
   Method: Four electronic databases were searched to identify literature investigating the use of WT in autistic youth, resulting in a total of 33 studies being reviewed. Descriptive and content analysis was conducted, with studies subsequently mapped to the ASD International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Core-sets and the ICF Child and Youth Version (ICF-CY).
   Results: Studies were predominately pilot studies for novel devices. WTs measured a range of physiological and behavioural functions to objectively measure stereotypical motor movements, social function, communication, and emotion regulation in autistic youth in the context of a range of environments and activities.
   Conclusions: While this review raises promising prospects for the use of WTs for autistic youth, the current evidence is limited and requires further investigation.

AB  - Increased reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative conditions including among others Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Friedrich's ataxia, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. The endogenous antioxidant response pathway protects cells from oxidative stress by increasing the expression of cytoprotective enzymes and is regulated by the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). In addition to regulating the expression of antioxidant genes, NRF2 has also been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and modulate both mitochondrial function and biogenesis. This is because mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation are features of many neurodegenerative diseases as well NRF2 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we review evidence for a beneficial role of NRF2 in neurodegenerative conditions and the potential of specific NRF2 activators as therapeutic agents.

AB  - Pain is a very frequent symptom with influence on the quality of life in Parkinson's disease (PD), but is still underdiagnosed and commonly treated only unsystematically. Pain etiology and pain character are often complex and multi causal, and data regarding treatment recommendations are limited. Pain can be primarily related to PD but frequently it is associated with secondary diseases, such as arthrosis of the spine or joints. However, even basically PD-unrelated pain often is amplified by motoror non-motor PD symptoms, such as akinesia or depression. Beyond an optimization of anti-parkinsonian treatment, additional pain treatment strategies are usually needed to properly address pain in PD. A careful pain history and diagnostic work-up is essential to rate the underlying pain pathophysiology and to develop a targeted therapeutic concept. This review gives an overview on how pain is treated in PD patients and how patients assess the effectiveness of these therapies; here, the manuscript focuses on pathophysiology-driven suggestions for a multimodal pain management in clinical practice.

AB  - Introduction: The philosophy and practice of occupational therapy is subjective and this provides a challenge in reflecting the essence of practice within research methodologies for this profession. The individualistic practice of client centredness and the importance of context are core elements of occupational therapy. Objective: The aim is to conduct a descriptive analysis of contemporary use of case study research in occupational therapy based on selected articles using this methodology. Method: An integrative literature review was carried out to explore contemporary occupational therapy application of case study as an approach. The search comprised the publications between 2006-2016, containing the keywords: "case study method", "case study approach" and "case study methodology" were combined with "occupational therapy" in the following databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE and PSYCHINFO, and Royal College of Occupational Therapistsonline dissertation database. Results: Thirty-two papers were synthesised; the studies predominantly featured mixed method data gathering as would be expected within a case study approach. There was a global uptake of the case study approach; UK, Canada, USA, Australia, Qatar, Brazil and Hong Kong in order of incidence. There was a relatively equal division between explanatory case studies and exploratory case studies. Conclusion: The case study approach is a strongly viable and acceptable research tool to reflect the elements of occupational therapy practice and enhance the evidence-based practice of this profession. Occupational therapy research would benefit from a higher number of case study designs to reflect the complexity, subjectivity and person centredness of the profession.

AB  - Background Several healthcare systems facing respiratory viral infections outbreaks, like COVID-19, have not been prepared to manage them. Public health mitigation solutions ranging from isolation of infected or suspected cases to implementation of national lockdowns have proven their effectiveness for the outbreak's control. However, the adjustment of public health measures is crucial during transition phases to avoid new outbreaks. To address the need for designing evidence-based strategies, we performed a systematic review to identify healthcare systems interventions, experiences and recommendations that have been used to manage different respiratory viral infections outbreaks in the past. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane were searched to retrieve eligible studies of any study design, published in English until 17 April 2020. Double-blinded screening process was conducted by titles/abstracts and subsequently eligible full texts were read and pertinent data were extracted. When applicable, quality assessment was conducted for the included articles. We performed a narrative synthesis of each implemented public health approaches. Results We included a total of 24 articles addressing the public health approaches implemented for respiratory viral infections outbreaks for COVID-19, influenza A H1N1, MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome. The identified approaches are ascribable to two main categories: healthcare system strategies and healthcare provider interventions. The key components of an effective response on respiratory viral outbreaks included the implementation of evidence-based contextual policies, intrahospital management actions, community healthcare facilities, non-pharmaceutical interventions, enhanced surveillance, workplace preventive measures, mental health interventions and communication plans. Conclusion The identified healthcare system strategies applied worldwide to face epidemics or pandemics are a useful knowledge base to inform decision-makers about control measures to be used in the transition phases of COVID-19 and beyond.

AB  - Background: Epidemiologic studies have provided inconclusive evidence for a protective effect of caffeine consumption on risk of dementia and cognitive decline.
   Objective: To summarize literature on the association between caffeine and 1) the risk of dementia and/or cognitive decline, and 2) cognitive performance in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, and 3) to examine the effect of study characteristics by categorizing studies based on caffeine source, quantity and other possible confounders.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review of caffeine effects by assessing overall study outcomes; positive, negative or no effect. Our literature search identified 61 eligible studies performed between 1990 and 2020.
   Results: For studies analyzing the association between caffeine and the risk of dementia and/or cognitive decline, 16/57 (28%) studies including a total of 40,707/153,070 (27%) subjects reported positive study outcomes, and 30/57 (53%) studies including 71,219/153,070 (47%) subjects showed positive results that were dependent on study characteristics. Caffeine effects were more often positive when consumed in moderate quantities (100-400 mg/d), consumed in coffee or green tea, and in women. Furthermore, four studies evaluated the relationship between caffeine consumption and cognitive function in cognitively impaired individuals and the majority (3/4 [75%]) of studies including 272/289 subjects (94%) reported positive outcomes.
   Conclusion: This review suggests that caffeine consumption, especially moderate quantities consumed through coffee or green tea and in women, may reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline, and may ameliorate cognitive decline in cognitively impaired individuals.

AB  - Aims To identify and synthesise the literature on the cost of mental disorders. Methods Systematic literature searches were conducted in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, EconLit, NHS York Database and PsychInfo using key terms for cost and mental disorders. Searches were restricted to January 1980-May 2019. The inclusion criteria were: (1) cost-of-illness studies or cost-analyses; (2) diagnosis of at least one mental disorder; (3) study population based on the general population; (4) outcome in monetary units. The systematic review was preregistered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42019127783). Results In total, 13 579 potential titles and abstracts were screened and 439 full-text articles were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Of these, 112 articles were included from the systematic searches and 31 additional articles from snowball searching, resulting in 143 included articles. Data were available from 48 countries and categorised according to nine mental disorder groups. The quality of the studies varied widely and there was a lack of studies from low- and middle-income countries and for certain types of mental disorders (e.g. intellectual disabilities and eating disorders). Our study showed that certain groups of mental disorders are more costly than others and that these rankings are relatively stable between countries. An interactive data visualisation site can be found here:https://nbepi.com/econ. Conclusions This is the first study to provide a comprehensive overview of the cost of mental disorders worldwide.

AB  - Background: Cariprazine is a new atypical antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.
   Methods: we searched the published randomized controlled-trials (RCT) to review cariprazine efficacy and tolerability using the databases (PubMed, EUDRACT, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) for cariprazine role in managing the following psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia, bipolar mania, bipolar depression and major depressive disorder). A meta-analysis was conducted using the identified 13 clinical trials to assess efficacy using with the outcomes: positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), clinical global impressions - severity of Illness (CGI-S), young mania rating scales (YMRS), Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) and Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D). The risk of discontinuation due to adverse effects and common side effects were examined.
   Results: The mean difference in change from baseline for PANSS was -6.23 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -7.18, -5.28) favoring cariprazine treatment (p<0.00001). Similarly, mean difference for CGI-S was -0.36 (95% CI -0.41, -0.30), YMRS -5.64 (95% CI 6.86, -4.43), MADRS -1.43 (95% CI -1.88, -0.99) and HAM-D -1.52 (95% CI -2.28, -0.76). The risk ratio (RR) of discontinuing due to adverse events was 1.18 (95% CI 1.01, 1.38) meaning risk increased by 18% in cariprazine group with RR for EPS related side effects 2.82 (95% CI 2.47, 3.22) reflecting an increased risk of experiencing EPS related side effects by 182%. Cariprazine was also associated with an increased incidence of side effects such as akathisia, nausea and insomnia.
   Conclusion: Cariprazine demonstrates significant improvements in symptom intensity control in patients suffering from psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and depression and is considered well-tolerated with similar rates of trials discontinuation; however, cariprazine was associated with a higher risk of EPS side effects. These findings will guide psychiatrists and pharmacists in their clinical role for supporting psychiatric patients care.

AB  - Introduction
   Global public health is challenged by two concurrent epidemics; COVID-19 and obesity. Considering the global prevalence of obesity, exploring relationships with COVID-19 are of clinical importance. The aim was to provide a comprehensive summary and recommendations on this relationship between COVID-19 and obesity.
   Method
   A literature search was performed to prepare a narrative review of COVID-19 and obesity.
   Results
   An obesity state promotes chronic inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hinders immunity and causes mechanical lung compression. These increase susceptibilities to COVID-19 infection, complications including the requirement of invasive ventilation. Existing co-morbidities enhances these complications. Preventive measures of social distancing and self-isolation may increase stigmatisation and psychological deterrents. Hence, special recommendations targeting this vulnerable population are required.
   Conclusion
   The obese population is a COVID-19 vulnerable group, requiring special attention during this pandemic to avoid complications and healthcare systems burden. Lacking COVID-19 vaccination, regular physical activity and a healthy diet are recommended with attention to mental health. A prolonged quarantine duration and administration of prophylactic vitamin D may be considered.

AB  - Empowering families of children with autism spectrum disorder through education and training is best practice. A wide range of Parent Education and Training programmes are delivered around the globe, but there is limited knowledge about the characteristics of these programmes, or about the research methods and outcomes used to evaluate them, particularly in countries outside the United States. We, therefore, performed a scoping review of all peer-reviewed Parent Education and Training publications outside the United States. A search was conducted between March and May 2017. Four reviewers extracted data and performed a mixed-methods quality appraisal of publications. Thirty-seven publications representing 32 unique programmes were identified. Publications described a highly diverse range of Parent Education and Training programmes across 20 countries and all continents except South America. The majority were group-based, but varied significantly in goals, modalities and duration. The majority of studies (86.4%) reported positive outcomes in relation to the core study objectives and only two studies reported some negative findings. Quality appraisal rated only 27% of studies to have met all the methodological quality criteria. Implementation factors such as manualisation, fidelity and cost were commented on infrequently. In spite of the clear need for Parent Education and Training programmes, our findings show that the research evidence-base in autism spectrum disorder outside the United States is relatively small, non-representative and in need of methodological quality improvements.

AB  - This study is a review of institutionalization, mental disorders and violence. A systematic search was performed in major databases, focusing on studies from the last twenty-two years. The results were divided into two groups: 'studies on factors related to the risk of violence/prediction and institutionalization' and 'studies on the risk of violence and deinstitutionalization/inadequate mental treatment'. We found that mental illness is not directly associated with high risk of violence. Specific details of the institutionalization and assistance with deprivation of liberty are related to violent behavior. We concluded that humanized, multiprofessional approaches and trained staff, combined with the management of real risk factors of violence can contribute to a better health assistance and reduce the need for institutionalization.

AB  - Across the fields of virology and neuroscience, the role of neurotropic viruses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has received renewed enthusiasm, with a particular focus on human herpesviruses (HHVs). Recent genomic analyses of brain tissue collections and investigations of the antimicrobial responses of amyloid-p do not exclude a role of HHVs in contributing to or accelerating AD pathogenesis. Due to continued expansion in our aging cohort and the lack of effective treatments for AD, this composition examines a potential neuroviral theory of AD in light of these recent data. Consideration reveals a possible viral "Hit-and-Run" scenario of AD, as well as neurobiological mechanisms (i.e., neuroinflammation, protein quality control, oxidative stress) that may increase risk for AD following neurotropic infection. Although limitations exist, this theoretical framework reveals several novel therapeutic targets that may prove efficacious in AD.

AB  - Introduction: Delivering health services and improving health outcomes of the 1.3 million people residing in northern Australia, a region spanning 3 million km(2) across the three jurisdictions of Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland, presents specific challenges. This review addresses a need for systems level analysis of the issues influencing the coverage, quality and responsiveness of health services across this region by examining the available published literature and identifying key policyrelevant gaps.
   Methods: A scoping review design was adopted with searches incorporating both peer-reviewed and grey literature (eg strategy documents, annual reports and budgets). Grey literature was predominantly sourced from websites of key organisations in the three northern jurisdictions, with peer-reviewed literature sourced from electronic database searches and reference lists. Key articles and documents were also contributed by health sector experts. Findings were synthesised and reported narratively using the WHO health system `building blocks' to categorise the data.
   Results: From the total of 324 documents and data sources included in the review following screening and eligibility assessment, 197 were peer-reviewed journal articles and 127 were grey literature. Numerous health sector actors across the north comprising planning bodies, universities and training organisations, peak bodies and providers-deliver primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare and workforce education and training in highly diverse contexts of care. Despite many exemplar health service and workforce models in the north, this synthesis describes a highly fragmented sector with many and disjointed stakeholders and funding sources. While the many strengths of the northern health system include expertise in training and supporting a fit-for-purpose health workforce, health systems in the north are struggling to meet the health needs of highly distributed populations with poorly targeted resources and illsuited funding models. Ageing of the population and rising rates of chronic disease and mental health issues, underpinned by complex social, cultural and environmental determinants of health, continue to compound these challenges.
   Conclusion: Policy goals about developing northern Australia economically need to build from a foundation of a healthy and productive population. Improving health outcomes in the north requires political commitment, local leadership and targeted investment to improve health service delivery, workforce stability and evidence-based strengthening of community-led comprehensive primary health care. This requires intersectoral collaboration across many organisations and the three jurisdictions, drawing from previous collaborative experiences. Further evaluative research, linking structure to process and outcomes, and responding to changes in the healthcare landscape such as the rapid emergence of digital technologies, is needed across a range of policy areas to support these efforts.

AB  - Background: Conflict and violent crises have resulted in over 40 million of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Most affected regions lack access to basic health resources and generally rely on humanitarian support. The objective of this review was to appraise primary health service interventions among conflict-induced internally displaced populations in low and middleincome countries between 2000 and 2019.
   Methods: A systematic review of literature in the following databases: Embase, MEDLINE, PsyArticles, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, LILAC and CAB Articles, was performed to identify interventions implemented in conflict IDP settings.
   Results: Initial searches yielded 4578 papers and 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. Descriptive synthesis analysis was used, and the final selections were assessed using a customised Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. Included papers were from Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and the Middle East regions. Most studies were on prevention interventions, especially water treatment and maternal health. Treatment interventions mostly focused on malaria and mental health. Only one food and nutrition study with outcome data was identified, indicating limitations in IDP health-related intervention publications. Reported interventions were conducted between one week to five years, and the study qualities were moderate. The most effective interventions were integrated programmes and common challenges were weak study methodology and data reporting.
   Conclusion: Regardless of the intervention types and durations, the services offered were beneficial to the IDPs. More intervention evidence are, however required as shown in gaps around food and nutrition, health education and disease surveillance.

AB  - Background: Georgia is leading one of the world's first hepatitis C (HCV) elimination programs alongside interventions to combat a HIV epidemic concentrated among high-risk groups. Although progress has been substantial, neither strategy accounts for the nearly 150,000 internally displaced persons residing in collective centers (CC-IDPs) who are susceptible to deeply integrated risk environments that could promote infection. Achieving dedicated goals for HCV elimination and HIV suppression requires a clear understanding of the risks facing CC-IDPs.
   Objectives: This literature review aims to consolidate what is known about the socio-economic and-physical/mental health status of IDPs living in collective centers in Georgia, and to assess their-vulnerability to HIV and HCV in light of local and global epidemiological trends.
   Methods: Sources were compiled from journal publications, reports by government ministries and-transnational organizations, and the Integrated Household Survey database (2009-2018; updated annually by the National Statistics Office of Georgia) through manual searches in PUBMED, Google Scholar and Search, ProQuest, and digital repositories of government offices.
   Findings: Reports indicate that CC-IDPs are more susceptible to poverty, poor living conditions,-mental illness, disability, substance use, and in some cases infectious disease; although, the correlation is not always present and subject to variability. These factors were linked to increased transmission and-acquisition of HIV/HCV in both displacement and non-displacement contexts abroad. The geographic concentration of HIV/HCV in areas with greater clusters of CC-IDPs, and shared characteristics with local high-risk groups, indicate the possibility of inordinate transmission among CC-IDPs in Georgia.
   Conclusions: The disproportionate prevalence of psychosocial and clinical harms among CC-IDPs testifies to the serious potential of a greater burden of HIV and hepatitis C. Going forward, targeted research is needed to inform interventions and clarify the health status of CC-IDPs in Georgia.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide, disturbs blood glucose hemostasis in experimental models and causes metabolic disorders. However, there are controversial findings of its impact on the BS level. The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate blood gluocse levels in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos. Present systematic review and meta-analysis study was done by searching in the online databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus. Data were analyzed by performing "random effects meta-regression." Findings were expressed as standardized mean value and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I-square and Q test. Meta-analysis of 7 animal studies indicated the dose-dependence manner of chlorpyrifos exposure on the blood glucose levels. The subgroup analysis indicated that exposure to low doses of chlorpyrifos significantly increased the blood glucose levels in exposed animals versus the nonexposed (0.11; 95% CI: - 1.14, 1.36, z = 2.25, p = 0.03, I-2 = 90.1%, p < 0.001) and high doses markedly decreased blood glucose levels in exposed rats versus the nonexposed (7.34; 95%CI: - 9.35, - 5.32, z = 6.41, p < 0.001, I-2 = 96.9%, p < 0.001). The random effects and pooled analysis indicated that the blood glucose levels were 4.22-fold lower in exposed animals versus the nonexposed ones (95% CI: 5.59,- 2.85; Z = 3.97; p < 0.001); therefore, heterogeneity was significant (I-2 = 96.5%, p < 0.001). The present finding indicated the association between chlorpyrifos exposure and a decrease in blood glucose levels. However, more studies should be designed to clarify this effect of chlorpyrifos exposure on blood glucose levels and involved mechanisms.

AB  - Background The elderly population and numbers of nursing homes residents are growing at a rapid pace globally. Uncertainty exists regarding the actual rates of major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as previous evidence documenting high rates relies on suboptimal methodology. Aims To carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence and correlates of MDD, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorder among nursing homes residents without dementia. Method Major electronic databases were systematically searched from 1980 to July 2017 for original studies reporting on the prevalence and correlates of MDD among nursing homes residents without dementia. The prevalence of MDD in this population was meta-analysed through random-effects modelling and potential sources of heterogeneity were examined through subgroup/meta-regression analyses. Results Across 32 observational studies encompassing 13 394 nursing homes residents, 2110 people were diagnosed with MDD, resulting in a pooled prevalence rate of 18.9% (95% CI 14.8-23.8). Heterogeneity was high (I-2 = 97%, P <= 0.001); no evidence of publication bias was observed. Sensitivity analysis indicated the highest rates of MDD among North American residents (25.4%, 95% CI 18-34.5, P <= 0.001). Prevalence of either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia spectrum disorder could not be reliably pooled because of the paucity of data. Conclusions MDD is highly prevalent among nursing homes residents without dementia. Efforts towards prevention, early recognition and management of MDD in this population are warranted.

AB  - Anosmia, stroke, paralysis, cranial nerve deficits, encephalopathy, delirium, meningitis, and seizures are some of the neurological complications in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) which is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2). There remains a challenge to determine the extent to which neurological abnormalities in COVID-19 are caused by SARS-Cov2 itself, the exaggerated cytokine response it triggers, and/or the resulting hypercoagulapathy and formation of blood clots in blood vessels throughout the body and the brain. In this article, we review the reports that address neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 who may present with acute neurological symptoms (e.g., stroke), even without typical respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Next, we discuss the different neurobiological processes and mechanisms that may underlie the link between SARS-Cov2 and COVID-19 in the brain, cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, and muscles. Finally, we propose a basic "NeuroCovid" classification scheme that integrates these concepts and highlights some of the short-term challenges for the practice of neurology today and the long-term sequalae of COVID-19 such as depression, OCD, insomnia, cognitive decline, accelerated aging, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease in the future. In doing so, we intend to provide a basis from which to build on future hypotheses and investigations regarding SARS-Cov2 and the nervous system.

AB  - Background: Ambient air pollution has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the elderly. However, its effects on AD have not been meta-analyzed comprehensively.
   Objective: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the associations between air pollution and AD incidence.
   Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for indexed publications up to March 2020. Odds risk (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for particulate matter (PM)10 (PM10), PM2.5, ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). The subgroup analysis was conducted based on the pollution levels.
   Results: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis and review. The OR per 10 mu g/m(3) increase of PM2.5 was 1.95 (95% CI: 0.88-4.30). The corresponding values per 10 mu g/m(3) increment of other pollutants were 1.03 (95% CI: 0.68-1.57) for O-3, 1.00 (95% CI: 0.89-1.13) for NO2, and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99) for PM10 (only one study), respectively. Overall OR of the five air pollutants above with AD was 1.32 (95% CI: 1.09-1.61), suggesting a positive association between ambient air pollution and AD incidence. The sub-analysis indicated that the OR (2.20) in heavily polluted regions was notably higher than that in lightly polluted regions (1.06). Although AD risk rate data related to SO2 or CO exposure are still limited, the epidemiologic and toxicological evidence indicated that higher concentration of SO2 or CO exposure increased risks of dementia, implying that SO2 or CO might have a potential impact on AD.
   Conclusion: Air pollution exposure may exacerbate AD development.

AB  - From January 2022, the WHO member countries shall start implementing the mortality and morbidity statistics (MMS) version of the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Regarding mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders, there are substantial changes from ICD-10 to ICD-11. The subchapter for schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders has changed due to a revised structure, new diagnostic criteria, and the introduction of dimensional elements (i.e., course and symptom qualifiers). The aim of this manuscript is twofold. First, we review changes from ICD-10 to ICD-11 in the classification and diagnosis of schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders, including findings from recent field studies. Second, we provide an overview of approaches to the implementation of ICD-11 in clinical practice. Critical elements for transition from ICD-10 to ICD-11 include the use of digital tools, education and training, stakeholder involvement, national adaptations, and continuous evaluation.

AB  - Grapes contain different polyphenols and might prevent inflammation by reducing Nitric Oxide (NO) inactivation through antioxidative enzymes. The aim of this article was to demonstrate the effects of grape polyphenols on the selected inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). To find papers assessing the effects of grape polyphenols on inflammatory mediators, electronic data bases, including ISI web of science, PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, and Google scholar, were searched up to March 2019. Delphi checklist was used for evaluating the qualities of the included articles. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (No. CRD42019116695). The mean changes in the intervention and control groups were calculated by subtracting the end values from the baselines. Then, the difference between the two changes was measured and utilized as the effect size in meta-analysis. 9 and 8 articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Our results indicated that grape polyphenols did not reduce hs-CRP levels, but omission of one article could lead to a significant reduction in hs-CRP (Weight Mean Difference (WMD): -0.54 mg/L, 95 % CI: -1.02, -0.06; P=0.026, I-2=0.0 %). Regarding IL-6 and TNF-alpha, no significant changes were observed in the intervention compared to the control group (WMD: 0.04 pg/mL, 95 % CI: -0.02, 0.28; P=0.744, I-2=0.0 %, WMD: -0.10 pg/mL, 95 % CI: -0.25, 0.05; P=0.183, I-2=0.0 %, respectively). We found no beneficial effects of grape polyphenols on the selected inflammatory mediators. Still, more studies with higher doses of polyphenols, longer treatment durations, different sources of grape polyphenols, and larger numbers of participants are required.

AB  - Introduction Persons with disabilities have the same sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) as non-disabled persons. Yet they face numerous barriers in their access to sexual and reproductive health services and their rights are often not met. Evidence on SRHR for persons with disabilities is sparse, particularly evaluations of interventions demonstrating 'what works.' This systematic review assessed interventions to promote SRHR for persons with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries. Methods We searched for qualitative, quantitative or mixed method observational studies representing primary research, published between 2010 and 2019, using MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Global Health and CINAHL Plus. Search strings were compiled for different elements of SRHR and for all forms of disability. 24,919 records were screened, leading to over 380 relevant papers, most of which were descriptive, focussing on needs and barriers to SRHR needs being fulfilled. Of the 33 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 18 were included in the synthesis. All included studies were assessed for bias and quality of evidence, using STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) and RATS (relevance, appropriateness, transparency andsoundness) tools. Among the 16 interventions (from 18 articles), 25% had low risk of bias, 31% had moderate risk of bias and 44% had high risk of bias. Data analysis used narrative synthesis; a method suited for systematic reviews with heterogeneous studies. We used Levesque healthcare access model to analyse the focus of interventions. Results 11 interventions were from upper middle-income settings; two from lower-income settings; only one operated in rural areas. Interventions addressed intellectual impairment (6), visual impairment (6), hearing impairment (4), mental health conditions (2) and physical impairments (2). Most interventions (15/16) focus on information provision and awareness raising. We could not identify any intervention promoting access to maternal health, family planning and contraception, or safe abortion for people with disabilities. Conclusion This systematic review has highlighted stark gaps in evidence. More rigorous evaluations are needed.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to increase the severity and prevalence of harmful algal blooms (HABs). In the past twenty years, omics techniques such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics have transformed that data landscape of many fields including the study of HABs. Advances in technology have facilitated the creation of many publicly available omics datasets that are complementary and shed new light on the mechanisms of HAB formation and toxin production. Genomics have been used to reveal differences in toxicity and nutritional requirements, while transcriptomics and proteomics have been used to explore HAB species responses to environmental stressors, and metabolomics can reveal mechanisms of allelopathy and toxicity. In this review, we explore how omics data may be leveraged to improve predictions of how climate change will impact HAB dynamics. We also highlight important gaps in our knowledge of HAS prediction, which include swimming behaviors, microbial interactions and evolution that can be addressed by future studies with omics tools. Lastly, we discuss approaches to incorporate current omics datasets into predictive numerical models that may enhance HAB prediction in a changing world. With the ever-increasing omics databases, leveraging these data for understanding climate-driven HAB dynamics will be increasingly powerful.

AB  - Background: Exposure to particulate matters (PM) is recognized as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A change in cardiac autonomic function is one postulated mechanism leading to PM related cardiovascular events. This study therefore evaluated the associations of short-term exposure to PM and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, which can reflect the cardiac autonomic function.
   Methods: Four electronic databases were searched for controlled studies of rodents published prior to December 2018. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Effect sizes were calculated for five main HRV parameters, including standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), square root of mean squared differences between successive normal-to-normal intervals (rMSSD), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and the ratio of LF and HF (LF/HF).
   Results: The review included 23 studies with 401 animals. Short-term exposure to PM by instillation yielded statistically significant effects on SDNN (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD]= -1.11, 95% Confidence Intervals [CI] = -2.22 to -0.01, P= 0.05), LF (SMD = -1.19, 95% CI = -1.99 to -0.40, P = 0.003) and LF/HF (SMD = -1.05, 95% CI = -2.03 to -0.07, P= 0.04). Short-term exposure to PM by inhalation only yielded statistically significant effect on LF/HF (SMD = -0.83, 95% CI = -1.39 to -0.27, P= 0.004). There was no evidence that animal model and exposure frequency influenced the relationship of PM and HRV.
   Conclusions: Short-term exposure to PM can decrease HRV of rodents, affecting cardiac autonomic function. Exposure methods can influence the relationships of PM and HRV parameters. Further studies should focus on the effects of long-term PM exposure, on human beings, and potential influential factors of PM-HRV associations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often presents with cognitive complaints including difficulty with attention and concentration. As these symptoms resemble those of ADHD, stimulants may be a potential treatment for mTBI. This review evaluates the literature on the use of stimulants for the treatment of mTBI. Method: A systematic evaluation of the literature using six databases: Ovidmedline, Pubmed, psychINFO, CINAH, Embase, and Cochrane. Broad search terms were used and studies were included that evaluate the use of stimulant and stimulant-like medications in the mTBI population. Data extracted included stimulant type and dosing, symptoms targeted, outcomes, safety and tolerability, and if the study population had ADHD. Results: Nine studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Immediate release methylphenidate and amantadine were used for treatment. Methylphenidate had some impact on attention, fatigue, and depression. However, due to the limited number of studies and heterogeneity of study populations, symptoms targeted, and outcome measures used, meaningful conclusions regarding the effect of stimulants in mTBI could not be made. No study evaluated for the presence of ADHD within the study population, despite stimulants being the mainstay treatment for ADHD. Conclusion: PProspective studies on the use of stimulants in mTBI, that evaluate participants for a diagnosis of ADHD, are needed.

AB  - Background: Clients and therapists often have different perspectives on their therapeutic alliance (TA), affecting the process and outcome of therapy. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to assess the mean differences between clients' and therapists' estimations of TA among clients with severe disturbances, while focusing on two potential moderators: client diagnosis and alliance instrument. Method: We conducted a systematic literature search of studies examining both client perspective and therapist perspective on TA in psychotherapy among people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, personality disorders, and substance misuse disorders. We then analyzed the data using a random-effects meta-analytic model with Cohen'sdstandardized mean effect size. Results: Heterogeneity analyses (k = 22, Cohen'sd = -.46, 95% confidence interval = .31-1.1) produced a significantQ-statistic (Q = 94.96) and indicated high heterogeneity, suggesting that moderator analyses were appropriate. Conclusions: Our findings show that the type of TA instrument moderates the agreement on TA between client and therapist, but there was no indication of the client's diagnosis moderating the effect. The agreement between client and therapist estimations seems to be dependent on the instrument that is used to assess TA. Specific setting-related instruments seem to result in higher agreement between clients' and therapists' estimations than do more general instruments that are applied to assess TA.

AB  - Introduction Globally, a record number of people are affected by humanitarian crises caused by conflict and natural disasters. Many such populations live in settings where epidemiological transition is underway. Following the United Nations high level meeting on non-communicable diseases, the global commitment to Universal Health Coverage and needs expressed by humanitarian agencies, there is increasing effort to develop guidelines for the management of hypertension in humanitarian settings. The objective was to investigate the prevalence and incidence of hypertension in populations directly affected by humanitarian crises; the cascade of care in these populations and patient knowledge of and attitude to hypertension. Methods A literature search was carried out in five databases. Grey literature was searched. The population of interest was adult, non-pregnant, civilians living in any country who were directly exposed to a crisis since 1999. Eligibility assessment, data extraction and quality appraisal were carried out in duplicate. Results Sixty-one studies were included in the narrative synthesis. They reported on a range of crises including the wars in Syria and Iraq, the Great East Japan Earthquake, Hurricane Katrina and Palestinian refugees. There were few studies from Africa or Asia (excluding Japan). The studies predominantly assessed prevalence of hypertension. This varied with geography and age of the population. Access to care, patient understanding and patient views on hypertension were poorly examined. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias due to methods used in the diagnosis of hypertension and in the selection of study populations. Conclusion Hypertension is seen in a range of humanitarian settings and the burden can be considerable. Further studies are needed to accurately estimate prevalence of hypertension in crisis-affected populations throughout the world. An appreciation of patient knowledge and understanding of hypertension as well as the cascade of care would be invaluable in informing service provision.

AB  - Background A sizeable cohort of Chinese migrants in high-income non-Asian countries is reaching old age and many will develop life-limiting illnesses. They may benefit from palliative care, which is integrated into universal health coverage in many of these countries, but the uptake of this care among migrant communities remains low. Cultural differences between the Chinese and the host community, and poor language skills may be barriers to access, yet understanding the reasons hindering uptake are obscure. Aims To understand the cultural perspective of how first generation Chinese migrants and their families perceive the provision of palliative care, to identify what exists which may limit their access in high-income non-Asian countries. Design A systematic review and three-stage thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Citations and full texts were reviewed against predefined inclusion criteria. All included studies were appraised for quality. Data source MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and PubMed were searched to July 2019. Results Seven qualitative studies were identified (from USA, UK, Canada and Australia). Across the studies analytical themes that impacted on the use of palliative care services were identified: (1) migrants' intrinsic perceptions of cultural practices, (2) their expectations of and preparation for care at the end of life, (3) perspectives and influences of family and (4) knowledge and communication with palliative care providers in the host country. Key elements found that challenge access to palliative care services in the host countries were: Chinese culture is rooted in the core values of the family as opposed to the individual; migrants' limited experience in their place of origin in accessing healthcare; and practical issues including a lack of language skills of their host country. Conclusions Palliative care services do not always match the needs of Chinese migrants in non-Asian high-income countries. Engagement and education on multiethnic cultural awareness in both the host non-migrant and the migrant communities is needed.

AB  - Introduction: Despite the promises of universal health care in most developed countries, health inequities remain prevalent within and between rural and remote communities. Remote health technologies are often promoted as solutions to increase health system efficiency, to enhance quality of care, and to decrease gaps in access to care for rural and remote communities. However, there is mixed evidence for these interventions, particularly related to how they are received and perceived by health providers and by patients. Health technologies do not always adequately meet the needs of patients or providers. To examine this, a broad-based scoping review was conducted to provide an overview of patient and provider perspectives of eHealth initiatives in rural communities. The unique objective of this review was to prioritize the voices of patients and providers in discussing the disparities between health interventions and needs of people in rural communities. eHealth initiatives were reviewed for rural communities of Australia and Canada, two countries that have similar geographies and comparable health systems at the local level.
   Methods: Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science with results limited from 2000 to 2018. Keywords included combinations of 'eHealth', 'telehealth', 'telemedicine', 'electronic health', and 'rural/remote'. Individual patient and provider perspectives on health care were identified, followed by qualitative thematic coding based on the type of intervention, the feedback provided, the affected population, geographic location, and category of individual providing their perspective. Quotes from patients and providers are used to illustrate the identified benefits and disadvantages of eHealth technologies.
   Results: Based on reviewed literature, 90.1% of articles reported that eHealth interventions were largely positive. Articles noted decreased travel time (18%), time/cost saving (15.1%), and increased access to services (13.9%) as primary benefits to eHealth. The most prevalent disadvantages of eHealth were technological issues (24.5%), lack of face-to-face contact (18.6%), limited training (10.8%), and resource disparities (10.8%). These results show where existing eHealth interventions could improve and can inform policymakers and providers in designing new interventions. Importantly, benefits to eHealth extend beyond geographic access. Patients reported ancillary benefits to eHealth that include reduced anxiety, disruption on family life, and improved recovery time. Providers reported closer connections to colleagues, improved support for complex care, and greater eLearning opportunity. Barriers to eHealth are recognized by patient and providers alike to be largely systemic, where lack of rural high-speed internet and unreliability of installed technologies were significant.
   Conclusion: Regional and national governments are seen as the key players in addressing these technical barriers. This scoping review diverges from many reviews of eHealth with the use of first person perspectives. It is hoped that this focus will highlight the importance of patient voices in evaluating important healthcare interventions such as eHealth and associated technologies.

AB  - Light modulation plays an important role in understanding the pathology of brain disorders and improving brain function. Optogenetic techniques can activate or silence targeted neurons with high temporal and spatial accuracy and provide precise control, and have recently become a method for quick manipulation of genetically identified types of neurons. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is light therapy that utilizes non-ionizing light sources, including lasers, light emitting diodes, or broadband light. It provides a safe means of modulating brain activity without any irreversible damage and has established optimal treatment parameters in clinical practice. This manuscript reviews 1) how optogenetic approaches have been used to dissect neural circuits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression, and 2) how low level transcranial lasers and LED stimulation in humans improves brain activity patterns in these diseases. State-of-the-art brain machine interfaces that can record neural activity and stimulate neurons with light have good prospects in the future.

AB  - Purpose: Many East Asian Americans (EAAs) (populations originating from China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) experience unique challenges in managing their disease, including language barriers and traditional cultural beliefs, particularly among first-generation immigrants.. The purpose of this mixed-methods systematic review was to examine cultural perspectives of EAAs that influence dietary self-management of T2DM and identify education interventions and their approaches to enhance EAAs' dietary self-management of diabetes.
   Methods: A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted to examine EAAs' perspectives from qualitative studies and to identify education interventions and their approaches from quantitative studies. A literature search was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Web of Science from 1995 to 2018. Sixteen studies (10 qualitative and 6 quantitative) met criteria for analysis. Thematic synthesis of qualitative data was conducted using a line-by-line coding strategy. Extracted quantitative data were assessed for cultural approaches used in the interventions and diabetes-related outcomes.
   Results: In the qualitative studies, beliefs about food impacted EAAs' abilities to adopt appropriate dietary recommendations for diabetes management. Requiring a specialized diet disrupted social harmony and made EAAs feel burdensome to others. Having bilingual and bicultural resources eased the stress of making dietary modifications. The most commonly incorporated approaches in diabetes education interventions were bilingual education and culturally specific dietary recommendations. Social roles and harmony were not discussed. Significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c and increases in diabetes knowledge were reported post-intervention.
   Conclusions: Beliefs about food, beliefs about social roles, and access to culturally competent care play an important role in dietary self-management of T2DM among EAAs. Understanding the cultural influences on dietary self-management of T2DM and tailoring interventions to meet the needs of EAAs are essential in effort to address the growing epidemic and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Background: Diet is an important lifestyle factor that may prevent or slow the onset and progression of neurodegeneration. Some, but not all, recent studies have suggested that adherence to a healthy dietary pattern may be associated with reduced risk of dementia.
   Objective: In this meta-analysis, we systematically examined the associations between overall dietary patterns, assessed a priori and a posteriori, and risk of dementia.
   Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health databases from January 1, 1981 to September 11, 2019. Prospective studies published in English were included. Random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: Sixteen research articles were identified in the systematic review and 12 research articles including 66,930 participants were further included for the meta-analysis. Adherence to high diet quality or a healthy dietary pattern was significantly associated with lower risk of overall dementia (pooled risk ratio = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.95; n = 12) and Alzheimer's disease (pooled risk ratio = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.79; n = 6) relative to those with low diet quality or an unhealthy dietary pattern. Subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, follow-up duration, diet quality assessment approach, study location, and study quality generated similar results.
   Conclusion: Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern was associated with lower risk of overall dementia. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to provide additional evidence about the role of a healthy diet on the development and progression of dementia.

AB  - Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have reduced drastically in size, cost, and power consumption, while improving accuracy. The combination of different sensor technologies is considered a promising step in the monitoring of athletes. Those "wearables" enable the capturing of relevant physiological and tactical information in individual and team sports and thus replacing subjective, time-consuming and qualitative methods with objective, quantitative ones. Prior studies mainly comprised sports categories such as: targeting sports, batting and fielding games as well as net and wall games, focusing on the detection of individual, non-locomotive movements. The increasing capabilities of wearables allow for more complex and integrative analysis expanding research into the last category: invasion sports. Such holistic approaches allow the derivation of metrics, estimation of physical conditions and the analysis of team strategic behavior, accompanied by integrative knowledge gains in technical, tactical, physical, and mental aspects of a sport. However, prior and current researchers find the precise measurement of the actual movement within highly dynamic and non-linear movement difficult. Thus, the present article showcases an overview of the environments in which the wearables are employed. It elaborates their use in individual as well as team-related performance analyses with a special focus on reliability and validity, challenges, and future directions.

AB  - Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain how Alzheimer's disease is triggered, but none of them provide a unified view of its pathogenesis. The dominant hypothesis based on build-ups of the amyloid-beta peptide has been around for longer than three decades; however, up to today, numerous clinical trials based on the amyloid postulates have been attempted, but all of them have failed. Clearly, the revisited tau hypothesis provides a better explanation of the clinical observations of patients, but it needs to integrate the cumulative observations on the onset of this disease. In this context, the neuroimmuno modulation theory, based on the involvement of inflammatory events in the central nervous system, accounts for all these observations. In this review we intend to emphasize the idea that neuroinflammation is a main target for the search of new therapeutic strategies to control Alzheimer's disease. Beyond mono-targeting approaches using synthetic drugs that control only specific pathophysiological events, emerging therapeutics views based on multi targeting compounds appear to provide a new pathway for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the Brazilian cohorts that started either in the prenatal period or at birth, to describe their characteristics and the explored variables, and to map the cohorts with potential for studies on early determinants on health and the risk of falling ill on later stages of the life cycle.
   METHODS: A scoping review was carried out. The articles were searched in the electronic databases PubMed and Virtual Health Library (VHL). The descriptors used were [((("Child" OR "Child, Preschool'' OR "Infant'' OR "Infant, Newborn") AND (Cohort Studies" OR "Longitudinal Studies")) AND "Brazil")]. The inclusion criteria were Brazilian cohorts that started the baseline in the prenatal period or at birth and with at least two follow-ups with the participants. In order to meet the concept of LCE, we excluded those cohorts whose follow-ups were restricted to the first year of life, as well as those that did not address biological, behavioral and psychosocial aspects, and cohorts with data collection of a single stage of the life cycle.
   RESULTS: The search step identified 5,010 articles. Eighteen cohorts were selected for descriptive synthesis. The median number of baseline participants was 2,000 individuals and the median age at the last follow-up was 9 years. Sample loss at the last follow-up ranged from 9.2 to 87.5%. Most cohorts monitored two phases of the life cycle (the perinatal period and childhood). The Southern region had the highest number of cohorts. The main variables collected were sociodemographic and environmental aspects of the family, morbidity aspects, nutritional practices and lifestyle.
   CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the continuity of these cohorts, the approach to different social contexts and the performance of follow-ups with participants in different phases of the life cycle for the strengthening and expansion of life course epidemiology analyses in Brazil.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Unemployment rates are generally higher among persons with mental disabilities who experience many barriers and challenges that limit their participation in work and employment. Occupational therapy can play a key role in promoting participation and engagement in work by persons with mental disabilities.
   OBJECTIVE: This review sought to identify the barriers and facilitators to work participation for persons with mental disabilities globally in comparison to Zimbabwe, and to identify the competencies related to work practice in occupational therapy curricula internationally and regionally.
   METHODS: A narrative literature review was conducted using the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis and Analysis) framework which informed retrieval and analysis of articles published between 2012 and 2018.
   RESULTS: Fifty-one out of 227 articles were selected to inform the review. Asynthesis of the literature provided insights and ideas on facilitators and barriers to work for persons with mental disabilities and the competencies related to work practice in occupational therapy curricula.
   CONCLUSION: Barriers to participation in work for persons with mental disabilities are real. However, occupational therapists from different contexts have a variety of competencies to facilitate participation in work. There is a need to develop work practice competencies particular to the Zimbabwean context.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is defined as a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication impairment, delayed development, social function deficit, and repetitive behaviors. The Center for Disease Control reports an increase in ASD diagnosis rates every year. This systematic review evaluated the use of sulforaphane (SFN) therapy as a potential treatment option for individuals with ASD. PubMed.gov, PubMed Central, Natural Medicines, BoardVitals, Google Scholar and Medline were searched for studies measuring the effects of SFN on behavior and cognitive function. All five clinical trials included in this systematic review showed a significant positive correlation between SFN use and ASD behavior and cognitive function. The current evidence shows with minimal side effects observed, SFN appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for treating ASD.

AB  - Aims. Despite an increasing awareness of the importance of spirituality in mental health contexts, a 'religiosity gap' exists in the difference in the value placed on spirituality and religion by professionals compared with service users. This may be due to a lack of understanding about the complex ways people connect with spirituality within contemporary society and mental health contexts, and can result in people's spiritual needs being neglected, dismissed or pathologised within clinical practice. The aim of this qualitative systematic review is to characterise the experiences of spirituality among adults with mental health difficulties in published qualitative research.
   Methods. An electronic search of seven databases was conducted along with forward and backward citation searching, expert consultation and hand-searching of journals. Thirtyeight studies were included from 4944 reviewed papers. The review protocol was pre-registered (PROSPERO:CRD42017080566).
   Results. Athematic synthesis identified six key themes: Meaning-making (sub-themes: Multiple explanations; Developmental journey; Destiny v. autonomy), Identity, Service-provision, Talk about it, Interaction with symptoms (sub-themes: Interactive meaning-making; Spiritual disruption) and Coping (sub-themes: Spiritual practices; Spiritual relationship; Spiritual struggles; Preventing suicide), giving the acronym MISTIC.
   Conclusions. This qualitative systematic review provides evidence of the significant role spirituality plays in the lives of many people who experience mental health difficulties. It indicates the importance of mental health professionals being aware of and prepared to support the spiritual dimension of people using services. The production of a theory-based framework can inform efforts by health providers to understand and address people's spiritual needs as part of an integrated holistic approach towards care.

AB  - Introduction: One of the most common psychiatric disorders in nurses is job stress. Regarding the inconsistency of the studies conducted in nurses working in Iran, the present structured review and metaanalysis study was conducted to determine the prevalence ofjob stress in nurses working in Iranian hospitals.
   Materials and Methods: The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted during 2001-2017. Articles related to job stress were obtained by searching SID, MEDLINE (PubMed), Science direct, and Google Scholar databases, and data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.
   Results: Having investigated 17 studies, the overall prevalence of Job stress in nurses working in Iranian hospitals was obtained 60% (48.1% - 70.7%: 95% confidence), meta-regression test was conducted to investigate the heterogeneity of meta-analysis results. It was reported that increasing sample size decreases the prevalence of Job stress (P <0.05).
   Conclusion: Regarding the high prevalence of job stress among nurses working in Iranian hospitals, health policymakers have to take effective measures to remove and reduce the stress causes in nurses to reduce the prevalence of stress in nurses and enhance work efficiency.

AB  - Nutritional ketosis, induced via either the classical ketogenic diet or the use of emulsified medium-chain triglycerides, is an established treatment for pharmaceutical resistant epilepsy in children and more recently in adults. In addition, the use of oral ketogenic compounds, fractionated coconut oil, very low carbohydrate intake, or ketone monoester supplementation has been reported to be potentially helpful in mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autistic spectrum disorder. In these and other neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders, there are detrimental effects of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation on neuronal function. However, they also adversely impact on neurone-glia interactions, disrupting the role of microglia and astrocytes in central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Astrocytes are the main site of CNS fatty acid oxidation; the resulting ketone bodies constitute an important source of oxidative fuel for neurones in an environment of glucose restriction. Importantly, the lactate shuttle between astrocytes and neurones is dependent on glycogenolysis and glycolysis, resulting from the fact that the astrocytic filopodia responsible for lactate release are too narrow to accommodate mitochondria. The entry into the CNS of ketone bodies and fatty acids, as a result of nutritional ketosis, has effects on the astrocytic glutamate-glutamine cycle, glutamate synthase activity, and on the function of vesicular glutamate transporters, EAAT, Na+, K+-ATPase, K(ir)4.1, aquaporin-4, Cx34 and K-ATP channels, as well as on astrogliosis. These mechanisms are detailed and it is suggested that they would tend to mitigate the changes seen in many neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders. Hence, it is hypothesized that nutritional ketosis may have therapeutic applications in such disorders.

AB  - Exposure to traffic noise is associated with stress and sleep disturbances. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently concluded that road traffic noise increases the risk for ischemic heart disease and potentially other cardiometabolic diseases, including stroke, obesity, and diabetes. The WHO report focused on whole-day noise exposure, but new epidemiological and translational field noise studies indicate that nighttime noise, in particular, is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) through increased levels of stress hormones and vascular oxidative stress, leading to endothelial dysfunction and subsequent development of various CVDs. Novel experimental studies found noise to be associated with oxidative stress-induced vascular and brain damage, mediated by activation of the NADPH oxidase, uncoupling of endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase, and vascular/brain infiltration with inflammatory cells. Noise-induced pathophysiology was more pronounced in response to nighttime as compared with daytime noise. This review focuses on the consequences of nighttime noise.

AB  - The componential view of human emotion recognises that affective states comprise conscious, behavioural, physiological, neural and cognitive elements. Although many animals display bodily and behavioural changes consistent with the occurrence of affective states similar to those seen in humans, the question of whether and in which species these are accompanied by conscious experiences remains controversial. Finding scientifically valid methods for investigating markers for the subjective component of affect in both humans and animals is central to developing a comparative understanding of the processes and mechanisms of affect and its evolution and distribution across taxonomic groups, to our understanding of animal welfare, and to the development of animal models of affective disorders. Here, contemporary evidence indicating potential markers of conscious processing in animals is reviewed, with a view to extending this search to include markers of conscious affective processing. We do this by combining animal-focused approaches with investigations of the components of conscious and non-conscious emotional processing in humans, and neuropsychological research into the structure and functions of conscious emotions.

AB  - Deemed as incurable, Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is becoming less convoluted as our understanding of its pathology increases. With current treatments focusing on merely mitigating the symptoms of AD, there have been many attempts to find a molecular culprit to serve as the single underlying cause and therapeutic target for clinical applications to approach the disease from its roots. Indeed, over the course of decades, the endless search for a singular target culprit in AD has uncovered a cascade of pathological defects, adding on to each other throughout the progression of the disease. The developmental patterns of amyloid-beta (A beta) oligomers have been studied as a means to discover the complex molecular interplay between various immune responses, genetic mutations, pathway disturbances, and regulating factors that disturb synapse homeostasis before disease manifestation. This new understanding has shifted the underlying goal of the research community from merely removing A beta oligomers to finding methods that can predict high risk individuals and resorting to cocktail-drug treatments in an attempt to regulate multiple pathways that cumulatively result in the debilitating symptoms of the disease. By utilizing various assays from immuno-targeting to molecular biomarkers, we then interfere in the molecular cascades in an endeavor to avoid synapse dysfunction before disease maturity. Here, we review the current literature supporting the importance of synapses in AD, our current understanding of the molecular interactions leading up to clinical diagnoses, and the techniques used in targeted therapies.

AB  - Background: Epigenetic modifications appear to be dynamic and they might be affected by environmental factors. The possibility of influencing these processes through psychotherapy has been suggested.
   Objective: To analyse the impact of psychotherapy on epigenetics when applied to mental disorders. The main hypothesis is that psychological treatments will produce epigenetic modifications related to the improvement of treated symptoms.
   Methods: A computerised and systematic search was completed throughout the time period from 1990 to 2019 on the PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus databases.
   Results: In total, 11 studies were selected. The studies were evaluated for the theoretical framework, genes involved, type of psychotherapy and clinical challenges and perspectives. All studies showed detectable changes at the epigenetic level, like DNA methylation changes, associated with symptom improvement after psychotherapy.
   Conclusion: Methylation profiles could be moderating treatment effects of psychotherapy. Beyond the detected epigenetic changes after psychotherapy, the epigenetic status before the implementation could act as an effective predictor of response.

AB  - Neighbourhood community life has been widely recognized as an important determinant of population health. This systematic review of reviews provides an overview of the evidence for the ecological correlation between neighbourhood community life and population health. Nine databases were searched from 2008 to 2018 in order to identify systematic reviews of studies examining the association between neighbourhood community life and population health in urban neighbourhoods within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Two reviewers completed selection and data extraction, then assessed the methodological quality of reviews using the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews. We identified three high quality reviews and five of moderate quality. The reviews vary in quality of methodology, concepts, and measures. Most of the reviews examined the influence of social cohesion, social capital, and social interactions on health. Reviews found evidence supporting a consistently favourable correlation between social cohesion and physical activity, as well as a favourable trend in the relationship between social cohesion and healthy weight. They also found evidence of a favourable trend in the correlation between social capital and healthy weight. Reviews identified studies supporting a consistently favourable correlation between social interaction and depression. We identify evidence of a positive association between neighbourhood community life and several population health outcomes. Future research should define and conceptualize neighbourhood community life factors and health indicators to improve the comparison between studies and the process of evidence synthesis. This will also enable policy makers to take appropriate decisions.

AB  - Burnout has adverse effects on the health and work-related outcomes of employees. Nevertheless, little is known about effective ways of reducing burnout complaints and facilitating full return to work, which defines rehabilitation. This study consists of a systematic review of the effects of combined interventions (i.e., both person-directed and organization-directed). It also includes the identification and description of mediators of change, thereby explaining how combined interventions do or do not work. Seven electronic databases were searched for English peer-reviewed publications: the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection; PsycARTICLES; Web of Science; Scopus; SocINDEX; PubMed; and PsycINFO, using various combinations of search terms (e.g., burnout AND intervention). Out of 4110 abstracts published before 29 September, 2019, 10 studies (reporting the effects of nine combined interventions) fulfilled the inclusion criteria, which were defined using PICOS criteria (participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes and study design). Although the risk of bias of the included studies is high, all combined interventions were effective in facilitating rehabilitation. Results suggest that involving employees in decision-making and enhance their job control and social support, while eliminating stressors, explain the effectiveness of the intentions. With caution, workplace health promotion practitioners are encouraged to use these findings to tackle burnout among employees.

AB  - Background: Patients with severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, may be legally mandated to undergo psychiatric treatment. Patients' experiences in these situations are not well characterized. This systematic review of qualitative studies aims to describe the experiences of patients with schizophrenia and related disorders who have undergone legally mandated treatment. Methods: Four bibliographic databases were searched: CINAHL Plus (1981-2019), EMBASE (1947-2019), MEDLINE (1946-2019), and PsycINFO (1806-2019). These databases were searched for keywords, text words, and medical subject headings related to schizophrenia, legally mandated treatment and patient experience. The reference lists of included studies and systematic reviews were also investigated. The identified titles and abstracts were reviewed for study inclusion. A thematic analysis was completed for the synthesis of positive and negative aspects of legally mandated treatment. Results: A total of 4,008 citations were identified. Eighteen studies were included in the final synthesis. For the thematic analysis, results were collated under two broad themes; positive patient experiences and negative patient experiences. Patients were satisfied when their autonomy was respected, and dissatisfied when it was not. Patients often retrospectively recognized that their treatment was beneficial. Furthermore, negative aspects of the treatment included deficits in communication and a lack of information. Conclusions: Intervention research has historically focused on clinical outcomes and the quantitative aspects of treatment. Thus, this study provides insight into the qualitative aspects of patients' experiences with legally mandated treatment. Recognizing these opinions and experiences can lead to better attitudes toward treatment for patients with schizophrenia and related psychiatric illnesses.

AB  - Background Postpartum depression is common in the perinatal period and poses a risk for the development of the infant and the mother-infant relationship. Infancy is a critical developmental period of life and supportive parenting is crucial for healthy development, however, the effects of interventions aimed at improving parenting among mothers with depression are uncertain. Aims To assess the effects of parenting interventions on parent-child relationship and child development among mothers with depressive symptoms with 0-12-month-old infants. Method We conducted a systematic review with the inclusion criteria: (a) randomised controlled trials of structured psychosocial parenting interventions for women with depressive symptoms and a child aged 0-12 months in Western Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, (b) minimum three sessions with at least half of these delivered postnatally and (c) outcomes relating to the parent-child-relationship and/or child development. Publications were extracted from 10 databases in September 2018 and supplemented with grey search and hand search. We assessed risk of bias, calculated effect sizes and conducted meta-analysis. Results Eight papers representing seven trials were included. We conducted meta-analysis on the post-intervention parent-child relationship. The analysis included six studies and showed no significant effect. For individual study outcomes, no significant effects on the majority of both the parent-child relationship and child development outcomes were reported. Conclusions No evidence of the effect of parenting interventions for mothers with depressive symptoms was found on the parent-child relationship and child development. Larger studies with follow-up assessments are needed, and future reviews should examine the effects in non-Western countries.

AB  - Psychotic disorders can be exacerbated by the hormonal changes associated with childbirth, but the extent to which exacerbations occur with the menstrual cycle is unclear. We addressed this issue by conducting a systematic review. Embase, Medline, and PsychINFO databases were searched for studies that measured exacerbations of psychotic disorders in relation to the menstrual cycle. We extracted exacerbation measure, definition of menstrual cycle phase, and measurement of menstrual cycle phase. Standard incidence ratios were calculated for the perimenstrual phase based on the observed admissions during this phase divided by the expected number of admissions if the menstrual cycle had no effect. Random effects models were used to examine pooled rates of psychiatric admission in the perimenstrual phase. Nineteen studies, comprising 1193 participants were eligible for inclusion. Eleven studies examined psychiatric admission rates, 5 examined symptoms scores, 2 examined self-reported exacerbation, and 1 examined both admission rates and symptom scores. A random effects model demonstrated the rate of admissions during the perimenstrual phase was 1.48 times higher than expected (95% CI: 1.31-1.67), with no significant heterogeneity detected. Four of six symptom score studies reported perimenstrual worsening, but lack of consistency in timepoints precluded meta-analysis. Two studies examining self-reported menstrual exacerbations reported prevalences ranging from 20% to 32.4%. Psychiatric admission rates are significantly higher than expected during the perimenstrual phase. There is some evidence that a worsening of psychotic symptoms also occurs during this phase, but further research with more precise measurement of the menstrual cycle and symptomatology is required.

AB  - The purpose of this review is to illustrate how a reductionistic, but sophisticated, approach based on the use of a simple model system such as the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis (L. stagnalis), might be useful to address fundamental questions in learning and memory. L. stagnalis, as a model, provides an interesting platform to investigate the dialog between the synapse and the nucleus and vice versa during memory and learning. More importantly, the "molecular actors" of the memory dialogue are well-conserved both across phylogenetic groups and learning paradigms, involving single- or multi-trials, aversion or reward, operant or classical conditioning. At the same time, this model could help to study how, where and when the memory dialog is impaired in stressful conditions and during aging and neurodegeneration in humans and thus offers new insights and targets in order to develop innovative therapies and technology for the treatment of a range of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Oxidative stress is now believed to play a crucial role for neurodevelopment disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To review the most recent literature regarding the role of oxidative stress for the pathophysiology of ASD and ADHD, we conducted a systematic search of the relevant literature and further discuss the clinical and research implications of this knowledge. A systematic search in PubMed database retrieved 132 articles, of which 33 were included in the review. This review found relevant evidence concerning the role of oxidative status in ASD and ADHD, albeit with some contradictory findings. In order to overcome the incongruities found, more studies are needed in the study of neurodevelopmental disorders, with more thorough study designs and particular attention to the accuracy of the diagnostic tools used for the cases included.

AB  - Background: The mental health of the population consists of the three essential pillars of quality of life, economy, and society. Mental health services take care of the prevention and treatment of mental disorders and through them maintain, improve, and restore the mental health of the population. The purpose of this study is to describe the methodology for qualitative and quantitative evaluation and improvement of the mental health service system. Methods: This is a narrative review study that searches the literature to provide criteria, indicators, and methodology for evaluating and improving the quality of mental health services and the related qualitative and quantitative indicators. The bibliography was searched in popular databases PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, using the keywords "mental", "health", "quality", "indicators", alone or in combinations thereof. Results: Important quality indicators of mental health services have been collected and presented, and modified where appropriate. The definition of each indicator is presented here, alongside its method of calculation and importance. Each indicator belongs to one of the eight dimensions of quality assessment: (1) Suitability of services, (2) Accessibility of patients to services, (3) Acceptance of services by patients, (4) Ability of healthcare professionals to provide services, (5) Efficiency of health professionals and providers, (6) Continuity of service over time (ensuring therapeutic continuity), (7) Efficiency of health professionals and services, (8) Safety (for patients and for health professionals). Discussion/Conclusions: Accessibility and acceptability of service indicators are important for the attractiveness of services related to their use by the population. Profitability indicators are important economic indicators that affect the viability and sustainability of services, factors that are now taken into account in any health policy. All of the indicators mentioned are related to public health, affecting the quality of life, morbidity, mortality, and life expectancy, directly or indirectly. The systematic measurement and monitoring of indicators and the measurement and quantification of quality through them, are the basis for evidence-based health policy for improvement of the quality of mental health services.

AB  - Background: Measures of handgrip strength have not only emerged as a clinically viable screening tool for determining risk for morbidity, functional disability, and early mortality, but also for helping to identify cognitive deficits. However, the phenomena that links low handgrip strength with cognitive decline remains unclear. The role of the muscular and neural systems, and their adaptations to muscle strengthening activities over the life course, may provide important information for how age-related changes to muscle mass, strength, and neural capacity influence cognition. Moreover, disentangling how handgrip strength and cognitive function are associated may help to inform healthcare providers working with aging adults and guide targeted interventions aiming to preserve muscle and cognitive functioning.
   Objective: To 1) highlight and summarize evidence examining the associations of handgrip strength and cognitive functioning, and 2) provide directions for future research in this area.
   Methods: Articles from the PubMed database were searched from November 2018-May 2019. The search term algorithm, inclusion and exclusion criteria were pre-specified by investigators.
   Results: Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have revealed that measures of handgrip strength were associated with cognitive declines regardless of age demographics and the presence of comorbidities.
   Conclusion: Handgrip strength can be used in clinical and epidemiological settings for helping to determine the onset and progression of cognitive impairment. Future research should continue to examine how handgrip strength and cognitive function are linked.

AB  - Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered the earliest symptomatic manifestation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, given the lack of effective and curable pharmacological treatments for AD, non pharmacological interventions (NPIs) for individuals with SCD may provide a valuable opportunity for the secondary prevention of AD.
   Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, aimed to investigate the benefits of current NPIs in the population with SCD.
   Methods: The online electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and CINAHL, were searched to identify randomized controlled trials of NPIs for SCD. Intervention strategies were psychological and health-related education interventions, mind-body therapy, lifestyle modification, cognitive training, and multidomain interventions. Outcomes included subjective memory, objective memory, global cognitive function, psychological well-being, and mood. Study quality was determined using the criteria of the Cochrane collaboration's tool. The Hedges' g of change was analyzed.
   Results: Eighteen studies were included in this review and meta-analysis. Overall, psychological and health-related education interventions exhibited a medium effect on objective memory function (Hedges' g =0.53, p = 0.01). Cognitive training led to a small effect on objective memory, which was marginal statistically (Hedges' g =0.19, p = 0.05). In addition, cognitive training also significantly improved subjective memory performance (Hedges' g = 0.49, p = 0.0003) and psychological well-being (Hedges' g = 0.27, p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: Overall, the psychological intervention and cognitive training may be beneficial to cognitive function and psychological well-being. NPIs may be effectively implemented in older adults with SCD.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the associations of body mass index (BMI) with all-cause and cause-specific disability retirement. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from their inception to May 2019. A total of 27 (25 prospective cohort and 2 nested case-control) studies consisting of 2 199 632 individuals qualified for a meta-analysis. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We used a random effects meta-analysis, assessed heterogeneity and publication bias, and performed sensitivity analyses. There were a large number of participants and the majority of studies were rated at low or moderate risk of bias. There was a J-shaped relationship between BMI and disability retirement. Underweight (hazard ratio (HR)/risk ratio (RR)=1.20, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.41), overweight (HR/RR=1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19) and obese individuals (HR/RR=1.52, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.71) were more commonly granted all-cause disability retirement than normal-weight individuals. Moreover, overweight increased the risk of disability retirement due to musculoskeletal disorders (HR/RR=1.26, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.39) and cardiovascular diseases (HR=1.73, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.41), and obesity increased the risk of disability retirement due to musculoskeletal disorders (HR/RR=1.66, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.94), mental disorders (HR=1.29, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.61) and cardiovascular diseases (HR=2.80, 95% CI 1.85 to 4.24). The association between excess body mass and all-cause disability retirement did not differ between men and women and was independent of selection bias, performance bias, confounding and adjustment for publication bias. Obesity markedly increases the risk of disability retirement due to musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular diseases and mental disorders. Since the prevalence of obesity is increasing globally, disease burden associated with excess body mass and disability retirement consequently are projected to increase.

AB  - Aims. Unmet needs for mental health treatment are large and widespread, and periods of economic crisis may increase the need for care and the treatment gap, with serious consequences for individuals and society. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the empirical evidence on the association between periods of economic crisis and the use of mental health care.
   Methods. Following the PRISMA statement, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Open Grey and Cochrane Database were searched for relevant publications, published between 1990 and 2018, from inception to June 2018. Search terms included (1) economic crisis, (2) use of mental health services and (3) mental health problems. Study selection, data extraction and the assessment of study quality were performed in duplicate.
   Results. Seventeen studies from different countries met the inclusion criteria. The results from the included articles suggest that periods of economic crisis might be linked to an increase of general help sought for mental health problems, with conflicting results regarding the changes in the use of specialised psychiatric care. The evidence on the use of mental health care specifically due to suicide behaviour is mixed. The results also suggest that economic crises might be associated with a higher use of prescription drugs and an increase in hospital admissions for mental disorders.
   Conclusions. Research on the impact of economic crises on the use of mental health care is scarce, and methodologies of the included papers are prone to substantial bias. More empirical and long-term studies on this topic are needed, in order to adapt mental health care systems to the specific needs of the population in times of economic crisis.

AB  - Background: Informal caregivers for persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) face a range of unique issues, and racial/ethnic group differences in caregiver challenges are poorly understood. We undertook a scoping study of peer-reviewed literature to assess the quantity and quality of available research describing differences by race/ethnicity in informal caregiving roles and burden.
   Methods: Using Arksey and O'Malley's framework and guided by the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews, we conducted electronic searches of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Social Work Abstracts, Embase, and Scopus to identify peer-reviewed studies that examined TBI informal caregiver burden and reported on the influences of race or ethnicity.
   Results: Among 4523 unique publications identified and screened, 11 studies included sufficient race/ethnicity data and were included in the analysis. Of these, six studies described civilian populations and five described military Veterans Affairs (VA). Included studies revealed that nonwhite caregivers and white caregivers use different approaches and coping strategies in their caregiving role. Some studies found differences in caregiver burden by race or ethnicity, others did not. Most were limited by a small sample size and overdependence on assessment tools not validated for the purposes or populations for which they were used. This was particularly true for race/ethnicity as a factor in TBI caregiver burden in VA groups, where essential characteristics moderate the association of race/ethnicity with socioeconomic factors.
   Conclusions: This scoping study highlights the paucity of information on race/ethnicity as a factor in TBI caregiver burden and roles, and suggests that innovative and alternative approaches to research are needed to explore needed changes in practice.

AB  - Background: Prior research has investigated various strategies to improve health, wellbeing and the job-related outcomes of nurses. However, the scope of this evidence is not clear and the types of intervention most likely to have positive outcomes are unknown. Objective: To provide an overview and synthesis of the effectiveness of interventions conducted with the goal of improving health, wellbeing and the job-related outcomes of nurses. Methods: A systematic database search was conducted from January 2000 to December 2018, with pre-defined criteria (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE and PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO; and BioMed Central). In total, 136 intervention studies with a total sample of 16,129 participants (range 9-3381) were included and evaluated. Data extraction, quality assessment and risk of bias analyses were performed. Results: Studies included randomised controlled trials (RCTs; n = 52, 38%), randomised crossover design studies (n = 2, 1.5%) and non-randomised pre-post studies with a control group (n = 31, 23%) and without a control group (n = 51, 37.5%). The majority of interventions focused on education, physical activity, mindfulness, or relaxation. Thirty-seven (27%) studies had a multimodal intervention approach. On average, studies had relatively small samples (median = 61; mode = 30) and were conducted predominantly in North America (USA/Canada, n = 53). The findings were mixed overall, with some studies reporting benefits and others finding no effects. Dietary habits was the most successfully improved outcome (8/9), followed by indices of body composition (20/24), physical activity (PA) (11/14), and stress (49/66), with >70% of relevant studies in each of these categories reporting improvements. The lowest success rate was for work-related outcomes (16/32). Separate analysis of RCTs indicated that interventions that focus solely on education might be less likely to result in positive outcomes than interventions targeting behavioural change. Conclusions: Interventions targeting diet, body composition, PA, or stress are most likely to have positive outcomes for nurses' health and/or wellbeing. The methodologically strongest evidence (RCTs) is available for body composition and stress. Interventions relying solely on educational approaches are least likely to be effective. Organisational outcomes appear to be more challenging to change with lifestyle intervention, likely requiring more complex solutions including changes to the work environment. There is a need for more high-quality evidence since many studies had moderate or high risk of bias and low reporting quality.

AB  - Background.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is debilitating for patients and society. There are a number of treatment methods albeit not all patients respond to these and an interesting method using electroencephalography-based neurofeedback (EEG-NF) has become more prominent in recent years. This systematic review aimed to assess whether EEG-NF, compared with sham NF, other treatment, or no treatment, is effective for PTSD. Primary outcomes were self-harm, PTSD symptoms, level of functioning and health-related quality of life.Methods.Systematic literature searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted in six databases. Random effects meta-analysis was performed. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.Results.Four RCTs were included (123 participants). Suicidal thoughts were significantly reduced after EEG-NF compared with a waiting list in a small study. PTSD symptoms were assessed in all studies with different instruments. Results were consistently in favor of EEG-NF with large effect sizes (standardized mean difference -2.30 (95% confidence interval: -4.37 to -0.24). One study reported significantly improved level of executive functioning and one study a reduction in use of psychotropic medication. Complications were scarcely reported. Certainty of evidence was assessed as very low for the four assessed outcomes.Conclusions.Based on four RCTs, with several study limitations and imprecision, it is uncertain whether EEG-NF reduces suicidal thoughts, PTSD symptoms, medication use, or improves function. Although all studies showed promising results, further studies are needed to increase the certainty of evidence.

AB  - Background: Over the decades, several published studies showing the relevance of alcohol use among seafarers/fishermen have highlighted the dangers of alcohol consumption during working time. The present study aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the prevalence of alcohol consumption among seafarers/fishermen. It also points out their consumption behaviour, depending on socio-demographic and job-related factors.
   Materials and methods: To detect relevant studies for this systematic review, the electronic database PubMed was searched. All identified studies published between January 2014 and September 2019 were included using the subsequent terms: (alcohol OR ethanol) AND (seafarer OR fishermen OR ship crew OR merchant ship).
   Results: According to the applied search string, 18 studies were identified. Thirteen of them were selected for this review. The results of the studies about alcohol consumption among seafarers and fishermen showed a wide range of prevalence, from 11.5% to 89.5% (median 53.0%). Concerning seafarers no stratified data were available for further analyses. Among fishermen alcohol consumption has decreased over the period examined (56.9% [2010-2014] vs. 42.3% [2015-2018]). The evaluation of socio-demographic factors showed alcohol consumption was less prevalent in fishermen > 60 years (15.0%). Furthermore, a higher prevalence of alcohol intake was found in those with a lower education (63.9%). In respect of job-related data, 61.0% of the alcohol consuming fishermen reported they had been involved in an accident due to alcohol consumption.
   Conclusions: The consumption of alcohol among fishermen has declined over time. Compared with the land-based European population, seafarers and fishermen show a lower prevalence of alcohol use, at least during their stay on board. Due to the limited data available - especially concerning seafarers - further studies on the prevalence of alcohol consumption among shipboard crews are recommended. In particular, these should provide more data on alcohol consumption related to socio-demographic and job-related factors.

AB  - Background Homelessness is a global public health concern, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) could represent an underappreciated factor in the health trajectories of homeless and marginally housed individuals. We aimed to evaluate the lifetime prevalence of TBI in this population, and to summarise findings on TBI incidence and the association between TBI and health-related or functioning-related outcomes.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched without date restrictions for original research studies in English that reported data on the prevalence or incidence of TBI, or the association between TBI and one or more health-related or function-related outcome measures. Studies were included if they had a group or clearly identifiable subgroup of individuals who were homeless, marginally housed, or seeking services for homeless people. With use of random-effects models, we calculated pooled estimates of the lifetime prevalence of any severity of TBI and the lifetime prevalence of moderate or severe TBI. We used meta-regression and subgroup analysis to evaluate potential moderators of prevalence estimates and the leave-one-out method for sensitivity analyses. We then summarised findings from all studies that evaluated TBI incidence and the association between TBI and health-related or functioning-related outcomes. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.5.1. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019119678.
   Findings Of 463 potentially eligible studies identified by the search, 38 studies were included in the systematic review and 22 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The lifetime prevalence of any severity of TBI in homeless and marginally housed individuals (18 studies, n=9702 individuals) was 53.1% (95% CI 46.4-59.7; I-2=97%) and the lifetime prevalence of moderate or severe TBI (nine studies, n=5787) was 22.5% (13.5-35.0; I-2=99%). The method used to ascertain TBI history, the age of the sample, and the sample size significantly moderated estimated lifetime prevalence of any severity of TBI. TBI was consistently associated with poorer self-reported physical and mental health, higher suicidality and suicide risk, memory concerns, and increased health service use and criminal justice system involvement.
   Interpretation The lifetime prevalence of TBI is high among homeless and marginally housed individuals, and a history of TBI is associated with poorer health and general functioning. Health-care providers and public health officials should have an increased awareness of the burden of TBI in this population. Prospective and longitudinal studies are needed to better understand how the health of this population is affected by TBI. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives Psychosocial work stressors are common exposures affecting the working population, and there is good evidence that they have adverse health consequences. There is some evidence that they may impact on mortality, but this has not been systematically examined. We performed a systematic review, including risk of bias, and meta-analyses of observational studies to examine the association between psychosocial work stressors and all-cause mortality and death due to coronary heart disease (CHD).
   Methods Electronic databases were searched to identify studies and information on study characteristics and outcomes extracted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Risk estimates of outcomes associated with psychosocial work stressors: specifically, all-cause mortality, and death due to CHD were pooled using inverse variance weighted random effects meta-analysis.
   Results We identified 45 eligible cohort studies, of which 32 were included in the quantitative analyses of psychosocial work stressors and mortality. Low job control was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.37, minimally-adjusted; HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10, multivariable-adjusted; HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06 exclusion of low quality studies and multivariable-adjusted] and CHD mortality [HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.42-1.58, minimally-adjusted; HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17-1.30, multivariable-adjusted; HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.40, exclusion of low quality studies and multivariable-adjusted].
   Conclusions Workers with low job control are at increased risk of all-cause and CHD mortality compared to workers with high job control. Policy and practice interventions to improve job control could contribute to reductions in all-cause and CHD mortality.

AB  - There is currently no effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. It has been proposed, however, that a modest delay in onset can significantly reduce the number of cases. Thus, prevention and intervention strategies are currently the focus of much research. In the search for compounds that potentially confer benefit, the Amla fruit and its extracts have drawn attention. Amla preparations have been used for centuries in traditional Indian medicine systems such as Ayurveda, with various parts of the plant used to treat a variety of diseases. Here we review many animal-based studies, and some clinical trials, which have shown that Amla, and its extracts, exert many positive effects on dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy, that contribute to AD risk. Collectively, this evidence suggests that Amla may be of value as part of an effective disease-delaying treatment for AD.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of the three main eating disorders (EDs) anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) is increasing, and a growing number of patients with EDs is seeking professional help. Thus, there is a need for additional treatment strategies in EDs. The aim of this review was to summarize the literature on the benefits and risks of music as well as the evidence for its therapeutic application in people with EDs.
   Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature review on scientific studies on the effect of music in people with or at risk for EDs using PubMed and the Web of Science database. The search terms used were: "music", "music therapy", "eating disorders", "anorexia nervosa", "bulimia nervosa" and "binge eating disorder".
   Results: 16 out of 119 identified and screened articles qualified as scientific studies involving a total of 3,792 participants. They reported on the use of music or music therapy in individuals with or at risk of AN and BN, but not BED. In inpatients with AN, listening to classical music was beneficial to food consumption. Singing in a group reduced post-prandial anxiety in AN inpatients and outpatients. Vodcasts which also included positive visual or autobiographical stimuli helped BN patients with anxiety and body image perception. Songwriting and sessions with a Body Monochord helped with the processing of therapeutically relevant topics in AN. Watching music videos, however, reinforced body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, bodyweight concerns, preoccupation with physical appearance in pre-teenage and teenage girls, and drive for muscularity in adolescent boys.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the therapeutic application of music may be beneficial in patients with AN and BN. However, the availability of studies with a rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is scarce.

AB  - Precarious employment has expanded during the last decades, but there is no full consensus on its definition, and its impact on mental health is not completely understood. The relevance of several micro- and macro-level variables in the association between precarious employment and mental health has not been fully addressed. This review has 2 aims: to identify scientific evidence on the relationship between various dimensions of precarious employment and mental health, and to synthesize the inclusion of a gender-sensitive perspective, context variables, workers' household variables, and the discussion of causal mechanisms underlying the association. The literature was searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and PsycINFO including articles dated 2010-May 2018. A minimum of 2 independent reviewers assessed each article regarding quality and eligibility criteria. The search retrieved 1522 papers, of which 54 (corresponding to 53 studies) met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies analyzing job insecurity, temporariness and multidimensional approaches reported a significant association. Nevertheless, results for working time arrangements and downsizing are inconclusive. Around half of the studies included sex-stratified analyses and formulated contradictory conclusions. Overall, 7 studies considered workers' household situation and only 3 delivered significant results, and 16 described some of the potential pathways. There is evidence of an association between various precarious employment approaches and mental health problems. Further research (preferably longitudinal) should aim to discuss theoretical models explaining the pathways between precarious employment and mental health, including a gender-sensitive perspective, and integrating several levels of individual and contextual variables.

AB  - Insomnia is a symptom of physical or mental disorder and refers to decreased sleep time and potentially low quality. There is evidence showing that acupuncture could enhance management of insomnia, and Sanyinjiao (SP 6) is one of the promising acupoints. This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of stimulating single acupoint SP 6 in managing insomnia. The study was registered under PROSPERO CRD42019140855. English and Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled trials on single acupoint SP 6 stimulation in management of insomnia. Quality of methodology was assessed by two authors independently using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and reporting quality was assessed by the STRICTA checklist. The primary outcome was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and secondary outcomes were improvement in clinical effect and sleep duration assessed by polysomnogram (PSG). The extracted data were pooled and meta-analyzed with RevMan 5.3 software. Four trials involving 288 participants were included in this review. The findings showed that SP 6 stimulation could improve sleep quality (MD -0.30, 95% CI [-0.52, -0.08]), lengthen deep sleep duration (MD 80.46, 95% CI [56.47, 104.45]), rapid eye movement (REM) duration (MD 91.53, 95% CI [68.41, 114.65]), and increase improvement in clinical effect. Quality of reporting and methodology was limited in all included trials. Some limited evidence showed that single acupoint stimulation of SP 6 could improve sleep quality, lengthen deep sleep and REM duration of patients with insomnia. However, the findings in this review should be interpreted with caution due to methodological limitations.

The Ethics Committee of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA) launched a survey on involuntary admission procedures of patients with mental disorders in 40 countries to gather information from all National Psychiatric Associations that are members of the EPA to develop recommendations for improving involuntary admission processes and promote voluntary care. Methods. The survey focused on legislation of involuntary admissions and key actors involved in the admission procedure as well as most common reasons for involuntary admissions. Results. We analyzed the survey categorical data in themes, which highlight that both medical and legal actors are involved in involuntary admission procedures. Conclusions. We conclude that legal reasons for compulsory admission should be reworded in order to remove stigmatization of the patient, that raising awareness about involuntary admission procedures and patient rights with both patients and family advocacy groups is paramount, that communication about procedures should be widely available in lay-language for the general population, and that training sessions and guidance should be available for legal and medical practitioners. Finally, people working in the field need to be constantly aware about the ethical challenges surrounding compulsory admissions.

AB  - Introduction: Evidence suggesting a link between neighborhood ethnic-racial concentrations and adolescent behaviour problems in the U.S. is mixed, with some studies documenting negative and others positive associations. This work raises important questions about promoting and inhibiting effects of neighborhood environments characterized by high concentrations of ethnic-racial minority groups, including Asian Americans, Blacks or African Americans, and Latinos. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine 1) the magnitude, direction, and variability of the association between neighborhood ethnic-racial concentrations and adolescent behaviour problems, and 2) whether these associations varied by putative moderators.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search in PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed as well as searching reference lists and relying on expert knowledge (285 initial records). We coded the records for theoretical and design elements.
   Results: We included 40 effect sizes from 17 records (24% unpublished) with N = 11,858. The average association between neighborhood ethnic-racial concentrations and adolescent behaviour problems was not significantly different from zero (r = - 0.001, 95% CI -0.048, 0.046, p = .964, tau(2) = 0.006); there was a large percentage of systematic heterogeneity (I-2 = 77.1%), which was not explained by putative moderators.
   Conclusions: There is substantial unexplained systematic heterogeneity in the association between neighborhood ethnic-racial concentrations and adolescents' behaviour problems. There is heavy reliance on a small number of parent datasets in research on this topic, alongside critical reporting omissions. We offer recommendations to guide future work, in hopes of supporting culturally and developmentally informed policies and programs capable of addressing residential segregation.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a systematic review of literature on use and efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for treatment of treatment-resistant depression in adults and adolescents.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review according to the Prisma Guidelines of literature indexed on the PubMed, SciELO, Psychiatry Online, Scopus, PsycArticles, Science Direct and the Journal of Medical Case Reports databases. Randomized controlled trials, open studies and case reports were included in the review.
   Results: The searches returned a total of 1,580 articles, published from 1985 to 2017. After applying the inclusion criteria, 17 articles were selected, their complete texts were read and 8 were included in this review. Four of these studies were randomized controlled trials with adults, one of which covered a post-study follow-up period; two were randomized controlled trials with adolescents, one of which presented follow-up data; one was an open study; and one was a case report. The studies provide good quality and robust evidence on the topic addressed.
   Conclusions: A combination of CBT with pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant patients shows a decrease in depressive symptoms. CBT can be an effective type of therapy for adults and adolescents with treatment-resistant depression.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review that examined the link between individual drug categories and violent outcomes. We searched for primary case-control and cohort investigations that reported risk of violence against others among individuals diagnosed with drug use disorders using validated clinical criteria, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We identified 18 studies published during 1990-2019, reporting data from 591,411 individuals with drug use disorders. We reported odds ratios of the violence risk in different categories of drug use disorders compared with those without. We found odds ratios ranging from 0.8 to 25.0 for most individual drug categories, with generally higher odds ratios among individuals with polydrug use disorders. In addition, we explored sources of between-study heterogeneity by subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Cohort investigations reported a lower risk of violence than case-control reports (odds ratio = 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1, 3.5) vs. 6.6 (95% CI: 5.1, 8.6)), and associations were stronger when the outcome was any violence rather than intimate partner violence (odds ratio = 5.7 (95% CI: 3.8, 8.6) vs. 1.7 (95% CI: 1.4, 2.1)), which was consistent with results from the meta-regression. Overall, these findings highlight the potential impact of preventing and treating drug use disorders on reducing violence risk and associated morbidities.

AB  - Background: Regular aerobic exercises could improve global cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), such as aerobic dance a type of commonly practiced aerobic exercises. However, its effects remain debatable in improving the cognitive function in patients with MCI.
   Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effects of aerobic dance on cognitive function among older adults with MCI.
   Methods: We searched articles in the MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library databases from inception to 28 February 2019, with the following criteria: 1) randomized controlled trials; 2) older adults with MCI; 3) aerobic dance intervention.
   Results: Five studies of 842 participants were identified. This meta-analysis showed that aerobic dance can significantly improve global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination: MD = 1.43; 95%CI:[0.59, 2.27]; p = 0.0009; Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale: MD=-2.30; 95%CI:[-3.60, -1.00]; p = 0.0005), and delayed recall ability (SMD = 0.46;95%CI: [0.30, 0.62]; p < 0.00001) in older adults with MCI. In addition, have positive effects on improving executive function (Trial-Making Test A: MD = -2.37;95%CI:[-4.16, -0.58]; p = 0.010; Trial-Making Test B: MD = -16.0; 95%CI: [-30.03, -2.11]; p = 0.020) and immediate recall ability (SMD = 0.24;95%CI: [0.01, 0.46]; p = 0.04).
   Conclusion: Aerobic dance significantly improves global cognitive function and memory in older adults with MCI. In addition, it also benefits executive function. However, due to the limitations as the review states, more randomized controlled trials with better study design and larger sample sizes should be conducted in the future research to make it much clearer.

AB  - Aim The at-risk mental state (ARMS) allows clinicians to identify individuals who have an increased risk of developing psychosis. At present, most screening for psychosis-risk is carried out within help-seeking populations; however, screening within educational settings may allow clinicians to identify individuals at-risk earlier and to increase the rate of detection. This review aimed to examine screening for the ARMS in educational settings, with the key questions: what screening tools have been used in educational settings, can screening in educational settings detect individuals with ARMS, what threshold scores in screening tools indicate a positive screen in educational settings, are there comorbid mental health conditions associated with the ARMS in educational settings? Methods Searches were carried out in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science and reference lists of included articles searched. Results were summarized using narrative synthesis. Results Nine papers were included for narrative synthesis. A variety of screening tools have been used when screening for the ARMS in educational settings. The majority of studies have been conducted in schools. The prevalence of the ARMS reported in ranges from 1% to 8%. Conclusions The ARMS indicates the presence of distressing symptoms for which intervention may be beneficial. Screening programmes within educational settings may allow outreach for prodromal symptoms at an earlier stage than clinical settings currently provided for.

AB  - There is continued interest in developing effective and innovative treatment approaches to manage and improve outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Included in this, is the potential use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a neuromodulatory tool currently recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as a treatment for depression. This review considers the application of rTMS after TBI, focussing on its therapeutic efficacy for a broad range of sequalae, whether an optimal and safe rTMS protocol can be determined, and recommendations for future clinical and research work. Five research databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, and Web of Science) were electronically searched, identifying 30 empirical studies (single and multiple subject case reports; randomized controlled trials) for the full review. Evidence suggests that rTMS has the potential to be an efficacious therapeutic intervention for multiple symptoms after TBI, including depression, dizziness, central pain, and visual neglect. However, the picture is less encouraging for prolonged disorders of consciousness and mixed for cognitive outcomes. Overall, rTMS was well-tolerated by patients, although some incidents of side effects and seizures have been reported. Recommendations are made for more comprehensive guidelines and sufficient reporting of rTMS parameters and procedures.

AB  - Background The implementation of a theoretical intersectionality framework into quantitative data analyses is gaining increasing interest in health research. The substantive foundation of intersectionality was established in the U.S., based on the claim of black feminists to broaden the scope of contemporary gender studies by considering the intersection between sex/gender and race/ethnicity more firmly. The aim of our scoping review with particular emphasis on sex/gender was to assess how intersectionality-informed studies in epidemiological research considered different social dimensions in their multivariable and multivariate analyses. Methods Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), we conducted a literature review in PubMed. Three distinct health-related fields were brought into focus: diabetes representing a frequent chronic disease, smoking as a wide-spread behavioural health determinant and physical activity as a central target for health promotion. Initially, we compared which and how different social dimensions were accounted for and how inter-categorical and intersectionality-informed analyses were conducted. Further, we assessed sex/gender sensitivity by comparing operationalisation of sex/gender, how sex/gender theories were used and which central theoretical sex/gender concepts were referred to when aiming at explanation of (intersectional) sex/gender differences. Results Our results suggest, that intersectionality-based analyses within the three selected health-related fields are mainly conducted in the U.S. and focused on the intersection between sex/gender and race/ethnicity by using them jointly as subgrouping variables and as parts of interaction terms in regression analyses. Income and education as proxies for social class as well as age are mainly used for adjustment in quantitative analyses. Other approaches for calculating interactions (i.a. synergy-index, CART-analysis) are an exception. Even though sex/gender was considered in every included study and Gender was the most frequent theoretical sex/gender concept referred to when theoretically explaining sex/gender differences, it was exclusively operationalised as binary and solution-linked sex/gender variables were hardly considered in quantitative analyses. Conclusion The systematic integration of solution-linked variables indicating modifiable aspects of sex/gender-related living conditions and disadvantages could improve sex/gender sensitivity as part of intersectionality-based quantitative data analysis in health research.

AB  - Objective Individual placement and support (IPS) has shown consistently better outcomes on competitive employment for patients with severe mental illness than traditional vocational rehabilitation. The evidence for efficacy originates from few countries, and generalization to different countries has been questioned. This has delayed implementation of IPS and led to requests for country-specific RCTs. This meta-analysis examines if evidence for IPS efficacy can be generalized between rather different countries. Methods A systematic search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines to identify RCTs. Overall efficacy was established by meta-analysis. The generalizability of IPS efficacy between countries was analysed by random-effects meta-regression, employing country- and date-specific contextual data obtained from the OECD and the World Bank. Results The systematic review identified 27 RCTs. Employment rates are more than doubled in IPS compared with standard vocational rehabilitation (RR 2.07 95% CI 1.82-2.35). The efficacy of IPS was marginally moderated by strong legal protection against dismissals. It was not moderated by regulation of temporary employment, generosity of disability benefits, type of integration policies, GDP, unemployment rate or employment rate for those with low education. Conclusions The evidence for efficacy of IPS is very strong. The efficacy of IPS can be generalized between countries.

AB  - Since the last Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) effort to review biological effects of the exposure to organohalogen compounds (OHCs) in Arctic biota, there has been a considerable number of new Arctic effect studies. Here, we provide an update on the state of the knowledge of OHC, and also include mercury, exposure and/or associated effects in key Arctic marine and terrestrial mammal and bird species as well as in fish by reviewing the literature published since the last AMAP assessment in 2010. We aimed at updating the knowledge of how single but also combined health effects are or can be associated to the exposure to single compounds or mixtures of OHCs. We also focussed on assessing both potential individual as well as population health impacts using population-specific exposure data post 2000. We have identified quantifiable effects on vitamin metabolism, immune functioning, thyroid and steroid hormone balances, oxidative stress, tissue pathology, and reproduction. As with the previous assessment, a wealth of documentation is available for biological effects in marine mammals and seabirds, and sentinel species such as the sledge dog and Arctic fox, but information for terrestrial vertebrates and fish remain scarce. While hormones and vitamins are thoroughly studied, oxidative stress, immunotoxic and reproductive effects need further investigation. Depending on the species and population, some OHCs and mercury tissue contaminant burdens post 2000 were observed to be high enough to exceed putative risk threshold levels that have been previously estimated for non-target species or populations outside the Arctic. In this assessment, we made use of risk quotient calculations to summarize the cumulative effects of different OHC classes and mercury for which critical body burdens can be estimated for wildlife across the Arctic. As our ultimate goal is to better predict or estimate the effects of OHCs and mercury in Arctic wildlife at the individual, population and ecosystem level, there remain numerous knowledge gaps on the biological effects of exposure in Arctic biota. These knowledge gaps include the establishment of concentration thresholds for individual compounds as well as for realistic cocktail mixtures that in fact indicate biologically relevant, and not statistically determined, health effects for specific species and subpopulations. Finally, we provide future perspectives on understanding Arctic wildlife health using new in vivo, in vitro, and in silico techniques, and provide case studies on multiple stressors to show that future assessments would benefit from significant efforts to integrate human health, wildlife ecology and retrospective and forecasting aspects into assessing the biological effects of OHC and mercury exposure in Arctic wildlife and fish.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease constitutes a growing cause of cognitive impairment in aging population. Given that current treatments do not produce the desired therapeutic effects, the need for finding alternative biological and pharmacological approaches is critical. Accumulating evidence suggests inflammatory and oxidative stress responses as potential causal factors of cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease and healthy aging. Curcumin has received increased interest due to its unique molecular structure that targets inflammatory and antioxidant pathways as well as (directly) amyloid aggregation; one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this review summarizes preclinical and clinical findings on curcumin as a potential cognitive enhancer in Alzheimer's disease and normal aging. Databases used for literature searches include PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science; in addition, clinicaltrials.gov was used to search for clinical studies. Overall, animal research has shown very promising results in potentiating cognition, both physiologically and behaviourally. However, human studies are limited and results are less consistent, complicating their interpretation. These inconsistencies may be related to differences in methodology and the included population. Taking into account measurements of important inflammatory and antioxidant biomarkers, optimal dosages of curcumin, food interactions, and duration of treatment would increase our understanding on curcumins promising effects on cognition. In addition, increasing curcumin's bioavailability could benefit future research.

We also sought to identify the key ethical and methodological issues that Australian psychologists should be aware of before commencing a forensic evaluation of a young offender. Method Using search terms "expert witness, pre-sentence report, pre-sentence report, forensic mental health assessment, Forensic Mental Health Assessment, forensic assessment, methodology, forensic model, and sentencing juveniles" we searched for peer reviewed articles published between the years 2000-2018 on the PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and ProQuest data bases. Results Drawing upon available literature we identified the knowledge and skills required for evaluations and the ethical standards available to help guide the evaluation. Due to the lack of Australian research in this area, we had to rely on international literature regarding recommended evaluation methods. There is no clear statement on what the psychology profession in Australia believes is an appropriate evaluation methodology and what content is required in a pre-sentence report. There is no specific data clarifying what Australian judicial officers find helpful in pre-sentence reports. Conclusions Our article highlights the need for further research into Australian evaluation methodology for pre-sentence reports, and the need for professional standards and guidelines specific to Australian jurisdictions.

AB  - Introduction: Cognitive assessment of older adults who are either illiterate or with low levels of education is particularly challenging because several battery tasks require a certain educational background. Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly using validated screening tools is of great importance since this population group could benefit from new drugs that are being investigated for the treatment of dementias. Cutoff scores for psychometric properties of cognitive tests are not well established among adults with low levels of education. The present study aimed to critically review the literature on cognitive assessment tools for screening cognitive syndromes including MCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults with low levels of education. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane, and SCOPUS electronic databases of cross-sectional and prospective studies with adults over 55 years of age. Results: We found a significant number of assessment tools available (n = 44), but only a few of them showed diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of MCI and AD in older adults with low levels of education: the Mini-Mental State Exam; the Montreal Cognitive Assessment; the Persian Test of Elderly for Assessment of Cognition and Executive Function; the Six-Item Screener; and the Memory Alteration Test. Few studies evaluated individuals with low levels of education, with a wide range of cutoff scores and cognitive test batteries. Conclusion: We found that a small number of studies evaluated adults with 4 years of formal education or less. Our findings further support the importance of developing specific tools for the assessment of older adults with low levels of education.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder featuring repetitive intrusive thoughts and behaviors associated with a significant handicap. Of patients, 20% are refractory to medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. Refractory OCD is associated with suicidal behavior and significant degradation of social and professional functioning, with high health costs. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been proposed as a reversible and controllable method to treat refractory patients, with meta-analyses showing 60% response rate following DBS, whatever the target: anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), anteromedial subthalamic nucleus (amSTN), or inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP). But how do we choose the "best" target? Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that ALIC-DBS requires the modulation of the fiber tract within the ventral ALIC via the ventral striatum, bordering the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and connecting the medial prefrontal cortex with the thalamus to be successful. VC/VS effective sites of stimulation were found within the VC and primarily connected to the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) dorsomedial thalamus, amygdala, and the habenula. NAcc-DBS has been found to reduce OCD symptoms by decreasing excessive fronto-striatal connectivity between NAcc and the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. The amSTN effective stimulation sites are located at the inferior medial border of the STN, primarily connected to lateral OFC, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Finally, ITP-DBS recruits a bidirectional fiber pathway between the OFC and the thalamus. Thus, these functional connectivity studies show that the various DBS targets lie within the same diseased neural network. They share similar efficacy profiles on OCD symptoms as estimated on the Y-BOCS, the amSTN being the target supported by the strongest evidence in the literature. VC/VS-DBS, amSTN-DBS, and ALIC-DBS were also found to improve mood, behavioral adaptability and potentially both, respectively. Because OCD is such a heterogeneous disease with many different symptom dimensions, the ultimate aim should be to find the most appropriate DBS target for a given refractory patient. This quest will benefit from further investigation and understanding of the individual functional connectivity of OCD patients.

AB  - Globally, anomalously warm temperature events have increased by 34% in frequency and 17% in duration from 1925 to 2016 with potentially major impacts on coastal ecosystems. These "marine heatwaves" (MHWs) have been linked to changes in primary productivity, community composition and biogeography of seaweeds, which often control ecosystem function and services. Here we review the literature on seaweed responses to MHWs, including 58 observations related to resistance, bleaching, changes in abundance, species invasions and local to regional extinctions. More records existed for canopy-forming kelps and bladed and filamentous turf-forming seaweeds than for canopy-forming fucoids, geniculate coralline turf and crustose coralline algae. Turf-forming seaweeds, especially invasive seaweeds, generally increased in abundance after a MHW, whereas native canopy-forming kelps and fucoids typically declined in abundance. We also found four examples of regional extinctions of kelp and fucoids following specific MHWs, events that likely have long term consequences for ecological structure and functioning. Although a relatively small number of studies have described impacts of MHWs on seaweed, the broad range of documented responses highlights the necessity of better baseline information regarding seaweed distributions and performance, and the need to study specific characteristics of MHWs that affect the vulnerability and resilience of seaweeds to these increasingly important climatic perturbations. A major challenge will be to disentangle impacts caused by the extreme temperature increases of MHWs itself from co-occurring potential stressors including altered current patterns, increasing herbivory, changes in water clarity and nutrient content, solar radiation and desiccation stress in the intertidal zone. With future increases anticipated in the intensity, duration and frequencies of MHWs, we expect to see more replacements of large long-lived habitat forming seaweeds with smaller ephemeral seaweeds, reducing the habitat structure and effective services seaweed-dominated reefs can provide.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) was established in 2010 with $500 million in funding provided by British Petroleum over a 10-year period to support research on the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and recovery. Contributions of the GoMRI program to date focused on human health are presented in more than 32 peer-reviewed papers published between 2011 and May 2019. Primary findings from review of these papers are (i) the large quantity of dispersants used in the oil cleanup have been associated with human health concerns, including through obesogenicity, toxicity, and illnesses from aerosolization of the agents; (ii) oil contamination has been associated with potential for increases in harmful algal blooms and numbers of pathogenic Vibrio bacteria in oil-impacted waters; and (iii) members of Gulf communities who are heavily reliant upon natural resources for their livelihoods were found to be vulnerable to high levels of life disruptions and institutional distrust. Positive correlations include a finding that a high level of community attachment was beneficial for recovery. Actions taken to improve disaster response and reduce stress-associated health effects could lessen negative impacts of similar disasters in the future. Furthermore, GoMRI has supported annual conferences beginning in 2013 at which informative human health-related presentations have been made. Based on this review, it is recommended that the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 be updated to include enhanced funding for oil spill impacts to human health.

AB  - Issue addressed Noncommunicable chronic disease underlies much of the life expectancy gap experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Modifying contributing risk factors; tobacco smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity, social and emotional wellbeing (SNAPS) could help close this disease gap. This scoping review identified and describes SNAPS health promotion programs implemented for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. Methods Databases PubMed, CINAHL, Informit (Health Collection and Indigenous Peoples Collection), Scopus, Trove and relevant websites and clearing houses were searched for eligible studies until June 2015. To meet the inclusion criteria the program had to focus on modifying one of the SNAPS risk factors and the majority of participants had to identify as being of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander heritage. Results The review identified 71 health promotion programs, described in 83 publications. Programs were implemented across a range of health and community settings and included all Australian states and territories, from major cities to remote communities. The SNAPS factor addressed most commonly was nutrition. Some programs included the whole community, or had multiple key audiences, whilst others focused solely on one subgroup of the population such as chronic disease patients, pregnant women or youth. Fourteen of the programs reported no outcome assessments. Conclusions Health promotion programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have not been adequately evaluated. The majority of programs focused on the development of individual skills and changing personal behaviours without addressing the other health promotion action areas, such as creating supportive environments or reorienting health care services. So What? This scoping review provides a summary of the health promotion programs that have been delivered in Australia for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to prevent or manage chronic disease. These programs, although many are limited in quality, should be used to inform future programs. To improve evidence-based health promotion practice, health promotion initiatives need to be evaluated and the findings published publicly.

AB  - Aims: Several meta-analyses of observational studies report a long-term correlation between air pollution and the risk of cancer, particularly lung carcinoma. The aim of this study was to review and quantify evidence for an association between air pollution and the risk of developing non-lung cancers. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the reference lists of the included studies as well as those recorded in previous meta-analyses conducted before January 2019. A random-effects model was used to derive overall risk estimates per pollutant. Results: A total of 20 studies, including 5 case-control and 15 prospective cohort studies, were used in the final analysis. The risk of developing non-lung cancer was 1.09 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.18, I-2 = 72.9%) per NO2 increases of 10 mu g/m(3). There was also a significant association between exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 and the risk of non-lung cancer when the male and female populations were combined (pooled odds ratio/relative risk (OR/RR) = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.11-1.34; I-2 = 0.0% and pooled OR/RR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05-1.52; I-2 = 43.9%, respectively). Regarding the type of cancer, significant harmful effects of PM2.5 were observed for liver cancer populations (pooled OR/RR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.10-1.32; I-2 = 0.0%). Different types of cancer were positively associated with the incidence of non-lung cancer and PM10 in the random-effect meta-regression analysis. Conclusion: Long-term exposure to air pollutants appears to be associated with an increased risk of non-lung cancer. Care should be taken in interpretation, because the results for specific cancers were restricted.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders with a global burden of approximately 6.1 million patients. Alpha-synuclein has been linked to both the sporadic and familial forms of the disease. Moreover, alpha-synuclein is present in Lewy-bodies, the neuropathological hallmark of PD, and the protein and its aggregation have been widely linked to neurotoxic pathways that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration. Such pathways include autophagy/lysosomal dysregulation, synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial disruption, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress. Alpha-synuclein has not only been shown to alter cellular pathways but also to spread between cells, causing aggregation in host cells. Therapeutic approaches will need to address several, if not all, of these angles of alpha-synuclein toxicity. Here we review the current advances in therapeutic efforts for PD that aim to produce a disease-modifying therapy by targeting the spread, production, aggregation, and degradation of alpha-synuclein. These include: receptor blocking strategies whereby putative alpha-synuclein receptors could be blocked inhibiting alpha-synuclein spread, an alpha-synuclein reduction which will decrease the amount alpha-synuclein available for aggregation and pathway disruption, the use of small molecules in order to target alpha-synuclein aggregation, immunotherapy and the increase of alpha-synuclein degradation by increasing autophagy/lysosomal flux. The research discussed here may lead to a disease-modifying therapy that tackles disease onset and progression in the future.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders that affect people of all genders, ages, and races. Medicinal herbs have gained wide attention from researchers and have been considered to be a beneficial adjuvant agent to oral antidiabetic drugs because of their integrated effects. Concerning the various beneficial effects of Nigella sativa, this systematic review aims to provide comprehensive information on the effects of Nigella sativa on glucose and insulin profile status in humans. A computerized database search performed through Scopus and Medline via Ebscohost with the following set of keywords: Nigella Sativa OR black seed oil OR thymoquinone OR black cumin AND diabetes mellitus OR hyperglycemia OR blood glucose OR hemoglobin A1C had returned 875 relevant articles. A total of seven articles were retrieved for further assessment and underwent data extraction to be included in this review. Nigella sativa was shown to significantly improve laboratory parameters of hyperglycemia and diabetes control after treatment with a significant fall in fasting blood glucose, blood glucose level 2 h postprandial, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin resistance, and a rise in serum insulin. In conclusion, these findings suggested that Nigella sativa could be used as an adjuvant for oral antidiabetic drugs in diabetes control.

AB  - The practice of educating individuals (known as 'gatekeepers' [GK]) at the informal social level with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to identify an at-risk individual and provide support has been shown as an effective suicide prevention method. Despite the efficacy of gatekeeper training (GKT) in the short-term, there are concerns over the long-term efficacy of these outcomes. The objective of this review was to identify the empirical GKT studies in the literature that included evaluations at pre, post, and follow-up. Additionally, this review aimed to evaluate the long-term effect of training on GK behavior. PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycNET databases were searched using the terms 'gatekeeper' and 'suicid*' present in the title and/or the abstract, with the terms 'follow-up', 'pre-post', or 'long-term' present in any text. Studies must have involved a suicide prevention program intervention provided to general members of the community. Knowledge and self-efficacy were shown to exhibit the strongest endurance of training effect, although some decay was present for knowledge over time (M follow-up delay 6.1 months). Gatekeeper attitude at follow-up (M follow-up delay 4.4 months) had returned to baseline levels in 57% (4/7) of the identified studies that evaluated this construct. Behavioral intention and behavior both indicate a weak training effect with poor translation of training into intervention behavior. Findings indicate the ideological and socio-cultural aspects of individual GKs should also be addressed to facilitate the improved potential for long-term attitudinal change. Future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Background: Effective hypertrophy-oriented resistance training (RT) should comprise a combination of mechanical tension and metabolic stress. Regarding training variables, the most effective values are widely described in the literature. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the efficiency of advanced RT techniques and methods in comparison to traditional approaches. Methods: MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from 1996 to September 2019 for all studies investigating the effects of advanced RT techniques and methods on muscle hypertrophy and training variables. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria and were consequently included for the quality assessment and data extraction. Results: Concerning the time-efficiency of training, the use of agonist-antagonist, upper-lower body supersets, drop and cluster sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, employment of fast, but controlled duration of eccentric contractions (2s), and high-load RT supplemented with low-load RT under blood flow restriction may provide an additional stimulus and an advantage to traditional training protocols. With regard to the higher degree of mechanical tension, the use of accentuated eccentric loading in RT should be considered. Implementation of drop sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, low-load RT in conjunction with low-load RT under blood flow restriction could provide time-efficient solutions to increased metabolic stress. Conclusions: Due to insufficient evidence, it is difficult to provide specific guidelines for volume, intensity of effort, and frequency of previously mentioned RT techniques and methods. However, well-trained athletes may integrate advanced RT techniques and methods into their routines as an additional stimulus to break through plateaus and to prevent training monotony.

AB  - Obesity is associated with difficulties due to stigma and loneliness. These impact negatively on individuals' quality of life and behaviour change efforts. Increased sensitivity to others' negative feedback might play a role in the maintenance of these difficulties and could be addressed in psychological interventions. We conducted a systematic review of interpersonal difficulties in individuals with obesity, across the lifespan. We investigated early interpersonal adversity (i.e. frequency of teasing/bullying), perceived interpersonal stress and quality of social life, based on a rejection sensitivity model. The databases PubMed, Web of Knowledge and AGRIS, Embase, Medline and PsychINFO were searched for published peer-reviewed journal articles (1980-June 2018). Thirty-two studies met inclusion criteria. Results from the meta-analyses (n = 16 studies) indicated that overweight/obese individuals reported more frequent experiences of teasing/bullying, greater interpersonal stress and poorer quality of social life than healthy weight individuals. Findings in the systematic review aligned to this evidence. Psychological interventions targeting increased sensitivity to negative interpersonal feedback could improve interpersonal functioning and, in turn, eating behaviours in individuals with obesity.

AB  - Globally, suicide is a major public health problem among homeless people. Suicidal ideation and attempt are remarkably higher among homeless people as compared to the general population and they are linked with greater risk of complete suicide. However, no systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to report the consolidated magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempt among homeless people. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus to identify pertinent studies on suicidal ideation and attempt among homeless people. A meta-analysis of the studies was conducted using a random effect model. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis and Cochran's Q- and the I-2 test was employed to evaluate heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots. In total, 20 eligible studies with 27,497 homeless people matched the inclusion criteria. Nineteen studies assessed suicidal attempt and thirteen studies assessed suicidal ideation among homeless people. The pooled current and lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation was 17.83% (95% CI;10.73-28.14) and 41.60% (95% CI; 28.55-55.95), respectively whereas the pooled current and lifetime prevalence of suicidal attempt was 9.16% (95% CI;4.10-19.20) and 28.80% (95% CI; 21.66-37.18), respectively. We found a considerable heterogeneity between the studies, but we found no significant publication bias. The current review revealed a remarkably higher magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempt among homeless people as compared to the estimated prevalence in the general population. The concerned stakeholders need to give attention to address this problem emphasizing more on prevention and treatment strategies as well as utilizing holistic approaches to address the potential predictors of suicide among homeless people including physical, mental, and substance use problems.

AB  - People with mental illness experience increased chronic disease burden, contributed to by a greater prevalence of modifiable chronic disease risk behaviours. Policies recommend mental health services provide preventive care for such risk behaviours. Provision of such care has not previously been synthesised. This review assessed the provision of preventive care for modifiable chronic disease risk behaviours by mental health services. Four databases were searched from 2006 to 2017. Eligible studies were observational quantitative study designs conducted in mental health services, where preventive care was provided to clients for tobacco smoking, harmful alcohol consumption, inadequate nutrition, or inadequate physical activity. Two reviewers independently screened studies, conducted data extraction and critical appraisal. Results were pooled as proportions of clients receiving or clinicians providing preventive care using random effects meta-analyses, by risk behaviour and preventive care element (ask/assess, advise, assist, arrange). Subgroup analyses were conducted by mental health service type (inpatient, outpatient, other/multiple). Narrative synthesis was used where meta-analysis was not possible. Thirty-eight studies were included with 26 amenable to meta-analyses. Analyses revealed that rates of assessment were highest for smoking (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI]:59%-96%) and lowest for nutrition (17%, 95% CI:1%-35%); with variable rates of care provision for all behaviours, care elements, and across service types, with substantial heterogeneity across analyses. Findings indicated suboptimal and variable provision of preventive care for modifiable chronic disease risk behaviours in mental health services, but should be considered with caution due to the very low quality of cumulative evidence.

AB  - Introduction: The family Euconulidae is circumglobal, but only one subfamily, the Euconulinae, occurs in the American continent. Fourteen native euconulids, in three genera, have been reported from Costa Rica. Objective: In this paper I describe Tikoconus, a new genus of Euconulinae endemic to Costa Rica. Methods: I dissected alcohol-preserved euconulids collected in Costa Rica. I took photographs or electron micrographs or drew the shell, external anatomy, reproductive system, mantle cavity organs and radula. Results: The genus Tikoconus can be recognized by its semislug appearance and very thin and often flexible subglobose to subglobose-depressed external shell. Other distinctive features of the genus are a lack of black dots on the mantle and the presence of at least some dark blotches on the subpedal groove band. Internally, the urethra has a Z-shaped prolongation that almost reaches the mantle collar. The reproductive system has a distinctive external C-shaped penial gland that surrounds half of the penis circumference and is attached to the penis and to the penial caecum, but not connected to them by ducts. Also, there is an internal mono- or bi-lobulated extension in the penis. The epiphallus has a verge that enters into the penis. The penial sheath surrounds part of the penis, the epiphallus base and the penial retractor muscle insertion, but leaves the penial gland and the penis caecum free. The gametolytic gland is absent. I described two new subgenera: Tikoconus with six new species-T. (T.) costaricanus sp.n. (type species), T. (T.) onca sp.n., T. (T.) andresi sp.n., T. (T.) katyae sp.n., T.(T.) alosii sp.n., T. (T.) subsilvanus sp.n.; and Bribriconus with only one species-T. (B.) thompsoni sp.n. All species have restricted distributions and are endemic to particular watersheds, except for T. costaricanus which occurs nearly throughout the central mountains of Costa Rican. This genus inhabits very wet, little disturbed tropical forests from 400 to 2 500 mast on the Atlantic slope and from 760 to 2 500 masl on the Pacific slope. The genus Velifera, the other semislug euconulid reported from Costa Rica, is kept as a valid taxon and I choose the specimen ANSP 48765 as lectotype of Velifera gabbi with the purpose of clarifying the application of the name to a taxon. Conclusion: A new euconulid genus and seven species were described.

AB  - The Northern Great Plains is a key region to global food production. It is also a region of water stress that includes poor water quality associated with high concentrations of nutrients. Agricultural nitrogen and phosphorus loads to surface waters need to be reduced, yet the unique characteristics of this environment create challenges. The biophysical reality of the Northern Great Plains is one where snowmelt is the major period of nutrient transport, and where nutrients are exported predominantly in dissolved form. This limits the efficacy of many beneficial management practices (BMPs) commonly used in other regions and necessitates place-based solutions. We discuss soil and water management BMPs through a regional lens-first understanding key aspects of hydrology and hydrochemistry affecting BMP efficacy, then discussing the merits of different BMPs for nutrient control. We recommend continued efforts to "keep water on the land" via wetlands and reservoirs. Adoption and expansion of reduced tillage and perennial forage may have contributed to current nutrient problems, but both practices have other environmental and agronomic benefits. The expansion of tile and surface drainage in the Northern Great Plains raises urgent questions about effects on nutrient export and options to mitigate drainage effects. Riparian vegetation is unlikely to significantly aid in nutrient retention, but when viewed against an alternative of extending cultivation and fertilization to the waters' edge, the continued support of buffer strip management and refinement of best practices (e.g., harvesting vegetation) is merited. While the hydrology of the Northern Great Plains creates many challenges for mitigating nutrient losses, it also creates unique opportunities. For example, relocating winter bale-grazing to areas with low hydrologic connectivity should reduce loadings. Managing nutrient applications must be at the center of efforts to mitigate eutrophication. In this region, ensuring nutrients are not applied during hydrologically sensitive periods such as late autumn, on snow, or when soils are frozen will yield benefits. Working to ensure nutrient inputs are balanced with crop demands is crucial in all landscapes. Ultimately, a targeted approach to BMP implementation is required, and this must consider the agronomic and economic context but also the biophysical reality.

AB  - In relation to the growing attention to the quality of physical space in early childhood education and care (ECEC), the present scoping review aims to define the state of the art regarding the relationship between the physical environment of ECEC services and the psychological development of children. After 50 years of research in this field, this contribution should promote understanding of what scientific studies have achieved so far, in order to prompt useful reflections for education professionals and identify future directions of research. A systematic analysis of the psychological and educational databases has provided 88 publications on the topic. The contents of the studies identified refer to two main thematic areas: "perception of physical environment," which includes both children's and adults' perceptions, and "relation between physical environment and child development," which includes behavioral, cognitive, and emotional aspects of development. Although the studies included have used several methods and investigated different aspects of environment, systematic analysis has enabled the identification of some topics that recur among the studies, such as the significance of adults' awareness about their perception of space, the importance of a child-centered approach, and the relevance of the participation of stakeholders in the design processes. Finally, these main findings are summarized and reflections on future conceptual and methodological orientations in the field are discussed.

AB  - Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying differential vulnerability of substantia nigra dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains limited, and previous therapeutic efforts targeting rodent nigral neurons have not been successfully translated to humans. However, recent emergence of induced pluripotent stem cell technology has highlighted some fundamental differences between human and rodent midbrain dopamine neurons that may at least in part explain relative resistance of rodent neurons to degeneration in genetic models of PD. Using GBA1-linked PD as an example, we discuss cellular pathways that may predispose human neurons to degeneration in PD, including mitochondrial oxidant stress, elevated intracellular calcium, altered synaptic vesicle endocytosis, accumulation of oxidized dopamine and neuromelanin. Recent studies have suggested that a combination of mitochondrial oxidant stress and accumulation of oxidized dopamine contribute to dysfunction of nigral neurons in various genetic and sporadic forms of PD. We also briefly summarize the development of targeted therapies for GBA1-associated synucleinopathies and highlight that modulation of wildtype GCase activity serves as an important target for the treatment of genetic and idiopathic forms of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies.

AB  - Profound racial health disparities in maternal and infant health exist in the USA. Discrimination based on race may contribute to these disparities, but the biological pathways through which racial discrimination acts on health are not fully known. Even less is known about these pathways during development. Examining how racial discrimination becomes biology is paramount because it may shed light on how and when such social forces result in lasting biological consequences for health and wellbeing. To begin exploring this issue, we performed a systematic review of the relationships between experiences of chronic racial discrimination and relevant biomarkers measured during pregnancy among African American women. The literature search included studies published prior to August 2018 in the MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases, and 11 studies met our inclusion criteria. We evaluated the articles based on the biological system that the authors investigated, which included the immune, neuroendocrine, and cardiovascular systems. We found that the current literature provides preliminary evidence that experiences of chronic racial discrimination are associated with changes in maternal biology during pregnancy. However, the literature was limited in both quantity and quality. We found only 11 studies that addressed this subject, four of which only provided indirect evidence, and many studies had small sample sizes. Future work in this area should develop more informative methods that consider the interaction between interpersonal and structural racial discrimination, individual variation, and sociocultural factors. We conclude researchers should continue to work in this area and focus on developing more effective study designs and larger sample sizes.

AB  - Increased temperatures and changing amounts of precipitation may alter environments, increasing the challenges faced by mines. This is a paper on topics relevant to metal mine biogeochemical environments, related waste management, element transport, and environment health south of 60 degrees latitude. Mine waste can contain elements of interest (EOI) that may have adverse environmental and biological effects at concentrations that are higher than in undisturbed sites. Elevated concentrations of EOIs are transported by water as solutes and particles. Wind erosion also transports particles, and establishing its contribution and effects is challenging. Dispersal of EOI can be controlled at the source using water covers, geomembranes, geosynthetic clay liners, and covers with capillary barrier effects. Drainage that can be produced over a wide range of pH must be treated to meet environmental requirements. Water treatment can produce sludge that must be stored or processed. The success of these mitigation measures can be observed in the biological health of organisms at the site and vicinity. Processes responsible for EOI dissolution and transport, waste control and water management systems, and the stress experienced by biota near mines are all subject to climate change effects. Understanding and adapting to challenges from a rapidly changing environment will require cooperation between industry, government, mining communities, and scientists. Ideally, adaptation measures should correspond to temperature and precipitation projections, but this information is not always available at the relevant geographic scale. To anticipate emerging risks, it may be necessary to explore a variety of scenarios at lab and field scales, and to implement robust and flexible management techniques.

AB  - Theory of mind (ToM) is defined as the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others and is often said to be one of the cornerstones of efficient social interaction. In recent years, a number of authors have suggested that one particular ToM process occurs spontaneously in that it is rapid and outside of conscious control. This work has argued that humans efficiently compute the visual perspective of other individuals. In this article, we present a critique of this notion both on empirical and theoretical grounds. We argue that the experiments and paradigms that purportedly demonstrate spontaneous perspective-taking have not as yet convincingly demonstrated the existence of such a phenomenon. We also suggest that it is not possible to represent the percept of another person, spontaneous or otherwise. Indeed, the perspective-taking field has suggested that humans can represent the visual experience of others. That is, going beyond assuming that we can represent another's viewpoint in anything other than symbolic form. In this sense, the field suffers from the same problem that afflicted the "pictorial" theory in the mental imagery debate. In the last section we present a number of experiments designed to provide a more thorough assessment of whether humans can indeed represent the visual experience of others.

AB  - This systematic review seeks to evaluate the documented uses of applied theatre practice within an Indian context. For the purposes of this review, specific applied theatre practices were focused upon, notably community theatre, theatre in education, theatre in health education and Theatre for Development. This article was written in preparation for a collaborative research project (http://mhri-project.org) utilizing community theatre practices to investigate mental health and resilience within slum (basti) communities in the city of Pune, in the state of Maharashtra in India. At its most particular level, the review focuses on theatre interventions within migrant slum communities. Of specific interest is the conjunction of applied theatre with research and practice in mental health and wellbeing, and how such collaborations have investigated levels and modes of mental resilience within migrant communities. The review also draws upon related global research to contextualize and inform the Indian context. At present, systematic reviews are not prevalent within the research fields of theatre generally or applied theatre specifically, yet these reviews arguably offer the breadth of objective evidence required to interrogate the efficacy of this practice. This review is therefore intended to rigorously map the existing academic research and the more diffuse online dialogues within India that are pertinent to the subject; to consider the relations, contradictions, absences and inconsistencies within this literature; and, from this, to articulate key findings that may be integrated into the planning and delivery of new initiatives within this field.

AB  - Traditional active avoidance tasks have advanced the field of aversive learning and memory for decades and are useful for studying simple avoidance responses in isolation; however, these tasks have limited clinical relevance because they do not model several key features of clinical avoidance. In contrast, platform-mediated avoidance (PMA) more closely resembles clinical avoidance because the response i) is associated with an unambiguous safe location, ii) is not associated with an artificial termination of the warning signal, and iii) is associated with a decision-based appetitive cost. Recent findings on the neuronal circuits of PMA have confirmed that amygdalastriatal circuits are essential for avoidance. In PMA, however, the prelimbic cortex facilitates the avoidance response early during the warning signal, perhaps through disinhibition of the striatum. Future studies on avoidance should account for additional factors such as sex differences and social interactions that will advance our understanding of maladaptive avoidance contributing to neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Dehumanization is an everyday, pervasive phenomenon in health contexts. Given its detrimental consequences to health care, much research has been dedicated to understanding and promoting the humanization of health services. However, health care service research has neglected the sociopsychological processes involved in the dehumanization of self and others, in formal but also informal health-related contexts. Drawing upon sociopsychological models of dehumanization, this article will bridge this gap by presenting a critical review of studies on everyday meaning-making and person perception processes of dehumanization in health-related contexts. A database search was conducted in PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed, using a combination of keywords on dehumanization and health/illness/body; 3,229 references were screened; 95 full texts were assessed for eligibility; 59 studies were included. Most studies focused on informal contexts, reflecting a decontextualized and one-sided view of dehumanization (i.e., not integrating actors' and victims' perspectives). Despite the dominant focus on self-dehumanization, emerging perspectives uncover the role of processes that deny human uniqueness to others, and their individual determinants and consequences for mental health. A few studies bring to light the functions of a variety of dehumanizing body metaphors on self- and other-dehumanization. These trends in the literature leave several gaps, which are here critically analyzed to inform future research.

AB  - PurposeYoga has been increasingly used as a complementary therapy for eating disorders. However, it is still not clear whether yoga is effective in the prevention and treatment of eating disorders, as some studies suggest that yoga practitioners show elevated levels of disordered eating behaviours. The goal of this systematic review is, thus, to analyse the occurrence of disordered eating behaviours and correlates in yoga practitioners.MethodPRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were used. Search was conducted in several databases and specific journals.ResultsTwelve articles, all cross-sectional, were identified, following PRISMA guidelines. Results across studies were inconsistent. Yoga practice was usually associated with healthier eating behaviours, lower disordered eating symptoms, and higher positive body image and body satisfaction, suggesting that yoga practitioners may be at a lower risk of developing eating disorders. However, other studies suggested that a high dosage of yoga practice may be associated with a higher prevalence of disordered eating behaviours.ConclusionsAs yoga is increasingly used as therapy for eating disorders, understanding the relationship between yoga dosage and disordered eating behaviours is critical to guide treatment recommendations and establish yoga as a valuable complementary therapy.Level of evidenceLevel I, systematic review.

AB  - Background The percentage of smartphone users -especially among minors-is growing, and so is the body of literature hinting at increasing rates of problematic smartphone use in children and adolescents. However, comprehensive reviews regarding this issue are still scarce.
   Objective The main aim of this review was to provide an overview of studies focusing on specific risk factors predicting problematic smartphone use in children and adolescents.
   Methods A literature search was conducted in Google Scholar and PubMed. Results The search yielded 38 articles that met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Research regarding influencing factors such as gender, age, and social, family, and personality factors, as well as duration of use and use patterns, could be found.
   Results seem to cautiously suggest that using a smartphone for gaming and social networking might be risk factors, whereas having good friendships might constitute a protective factor. Also, female adolescents seem to be prone to a higher smartphone addiction risk than male adolescents. For family, school, and personality factors, results are still scarce, and more research is needed. Nevertheless, strict parenting, low self-control, and low self-esteem seem to increase risks for problematic use, whereas academic motivation and school success might decrease this risk.
   Conclusion A concise theoretical conceptualization of problematic smartphone use and corresponding standardized measures are needed to increase comparability of future studies and to thereby add to a clearer understanding of this contested concept.

AB  - Objective Numerous studies suggest that health literacy (HL) plays a crucial role in maintaining and improving individual health. Empirical findings highlight the relation between levels of a person's HL and her/his clinical outcome. To date, the role of HL in persons at-risk for psychosis has not been systematically reviewed. Methods We conducted a systematic review using a mixed-methods approach to analyse a variety of study types. Peer-reviewed publications were systematically searched in PUBMED, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Results The search string returned 10587 publications. After screening, 15 quantitative, four qualitative studies and two reviews were included. Only one study assessed HL as primary outcome, assessing knowledge and beliefs about psychosis among the general population. In the other studies, sub-dimensions of HL were investigated. None of the publications operationalized HL or it's sub-dimensions with a validated measure. Conclusions A lack of understanding of their condition, and fear of stigmatization, were associated with a delay in help-seeking among people with clinical-high-risk state for psychosis. Family members, school personnel, general practitioners and the internet play a crucial role in the HL process. Considerable barriers in obtaining adequate specialist support emphasize the urgent need of a "HL environment" for persons at risk for psychosis.

AB  - Physical, chemical, and social environments adversely affect the molecular process and results in cell signal transduction and the subsequent transcription factor dysregulation, leading to impaired gene expression and abnormal protein synthesis. Stressful environments such as social adversity, isolation, sustained social threats, physical inactivity, and highly methylated diets predispose individuals to molecular level alterations such as aberrant epigenomic modulations that affect homeostasis and hemodynamics. With cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of mortality in the US and blacks/African Americans being disproportionately affected by hypertension (HTN) which contributes substantially to these deaths, reflecting the excess mortality and survival disadvantage of this sub-population relative to whites, understanding the molecular events, including epigenomic and socio-epigenomic modulations, is relevant to narrowing the black-white mortality risk differences. We aimed to synthesize epigenomic findings in HTN namely (a) angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE II) gene, (b) Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) gene, (c) interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) gene, and (d) Capping Actin Protein, Gelosin-Like (CAPG) gene, adducin 1(ADD1) gene, (e) Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), (f) mesoderm specific transcript (MEST) loci, (g) sodium channel epithelial 1 alpha subunit 2 (SCNN1B), (h) glucokinase (CKG) gene (i) angiotensin II receptor, type1 (AGTR1), and DNA methylation (mDNA). A systematic review and quantitative evidence synthesis (QES) was conducted using Google Scholar and PubMed with relevant search terms. Data were extracted from studies on: (a) Epigenomic modulations in HTN based on ACE II (b) TLR2, (c) IFN-gamma gene, (d) CAPG, ADD1, TIMP3, MEST loci, and mDNA. The random-effect meta-analysis method was used for a pooled estimate of the common effect size, while z statistic and I boolean AND 2 were used for the homogeneity of the common effect size and between studies on heterogeneity respectively. Of the 642 studies identified, five examined hypermethylation while seven studies assessed hypomethylation in association with HTN. The hypermethylation of ACE II, SCNN1B, CKG, IFN-gamma gene, and miR-510 promoter were associated with hypertension, the common effect size (CES) = 6.0%, 95% CI, -0.002-11.26. In addition, the hypomethylation of TLR2, IFN-gamma gene, ADD1, AGTR1, and GCK correlated with hypertension, the CES = 2.3%, 95% CI, -2.51-7.07. The aberrant epigenomic modulation of ACE II, TLR2, IFN-gamma, AGTR1, and GCK correlated with essential HTN. Transforming the environments resulting from these epigenomic lesions will facilitate early intervention mapping in reducing HTN in the US population, especially among socially disadvantaged individuals, particularly racial/ethnic minorities.

AB  - Background. Rapid industrialization and anthropogenic activities such as the unmanaged use of agro-chemicals, fossil fuel burning and dumping of sewage sludge have caused soils and waterways to be severely contaminated with heavy metals. Heavy metals are non-biodegradable and persist in the environment. Hence, remediation is required to avoid heavy metal leaching or mobilization into environmental segments and to facilitate their extraction.
   Objectives. The present work briefly outlines the environmental occurrence of heavy metals and strategies for using microorganisms for bioremediation processes as reported in the scientific literature.
   Methods. Databases were searched from different libraries, including Google Scholar, Medline and Scopus. Observations across studies were then compared with the standards for discharge of environmental pollutants.
   Discussion. Bioremediation employs microorganisms for removing heavy metals. Microorganisms have adopted different mechanisms for bioremediation. These mechanisms are unique in their specific requirements, advantages, and disadvantages, the success of which depends chiefly upon the kind of organisms and the contaminants involved in the process.
   Conclusions. Heavy metal pollution creates environmental stress for human beings, plants, animals and other organisms. A complete understanding of the process and various alternatives for remediation at different steps is needed to ensure effective and economic processes.

AB  - The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) represents a widely utilized neuropsychological assessment technique for executive function. This meta-analysis examined the discriminant validity of the WCST for the assessment of mental shifting, considered as an essential subcomponent of executive functioning, against traditional psychometric intelligence tests. A systematic search was conducted, resulting in 72 neuropsychological samples for the meta-analysis of relationships between WCST scores and a variety of intelligence quotient (IQ) domains. The study revealed low to medium-sized correlations with IQ domains across all WCST scores that could be investigated. Verbal/crystallized IQ and performance/fluid IQ were indistinguishably associated with WCST scores. To conclude, the WCST assesses cognitive functions that might be partially separable from common conceptualizations of intelligence. More vigorous initiatives to validate putative indicators of executive function against intelligence are required.

AB  - Understanding user perceptions is particularly important in developing social robots, which tend to have a high degree of interaction with humans. However, psychometric measures of robot acceptability have only recently started to become available. The present critical review outlines the psychometrically validated questionnaires to measure social acceptability factors related to social robots. Using an iterative search strategy, articles were identified that reported on the development of such questionnaires as well as information about their psychometric properties. Six questionnaires were identified that provide researchers with options varying in length, content, and factor structure. Two of these questionnaires inquire about attitudes and anxieties related to robots, while two others capture a larger range of attitudes that extends to positive and neutral aspects as well. One of the questionnaires reviewed here was specific to inquiring about ethical issues related to the use of social robots for therapy with children with autism, and the last one was designed to provide an assessment of expectations of participants prior to interacting with a robot. Overall, the use of robot acceptability measures is still relatively new, and further psychometric work is necessary to provide confidence in the validity and reliability of these scales.

AB  - Objective Australian research on volunteering is rich and diverse, but also increasingly fragmented. In an attempt to promote a more integrated study of volunteering, we review volunteering research conducted in Australia, using volunteering journey as a framework. Specifically, we summarise literature on volunteer characteristics, motivations, benefits, psychological contract, commitment, and withdrawal. Method A comprehensive review yielded 152 studies on volunteering conducted in Australia. Results We find that volunteers have distinct characteristics, such as being older, better connected, employed, and residing in rural areas. There are a variety of reasons that prompt individuals to volunteer, and this motivation does change over time. Volunteering leads to better psychological well-being, as well as increases in social and human capital. Volunteer expectations and commitment are key drivers of ongoing volunteering. Finally, stress, work-family conflict, and negative interactions with others lead to volunteer withdrawal. Conclusion A lot is known about volunteering, however, future advancement of the field will depend on better integration across disciplines and domains. Currently, volunteering is viewed as a set of distinct stages, and a more integrated approach is required. We also note a lack of theoretical and methodological rigour in many Australian studies on volunteering.

AB  - We aim to quantitatively synthesise available epidemiological evidence on the prevalence rates of workplace violence (WPV) by patients and visitors against healthcare workers. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from their inception to October 2018, as well as the reference lists of all included studies. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Data were double-extracted and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. The overall percentage of healthcare worker encounters resulting in the experience of WPV was estimated using random-effects meta-analysis. The heterogeneity was assessed using the I-2 statistic. Differences by study-level characteristics were estimated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. We included 253 eligible studies (with a total of 331 544 participants). Of these participants, 61.9% (95% CI 56.1% to 67.6%) reported exposure to any form of WPV, 42.5% (95% CI 38.9% to 46.0%) reported exposure to non-physical violence, and 24.4% (95% CI 22.4% to 26.4%) reported experiencing physical violence in the past year. Verbal abuse (57.6%; 95% CI 51.8% to 63.4%) was the most common form of non-physical violence, followed by threats (33.2%; 95% CI 27.5% to 38.9%) and sexual harassment (12.4%; 95% CI 10.6% to 14.2%). The proportion of WPV exposure differed greatly across countries, study location, practice settings, work schedules and occupation. In this systematic review, the prevalence of WPV against healthcare workers is high, especially in Asian and North American countries, psychiatric and emergency department settings, and among nurses and physicians. There is a need for governments, policymakers and health institutions to take actions to address WPV towards healthcare professionals globally.

AB  - Objective: According to research conducted so far, the detection of a genetic mutation that increases the risk of developing cancer may be associated with feelings of discomfort, anxiety and apprehension, so it is important to know the needs and expectations externalized by those patients who face the challenge of coping with information about cancer risk. This analyzes the results obtained on this subject in recent studies.
   Material and methods: The results of 11 studies conducted in the years 2000-2018 were analyzed. To achieve this aim, the EBSCO, PubMed, PsychARTICLES and MEDLINE databases were searched through.
   Results: The results obtained show that both male and female carriers of BRCA mutations have specific support needs. They usually look for valuable content, including information on the procedure for conducting the genetic test and the consequences of obtaining a positive result. Social as well as therapeutic support are also significant. Patients who participated in psychotherapy assessed this form of help as valuable and necessary, especially in relation to the decision making process regarding surgical treatment.
   Discussion and conclusions: Support programs for patients with BRCA mutation implemented around the world have a chance to become an inspiration for the introduction of similar solutions tailored to the needs of patients in Poland, which could lead to an increase in their involvement or shall contribute to reduction of anxiety or distress resulting from having a genetic mutation.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewNeighborhood disorder has received attention as a determinant of health in urban contexts, through pathways that include psychosocial stress, perceived safety, and physical activity. This review provides a summary of data collection methods, descriptive terms, and specific items employed to assess neighborhood disorder/order.Recent FindingsThe proliferation of methods and terminology employed in measuring neighborhood disorder (or neighborhood order) noted over the past two decades has made related studies increasingly difficult to compare. Following a search of peer-reviewed articles published from January 1998 to May 2018, this rapid literature review identified 18 studies that described neighborhood environments, yielding 23 broad terms related to neighborhood disorder/order, and a total of 74 distinct measurable items.SummaryA majority of neighborhood disorder/order measurements were assessed using primary data collection, often relying on resident self-report or investigatory observations conducted in person or using stored images for virtual audits. Items were balanced across signs of order or disorder, and further classification was proposed based on whether items were physically observable and relatively stable over time.

AB  - The task of discerning truth from untruth has long interested psychologists; however, methods for doing so accurately remain elusive. In this article, we provide an overview and evaluation of methods of detecting deception used in the laboratory and the field. We identify and discuss three broad approaches to detecting deception: measurement of non-verbal behaviour, verbal interview methods, and statement evaluation by humans and computers. Part of the problem in devising good methods for detecting deception is the absence of a sound understanding of deception in human lives. We thus consider three theories of deception - leakage, reality monitoring, and truth-default - and conclude that although promising, they do not yet provide an adequate foundation. We review 10 extant methods of detecting deception in the second part of the article, focusing at greatest length on the most widely used method in South Africa, the polygraph test of deception. Our conclusion is that non-verbal methods that work by inducing anxiety in interviewees are fundamentally flawed, and that we ought to move away from such methods. Alternate methods of detecting deception, including statement analysis, are considered, but ultimately our view is that there are currently no methods sufficiently accurate for practitioners to rely on. We suspect that a precondition for developing such measures is a coherent and validated theory.

AB  - Background
   Cognitive-behavioural theories of panic disorder posit that panic attacks arise from a positive feedback loop between arousal-related bodily sensations and perceived threat. In a recently developed computational model formalising these theories of panic attacks, it was observed that the response to a simulated perturbation to arousal provided a strong indicator of vulnerability to panic attacks and panic disorder. In this review, we evaluate whether this observation is borne out in the empirical literature that has examined responses to biological challenge (eg, CO2 inhalation) and their relation to subsequent panic attacks and panic disorder.
   Method
   We searched PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO using keywords denoting provocation agents (eg, sodium lactate) and procedures (eg, infusion) combined with keywords relevant to panic disorder (eg, panic). Articles were eligible if they used response to a biological challenge paradigm to prospectively predict panic attacks or panic disorder.
   Results
   We identified four eligible studies. Pooled effect sizes suggest that there is biological challenge response has a moderate prospective association with subsequent panic attacks, but no prospective relationship with panic disorder.
   Conclusions
   These findings provide support for the prediction derived from cognitive-behavioural theories and some preliminary evidence that response to a biological challenge may have clinical utility as a marker of vulnerability to panic attacks pending further research and development.

AB  - Background: The promotion of physical activity among imprisoned people is a public health strategy that could help to improve the health status of this collective. This systematic review is aimed at reviewing the scientific evidence regarding the effects of exercise training programs performed by inmates. Methods: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials aimed at identifying the characteristics and effects of prison-based exercise training programs on imprisoned people was carried through MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus. Results: A total of 11 randomized controlled studies were selected, and the methodological quality of these was acceptable according to the Downs and Black scale. The proposed interventions were mainly based on the performance of aerobic or combined exercise training programs. Generally, the participants were healthy men who were imprisoned for at least 2 months and up to 15 years. Ten out of the 11 studies reported significant changes on physical and mental health-related variables, after the intervention took place. Conclusion: These findings suggest that prison-based exercise programs constitute a feasible and useful strategy for improving the physical and mental health status of prisoners.

AB  - The ability to perceive and produce music is a quintessential element of human life, present in all known cultures. Modern functional neuroimaging has revealed that music listening activates a large-scale bilateral network of cortical and subcortical regions in the healthy brain. Even the most accurate structural studies do not reveal which brain areas are critical and causally linked to music processing. Such questions may be answered by analysing the effects of focal brain lesions in patients' ability to perceive music. In this sense, acquired amusia after stroke provides a unique opportunity to investigate the neural architectures crucial for normal music processing. Based on the first large-scale longitudinal studies on stroke-induced amusia using modern multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (Mn) techniques, such as advanced lesion-symptom mapping, grey and white matter morphometry, tractography and functional connectivity, we discuss neural structures critical for music processing, consider music processing in light of the dual-stream model in the right hemisphere, and propose a neural model for acquired amusia.

We conducted a search of multiple databases to identify trials comparing a trauma-focused psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure, cognitive therapy, cognitive processing therapy or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) to an SSR1 or SNRI. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 was used to assess risk of bias; high risk of bias trials were included only in sensitivity analyses. PTSD symptom reduction was the primary outcome. Four trials met inclusion criteria. Random effects meta-analysis of the two trials that were not high risk of bias showed no difference in PTSD symptom reduction, but a wide confidence interval, including effects favoring psychotherapy and effects favoring medication. Heterogeneity was high. Inclusion of the two high risk of bias trials did not change substantive conclusions. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether SSRIs or trauma-focused psychotherapies are more effective for PTSD symptom reduction among adults with PTSD.

AB  - Objective To establish the evidence base for animal-assisted interventions, and specifically, hippotherapy and other interventions involving horses, in the context of improving biological, physical, psychological and social functioning, and outcomes in humans. Method A review of systematic reviews (an umbrella review) was carried out using a modified Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and following PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria were any interventions that included a live horse, for humans of any age and for any therapeutic purpose. Service and assistance horses and people who were incarcerated were excluded. Systematic reviews with a clearly articulated and comprehensive search strategy, with evidence of critical appraisal, both qualitative and quantitative and mixed methods, and in English were considered. Results Of 19 systematic reviews considered eligible for inclusion, 13 were included in this umbrella review. These 13 systematic reviews covered 79 individual studies of equine-assisted interventions, including primarily hippotherapy and therapeutic horse riding. Participants included children with cerebral palsy, children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, adults with multiple sclerosis, elderly people, adults post-stroke, people with spinal cord injury, adults with serious mental illness, adults with balance problems, people with brain disorders, breast cancer survivors, and obese women. Conclusions The evidence for equine-assisted interventions for adults and children across a range of conditions and presentations is equivocal. The current evidence base is marred by multiple methodological weaknesses and thus, therapeutic interventions that include a horse cannot be asserted as best practice at this time. Rigorous research is indicated to determine the utility of equine-assisted interventions.

AB  - Our previous studies have indicated that depression and declined cognition have been involved in some neurodegenerative diseases including Stroke, Parkinson's diseases and Vascular Parkinsonism. Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common psychiatric disorder following a stroke and has high morbidity and mortality. Studies on PSD are increasingly common, but the specific mechanisms remain unknown. Current research mainly includes clinical and animal aspects. Questionnaires and peripheral blood examination are two of the most common methods used to study clinical PSD. The results of questionnaires are influenced by multiple factors such as disease history, education background, occupation, economic status, family relationships and social support. There are certain limitations to blood sample testing; for example, it is influenced by cerebrovascular diseases and some other disruptions of the internal environment. It is difficult for either method to fully clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of PSD. Animal models provide alternative methods to further understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of PSD, such as the involvement of neuronal circuits and cytokines. More than ten animal models of PSD have been developed, and new models are constantly being introduced. Therefore, it is important to choose the appropriate model for any given study. In this paper, we will discuss the characteristics of the different models of PSD and comment on the advantages and disadvantages of each model, drawing from research on model innovation. Finally, we briefly describe the current assessment methods for the core symptoms of PSD models, point out the shortcomings, and present the improved sucrose preference test as a rational evaluation of anhedonia.

   Method: A systematic review of the literature retrieved from ten databases.
   Results: Fifteen studies yielded from our search strategy have been included in the review; eleven of these were longitudinal and four were experimental. The evidence indicates that pathological dissociation may contribute towards enduring interpersonal violence. Thus, dissociation may account for instances of repeated victimisation. There are similar indications concerning offenders, but study designs in this area allow one to draw fewer causal conclusions. There is some evidence that dissociation decreases information processing from the limbic system, which may be one underlying neurofunctional mechanism of persistent violence.
   Conclusion: There is growing evidence for dissociation as a cause of interpersonal violence. However, the available evidence is still limited, and our review rather reveals an important research gap. Future longitudinal and experimental studies aimed at clarifying the role of dissociation in the context of violence should take into account the theoretical and empirical complexity around the concept of dissociation.

AB  - Endometriosis impacts the physical, psychological and quality of life domains of women. Despite the medical and/or surgical management of endometriosis, the presence of persistent pelvic pain and psychological distress often continues, suggesting a role for psychological interventions in treatment planning. The present study aimed to conduct the first systematic review, with narrative data synthesis, on psychological interventions for endometriosis-related symptoms. The study also aimed to determine the effectiveness of current interventions in resolving psychological and pain-related loss of function associated with endometriosis and to identify gaps in the literature requiring further research. A total of 15,816 studies were retrieved through database searching and handsearching, with two researchers identifying 11 full-text studies that met inclusion criteria. Three studies of 'moderate' quality were identified, although the overall quality of studies was found to be 'weak', with a 'high' risk of bias. The findings regarding the effectiveness of psychological interventions for endometriosis-related symptoms remain inconclusive. Further research into psychological interventions for women with endometriosis that employ evidence-based protocols with high intervention integrity is recommended.

AB  - Background Use of involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation varies widely within and between countries. The factors that place individuals and populations at increased risk of involuntary hospitalisation are unclear, and evidence is needed to understand these disparities and inform development of interventions to reduce involuntary hospitalisation. We did a systematic review, meta-analysis, and narrative synthesis to investigate risk factors at the patient, service, and area level associated with involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation of adults.
   Methods We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Register of Trials from Jan 1, 1983, to Aug 14, 2019, for studies comparing the characteristics of voluntary and involuntary psychiatric inpatients, and studies investigating the characteristics of involuntarily hospitalised individuals in general population samples. We synthesised results using random effects meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. Our review follows Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42018095103.
   Findings 77 studies were included from 22 countries. Involuntary rather than voluntary hospitalisation was associated with male gender (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.14-1.32; p<0.0001), single marital status (1.47, 1.18-1.83; p<0.0001), unemployment (1.43, 1.07-1.90; p=0.020), receiving welfare benefits (1.71, 1.28-2.27; p<0.0001), being diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (2.18, 1.95-2.44; p<0.0001) or bipolar disorder (1.48, 1.24-1.76; p<0.0001), and previous involuntary hospitalisation (2.17, 1.62-2.91; p<0.0001). Using narrative synthesis, we found associations between involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation and perceived risk to others, positive symptoms of psychosis, reduced insight into illness, reduced adherence to treatment before hospitalisation, and police involvement in admission. On a population level, some evidence was noted of a positive dose-response relation between area deprivation and involuntary hospitalisation.
   Interpretation Previous involuntary hospitalisation and diagnosis of a psychotic disorder were factors associated with the greatest risk of involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation. People with these risk factors represent an important target group for preventive interventions, such as crisis planning. Economic deprivation on an individual level and at the population level was associated with increased risk for involuntary hospitalisation. Mechanisms underpinning the risk factors could not be identified using the available evidence. Further research is therefore needed with an integrative approach, which examines clinical, social, and structural factors, alongside qualitative research into clinical decision-making processes and patients' experiences of the detention process.

AB  - Mike Levine's body of work guides thinking on how the basal ganglia process information to create coordinated movements and skill learning throughout the life span and in disease. This special issue is a nod to Mike's career and a well-deserved gesture by the neuroscience community thanking him for the impact he has made on many people's careers and the field of basal ganglia physiology. This paper reviews how aging impacts basal ganglia processing with a focus on single cell and synaptic physiology. This review begins with the work Mike did with his collaborators Nat Buchwald, Chester Hull and Jay Schneider. These early studies paved the way for subsequent studies on changes in synaptic processing that occur with aging in the basal ganglia. The primary focus of this review is aging at corticostriatal synapses. Corticostriatal synapses show reduced expression of both short-term and long-term synaptic potentiation. The roles of age-related changes in calcium homeostasis, vesicle cycling, dopamine modulation, and NMDA receptor function in aging's effect on synaptic plasticity are discussed. The article ends with a review of mitochondrial aging theory as it applies to age-induced changes in corticostriatal synaptic function.

AB  - Community-level vulnerability assessments (VAs) are important for understanding how populations experience vulnerabilities to climate change in different ways given local socioeconomic and environmental factors. Despite recent expansion in the literature that evaluates vulnerability at the local level, approaches to understanding future scenarios and to integrating climatic and nonclimatic factors are inconsistent and often lack clear methodological information. This study utilized systematic review methods to characterize and compare future scenarios and the integration of climatic and nonclimatic stimuli in community-focused VAs published over the last five years. Five common methods for assessing future dimensions of vulnerability were characterized. Key challenges regarding sources and scales of information were highlighted alongside methods to integrate data spanning climatic and nonclimatic information at scales ranging from local to global. The majority of VAs considered current and past vulnerability; few VAs incorporated future scenarios and these studies focused on future climatic conditions while largely overlooking changes in nonclimatic drivers of vulnerability. Approaches to evaluate future dimensions of vulnerability included climate model projections, socioeconomic model projections, temporal analogue approaches, longitudinal approaches, and local perceptions. These methods often failed to capture the dynamic interactions between variables through time, as future impacts are unlikely to follow previous patterns of change. To combine datasets of different scales, VAs created vulnerability indices, overlaid spatial datasets, or used expert judgement. These approaches tended to aggregate local characteristics to the regional level at the expense of community specificity. There is a need for methodological advances to assess future scenarios and to combine datasets in the field of community-level climate change VAs to make these studies more responsive to local realities and relevant to the development of climate change adaptation strategies.

AB  - Drug addiction is a neuropsychiatric disorder with grave personal consequences that has an extraordinary global economic impact. Despite decades of research, the options available to treat addiction are often ineffective because our rudimentary understanding of drug-induced pathology in brain circuits and synaptic physiology inhibits the rational design of successful therapies. This understanding will arise first from animal models of addiction where experimentation at the level of circuits and molecular biology is possible. We will review the most common preclinical models of addictive behavior and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each. This includes non-contingent models in which animals are passively exposed to rewarding substances, as well as widely used contingent models such as drug self-administration and relapse. For the latter, we elaborate on the different ways of mimicking craving and relapse, which include using acute stress, drug administration or exposure to cues and contexts previously paired with drug self-administration. We further describe paradigms where drug-taking is challenged by alternative rewards, such as appetitive foods or social interaction. In an attempt to better model the individual vulnerability to drug abuse that characterizes human addiction, the field has also established preclinical paradigms in which drug-induced behaviors are ranked by various criteria of drug use in the presence of negative consequences. Separation of more vulnerable animals according to these criteria, along with other innate predispositions including goal- or sign-tracking, sensation-seeking behavior or impulsivity, has established individual genetic susceptibilities to developing drug addiction and relapse vulnerability. We further examine current models of behavioral addictions such as gambling, a disorder included in the DSM-5, and exercise, mentioned in the DSM-5 but not included yet due to insufficient peer-reviewed evidence. Finally, after reviewing the face validity of the aforementioned models, we consider the most common standardized tests used by pharmaceutical companies to assess the addictive potential of a drug during clinical trials.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an insight into xylophagia, its treatment, intervention options, etiological causes and possible relationship with other diseases. Design/methodology/approach A systematic search was performed across four scientific databases (i.e. Ovid Medline, Embase via Ovid, PubMed and ProQuest). All of the qualitative studies reporting on xylophagia from the inception of databases until August 2019 have been included. The quality of included studies was assessed through a ten-item checklist given by Kmet et al. (2004). Findings A total of 18 studies were included, and five primary themes emerged after analysis: precipitation/onset of xylophagia, co-morbid psychiatric or medical illnesses, assessment and investigation modes to confirm diagnosis, outcomes of xylophagia and treatment options comprising medical care, psychological care, counseling and duration of recovery. There were 16 females and 9 males in included studies. The mean ages and standard deviations of males and females were 29.25(12.17) years and 32.81(11.92), respectively. The mean duration and standard deviation of paper pica were 4.80(4.27) years. Research limitations/implications - Despite the limitation that this meta-synthesis is based upon findings from case studies, results show that standardized medication regimens for treating xylophagia are still not available or are unknown. There is a dire need for further research in order to better understand the disorder. The healthcare professionals need to use reciprocal, mutually constituent influence of biological and sociocultural factors in order to screen, diagnose and manage complex psychological problems like xylophagia. Originality/value The findings advance our understanding of the positive effects of patients and family members undergoing counseling or cognitive behavior therapy in reducing stress and enhancing coping skills thus, avoiding self-damaging behaviors.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper, a meta-analysis and systematic review of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), is to focus on studies that reported trainees' mental health literacy, attitudes and helping-related behaviors, as well as the impact of the program for the people who came into contact with trainees (i.e. recipients). Design/methodology/approach A systematic search included several online databases of published studies, dissertations or theses, and journals commonly publishing research in this area. Studies were randomized or non-randomized control trials using an intervention based upon the adult or youth MHFA curriculum. Findings Of the 8,257 initial articles, 16 met inclusion criteria. Small-to-moderate effect sizes (Hedges' g=0.18-0.53) were found for the primary outcomes for the trainees with effects appearing to be maintained at follow-up. Study quality was inversely associated with effect size. No evidence of investigator allegiance was detected. Few studies examined the effects for those who received aid from a MHFA trainee. Preliminary quantitative evidence appeared lacking (Hedges' g=-0.04 to 0.12); furthermore, a qualitative review found limited positive effects. Research limitations/implications - MHFA trainees appear to benefit from MHFA; however, objective behavioral changes are in need of greater emphasis. Additionally, considerably greater attention and effort in testing effects on distressed recipients is needed with future empirical investigations. Originality/value This is the first known review that includes preliminary findings on the effects of MHFA on the distressed recipients of the aid. It is anticipated that this will prompt further investigation into the impact of MHFA.

AB  - Background Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders constitute a huge global burden of disease and they are major contributors to disability as well as premature mortality among homeless people. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders among homeless people. Methods PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched to identify pertinent studies. We used a fixed- or random-effect meta-analysis to pool data from the included studies depending on the anticipated heterogeneity. A predesigned search strategy, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria, were used. We also performed subgroup and sensitivity analysis and Cochran's Q- and the I-2 test was employed to compute heterogeneity. Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. Results Thirty-one studies involving 51,925 homeless people were included in the final analysis. The meta-analysis showed a remarkably higher prevalence of psychosis [21.21% (95% CI:13.73, 31.29), I-2 = 99.43%], schizophrenia [10.29% (95%, CI: 6.44, 16.02), I-2 = 98.76%], schizophreniform disorder [2.48% (95% CI: 6.16, 28.11), I-2 = 88.84%] schizoaffective disorder [3.53% (95% CI: 1.33, 9.05), I-2 = 31.63%,] as well as psychotic disorders not otherwise specified [9% (95% CI: 6.92, 11.62), I-2 = 33.38%] among homeless people. The prevalence estimate of psychosis was higher in developing (29.16%) as compared to developed (18.80%) countries. Similarly, the prevalence of schizophrenia was highest in developing (22.15%) than developed (8.83%) countries. Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are highly prevalent among homeless people, indicating an urgent need for studies to help develop better mechanisms of prevention, detection as well as treatment of those disorders among homeless people.

AB  - Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) modulates glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain area with a key role in learning and memory. In agreement, several studies have demonstrated that PACAP modulates learning in physiological conditions. Recent publications show reduced PACAP levels and/or alterations in PACAP receptor expression in different conditions associated with cognitive disability. It is noteworthy that PACAP administration rescued impaired synaptic plasticity and learning in animal models of aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's chorea. In this context, results from our laboratory demonstrate that PACAP rescued metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), a genetic form of intellectual disability. PACAP is actively transported through the blood-brain barrier and reaches the brain following intranasal or intravenous administration. Besides, new studies have identified synthetic PACAP analog peptides with improved selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties with respect to the native peptide. Our review supports the shared idea that pharmacological activation of PACAP receptors might be beneficial for brain pathologies with cognitive disability. In addition, we suggest that the effects of PACAP treatment might be further studied as a possible therapy in FXS.

AB  - Everyday memory is one of the most affected cognitive functions in multiple sclerosis (MS). Assessing everyday memory problems is crucial for monitoring the impact of memory deficits on individuals? day-to-day lives and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions that aim to improve cognitive functions. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the research literature on everyday memory measures used with people with MS, describe the types of measures used, and summarise their psychometric properties. Empirical studies of cognitive function in MS using standardised everyday memory measures were included. Online databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Embase) and Google Scholar were searched. Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 12?measures were identified, with varied uses and administration methods. The majority of papers did not report any psychometric properties for MS populations. The few papers that did, reported that the measures have good reliability and appear to have good face, concurrent, and ecological validity, but these need to be evaluated further. This review presents researchers and clinicians with an overview of the various everyday memory measures used in studies with people with MS, to help them choose the appropriate measure for their evaluations.

AB  - We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of the empty-nest elderly in China. We searched five databases up to 20 November 2018, to identify all studies on the QoL of empty-nest elderly in China. Twenty-nine were included in the final review. Compared with the control group, the physiological function, psychological function, social function and total score of QoL of empty nests were lower than those of non-empty nests. In addition, meta-analysis showed that the empty nesters were lower than the non-empty nesters in General Health, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, Role Emotional and Vitality. The existing evidence showed that the QoL of the empty-nest elderly in China was to some extent lower than that of the non-empty nest elderly.

AB  - Lay abstract Research has shown that children and adolescents on the autism spectrum develop gross motor skills such as running, jumping, throwing, and kicking at slower rates than their non-autistic peers. Accommodations to these types of assessments can help improve the performance and reduce the anxiety of children on the autism spectrum. However, there is little consensus regarding these accommodations, especially within the research process. In this study, the authors searched the literature for studies that used gross motor skill assessments with youth on the autism spectrum, then sent a survey to the first authors of those studies asking them to describe their assessment protocol. By understanding the assessment protocol, the authors looked for commonalities of application of gross motor assessment. Little consensus exists among the literature and in the reported practices of researchers. The findings of this work can help those providing gross motor assessment to youth on the autism spectrum, though further research is needed to understand how to best provide accommodations and under which circumstances.

AB  - The development of the brain is shaped by a myriad of factors among which neurotransmitters play remarkable roles before and during the formation and maturation of synaptic circuits. Cellular processes such as neurogenesis, morphological development, synaptogenesis and maturation of synapses are temporary and spatially regulated by the local or distal influence of neurotransmitters in the developing cortex. Thus, research on this area has contributed to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of brain development and to shed light on the etiology of various human neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome (RTT), among others. Recently, the field of neuroscience has been shaken by an explosive advance of experimental approaches linked to the use of induced pluripotent stem cells and reprogrammed neurons. This new technology has allowed researchers for the first time to model in the lab the unique events that take place during early human brain development and to explore the mechanisms that cause synaptopathies. In this context, the role of neurotransmitters during early stages of cortex development is beginning to be re-evaluated and a revision of the state of the art has become necessary in a time when new protocols are being worked out to differentiate stem cells into functional neurons. New perspectives on reconsidering the function of neurotransmitters include opportunities for methodological advances, a better understanding of the origin of mental disorders and the potential for development of new treatments.

AB  - Objective. To explore the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the motor recovery of stroke patients and the effect differences between the upper limb and lower limb. Methods. Randomized control trials published until January 2019 were searched from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated separately for upper and lower limb motor outcomes to understand the mean effect size. Results. Twenty-nine studies with 664 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The overall analyses of tDCS demonstrated significant effect size both for the upper limb (SMD=0.26, P=0.002) and the lower limb (SMD=0.47, P=0.002). Compared with acute and subacute stroke patients, chronic stroke patients obtained significant effects after tDCS (SMD=0.25, P=0.03) in upper limb function. Furthermore, both anode and cathode stimulations produced significant effect size for stroke patients after <= 10 sessions of tDCS (anode: SMD=0.40, P=0.001; cathode: SMD=0.79, P<0.0001) with >0.029 mA/cm(2) of density (anode: SMD=0.46, P=0.002; cathode: SMD=0.79, P<0.0001). But for lower limb function, more prominent effects were found in subacute stroke patients (SMD=0.56, P=0.001) with bilateral tDCS (SMD=0.59, p=0.009). Conclusion. tDCS is effective for the recovery of stroke patients with motor dysfunction. In addition, upper limb and lower limb functions obtain distinct effects from different therapeutic parameters of tDCS at different stages, respectively.

AB  - Objective: Ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation in treatment-resistant depression. But it is not known how quickly this occurs and how long it persists. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of ketamine for suicidality. Method: CENTRAL, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched until 12 December 2018. Randomised controlled trials of ketamine or esketamine reporting data on suicidal ideation, self-harm, attempted or completed suicide in adults diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Standardised mean difference was used for continuous outcomes. Results: Twenty-five reports from 15 independent trials, with a total of 572 participants diagnosed with predominately affective disorders, were included. The evidence was rated moderate to low. In most trials, ketamine was administered at 0.5 mg/kg via a single intravenous infusion over a 30- to 45-minute period. Only a single trial of intranasal esketamine was identified. At 4 hours post-infusion, treatment with ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in suicidal ideation scores (standardised mean difference = -0.51, 95% confidence interval = [-1.00, -0.03]), which persisted until 72 hours post-infusion (time points between 12 and 24 hours: standardised mean difference = -0.63, 95% confidence interval = [-0.99, -0.26]; between 24 and 72 hours: standardised mean difference = -0.57, 95% confidence interval = [-0.99, -0.14]), but not thereafter. However, there was marked heterogeneity of results. In a single trial of esketamine, marginal effects on suicidal ideation were observed. In terms of actual suicidal behaviour, there were virtually no data on effects of ketamine or esketamine. Conclusion: A single infusion of ketamine may have a short-term (up to 72 hours) beneficial impact on suicidal thoughts. While confirmation of these results in further trials is needed, they suggest possible use of ketamine to treat acute suicidality. Means of sustaining any anti-suicidal effect need to be found.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is the second most toxic heavy metal after arsenic (As), which has no role in biological systems. Pb toxicity causes a range of damages to plants from germination to yield formation; however, its toxicity is both time and concentration dependent. Its exposure at higher rates disturbs the plant water and nutritional relations and causes oxidative damages to plants. Reduced rate of seed germination and plant growth under stress is mainly due to Pb interference with enzymatic activities, membrane damage and stomatal closure because of induction of absicic acid and negative correlation of Pb with potassium in plants. Pb induced structural changes in photosynthetic apparatus and reduced biosynthesis of chlorophyll pigments cause retardation of carbon metabolism. In this review, the noxious effects of Pb on germination, stand establishment, growth, water relations, nutrient uptake and assimilation, ultra-structural and oxidative damages, carbon metabolism and enzymatic activities in plants are reported. The Pb dynamics in soil rhizosphere and role of remediation strategies i.e. physical, chemical and biological to decontaminate the Pb polluted soils has also been described. Among them, biological strategies, including phytoremediation, microbe-assisted remediation and remediation by organic amendments, are cost effective and environmentally sound remedies for cleaning Pb contaminated soils. Use of organic manures and some agricultural practices have the potential to harvest better crops yield of good quality form Pb contaminated soils.

Methods A literature search was conducted on three electronic databases. Results were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. Results A total of 126 studies (6424 patients with BDI, 702 with BDII, and 8276 controls) were included. BDI was associated with moderate to large impairments across all cognitive functions and BDII with small-to-medium impairments. Small significant differences were identified between BDI and BDII on all cognitive functions except inhibition. The Trail Making Test (TMT) (g = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.67-0.80), Hayling Test (g = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81), Digit Span Total (g = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.57-1.01), and Category Fluency (g = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.45-0.72) tasks were most sensitive to cognitive impairment in BDI. The TMT (g = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.80) and Category Fluency (g = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37-0.75) were also sensitive to cognitive alterations in patients with BDII. Conclusion BD type I was associated with more severe and widespread impairments than BDII, which showed smaller impairments on all functions except inhibition, where impairments were larger. Education and (hypo)manic symptoms should be further investigated in future studies due to their possible influence on the neuropsychological profile of BD. The instruments identified in this review should be considered for inclusion in cognitive assessment batteries in BD.

AB  - Background Clinical staging models describe where an individual exists on a continuum from asymptomatic at-risk states (Stage 0) through to established late-stage disease (Stage 4). We applied this framework to systematically assess evidence for any associations between objectively assessed cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and stage of psychosis. Method Nine electronic databases were searched for relevant publications from inception until October 31, 2019. Pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)) were estimated for differences in CRF for studies that reported mean oxygen uptake (max, peak, or predicted VO2 in ml/kg/min). Results Thirty-eight studies were eligible. Findings indicated that suboptimal CRF can be present at Stages 0 and 1. Meta-analyses of 22 studies demonstrated that CRF was significantly reduced in individuals classified between Stages 1 and 4 compared with matched or general population controls (g = -0.93; 95% CI -1.14, -0.71). Mean VO2 was decreased by 28% in Stage 4 compared with Stage 1 (34.1 vs. 24.66 ml/kg/min); the largest effect size for CRF reduction was reported between Stages 2 and 3 (g = -1.16; 95% CI -1.31, -1.03). Conclusions Although not identifying direct causal links between clinical stage and CRF, using this framework may enhance understanding of co-associations between mental and physical health markers across the entire spectrum of psychosis. Limitations include lack of research on CRF in Stages 0 and 1 alongside problems determining stage in some studies. However, impaired CRF is reported in emerging psychosis, supporting calls that early intervention programmes should address both mental and physical wellbeing.

AB  - For psychiatric patients, compulsory admission and coercive measures can constitute distressing and sometimes traumatizing experiences. As a consequence, clinicians aim at minimizing such procedures. At the same time, they need to ensure high levels of safety for patients, staff and the public. In order to prevent compulsory measures and to favor the use of less restrictive alternatives, innovative interventions improving the management of dangerous situations are needed. Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is being applied in a variety of diagnoses and treatment settings, and could have the potential to reduce aggression and psychopathology. Therefore, AAT might be of use in the prevention and early treatment of aggression, and might constitute a promising component of treatment alternatives to forced interventions. To our knowledge, no study evaluating the effect of AAT on compulsory measures in persons with psychiatric diseases has been published up to date. This narrative expert review including a systematic literature search examines the published literature about the use of AAT in psychiatry. Studies report reduced anxiety and aggressiveness as well as positive effects on general wellbeing, self-efficacy, quality of life and mindfulness. Although literature on the applicability of AAT as a component of preventive or de-escalating treatment settings is sparse, beneficial effects of AAT have been reported. Therefore, we encourage examining AAT as a promising new treatment approach to prevent compulsory measures.

KW  - ABSORPTION
AB  - In 1932 and again in 1947, the Scottish Council for Research in Education conducted the Scottish Mental Surveys. Testing two cohorts, one in 1932 and another in 1947, researchers set out to measure-using the same validated test each time-the intelligence of every Scottish child 11 years of age. The stated impetus for the Surveys was a fear that average Scottish intelligence was declining. But when investigators compared the results of the 1947 Survey with those from 1932 their predictions were completely upended. Instead of average intelligence declining, it had risen, substantially. The author argues that based on a study of the relevant ecosystems in place in Scotland at the time the increase in intelligence resulted from a decline in lead body burden. There is no evidence that the children were tested for lead. The decline is thought to have closely followed a fall in occupational lead use, a heightened awareness of the dangers of lead-solvency, improvements in lead plumbing in working-class homes, and a national campaign to improve the nutrition of women and children. Evidence shows that milk consumption in Scotland increased sharply, especially among children, beginning in the mid-1930s, just prior to and following the birth of the second cohort. This provided a source of calcium in a diet that had shown signs of deficiency. Evidence also suggests that lead contamination, from lead water pipes and industrial sources, was widely prevalent in Scotland in the early part of the twentieth century.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) and its treatment are challenges for global health. Optogenetics and chemogenetics are driving MDD research forward by unveiling causal relations between cell-type-specific control of neurons and depressive-like behaviour in rodents. Using a systematic search process, in this review, a set of 43 original studies applying optogenetic or chemogenetic techniques in rodent models of depression was identified. Our aim was to provide an examination of all available studies elucidating central neuronal mechanisms leading to depressive-like behaviour in rodents and thereby unveiling the most promising routes for future research. A complex interacting network of relevant structures, in which central circuitries causally related to depressive-like behaviour are implicated, has been identified. As most relevant structures emerge: medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, hippocampus and raphe nuclei. Further evidence, though examined by only few studies, emerges for structures like the lateral habenula, or medial dorsal thalamus. Most of the identified brain areas have previously been associated with MDD neuropathology, but now evidence can be provided for causal pathological mechanisms within a complex cortico-limbic reward circuitry. However, the studies also show conflicting results concerning the mechanisms underlying the causal involvement of specific circuitries. Comparability of studies is partly limited since even small deviations in methodological approaches lead to different outcomes. Factors influencing study outcomes were identified and need to be considered in future studies (e.g. frequency used for stimulation, time and duration of stimulation, limitations of applied animal models of MDD).

AB  - Although resettlement allows for refugees to live in a safer place, there are many issues that accompany this drastic life change. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine the literature on the life experiences of refugees in Canada to identify the challenges that they face and their unmet needs, as well as potential sources of support. Five databases were systematically searched for articles published in the last decade that included data on the life experience of refugees in Canada. Findings were analysed in depth to generate emergent themes and synthesize common findings across studies. The review found 26 articles on the life experiences of refugees, 23 of which were qualitative studies, as well as 1 quantitative and 2 mixed methods studies. The main challenges experienced by refugees included loss or change in identity, gender role conflicts, language barriers, lack of recognition of previous education or experience, and perceived lack of support and discrimination. This comprehensive review highlights the unmet needs and complex barriers that are experienced by refugees in Canada and directs attention to priorities for future research. Differences in language, culture, and social support lead to challenges in integration and accessing services among refugees in Canada, which may have potential policy implications.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes and constitutes a major cause of vision impairment and blindness in the world. DR has long been described exclusively as a microvascular disease of the eye. However, in recent years, a growing interest has been focused on the contribution of neuroretinal degeneration to the pathogenesis of the disease, and there are observations suggesting that neuronal death in the early phases of DR may favor the development of microvascular abnormalities, followed by the full manifestation of the disease. However, the mediators that are involved in the crosslink between neurodegeneration and vascular changes have not yet been identified. According to our hypothesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could probably be the most important connecting link between the death of retinal neurons and the occurrence of microvascular lesions. Indeed, VEGF is known to play important neuroprotective actions; therefore, in the early phases of DR, it may be released in response to neuronal suffering, and it would act as a double-edged weapon inducing both neuroprotective and vasoactive effects. If this hypothesis is correct, then any retinal stress causing neuronal damage should be accompanied by VEGF upregulation and by vascular changes. Similarly, any compound with neuroprotective properties should also induce VEGF downregulation and amelioration of the vascular lesions. In this review, we searched for a correlation between neurodegeneration and vasculopathy in animal models of retinal diseases, examining the effects of different neuroprotective substances, ranging from nutraceuticals to antioxidants to neuropeptides and others and showing that reducing neuronal suffering also prevents overexpression of VEGF and vascular complications. Taken together, the reviewed evidence highlights the crucial role played by mediators such as VEGF in the relationship between retinal neuronal damage and vascular alterations and suggests that the use of neuroprotective substances could be an efficient strategy to prevent the onset or to retard the development of DR.

AB  - Background Pain is common in older adults. To maintain their quality of life and promote healthy ageing in the community, it is important to lower their pain levels. Pharmacological pain management has been shown to be effective in older adults. However, as drugs can have various side effects, non-pharmacological pain management is preferred for community-dwelling older adults. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness, suitability, and sustainability of non-pharmacological pain management interventions for community-dwelling older adults. Methods Five databases, namely, CINHAL, Journals@Ovid, Medline, PsycInfo, and PubMed, were searched for articles. The criteria for inclusion were: full-text articles published in English from 2005 to February 2019 on randomized controlled trials, with chronic non-cancer pain as the primary outcome, in which pain was rated by intensity, using non-pharmacological interventions, and with participants over 65 years old, community-dwelling, and mentally competent. A quality appraisal using the Jadad Scale was conducted on the included articles. Results Ten articles were included. The mean age of the older adults was from 66.75 to 76. The interventions covered were acupressure, acupuncture, guided imagery, qigong, periosteal stimulation, and Tai Chi. The pain intensities of the participants decreased after the implementation of the intervention. The net changes in pain intensity ranged from - 3.13 to - 0.65 on a zero to ten numeric rating scale, in which zero indicates no pain and ten represents the worst pain. Conclusions Non-pharmacological methods of managing pain were effective in lowering pain levels in community-dwelling older adults, and can be promoted widely in the community.

AB  - Neuronal inhibition can be defined as a spatiotemporal restriction or suppression of local microcircuit activity. The importance of inhibition relies in its fundamental role in shaping signal processing in single neurons and neuronal circuits. In this context, the activity of inhibitory interneurons proved the key to endow networks with complex computational and dynamic properties. In the last 50 years, the prevailing view on the functional role of cerebellar cortical inhibitory circuits was that excitatory and inhibitory inputs sum spatially and temporally in order to determine the motor output through Purkinje cells (PCs). Consequently, cerebellar inhibition has traditionally been conceived in terms of restricting or blocking excitation. This assumption has been challenged, in particular in the cerebellar cortex where all neurons except granule cells (and unipolar brush cells in specific lobules) are inhibitory and fire spontaneously at high rates. Recently, a combination of electrophysiological recordings in vitro and in vivo, imaging, optogenetics and computational modeling, has revealed that inhibitory interneurons play a much more complex role in regulating cerebellar microcircuit functions: inhibition shapes neuronal response dynamics in the whole circuit and eventually regulate the PC output. This review elaborates current knowledge on cerebellar inhibitory interneurons [Golgi cells, Lugaro cells (LCs), basket cells (BCs) and stellate cells (SCs)], starting from their ontogenesis and moving up to their morphological, physiological and plastic properties, and integrates this knowledge with that on the more renown granule cells and PCs. We will focus on the circuit loops in which these interneurons are involved and on the way they generate feed-forward, feedback and lateral inhibition along with complex spatio-temporal response dynamics. In this perspective, inhibitory interneurons emerge as the real controllers of cerebellar functioning.

AB  - The Protocol on Environmental Protection of the Antarctic Treaty stipulates that the protection of the Antarctic environment and associated ecosystems be fundamentally considered in the planning and conducting of all activities in the Antarctic Treaty area. One of the key pollutants created by human activities in the Antarctic is noise, which is primarily caused by ship traffic (from tourism, fisheries, and research), but also by geophysical research (e.g., seismic surveys) and by research station support activities (including construction). Arguably, amongst the species most vulnerable to noise are marine mammals since they specialize in using sound for communication, navigation and foraging, and therefore have evolved the highest auditory sensitivity among marine organisms. Reported effects of noise on marine mammals in lower-latitude oceans include stress, behavioral changes such as avoidance, auditory masking, hearing threshold shifts, and- in extreme cases-death. Eight mysticete species, 10 odontocete species, and six pinniped species occur south of 60 degrees S (i.e., in the Southern or Antarctic Ocean). For many of these, the Southern Ocean is a key area for foraging and reproduction. Yet, little is known about how these species are affected by noise. We review the current prevalence of anthropogenic noise and the distribution of marine mammals in the Southern Ocean, and the current research gaps that prevent us from accurately assessing noise impacts on Antarctic marine mammals. A questionnaire given to 29 international experts on marine mammals revealed a variety of research needs. Those that received the highest rankings were (1) improved data on abundance and distribution of Antarctic marine mammals, (2) hearing data for Antarctic marine mammals, in particular a mysticete audiogram, and (3) an assessment of the effectiveness of various noise mitigation options. The management need with the highest score was a refinement of noise exposure criteria. Environmental evaluations are a requirement before conducting activities in the Antarctic. Because of a lack of scientific data on impacts, requirements and noise thresholds often vary between countries that conduct these evaluations, leading to different standards across countries. Addressing the identified research needs will help to implement informed and reasonable thresholds for noise production in the Antarctic and help to protect the Antarctic environment.

AB  - Recently, there has been increased studies in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We aimed to make an overview of research trends and genetic polymorphisms for NIHL from 2009 to 2018 with VOSviewer software. A total of 2391 papers were identified for research trends analysis in NIHL and 33 studies identified for a brief review of genetic polymorphisms in human NIHL. The number of publications has been increasing over the past decade. The journal Hearing Research published the most articles (218). The USA contributed the largest number of papers (1042; 43.58%), with the most citations (18,987) and the highest H-index (60). The University of Washington was the most contributive institution. Liberman MC published the most articles (32), and Kujawa SG possessed the highest co-citations (584). Except for high-frequency keywords identified by the software, "prevalence," "oxidative stress," "hair cells," and "cochlear implant" were also the latest research frontiers. HSPA1A rs1043618, HSPA1L rs2227956, PON2 rs12026 and rs7785846, SOD2 rs2855116, KCNE1 rs2070358, KCNQ4 rs34287852, GJB2 rs3751385, PCDH15 rs7095441 and rs11004085, GRHL2 rs1981361, ITGA8 rs10508489, MYH14 rs667907, and POU4F3 rs891969 were the research hotspots and were replicated in independent samples. Inflammation response underlying NIHL has emerged and should be considered as a pioneering field in the future for the prevention of NIHL and conservation of hearing.

AB  - In developing countries, urbanisation and associated demographic changes pose unprecedented challenges in terms of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. A systematic review methodology was conducted, combined with data synthesis, to examine the interactions between urban sprawl, land and resource use changes, agricultural production and food security in developing countries. The Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched to identify 188 relevant articles. The results revealed that existing literature has widely failed to take interactions between different aspects of urban food systems (UFS) into account, indicating disconnects and fragmentation in the approaches used to analyse these interactions. Therefore a further focus on food system transformation pathways, system feedbacks and trade-offs is recommended. Moreover, the results imply that UFS are complex interlinked systems and therefore that policies intending to assure food security in developing countries need to consider these interlinkages and approach them holistically. Finally, an absence of studies examining urban and rural systems from an interconnected perspective was identified. An acknowledgement of such rural-urban connectivity gaps is crucial in order to ensure more inclusive links within food systems and agricultural value chains, and achieve more resilient food systems and more sustainable urbanisation in developing countries.

TI  - Health state utility values in schizophrenia: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis
KW  - MODELS
KW  - COST
AB  - Introduction Cost-effectiveness analyses that use quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) allow comparing the value for money of interventions across different health problems. Health state utility values (HSUVs) are crucial to calculate QALYs. These are weights attached to a given health state reflecting preferences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In schizophrenia, there is extensive evidence about the consequences of this condition on HRQoL. Besides, several interventions have claimed to be cost-effective in terms of QALYs gained. Despite this evidence, a systematic review of HSUVs has not been conducted. Therefore, we aim to synthesise the evidence about HSUVs in schizophrenia. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic review of the literature about HSUVs in people with schizophrenia following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research task force recommendations. The submissions records of eight electronic peer-reviewed databases and three health technology assessment (HTA) agencies will be searched. Quantitative synthesis will be carried out in comparable studies, using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity will be explored using meta-regression if more than 10 studies per covariate are found. A narrative synthesis and methodological quality of included studies will be also reported. Discussion This review will provide a synthesis of the HSUVs estimated for different states experienced by people with schizophrenia. This will inform analysts when calculating QALYs, using values in a more transparent and accountable manner. Finally, it will shed light on evidence gaps and limitations about this measure in mental health. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019123582.

AB  - The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to analyze the psychological effects of exergames for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. In August 2018, the electronic databases searched were PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, Science Direct, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. The eligibility criteria were defined according to the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design. In relation to the population, only studies with children or adolescents with overweight or obesity and without any other comorbidities were analyzed. Only publications in English were considered. Nine studies were selected. The comparisons identified were in relation to weight, type of activity, and play style versus control and preintervention. The magnitude of effect size suggests that the practice of exergaming has a small effect on psychological outcomes. Furthermore, cooperative games produced greater attraction to the game (g = 4.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.23-6.19) and greater intrinsic motivation (g = 5.29; 95% CI = 3.68-6.90). It was verified that self-esteem (standard mean difference [SMD] = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.09-0.66), and self-efficacy (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.06-0.79) improved after playing an exergame. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that exergames may be effective in improving psychological aspects of children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. Given the limited number of studies, it is essential to increase scientific research in this area.

AB  - The main aim of the present study was to summarize the available literature on the topic of occupational health and safety (OH&S) among immigrant workers (IMWs) in Italy and Spain. We conducted a scoping review, searching Medline, Social Sciences Citation Index, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, SciELO, and EMBASE for peer-reviewed articles, published in English, Italian, or Spanish, between 1999-2018. 34 studies were included, 28 with quantitative methodology and 6 with qualitative. Main findings were that, compared to natives, IMWs in Italy and Spain showed higher prevalence of low-skilled jobs and of perceived discrimination at work; higher physical demands, poorer environmental working conditions, and more exposure to occupational risks (e.g., ergonomic and psychosocial hazards); a greater risk of occupational injuries; worse general and mental health; and a plausible worsening of their health status, especially in Spain, as a result of the economic crisis. The findings of the present scoping review constitute warning signs that indicate the need for a holistic global response to ensure that adverse OH&S outcomes among IMWs workers are improved and that equitable access to health care is guaranteed. Such a response will require a concrete and evidence-based approach to prevent and monitor occupational risk factors and associated outcomes in the workplaces.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety in late-life is a frequently encountered condition. The aim of this review is to systematically examine the efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants for treating anxiety disorders among older adults.
   METHODS: Electronic searches of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the standard bibliographic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were performed in August 2018 and updated in October 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating antidepressants for late-life anxiety. The quality of each study was appraised using criteria developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.
   RESULTS: Data from 12 papers describing 10 RCTs of antidepressants for late-life anxiety are included in this review. There were 2 studies each of sertraline, escitalopram, and duloxetine, and 1 study each of citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and imipramine. Across all trials, antidepressants were associated with a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms at the end of the study period. Limitations of the trials include a preponderance of generalized anxiety disorder and relatively less data on other anxiety disorders, and limited data on long-term use of antidepressants for anxiety.
   CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressants are beneficial for treating anxiety disorders in late life and are generally well tolerated.

AB  - Puerperium is a period of significant morbimortality for women, and Primary Health Care (PHC) is important in developing actions to meet women's health needs. This study aimed to systematize the knowledge produced on postpartum care programs actions within PHC at both national and international levels. This is an integrative review of the literature in databases LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), BDENF (Nursing Database), SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) and PubMed (US National Library of Medicine). Search was performed in the period April-May 2017. Forty-three papers met the selection criteria. Results indicate that PHC has the physical structure to provide puerperae with care, but has a shortage of human and material resources; there is low postpartum consultation coverage and home visits; there is a good evaluation of the incentive for breastfeeding, but focused on the child; international screening of Postpartum Depression through the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and care shortage for this condition in Brazil. Postpartum care still focuses on care for the newborn and is mostly restricted to the immediate and late puerperium.

AB  - A previous algorithm for the pharmacological treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder was published in 2012. Developments over the past 7 years suggest an update is needed. The authors conducted searches in PubMed, focusing on new studies and reviews since 2012 that would support or change previous recommendations. We identified exceptions to the main algorithm, including pregnant women and women of child-bearing potential, the elderly, and patients with common medical and psychiatric co-morbidities. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are still first-line. An adequate trial requires a period at typical antidepressant doses and dose adjustments guided by a plasma level to evaluate for poor adherence or ultra-rapid metabolism. If the response is inadequate, consider a trial of another SSRI this time possibly taken to a very high dose. Clomipramine could be an alternative. If the response to the second trial remains inadequate, the next recommendation is to augment with aripiprazole or risperidone. Alternatively, augmentation with novel agents could be selected, including glutamatergic (memantine, riluzole, topiramate, n-acetylcysteine, lamotrigine), serotonergic (ondansetron), and anti-inflammatory (minocycline, celecoxib) agents. A third option could be transcranial magnetic stimulation. Lastly, after several of these trials, deep brain stimulation and cingulotomy have evidence for a role in the most treatment-refractory patients.

AB  - IMPORTANCE This systematic review and meta-analysis is, to date, the first and most comprehensive to focus on the incidence of nonaffective psychoses among refugees.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the relative risk (RR) of incidence of nonaffective psychosis in refugees compared with the RR in the native population and nonrefugee migrants.
   DATA SOURCES PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases were searched for studies from January 1, 1977, to March 8, 2018, with no language restrictions (PROSPERO registration No. CRD42018106740).
   STUDY SELECTION Studies conducted in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Canada were selected by multiple independent reviewers. Inclusion criteria were (1) observation of refugee history in participants, (2) assessment of effect size and spread, (3) adjustment for sex, (4) definition of nonaffective psychosis according to standardized operationalized criteria, and (5) comparators were either nonrefugee migrants or the native population. Studies observing ethnic background only, with no explicit definition of refugee status, were excluded.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were followed for extracting data and assessing data quality and validity as well as risk of bias of included studies. A random-effects model was created to pool the effect sizes of included studies.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome, formulated before data collection, was the pooled RR in refugees compared with the nonrefugee population.
   RESULTS Of the 4358 screened articles, 9 studies (0.2%) involving 540 000 refugees in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Canada were included in the analyses. The RR for nonaffective psychoses in refugees was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.00-2.05; I-2 = 96.3%) compared with nonrefugee migrants. Analyses that were restricted to studies with low risk of bias had an RR of 1.39 (95% CI, 1.23-1.58; I-2 = 0.0%) for refugees compared with nonrefugee migrants, 2.41 (95% CI, 1.51-3.85; I-2 = 96.3%) for refugees compared with the native population, and 1.92 (95% CI, 1.02-3.62; I-2 = 97.0%) for nonrefugee migrants compared with the native group. Exclusion of studies that defined refugee status not individually but only by country of origin resulted in an RR of 2.24 (95% CI, 1.12-4.49; I-2 = 96.8%) for refugees compared with nonrefugee migrants and an RR of 3.26 (95% CI, 1.87-5.70; I-2 = 97.6%) for refugees compared with the native group. In general, the RR of nonaffective psychosis was increased in refugees and nonrefugee migrants compared with the native population.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Refugee experience appeared to be an independent risk factor in developing nonaffective psychosis among refugees in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Canada. These findings suggest that applying the conclusions to non-Scandinavian countries should include a consideration of the characteristics of the native society and its specific interaction with the refugee population.

AB  - Depression has brought huge disease burden to the world. This systematic review aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD). We searched electronic databases with time range from 1990.1.1 to 2018.9.5. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adult patients with MDD were eligible for inclusion. We conducted network meta-analyses using multivariate meta-analyses models under the frequency framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and safety (overall risk of adverse events). We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) based on group-level data. 20,937 citations were identified, 91 trials comprising 10,991 participants were included in efficacy study, and 32 trials comprising 5245 participants were included in safety study. In terms of efficacy, all treatments studied (acupuncture, mirtazapine, herbal medicine, venlafaxine, physical exercise, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), bupropion, fluoxetine, and vortioxetine) except for probiotics were significantly more effective than placebo. In terms of safety, bupropion, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were significantly less safe than placebo. Herbal medicine and mirtazapine had no significant difference in overall risk of adverse events compared with placebo. Acupuncture, CBT, physical exercise and probiotics were lack of eligible safety data.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) exposure is associated with the development of cardiopulmonary disease. Our group has studied the adverse health effects of World Trade Center particulate matter (WTC-PM) exposure on firefighters. To fully understand the complex interplay between exposure, organism, and resultant disease phenotype, it is vital to analyze the underlying role of genomics in mediating this relationship. A PubMed search was performed focused on environmental exposure, genomics, and cardiopulmonary disease. We included original research published within 10 years, on epigenetic modifications and specific genetic or allelic variants. The initial search resulted in 95 studies. We excluded manuscripts that focused on work-related chemicals, heavy metals and tobacco smoke as primary sources of exposure, as well as reviews, prenatal research, and secondary research studies. Seven full-text articles met pre-determined inclusion criteria, and were reviewed. The effects of air pollution were evaluated in terms of methylation (n = 3), oxidative stress (n = 2), and genetic variants (n = 2). There is evidence to suggest that genomics plays a meditating role in the formation of adverse cardiopulmonary symptoms and diseases that surface after exposure events. Genomic modifications and variations affect the association between environmental exposure and cardiopulmonary disease, but additional research is needed to further define this relationship.

AB  - We review empirical research on (social) psychology of morality to identify which issues and relations are well documented by existing data and which areas of inquiry are in need of further empirical evidence. An electronic literature search yielded a total of 1,278 relevant research articles published from 1940 through 2017. These were subjected to expert content analysis and standardized bibliometric analysis to classify research questions and relate these to (trends in) empirical approaches that characterize research on morality. We categorize the research questions addressed in this literature into five different themes and consider how empirical approaches within each of these themes have addressed psychological antecedents and implications of moral behavior. We conclude that some key features of theoretical questions relating to human morality are not systematically captured in empirical research and are in need of further investigation.

AB  - Background: Australian and US guidelines recommend routine brain imaging, either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, to exclude structural lesions in presentations for first-episode psychosis. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence for the appropriateness and clinical utility of this recommendation by assessing the frequency of abnormal radiological findings in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans among patients with first-episode psychosis. Methods: PubMed and Embase database were searched from inception to April 2018 using appropriate MeSH or Emtree terms. Studies were included in the review if they reported data on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan findings of individuals with first-episode psychosis. No restriction on the geographical location of the study or the age of participants was applied. We calculated the percentage of abnormal radiological findings in each study, separately by the two diagnostic methods. Results: There were 16 suitable studies published between 1988 and 2017, reporting data on an overall 2312 patients with first-episode psychosis. Most were observational studies with a retrospective design and the majority examined patients with computed tomography. While structural abnormalities were a relatively common finding, these rarely required clinical intervention (range across studies: 0-60.7%; median: 3.5%) and were very rarely the cause of the psychotic symptoms (range: 0-3.3%; median: 0%). Only 2 of the 16 studies concluded that brain imaging should be routinely ordered in first-episode psychosis. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to suggest that brain imaging should be routinely ordered for patients presenting with first-episode psychosis without associated neurological or cognitive impairment. The appropriate screening procedure for structural brain lesions is conventional history-taking, mental status and neurological examination. If intracranial pathology is suspected clinically, a magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan should be performed depending on the clinical signs, the acuity and the suspected pathology. National guidelines should reflect evidence-based data.

AB  - Objective: Working Memory (WM) is a domain of executive functioning often impaired in individuals with ADHD. Although assumed to cause difficulties across functioning, the scope of impairments from WM deficits in ADHD has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to examine outcomes associated with WM deficits in ADHD. Method: We conducted a search of the scientific literature on WM deficits, and Freedom From Distractibility (FFD), in ADHD using PubMed and PsycInfo databases. Results: The final sample included 11 controlled studies of WM/FFD deficits in ADHD with operationalized assessment of outcomes in academic, social, and emotional areas. WM assessment was divided into auditory-verbal memory (AVM) and spatial-visual memory (SWM). Seven studies examined WM deficits in academic functioning, eight studies assessed WM deficits in social functioning, and three assessed WM deficits in psychopathology. Conclusion: The majority of the literature suggests that WM deficits affect primarily academic functioning.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between physical exercise and creative thinking. A systematic review approach was employed by searching PubMed, Google Scholar and Psychlnfo databases. Among the evaluated 13 studies, 92% indicated a beneficial relationship. However, 77% were vulnerable to moderate-high risk for methodological bias, suggesting adherence to standardized and controlled research initiatives should be promoted. There appears to be weak to modest support for acute, moderate-intensity exercise to benefit creativity. Exercise timing relative to creativity assessment protocols should be addressed and further detailed. Creativity scoring procedures must be refined, and an increased focus on the motivational components of exercise may help guide researchers in measuring creative thoughts and behavior. Broader concluding claims that creativity, in general, is improved or impaired by exercise, is as problematic as sweeping statements that exercise improves or impairs a measure as dynamic as intelligence. Scientific inquiries must specify precisely which outcome characteristics are changing in line with research interventions. This review identifies several fallible linkages between physical activity and creativity. Too few studies were conducted on strong methodological foundations, perpetuating the risk for undermining or inaccurately inflating the potential association between exercise and creative thinking behavior.

AB  - Pelvic floor muscle training is commonly used for urine loss. However, research studies have not determined which training load is the most effective for women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Moreover, none of the previous reviews or studies have described the total effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with an objective test such as the pad test. The objectives were to analyze the effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle training in women with SUI and to determine which training load produces the greatest adaptations for decreasing urine loss. The search was conducted in three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane), for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of PFMT. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: participants were women; were older than 18; had SUI; were treated with PFMT; and the assessments of the effects were measured with a pad test. Finally, 10 articles (293 women) analyzed the pad test in women with SUI who performed PFMT. The meta-analysis showed that PFMT, independent of the protocol used in the study, resulted in decreased urine loss in women suffering from SUI. However, for large effects, the program should last 6-12 weeks, with >3 sessions/week and a length of session <45 min.

AB  - Background Excessive use of the internet is increasingly recognised as a global public health concern. Individual studies have reported cognitive impairment in problematic internet use (PIU), but have suffered from various methodological limitations. Confirmation of cognitive deficits in PIU would support the neurobiological plausibility of this disorder. Aims To conduct a rigorous meta-analysis of cognitive performance in PIU from case-control studies; and to assess the impact of study quality, the main type of online behaviour (for example gaming) and other parameters on the findings. Method A systematic literature review was conducted of peer-reviewed case-controlled studies comparing cognition in people with PIU (broadly defined) with that of healthy controls. Findings were extracted and subjected to a meta-analysis where at least four publications existed for a given cognitive domain of interest. Results The meta-analysis comprised 2922 participants across 40 studies. Compared with controls, PIU was associated with significant impairment in inhibitory control (Stroop task Hedge's g = 0.53 (s.e. = 0.19-0.87), stop-signal task g = 0.42 (s.e. = 0.17-0.66), go/no-go task g = 0.51 (s.e. = 0.26-0.75)), decision-making (g = 0.49 (s.e. = 0.28-0.70)) and working memory (g = 0.40 (s.e. = 0.20-0.82)). Whether or not gaming was the predominant type of online behaviour did not significantly moderate the observed cognitive effects; nor did age, gender, geographical area of reporting or the presence of comorbidities. Conclusions PIU is associated with decrements across a range of neuropsychological domains, irrespective of geographical location, supporting its cross-cultural and biological validity. These findings also suggest a common neurobiological vulnerability across PIU behaviours, including gaming, rather than a dissimilar neurocognitive profile for internet gaming disorder.

KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - Using animals for cosmetics and medical tests has contributed towards a debate based on conflicting interests. Despite the efforts in justifying the value of animals in conducting analyses, this study seeks to elaborate whether or not it is rational to use animals as test subjects in medical and cosmetics fields. The value of animal life is at the core of the emotional conflicts that arise when animals become experimental subjects in medical and cosmetics fields. The aim of this study is to determine if there are ethical differences in the use of animal testing in medicine versus cosmetics. The research, through review and content analysis of the existing literature, compares and provides the outcomes of using animals in medical and cosmetics tests by examining studies conducted in the UK. The findings of this research indicated that animal testing is considered acceptable in the medical field only if there are no other alternatives, but is completely unacceptable in the cosmetics field. The study also provides recommendations in the form of alternatives that protect animals from cruelty and may benefit the different stakeholders and the society at large.

AB  - This paper reviews the literature on the association between experiences of child abuse and neglect and the development of psychoses. It then explores the premise that psychotic patients with a history of maltreatment may comprise a clinically and biological distinct subgroup. The review demonstrates that there is a growing consensus in the field that experiences of child maltreatment contribute to the onset of psychotic symptoms and psychotic disorders. There is also strong support for the premise that patients with psychotic disorders and histories of child maltreatment have distinct clinical characteristics and unique treatment needs, and emerging preliminary data to suggest psychotic patients with a history of maltreatment may comprise a distinct neurobiological subgroup. The mechanisms by which experiences of child maltreatment confers risk for psychotic disorders remains unknown, and the review highlights the value of incorporating translational research perspectives to advance knowledge in this area.

AB  - Learning objectives After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to: center dot Evaluate the double-dissociation approach to research in neuropsychology center dot Assess research aiming to provide evidence of double dissociation between neurobiological abnormalities and clinical presentations in psychiatry Background Psychiatric neuroscience research has grown exponentially, but it has not generated the desired breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment development, or treatment selection. In many instances a given neurobiological abnormality is found in multiple clinical syndromes, and conversely, a clinical syndrome is associated with multiple neurobiological abnormalities. To the extent that neurobiology research is conducted to explain psychiatric manifestations, however, it should also provide insight into how certain brain abnormalities lead to one and not another specific clinical presentation-that is, "double-dissociation." We hypothesized that most psychiatric research studies are not designed to identify such double dissociations. Methods We selected three leading psychiatric journals (American Journal of Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, and Molecular Psychiatry) that are representative of high-quality psychiatry research and that also provided a sample size that was feasible to screen. We screened all original research manuscripts published over the course of one calendar year (2017) to identify those measuring brain function or biological parameters (which, collectively, we term neurobiological measures) in psychiatric disorders. We asked whether such biological research could provide evidence for a double dissociation of any kind. Results We found that only 7 of 403 articles published in three psychiatry journals, constituting approximately 2% of publications, examined the dissociation of neurobiological measures relating to two psychiatric disorders or symptom clusters. Of these 7 studies, 5 used imaging as research tool; 1 used genotype array; and 1 used polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sample sizes of the 7 studies ranged from 100 to 2876. Conclusion We report on a striking paucity of research aiming to provide evidence of double dissociation between neurobiological abnormalities and clinical presentations in psychiatry. We conclude that this paucity represents a missed opportunity for the field. Double-dissociation approaches have been used successfully in many studies in neurology and psychiatry in the past, and more widespread and explicit adoption of this design may improve the mechanistic insights obtained in psychiatry research.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the loss of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which leads to impaired motor and cognitive functions. PD is predominantly an idiopathic disease, however about 5% of cases are linked to hereditary mutations. The most common mutation in both familial and sporadic PD is the G2019S mutation of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) with high prevalence in Ashkenazi Jewish patients and in North African Berber and Arab patients. It is still not fully understood how this mutation leads to PD pathology. In this study, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient with G2019S LRRK2 mutation to isolate self-renewable multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) and to model this form of PD in vitro. To investigate the cellular diversity and disease pathology in the NSCs, we used single cell RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling. The evidence suggests there are three subpopulations within the NSCs: a committed neuronal population, intermediate stage population and undifferentiated stage population. Unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression and dysregulation of genes involved in PD pathology. The significantly affected genes were involved in mitochondrial function, DNA repair, protein degradation, oxidative stress, lysosome biogenesis, ubiquitination, endosome function, autophagy and mitochondrial quality control. The results suggest that G2019S LRRK2 mutation may affect multiple cell types in a non-cell autonomous mechanism of PD pathology and that unbiased single-cell transcriptomics holds promise for personalized medicine.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to systematically identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative research concerning UK parents' experiences of their child receiving a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. In total, 11 articles were located through a systematic search of five databases, reference lists, citations and grey literature. These were critically appraised and their results synthesised using meta-ethnography. The quality scores given to included studies were variable, so suggestions are made to improve reporting of future research. Three third-order constructs were developed: (1) emotional needs, (2) informational needs and (3) relational needs. Each relates to parents' needs as they navigate the process of making sense of their child by seeking and adjusting to a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Parents' experiences of assessment and diagnosis of their children varied, but these needs were evident across the course of the process. Fathers seemed to find it more difficult than mothers to reconcile having a child with autism spectrum disorder, which may have been grounded in a sense of exclusion from the assessment process. The findings should be considered by professionals working with children, particularly those directly involved in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder. Clinical implications emphasise the need for consideration of parents' emotional needs, provision of information to aid understanding, and strong relationships with professionals. Future clinical research, which should be informed by quality standards, might develop and evaluate standards of assessment and diagnosis, including post-diagnostic support.

AB  - Objective: Schizophrenia is associated with increased infectious disease comorbidity and mortality. Individuals with schizophrenia have increased risk of infectious hepatitis, potentially due to substance use comorbidity, sexual behaviors, and immunologic factors. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between schizophrenia and hepatitis B and C.
   Method: We searched major electronic databases from inception until January 2019 for prevalence and case-control studies of infectious hepatitis in patients with schizophrenia. Random effects meta-analyses calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for case-controls studies, prevalence and 95% CIs, and meta-regression analyses were performed.
   Results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. In case-control studies, there was an over 3-fold increased odds of hepatitis C in patients with schizophrenia (OR = 3.29, 95% CI 1.50-7.23, p = 0.003), and a prevalence of 6% (ES = 0.06, 95% CI 0.04-0.08). In case-control studies, there was an over 2-fold increased odds of hepatitis B in patients with schizophrenia (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.61-3.47, p < 0.001) and a prevalence of 7% (ES = 0.07, 95% CI 0.03-0.11).
   Conclusion: We found an approximately 3-fold increased odds of hepatitis B and C in patients with schizophrenia. This association may be due to an increased prevalence of environmental risk factors, increased susceptibility to infections, or both. Findings suggest that screening for infectious hepatitis may be germane to the clinical care of patients with schizophrenia and relevant risk factors.

AB  - Although mental disorders are a leading cause of disability in the Arab region, which includes 5.54% of the global population, Arab countries produce only 1.0% of the global output of peer-reviewed publications in mental health research. Various stakeholders, including Arab mental health researchers, institutional and funding agency officials, and international research collaborators, convened to identify challenges faced by Arab mental health researchers and propose an evidence-informed call for action. Challenges identified include prevalent stigma and low awareness, conflict and war, scarce institutional and funding resources, inadequate publishing opportunities, insufficient training in mental health research, and shortage of reliable and valid assessment tools. The proposed action plan includes ways of addressing stigma and spreading awareness, increasing collaborative efforts, building research infrastructure, strengthening the mental health workforce, and translating research findings into a call to action on societal and governmental levels. The proposed action plan could provide a roadmap for Arab mental health researchers and research institutions, which might ultimately increase research productivity in the Arab region and close the gap between Arab countries and the rest of the world.

AB  - The cognitive science of religions' By-Product Theory contends that much religious thought and behavior can be explained in terms of the cultural activation of maturationally natural cognitive systems. Those systems address fundamental problems of human survival, encompassing such capacities as hazard precautions, agency detection, language processing, and theory of mind. Across cultures they typically arise effortlessly and unconsciously during early childhood. They are not taught and appear independent of general intelligence. Theory of mind (mentalizing) undergirds an instantaneous and automatic intuitive understanding of minds, mental representations, and their implications for agents' actions. By-Product theorists hypothesize about a social cognition content bias, holding that mentalizing capacities inform participants' implicit understanding of religious representations of agents with counter-intuitive properties. That hypothesis, in combination with Baron-Cohen's account of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in terms of diminished theory of mind capacities (what he calls "mind-blindness"), suggests an impaired religious understanding hypothesis. It proposes that people with ASD have substantial limitations in intuitive understanding of and creative inferences from such representations. Norenzayan argues for a mind-blind atheism hypothesis, which asserts that the truth of these first two hypotheses suggests that people with ASD have an increased probability, compared to the general population, of being atheists. Numerous empirical studies have explored these three hypotheses' merits. After carefully pondering distinctions between intuitive versus reflective mentalizing and between explicit versus implicit measures and affective versus cognitive measures of mentalizing, the available empirical evidence provides substantial support for the first two hypotheses and non-trivial support for the third.

AB  - Aims: Adult non-Western immigrants in Scandinavia tend to be worse off in terms of health than native-born populations, which cannot be fully ascribed to their often lower socioeconomic status (SES). This review examines if differences in health status are also present between non-Western immigrant and majority children in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and if SES explains the differences. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, relevant Scandinavian peer-reviewed quantitative publications since 1990 were identified through a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science and SveMed. Of 1197 identified publications, 27 remained relevant after applying inclusion criteria: 3 Danish, 6 Norwegian and 18 Swedish studies. Results: Non-western immigrant children had overall poorer outcomes compared with ethnic majority children in Denmark, Norway and Sweden in health issues covered by the included studies: diabetes, obesity, oral and mental health, and well-being. However, in diabetes, obesity and mental health, non-Western immigrant children from certain countries and regions, and descendants of non-Western immigrants had similar/more favourable outcomes than majority children. In mental health and well-being, ethnic inequalities were strongly associated with SES, while for diabetes, obesity and oral health, differences remained significant after adjusting for SES. Conclusions: Overall poorer health outcomes in non-Western immigrant compared with majority children in Scandinavia cannot be fully explained by SES. Evidence points to additional mechanisms at individual, household, societal or policy levels, including reasons for migration, culture and societal discrimination. Finally, methodological issues may influence study outcomes, e.g. heterogeneity of populations studied and socioeconomic variables included.

AB  - Weight gain is a side effect of antipsychotic medication and highly prevalent in people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, increasing their overall cardio-metabolic risk. We conducted a systematic review on non-pharmacological interventions for preventing/reducing weight gain or increase in waist-circumference in young, newly diagnosed patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We searched major electronic databases from inception to 04/2019 on RCTs, pre- and post-test studies, and non-randomized controlled clinical trials. From a potential of 2963 hits, eight studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 438, mean age of 18.8 (13-45) years). The interventions comprised supervised and individually adjusted aerobic exercise activities (5 studies), individual lifestyle counselling vs. control condition (2 RCTs), and dietetic counselling and practical training of cooking and shopping (1 study). Physical activity and practical dietetic interventions seem to be more efficient than lifestyle counselling. However, the results shall be taken with caution due to the non-randomized designs and other methodologically deficits in the majority of the included studies.

AB  - Background
   Indigenous people are overrepresented in prison populations of colonised justice systems, and Indigenous prisoners in these countries are at a particularly high risk of poor mental health and well-being. There is an acute need to ensure the access of these groups to culturally appropriate, evidence-based interventions.
   Aims
   To conduct a systematic review, evaluating quantitative and qualitative evaluations of mental health and well-being interventions designed for Indigenous people in custody.
   Method
   A search of relevant peer-reviewed journal articles to August 2019 was conducted. The focus was on colonised countries under a Western model of justice and health, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the USA. The review utilised Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, PsycNET, EBSCO, Proquest Criminal Justice Database and Informit.
   Results
   Of the 9283 articles initially found, only three quantitative and two qualitative evaluations of mental health or well-being interventions for Indigenous people in custody were identified. None were randomised controlled trials. Culturally based interventions appeared to have high acceptability and potential for increased recovery from trauma, reduced alcohol-related problems and lower reoffending. However, no studies quantitatively assessed mental health or well-being outcomes.
   Conclusions
   As yet there is no high-quality evidence on the impact on mental health and well-being from interventions specifically for Indigenous prisoners, although existing studies suggest programme features that may maximise acceptability and impact. There is a moral, social and practical imperative to build a strong evidence base on this topic.

AB  - Context: Recently, driving simulators have been widely used in various studies in the traffic safety domain, especially to investigate the effects of a mobile phone conversation on driving performance. As the characteristics of simulators and scenarios designed in previous studies were quite diverse, the cognitive workload resulting from scenarios in each study and their effects on the results varied significantly so that it made it difficult to compare the results. Therefore, the present study was conducted aiming at providing a checklist of cognitive specification control in this category of studies by investigating the methodological characteristics of previous studies.
   Evidence Acquisition: The articles were searched in Springer, Elsevier, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases during 2002 - 2017. The author used mobile phone, cell phone, driving simulator, distraction, and mental workload keywords with the "and" and "or" operators. Based on certain criteria, 14 articles were selected among the retrieved articles.
   Results: Methods and purposes of articles were evaluated in terms of factors affecting cognitive function. Based on reliable and valid scientific documents, a checklist of the cognitive profile of scenarios and simulators was designed and presented in three macro domains.
   Conclusions: Considering various simulator designs the scenario design characteristics effective in cognitive workload, the studies were not convergent so that different aspects of the main variables were reported in various studies. Inattention to reporting these variables led to the incorrect estimation of the effects of a mobile phone conversation on driving performance.

AB  - Exposure to inhalation aerosols and particulate matter (PM) in different concentrations can increase the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, and other related diseases. The inhalation exposure studies are implemented to assess the biological effects of these hazardous agents in human or animal models, in whole-body (WB) or nose/head-only conditions. Several factors can affect the performance of the inhalation exposure chambers and if left uncontrolled, the results may not be desirable. The current study reviewed the characteristics, structures, and factors affecting the performance of the WB chambers, especially the ones designed for small animal exposure to the PM. At the primary stage, the criteria and the search strategy were determined and the keywords were searched in the scientific electronic databases. Totally, 1051 articles were extracted in the first stage, and finally seven articles were adopted. The technical and design details, materials, coefficient variations (CVs) of concentration, assessment methods, type and number of laboratory animals, procedure, and animals housing conditions were extracted from the selected articles. Then the most desirable WB inhalation exposure chamber was determined based on the criteria for assessing the presented exposure chambers such as the animal housing and least CVs of the concentration in the respiratory zones of the animals under study. It was concluded that the Kimmel design was the best and the most desirable chamber structurally and geometrically, since the concentration of the particle (NaCl) injected into the chamber varied from 3.5% to 5.2%, under standard conditions.

AB  - Background Individuals affected by psychotic disorders frequently disengage from mental health services, although reports of this rate in the literature have ranged from 6 to 60%. One of the potential explanations for the large variation is that studies have adopted different definitions. Without a universal definition it is challenging to compare rates and factors leading to disengagement across studies. This systematic review aims to identify and compare how disengagement from psychosis services has been defined, measured and operationalised in the literature to date. Methods A systemic literature search of the PubMed, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases was completed following the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Results 1506 Studies were identified, of which 30 were eligible to be included. It was found that disengagement was operationalized as either a categorical or continuous variable across studies, with 18 studies classifying it as a categorical, binary variable. Only four studies applied a time period over which disengagement was said to occur, and only four studies used an instrument to measure or predict disengagement. Few studies considered similar factors in their definition, when this occurred it was because the papers came from the same research group. Discussion To truly understand the phenomenon of disengagement, studies need to have a comparable outcome variable. The need for consensus on a gold standard definition of disengagement that considers the full breadth of its complexity remains. A potential process for establishing a definition that includes set parameters, agreed upon terminology and time periods of assessment is discussed.

AB  - Background: Pituitary volume (PV) abnormalities, representing one of several markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, have been observed in psychosis, with variable patterns across illness stages. Typically, enlargements characterise first-episode patients, with reductions observed in those with chronic illness relative to healthy controls. Findings in high-risk populations have been inconsistent, highlighting the need for an updated review of the evidence.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for studies examining PV in high-risk [clinical high-risk (CHR), family history of psychosis (FHx), schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), and psychotic-experiences (PEs)] and healthy individuals. Random effects models were used to examine group differences in PV (Hedges g) with stratified analyses and meta-regression employed to investigate the effect of high-risk category, transition status, age, sex, and antipsychotic medication.
   Results: Ten studies, yielding 11 effect sizes, were eligible for inclusion. Overall, high-risk individuals had significantly larger PV relative to healthy controls (g = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.01 to 0.32] p = 0.04), despite showing a reduction in whole brain volume (g = -0.17, [95% CI. -0.30 to -0.03] p = 0.020). Individual sub-group analyses for CHR and FHx groups showed no significant differences relative to controls; however, larger PV increases characterised those who later transitioned to psychosis (g = 0.55, [95% CI. 0.06 to 1.04] p = 0.028). Larger effect sizes were positively associated with the proportion of high-risk individuals receiving antipsychotic medication.
   Conclusions: PV enlargements characterise high-risk individuals and are more pronounced among those who later develop psychosis. We provide recommendations for future studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of review Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth aged 10-24 years old globally, but detecting those at risk is challenging. Novel preventive strategies with wide influence across populations are required. Interest in the potential for both detrimental and supportive influences of social media/internet use on suicidal behaviour has been growing; however, the relationship remains unclear. Recent findings A systematic search of articles from database inception up to 25 January 2019 across five databases: Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, HMIC and CINAHL revealed nine independent studies investigating social media/internet use and suicide attempts in young people less than 19 years old (n = 346 416). An independent direct association was found between heavy social media/internet use and increased suicide attempts in seven studies (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.03 to 5.10), although adjusting for cyberbullying victimization and sleep disturbance reduced the strength of this association. Two studies found that some social media/internet use, versus no use, may be associated with fewer suicide attempts. There were no studies investigating the relationship between social media/internet use and completed suicide. There is an independent association between problematic use of social media/internet and suicide attempts in young people. However, the direction of causality, if any, remains unclear. Further evaluation through longitudinal studies is needed.

AB  - Athletes are prone to several health complications, including upper respiratory tract infections, allergies, and gastrointestinal discomforts during practice and after the performance due to the intense exercise, travel, insufficient rest and restricted food consumption. Probiotics are well known as complementary therapeutic and health supplements for several diseases and disorders. Studies suggest that the intervention of probiotics improved the health status of elite athletes, but the results are not consistent in all the studies. The beneficial effect of probiotic supplementation profoundly relies on species or strain, dose, duration, form, and host physiology. The manuscript summarizes the effect of probiotic supplementation on health status of athletes. The literature was collected from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using the search term "probiotic and athletes". As per the literature survey, probiotic supplementation improved the intestinal permeability, immune system, intestinal microbiota, inflammatory system, reduced the severity and incidence of respiratory tract infections, and duration of gastrointestinal symptoms. Several studies were conducted on Lactobacillus species and the outcomes were found to be species- or strain-specific. More studies are required to know the detailed mechanism behind the beneficial effect of probiotic intervention in athletes. Further studies are desired on formulation and optimization of probiotic supplements to develop generalized and personalized sports supplements to boost the overall health and enactment of elite athletes.

AB  - Background As an alternative to co-located integrated care, off-site integration (partnerships between primary care and non-embedded specialty mental health providers) can address the growing need for pediatric mental health services. Our goal is to review the existing literature on implementing off-site pediatric integrated care. Methods We systematically searched the literature for peer-reviewed publications on off-site pediatric integrated care interventions. We included studies that involved systematic data collection and analysis, both qualitative and quantitative, of implementation outcomes (acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability). Results We found 39 original articles from 24 off-site programs with a variety of study designs, most with secondary implementation outcomes. Models of off-site integration varied primarily along two dimensions: direct vs. indirect, and in-person vs. remote. Overall, off-site models were acceptable to providers, particularly when the following were present: strong interdisciplinary communication, timely availability and reliability of services, additional support beyond one-time consultation, and standardized care algorithms. Adoption and penetration were facilitated by enhanced program visibility, including on-site champions. Certain clinical populations (e.g., school-age, less complicated ADHD) seemed more amenable to off-site integrated models than others (e.g., preschool-age, conduct disorders). Lack of funding and inadequate reimbursement limited sustainability in all models. Conclusions Off-site interventions are feasible, acceptable, and often adopted widely with adequate planning, administrative support, and interprofessional communication. Studies that focus primarily on implementation and that consider the perspectives of specialty providers and patients are needed.

AB  - Quetiapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that is most favoured for its low propensity for extrapyramidal side effects. However, Quetiapine requires slow titration, which is disadvantageous. The brief review discussed research that trialled rapid titration of Quetiapine The author searched PubMed, Proquest, Embase, Google Scholar and Google Web using the keyword 'rapid titration' and 'quetiapine'. A total of 18 articles were included. The process, safety and efficacy of rapid titration of Quetiapine was examined. In conclusion, preliminary results appear to show that there is minimal difference in efficacy, between the rapid and traditional titration of Quetiapine. Sedation tended to occur more frequently and earlier among experimental group, and this might render rapid titration of Quetiapine to be suitable for agitated patients. There is a need for more large-scale, multisite, randomized clinical trials to examine the safety and efficacy of rapid titration of Quetiapine.

AB  - Background: Characterizing the link between childhood trauma and adult neurocognitive function in psychosis is crucial for improving the fields understanding of how early environmental risk factors impact the presentation of the disorder. To date, the literature has been inconsistent: meta-analytic synthesis is lacking, and it is unclear whether specific cognitive functions are affected. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed on a total of 3315 subjects with a psychotic disorder. The links between childhood trauma, overall neurocognitive function, and four cognitive subdomains (working memory, executive function, verbal/visual memory, and attention/processing speed) were examined. Relevant sample characteristics and methodological moderators were tested. The strength of the association between trauma and overall neurocognition in individuals with psychotic disorders was also compared to that of healthy controls. Results: Among individuals with psychotic disorders, there was a significant association between overall cognition and childhood trauma, r = -.055; 95% CI = -0.09, -0.02, P = .002. There was also a modest, negative relationship between childhood trauma and working memory, r = -.091; 95% CI = -0.15, -0.03, P = .002. Moderators did not have a significant effect on these analyses. Further, the association between childhood trauma and neurocognition was significantly stronger in healthy controls compared to patients with a psychotic disorder. Conclusion: A small negative association was found between overall cognition and childhood trauma in individuals with psychotic disorders. Results suggest the association is less strong for individuals with a psychotic disorder compared to healthy populations. Findings are informative for prominent etiological models of psychosis.

AB  - Objectives: Despite the established clinical and cost-effectiveness of integrated care (IC) models for patients with comorbid mental and physical illness, little is known about whether these models facilitate a better care experience from the patient's perspective. The authors conducted a scoping review of the literature to explore how IC influences patients' care experiences.
   Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYC INFO CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library, and grey literature were searched to identify relevant articles. Eligible studies were systematically reviewed and analyzed, using thematic analysis approach, to identify patterns, trends, and variation in patient experience within IC settings.
   Results: Search results yielded 5250 unique resources of which 21 primary studies met our eligibility criteria for analysis. Findings from this scoping review revealed variation in patients' experiences in IC settings. IC models enhanced patients' experience by creating theraputic spaces: improving patient access to care, developing collaborative relationships, and personalizing patient care to address individual needs.
   Conclusion: Productive interactions with care team were key to improve patient engagement and experience of centeredness in IC settings. Successful implementation of IC demanded purposeful alignment of IC structural components and care processes to create therapeutic spaces that address patient care needs and preferences.

AB  - 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is characterised by a well defined microdeletion that is associated with a high risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, including intellectual disability, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorders, seizures and epilepsy, and early-onset Parkinson's disease. Preclinical and clinical data reveal substantial variability of the neuropsychiatric phenotype despite the shared underlying deletion in this genetic model. Factors that might explain this variability include genetic background effects, additional rare pathogenic variants, and potential regulatory functions of some genes in the 22q11.2 deletion region. These factors might also be relevant to the pathophysiology of these neuropsychiatric disorders in the general population. We review studies that might provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the expression of neuropsychiatric disorders in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and potential implications for these common disorders in the general (non-deleted) population. The recurrent hemizygous 22q11.2 deletion, associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, has attracted attention as a genetic model for common neuropsychiatric disorders because of its association with substantially increased risk of such disorders.1 Studying such a model has many advantages. First, 22q11.2 deletion has been genetically well characterised.2 Second, most genes present in the region typically deleted at the 22q11.2 locus are expressed in the brain.3, 4, 5 Third, genetic diagnosis might be made early in life, long before recognisable neuropsychiatric disorders have emerged. Thus, this genetic condition offers a unique opportunity for early intervention, and monitoring individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome throughout life could provide important information on factors contributing to disease risk and protection. Despite the commonly deleted region being shared by about 90% of individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, neuropsychiatric outcomes are highly variable between individuals and across the lifespan. A clear link remains to be established between genotype and phenotype.3, 5 In this Review, we summarise preclinical and clinical studies investigating biological mechanisms in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, with a focus on those that might provide insight into mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and in the general population.

AB  - Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by dysfunction of the immune system that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by demyelination, chronic inflammation, neuronal and oligodendrocyte loss and reactive astrogliosis. It can result in physical disability and acute neurological and cognitive problems. Despite the gains in knowledge of immunology, cell biology, and genetics in the last five decades, the ultimate etiology or specific elements that trigger MS remain unknown. The objective of this review is to propose a theoretical basis for MS etiopathogenesis. Methods: Search was done by accessing PubMed/Medline, EBSCO, and PsycINFO databases. The search string used was "(multiple sclerosis* OR EAE) AND (pathophysiology* OR etiopathogenesis)". The electronic databases were searched for titles or abstracts containing these terms in all published articles between January 1, 1960, and June 30, 2019. The search was filtered down to 362 articles which were included in this review. Results: A framework to better understand the etiopathogenesis and pathophysiology of MS can be derived from four essential factors; mitochondria dysfunction (MtD) & oxidative stress (OS), vitamin D (VD), sex hormones and thyroid hormones. These factors play a direct role in MS etiopathogenesis and have a modulatory effect on many other factors involved in the disease. Conclusions: For better MS prevention and treatment outcomes, efforts should be geared towards treating thyroid problems, sex hormone alterations, VD deficiency, sleep problems and melatonin alterations. MS patients should be encouraged to engage in activities that boost total antioxidant capacity (TAC) including diet and regular exercise and discouraged from activities that promote OS including smoking and alcohol consumption.

AB  - Many researchers in moral psychology approach the topic of moral judgment in terms of value-assessing outcomes of behaviors as either harmful or helpful, which makes the behaviors wrong or right, respectively. However, recent advances in motivation science suggest that other motives may be at work as well-namely truth (wanting to establish what is real) and control (wanting to manage what happens). In this review, we argue that the epistemic experiences of observers of (im)moral behaviors, and the perceived epistemic experiences of those observed, serve as a groundwork for understanding how truth and control motives are implicated in the moral judgment process. We also discuss relations between this framework and recent work from across the field of moral psychology, as well as implications for future research.

AB  - Over 25 years ago Ericsson et al. (1993) published the results of their search for the most effective forms of training in music, a domain where knowledge of effective training has been accumulated over centuries. At music academies master teachers provide students individualized instruction and help them identify goals and methods for their practice sessions between meetings - this form of solitary practice was named deliberate practice, and its accumulated duration during development was found to distinguish groups with differing levels of attained music performance. In an influential meta-analysis Macnamara et al. (2014) identified studies that had collected estimates of practice accumulated during development and attained performance and reported that individual differences in deliberate practice accounted for only 14% of variance in performance. Their definition of "deliberate practice" differs significantly from the original definition of deliberate practice and will henceforth be referred to as structured practice. We explicate three criteria for reproducible performance and purposeful/deliberate practice and exclude all effect sizes considered by Macnamara et al. (2014) that were based on data not meeting these criteria. A reanalysis of the remaining effects estimated that accumulated duration of practice explained considerably more variance in performance (29 and 61% after attenuation correction). We also address the argument that the limited amount of variance explained by the duration of practice necessarily implies an important role of genetic factors, and we report that genetic effects have so far accounted for remarkably small amounts of variance - with exception of genetic influences of height and body size. The paper concludes with recommendations for how future research on purposeful and deliberate practice can go beyond recording only the duration of practice to measuring the quality of practice involving concentration, analysis, and problem solving to identify conditions for the most effective forms of training.

AB  - This systematic review aims to examine the existing literature concerning the association between father involvement and the development children's cognitive skills during early and middle childhood. Specifically, it analyzes: (1) how the number of researches developed across years; (2) which are the main socio-demographic characteristics of the samples; (3) which are the main focuses examined; and (4) which operational definitions were used to assess father involvement and children cognitive skills. Following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, the articles were searched through PubMed and EBSCO (PsycInfo, PsycArticles, Education Source, Social Sciences Abstract, Family Studies Abstracts, Gender Studies Database and CINAHL complete). The findings suggest that, although each research used a different operational definition of the father involvement construct, in recent years there was a wide and constant interest increase about this issue. Most of the empirical studies utilized quantitative methods, whereas relatively few used qualitative and only one mixed methods. As regards the analysis of socio-demographic characteristics of the samples there is a great evidence that most of them included biological and residential fathers: it may reflect that this type of sample is easier to recruit than non-residential and non-biological fathers. Regarding the socio- economic status and the ethnicity of families, the data highlighted how in recent years the literature on father involvement is starting to look at differences in ethnic and cultural backgrounds, in contrast to past researches. The findings revealed that the main focus is the impact of father involvement on children's cognitive skills and the most of the studies highlighted that it is positive and statistically significant. Regarding to the assessment of father involvement and children's cognitive skills, the literature is quite heterogeneous.

AB  - Research documents that many chronic non-malignant pain patients experience existential, spiritual and religious needs; however, research knowledge is missing on if and how physicians approach these needs. We conducted a systematic review to explore the extent to which physicians address these needs in their communication with chronic non-malignant pain patients and to explore the facilitators and challenges of this communication. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, searching Embase, Medline, Scopus and PsycINFO. The quality of the included articles was assessed based on design-specific screening tools. We included four of 2337 screened articles and found the quality to be good. Physicians' communication about existential, spiritual and religious needs was given low priority and depended on the patients' own initiative, except when clinicians were interested in holistic care. Patient dissatisfaction with the physician's attention to these needs was related to higher pain and depression. Physicians' challenges for addressing these needs were their tendency to prioritize physiological aspects and close further elaboration of existential needs when addressed by the patients. The main facilitator was the individual physician's willingness to listen with openness and empathy to the patients' existential concerns. A tentative conclusion is that physicians rarely meet the existential, spiritual and religious needs of their chronic non-malignant pain patients. This might be due to higher priority of physical aspects, lack of time and a lack of knowledge about the importance of and training in the ability to address these needs. Further research is needed on physicians' communication about existential, spiritual and religious needs and on their training in here.

AB  - Background: The first rate-limiting step for improving outcomes of psychosis through preventive interventions in people at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) is the ability to accurately detect individuals who are at risk for the development of this disorder. Currently, this detection power is sub-optimal. Methods: This is a conceptual and nonsystematic review of the literature, focusing on the work conducted by leading research teams in the field. The results will be structured in the following sections: understanding the CHR-P assessment, validity of the CHR-P as a universal risk state for psychosis, and improving the detection of at-risk individuals in secondary mental health care, in primary care, and in the community. Results: CHR-P instruments can provide adequate prognostic accuracy for the prediction of psychosis provided that they are employed in samples who have undergone risk enrichment during recruitment. This substantially limits their detection power in real-world settings. Furthermore, there is initial evidence that not all cases of psychosis onset are preceded by a CHR-P stage. A transdiagnostic individualized risk calculator could be used to automatically screen secondary mental health care medical notes to detect those at risk of psychosis and refer them to standard CHR-P assessment. Similar risk estimation tools for use in primary care are under development and promise to boost the detection of patients at risk in this setting. To improve the detection of young people who may be at risk of psychosis in the community, it is necessary to adopt digital and/or sequential screening approaches. These solutions are based on recent scientific evidence and have potential for implementation internationally. Conclusions: The best strategy to improve the detection of patients at risk for psychosis is to implement a clinical research program that integrates different but complementary detection approaches across community, primary, and secondary care. These solutions are based on recent scientific advancements in the development of risk estimation tools and e-health approaches and have the potential to be applied across different clinical settings.

AB  - Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for children and adolescents is a persuasive system that combines 3 major components to therapy-therapeutic content, technological features, and interactions between the user and program-intended to reduce users' anxiety symptoms. Several reviews report the effectiveness of iCBT; however, iCBT design and delivery components differ widely across programs, which raise important questions about how iCBT effects are produced and can be optimized.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to review and synthesize the iCBT literature using a realist approach with a persuasive systems perspective to (1) document the design and delivery components of iCBT and (2) generate hypotheses as to how these components may explain changes in anxiety symptoms after completing iCBT.
   Methods: A multi-strategy search identified published and gray literature on iCBT for child and adolescent anxiety up until June 2019. Documents that met our prespecified inclusion criteria were appraised for relevance and methodological rigor. Data extraction was guided by the persuasive systems design (PSD) model. The model describes 28 technological design features, organized into 4 categories that help users meet their health goals: primary task support, dialogue support, system credibility support, and social support. We generated initial hypotheses for how PSD (mechanisms) and program delivery (context of use) features were linked to symptom changes (outcomes) across iCBT programs using realist and meta-ethnographic techniques. These hypothesized context-mechanism-outcome configurations were refined during analysis using evidence from the literature to improve their explanatory value.
   Results: A total of 63 documents detailing 15 iCBT programs were included. A total of six iCBT programs were rated high for relevance, and most studies were of moderate-to-high methodological rigor. A total of 11 context-mechanism-outcome configurations (final hypotheses) were generated. Configurations primarily comprised PSD features from the primary task and dialogue support categories. Several key PSD features (eg, self-monitoring, simulation, social role, similarity, social learning, and rehearsal) were consistently reported in programs shown to reduce anxiety; many features were employed simultaneously, suggesting synergy when grouped. We also hypothesized the function of PSD features in generating iCBT impacts. Adjunct support was identified as an important aspect of context that may have complemented certain PSD features in reducing users' anxiety.
   Conclusions: This synthesis generated context-mechanism-outcome configurations (hypotheses) about the potential function, combination, and impact of iCBT program components thought to support desired program effects. We suggest that, when delivered with adjunct support, PSD features may contribute to reduced anxiety for child and adolescent users. Formal testing of the 11 configurations is required to confirm their impact on anxiety-based outcomes. From this we encourage a systematic and deliberate approach to iCBT design and evaluation to increase the pool of evidence-based interventions available to prevent and treat children and adolescents with anxiety.

AB  - A recent review of the literature concluded that Rasch measurement is an influential approach in psychometric modeling. Despite the major contributions of Rasch measurement to the growth of scientific research across various fields, there is currently no research on the trends and evolution of Rasch measurement research. The present study used co-citation techniques and a multiple perspectives approach to investigate 5,365 publications on Rasch measurement between 01 January 1972 and 03 May 2019 and their 108,339 unique references downloaded from the Web of Science (WoS). Several methods of network development involving visualization and text-mining were used to analyze these data: author co-citation analysis (ACA), document co-citation analysis (DCA), journal author co-citation analysis (JCA), and keyword analysis. In addition, to investigate the inter-domain trends that link the Rasch measurement specialty to other specialties, we used a dual-map overlay to investigate specialty-to-specialty connections. Influential authors, publications, journals, and keywords were identified. Multiple research frontiers or sub-specialties were detected and the major ones were reviewed, including "visual function questionnaires", "non-parametric item response theory", "valid measures (validity)", "latent class models", and "many-facet Rasch model". One of the outstanding patterns identified was the dominance and impact of publications written for general groups of practitioners and researchers. In personal communications, the authors of these publications stressed their mission as being "teachers" who aim to promote Rasch measurement as a conceptual model with real-world applications. Based on these findings, we propose that sociocultural and ethnographic factors have a huge capacity to influence fields of science and should be considered in future investigations of psychometrics and measurement. As the first scientometric review of the Rasch measurement specialty, this study will be of interest to researchers, graduate students, and professors seeking to identify research trends, topics, major publications, and influential scholars.

AB  - Visual working memory (VWM) is one of the most investigated cognitive systems functioning as a hub between low- and high-level processes. Remarkably, its role in human cognitive architecture makes it a stage of crucial importance for the study of socio-affective cognition, also in relation with psychopathology such as anxiety. Among socio-affective stimuli, faces occupy a place of first importance. How faces and facial expressions are encoded and maintained in VWM is the focus of this review. Within the main theoretical VWM models, we will review research comparing VWM representations of faces and of other classes of stimuli. We will further present previous work investigating if and how both static (i.e., ethnicity, trustworthiness and identity) and changeable (i.e., facial expressions) facial features are represented in VWM. Finally, we will examine research showing qualitative differences in VWM for face representations as a function of psychopathology and personality traits. The findings that we will review are not always coherent with each other, and for this reason we will highlight the main methodological differences as the main source of inconsistency. Finally, we will provide some suggestions for future research in this field in order to foster our understanding of representation of faces in VWM and its potential role in supporting socio-affective cognition.

AB  - Background Hypersensitivity to electromagnetic fields (EMF) is a controversial condition. While individuals with idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) claim to experience health complaints upon EMF exposure, many experimental studies have found no convincing evidence for a physical relation. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate methodological limitations in experimental studies on symptom development in IEI-EMF individuals that might have fostered false positive or false negative results. Furthermore, we compared the profiles of these limitations between studies with positive and negative results. Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided the methodological conduct and reporting. Eligible were blinded experimental studies that exposed individuals with IEI-EMF to different EMF exposure levels and queried the development of symptoms during or after each exposure trial. Strengths and limitations in design, conduct and analysis of individual studies were assessed using a customized rating tool. Results Twenty-eight studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. In many studies, both with positive and negative results, we identified methodological limitations that might have either fostered false or masked real effects of exposure. The most common limitations were related to the selection of study participants, the counterbalancing of the exposure sequence and the effectiveness of blinding. Many studies further lacked statistical power estimates. Methodically sound studies indicated that an effect of exposure is unlikely. Conclusion Overall, the evidence points towards no effect of exposure. If physical effects exist, previous findings suggest that they must be very weak or affect only few individuals with IEI-EMF. Given the evidence that the nocebo effect or medical/mental disorders may explain the symptoms in many individuals with IEI-EMF, additional research is required to identify the various factors that may be important for developing IEI-EMF and for provoking the symptoms. We recommend the identification of subgroups and exploring IEI-EMF in the context of other idiopathic environmental intolerances. If further experimental studies are conducted, they should preferably be performed at the individual level. In particular, to increase the likelihood of detecting hypersensitive individuals, if they exist, we encourage researchers to achieve a high credibility of the results by minimizing sources of risk of bias and imprecision.

AB  - Aims: This qualitative literature review aims to critically assess and analyse published literature to determine drivers influencing over-prescribing by general practitioners (GPs) in primary care, exploring their views and opinions, and also to determine how antibiotic prescribing can be improved and unnecessary prescribing reduced, thus reducing the threat to public health from antibiotic resistance. It is intended to develop new thinking in this area and add to existing knowledge concerning GPs' antibiotic prescribing behaviour. Methods: Thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke's 2006 framework was used to analyse 17 qualitative studies chosen from EBSCOhost databases, focusing on GPs' views of antibiotic prescribing in primary care, with specific search strategies and inclusion criteria to ensure study quality and trustworthiness. Results: Three main themes and nine sub-themes were generated from the studies. The first main theme discussed GP factors related to over-prescribing, the main drivers being GP attitudes and feelings and anxiety/fear concerning prescribing. The second theme highlighted external factors, with pressures from time and financial issues as the main drivers within this theme. The final theme marked patient pressure, demand and expectation with lack of patient education as the major drivers affecting GP over-prescribing. Conclusion: The findings of this research show GPs' antibiotic prescribing in primary care is complex, being influenced by many internal and external factors. A multifaceted approach to interventions targeting the drivers identified could significantly reduce the level of antibiotic prescribing thus minimising the impact of antibiotic resistance and promoting a more efficient working environment for GPs and patients alike.

AB  - Experimental streams are bounded and partly enclosed lotic units that facilitate the simulation of certain aspects of natural stream ecosystems under controlled conditions. We summarized the current knowledge regarding experimental streams in order to support researchers in designing and undertaking future studies using experimental streams. We observed an increase in the number of such studies since 1975. The geographically uneven distribution of studies suggests that the generalization of findings to global scale may not be straightforward. Our results indicate that macroinvertebrates, fish, and algae are the most frequently studied organisms and that the size of the experimental streams was related to the focal organism group(s) studied. The size of the units decreased over time, while the number of treatments, interpreted as the combination of the levels of factors, increased. These results suggest that biologically complex studies have gradually been replaced by biologically less complex ones. In contrast, the experimental complexity (the number of treatments) and the statistical power (number of replication) increased. Finally, we identified a number of important, but poorly documented pieces of information regarding experimental stream systems and experimental protocols and made recommendations for future research.

AB  - Sleep occupies a third of our life and is a primary need for all animal species studied so far. Nonetheless, chronic sleep restriction is a growing source of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Sleep loss is associated with the subjective feeling of sleepiness and with decreased performance, as well as with detrimental effects on general health, cognition, and emotions. The ideas that small brain areas can be asleep while the rest of the brain is awake and that local sleep may account for at least some of the cognitive and behavioral manifestations of sleepiness are making their way into the scientific community. We herein clarify the different ways sleep can intrude into wakefulness, summarize recent scientific advances in the field, and offer some hypotheses that help framing sleepiness as a local phenomenon.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is one of the major risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of brain impairment caused by chronic hyperglycemia is complex and includes mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, neurotransmitters' alteration, and vascular disease, which lead to cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, loss of synaptic plasticity, brain aging, and dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a gut released hormone, is attracting attention as a possible link between metabolic and brain impairment. Several studies have shown the influence of GPL-1 on neuronal functions such as thermogenesis, blood pressure control, neurogenesis, neurodegeneration, retinal repair, and energy homeostasis. Moreover, modulation of GLP-1 activity can influence amyloid beta peptide aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dopamine (DA) levels in Parkinson's disease (PD). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) showed beneficial actions on brain ischemia in animal models, such as the reduction of cerebral infarct area and the improvement of neurological deficit, acting mainly through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. They might also exert a beneficial effect on the cognitive impairment induced by diabetes or obesity improving learning and memory by modulating synaptic plasticity. Moreover, GLP-1RAs reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Besides this, there are growing evidences on neuroprotective effects of these agonists in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, regardless of diabetes. In PD animal models, GPL-1RAs were able to protect motor activity and dopaminergic neurons whereas in AD models, they seemed to improve nearly all neuropathological features and cognitive functions. Although further clinical studies of GPL-1RAs in humans are needed, they seem to be a promising therapy for diabetes-associated cognitive decline.

AB  - Background The potential link between sleep disorders and suicidal behaviour has been the subject of several reviews. We performed this meta-analysis to estimate the overall association between sleep disorders and suicidal behaviour and to identify a more specific relationship in patients with depression. Methods A systematic search strategy was developed across the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 1, 2019 for studies that reported a relationship between sleep disorders and suicidal behaviour in depressed patients. The odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to measure the outcomes. Heterogeneity was evaluated by Cochran's Q test and the I-2 statistic. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was adopted to evaluate the methodological quality of each of the included studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence. We calculated the overall association between sleep disorders and suicidal behaviour and estimated more specific categories, including insomnia, nightmares, hypersomnia, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide. Results A total of 18 studies were included in this study. Overall, sleep disorders were closely related to suicidal behaviour in patients with depression (OR = 2.45 95% CI: 1.33 4.52). The relatively increased risks of sleep disorders with suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide ranged from 1.24 (95% CI: 1.00 1.53) to 2.41 (95% CI: 1.45 4.02). Nightmares were found to be highly correlated with the risk of suicidal behaviour (OR = 4.47 95% CI: 2.00 9.97), followed by insomnia (OR = 2.29 95% CI: 1.69 3.10). The certainty of the evidence was rated as very low for the overall outcome and the major depression subgroup and was rated as low for the depression subgroup. Conclusions This meta-analysis supports the finding that sleep disorders, particularly nightmares and insomnia, increase the risk of suicidal behaviour in depressed patients. Considering that all included studies were observational, the quality of the evidence is rated as very low. More well-designed studies are needed to confirm our findings and to better explain the mechanisms by which sleep disorders aggravate suicidal behaviour in depressed patients.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, fatal disease, characterized by an accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in oligodendroglial cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in post-translational regulation and several biological processes. Disruption of miRNA-related pathways in the central nervous system (CNS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including MSA. While the exact mechanisms underlying miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MSA remain unclear, it is known that miRNAs can repress the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that regulate the following pathogenesis associated with MSA: autophagy, neuroinflammation, alpha-syn accumulation, synaptic transmission, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. In this review, the metabolism of miRNAs and their functional roles in the pathogenesis of MSA are discussed, thereby highlighting miRNAs as potential new biomarkers for the diagnosis of MSA and in increasing our understanding of the disease process.

AB  - Background: Among individuals experiencing amphetamine psychosis, it may be difficult to rule out schizophrenia. The use of antipsychotics for the treatment of amphetamine psychosis is sparse due to possible side effects. Some arguments disfavor their use, stating that the psychotic episode is self-limited. Without treatment, some individuals may not fully recover from the psychosis and may develop full-blown psychosis, emotional, and cognitive disturbance. This review aims to investigate the clinical benefits and risks of antipsychotics for the treatment of amphetamine psychosis.
   Methods: Electronic search on trials on antipsychotic drugs for amphetamine psychosis from their inception to November 2018 was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost, ProQuest, Cochrane Review Database, Medline Ovid, and EMBASE following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool assessed the risk of bias, the methodological quality of individual trials was assessed by the Oxford Quality Scoring System, and the quality of evidence for recommendations was judged by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE). The results were synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively.
   Results: The investigation of six randomized controlled trials of 314 participants showed that aripiprazole, haloperidol, quetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone were able to reduce or control the psychotic episode (positive and negative symptoms) induced by amphetamine use with no adverse event. Although the side-effect profile of these agents varied, no drug was clinically superior to others.
   Conclusions: This review suggests that antipsychotics seem to be efficacious for amphetamine psychosis on both positive and negative symptoms. Practitioners need to tailor their use based on risks for side effects individually.

AB  - BackgroundMore than 40% of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa are unaware of their HIV status. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is a novel approach with a potential to increase uptake of HIV testing and linkage to care for people who test HIV positive. We explored HIV stakeholder's perceptions about factors that enable or deter the uptake of HIV self-testing and experiences of self-testing of adult users in Africa.MethodsThis systematic review of qualitative evidence included articles on qualitative studies published or made available between January 1998 to February 2018 on perspectives of key stakeholders, including HIV policymakers, HIV experts, health care providers, and adult men and women (18years and above) about factors that enable or deter the uptake of HIV self-testing and experiences of self-testing among adult users.We searched CINAHL, MEDLINE in Pubmed, EMBASE, AJOL, PsycINFO, Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), and Web of Science for articles in English on HIVST with qualitative data from different African countries.ResultsIn total, 258 papers were retrieved, and only nine (9) studies conducted in 5 African countries were eligible and included in this synthesis.Perceived facilitators of the uptake of HIVST were autonomy and self-empowerment, privacy, confidentiality, convenience, opportunity to test, including couples HIV testing, and ease of use. The perceived barriers included the cost of buying self-test kits, perceived unreliability of test results, low literacy, fear and anxiety of a positive test result, and potential psychological and social harms. HIV stakeholder's concerns about HIVST included human right issues, lack of linkage to care, lack of face-to-face counseling, lack of regulatory and quality assurance systems, and quality of self-test kits. Actual HIVST users expressed preference of oral-fluid self-testing because of ease of use, and that it is less invasive and painless compared to finger-stick/whole blood-based HIV tests. Lack of clear instructions on how to use self-test kits, and existing different products of HIVST increases rates of user errors.ConclusionsOvercoming factors that may deter HIV testing, and HIVST, in particular, is complex and challenging, but it has important implications for HIV stakeholders, HIVST users, and public health in general. Research is warranted to explore the actual practices related to HIVST among different populations in Africa.

AB  - Objectives: The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) was adopted at the United Nations Assembly in 2006. The main aim of the convention is to ensure equal rights for people with disabilities including the expression of people?s own ?will and preferences? concerning health treatment. Article 12 demands the respect of a person?s ?rights, will and preferences? (CRPD) and suggests supported decision making (SDM) when possible. The aim of this review was to gather information regarding the SDM implementation from a clinical perspective for people with mental health disorders. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed on electronic databases MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, and PsycINFO using the keywords ?supported decision making? and ?UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities? in March 2018. Results: Eleven articles were included in the final review, which focussed on three themes: (1) different models of SDM, (2) stakeholder views, and (3) challenges for implementation. A limited number of papers described clinical models that had good theoretical consistency with SDM. The main challenges of implementation related to critical situations when ?will and preferences? are poorly understood or appear contradictory. Future studies should assess specific models of SDM implementation, including related outcomes and process measures.

AB  - Background: Links between eating disorders (EDs) [e.g., anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED)] and the major neurodevelopmental disorders of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been repeatedly highlighted. In both ASD and ADHD, these links range from an elevated risk for EDs to common symptomatic overlaps and etiological commonalities with EDs.
   Methods: We performed a systematic literature search (through July 2019) with Medline via Ovid for epidemiological data on EDs (AN, BN, and BED) in combination with both ASD and ADHD.
   Results: The reviewed studies showed that, on average, 4.7% of patients with certain ED diagnoses (AN, BN, or BED) received an ASD diagnosis. Reliable data on the prevalence of EDs in ASD samples are still scarce. Comorbid ASD is most commonly diagnosed in patients with AN. The prevalence of ADHD in EDs ranged between 1.6% and 18%. Comorbid ADHD was more often reported in the AN-binge eating/purging subtype and BN than in the AN restrictive subtype. The prevalence of EDs in ADHD ranged between no association and a lifetime prevalence of 21.8% of developing an ED in women with ADHD.
   Conclusions: Studies on the prevalence rates of EDs in ADHD and ASD and vice versa are heterogeneous, but they indicate frequent association. While there is growing evidence of clinical overlaps between the three disorders, it remains difficult to determine whether overlapping characteristics (e.g., social withdrawal) are due to common comorbidities (e.g., depression) or are instead primarily associated with EDs and neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, prospective studies are required to better understand how these disorders are related and whether ADHD and ASD could be either specific or nonspecific predisposing factors for the development of EDs.

AB  - Psychotic disorders have long been known to be a condition that peaks during adolescence and early adulthood. A considerable proportion of patients have their first onset at or after the age of 40, but little is known about this population. The current systematic review examined the clinical presentation of late-onset psychosis (LOP) and very-late-onset-schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) with focus on their psychopathological, neuropsychological, neurobiological, psychosocial and psychological correlates. A systematic search of studies published from 2000 to 2019 from Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus yielded 27 original studies that were included in this review. Results revealed there is a dearth of empirical research on the conditions in the current literature and inconsistencies in the findings reported may be associated with the lack of uniformity in the definitions for LOP and VLOSLP. Future research on the topic shall (i) specify the onset age criteria for LOP and VLOSLP; (ii) study the conditions independently; (iii) involve a larger sample size, and iv) account for potential confounding variables. A comprehensive evaluation of the risks and benefits of pharmacological treatment may also be needed.

AB  - Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is biochemically and genetically linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. It is now widely accepted that alpha-syn can be released in the extracellular space, even though the mechanism of its release is still unclear. In addition, pathology-related aggregated species of alpha-syn have been shown to propagate between neurons in synaptically connected areas of the brain thereby assisting the spreading of pathology in healthy neighboring neuronal cells. In neurons, calcium channels are key signaling elements that modulate the release of bioactive molecules (hormones, proteins, and neurotransmitters) through calcium sensing. Such calcium sensing activity is determined by the distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties and the ability of calcium channels to interact with other modulatory proteins. Although the function of extracellular alpha-syn is currently unknown, previous work suggested the presence of a calcium-dependent mechanism for alpha-syn secretion both in vitro, in neuronal cells in culture, and also in vivo, in the context of a trans-neuronal network in brain. Mechanisms regulating extracellular alpha-syn levels may be of particular importance as they could represent novel therapeutic targets. We discuss here how calcium channel activity may contribute to alpha-syn aggregation and secretion as a pathway to disease progression in synucleinopathies.

AB  - Background: Although empathy has always been considered to be impaired in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASCs), the relevant findings have been inconsistent. The present meta-analysis aims to determine which empathy components are impaired and how culture, gender, and age moderate such empathy impairment.
   Methods: By using "Autism," "Asperger Syndrome," "Empathy," and related Chinese synonyms as keywords, we searched the databases of Weipu, Wanfang, CNKI, Web of Science, Science Direct, SpringerLink, and Elsevier through "subject" and "keyword" searches. We also conducted a manual search according to the references. In total, 51 studies from Eastern and Western countries were included in this meta-analysis, which comprised 144 independent effects, 2,095 individuals with ASCs and 2,869 controls without ASCs. For the retrieved data, Hedge's g was taken as the quantitative measure of effect, and CMA V2.0 software was used for publication bias tests (by using Rosenthal's Classic Failsafe-N and Egger's methods), heterogeneity tests (by using a Q-test, I-2-test, and H-test) and a moderating effect test (by using a univariate regression model).
   Results: The results showed that the empathy impairment evident in individuals with ASCs is component specific; that is, trait-cognitive empathy, trait-empathic concern, state-cognitive empathy, and state-empathic concern are impaired, whereas state-empathic accuracy remains intact, and trait-empathic accuracy is superior to the trait-empathic accuracy in neurotypical individuals. The univariate regression model showed that gender moderates the impairment of the trait-empathic concern, trait-empathic accuracy, and state-cognitive empathy in autistic individuals and that age moderates the impairment of the trait-cognitive empathy, trait-empathic accuracy, state-empathic concern, and state-empathic accuracy in autistic individuals. However, culture does not moderate any empathy components (trait-cognitive empathy, trait-empathic concern, or state-cognitive empathy) involved in the present meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: These findings contribute to ending the controversy over the empathic integrity of individuals with ASCs and shed some light on future research about the empathy impairment of autistic individuals. More specifically, subsequent studies should distinguish specific empathy components and consider the role of gender and age when demonstrating empathy impairment in individuals with ASCs. Moreover, related studies based on Asian collectivist cultural samples and female samples should be further enriched.

AB  - Brain activity fluctuates continuously, even in the absence of changes in sensory input or motor output. These intrinsic activity fluctuations are correlated across brain regions and are spatially organized in macroscale networks. Variations in the strength, topography, and topology of correlated activity occur over time, and unfold upon a backbone of longrange anatomical connections. Subcortical neuromodulatory systems send widespread ascending projections to the cortex, and are thus ideally situated to shape the temporal and spatial structure of intrinsic correlations. These systems are also the targets of the pharmacological treatment of major neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, depression, and schizophrenia. Here, we review recent work that has investigated how neuromodulatory systems shape correlations of intrinsic fluctuations of large-scale cortical activity. We discuss studies in the human, monkey, and rodent brain, with a focus on non-invasive recordings of human brain activity. We provide a structured but selective overview of this work and distil a number of emerging principles. Future efforts to chart the effect of specific neuromodulators and, in particular, specific receptors, on intrinsic correlations may help identify shared or antagonistic principles between different neuromodulatory systems. Such principles can inform models of healthy brain function and may provide an important reference for understanding altered cortical dynamics that are evident in neurological and psychiatric disorders, potentially paving the way for mechanistically inspired biomarkers and individualized treatments of these disorders.

TI  - Curation of Mental Health Recovery Narrative Collections: Systematic Review and Qualitative Synthesis
KW  - mental health recovery
KW  - narrative medicine
KW  - culturally appropriate technology
KW  - INTERNET
KW  - STIGMA
AB  - Background: Mental health recovery narratives are first-person lived experience accounts of recovery from mental health problems, which refer to events or actions over a period. They are readily available either individually or in collections of recovery narratives published in books, health service booklets, or on the Web. Collections of recovery narratives have been used in a range of mental health interventions, and organizations or individuals who curate collections can therefore influence how mental health problems are seen and understood. No systematic review has been conducted of research into curatorial decision making.
   Objective: This study aimed to produce a conceptual framework identifying and categorizing decisions made in the curation of mental health recovery narrative collections.
   Methods: A conceptual framework was produced through a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis. Research articles were identified through searching bibliographic databases (n=13), indexes of specific journals (n=3), and gray literature repositories (n=4). Informal documents presenting knowledge about curation were identified from editorial chapters of electronically available books (n=50), public documents provided by Web-based collections (n=50), and prefaces of health service booklets identified through expert consultation (n=3). Narrative summaries of included research articles were produced. A qualitative evidence synthesis was conducted on all included documents through an inductive thematic analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify differences in curatorial concerns between Web-based and printed collections.
   Results: A total of 5410 documents were screened, and 23 documents were included. These comprised 1 research publication and 22 informal documents. Moreover, 9 higher level themes were identified, which considered: the intended purpose and audience of the collection; how to support safety of narrators, recipients, and third parties; the processes of collecting, selecting, organizing, and presenting recovery narratives; ethical and legal issues around collections; and the societal positioning of the collection. Web-based collections placed more emphasis on providing benefits for narrators and providing safety for recipients. Printed collections placed more emphasis on the ordering of narrative within printed material and the political context.
   Conclusions: Only 1 research article was identified despite extensive searches, and hence this review has revealed a lack of peer-reviewed empirical research regarding the curation of recovery narrative collections. The conceptual framework can be used as a preliminary version of reporting guidelines for use when reporting on health care interventions that make use of narrative collections. It provides a theory base to inform the development of new narrative collections for use in complex mental health interventions. Collections can serve as a mechanism for supporting collective rather than individual discourses around mental health.

AB  - Purpose: To define the actions of boron on normal neurophysiology and glioblastoma growth. Materials and Methods: PubMed and other relevant databases were searched. Results: Discovery of novel boron compounds in treatment of glioblastoma is being actively investigated, but the majority of such studies is focused on the synthesis of boron compounds as sensitizers to Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). Nonetheless, the translational functionality of boron compounds is not limited to BNCT as many boron compounds possess direct tumoricidal activity and there is substantial evidence that certain boron compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, boron-containing compounds interfere with several tumorigenic pathways including intratumoral IGF-I levels, molybdenum Fe-S containing flavin hydroxylases, glycolysis, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) and Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) channels. Conclusions: Boron compounds deserve to be studied further in treatment of systemic cancers and glioblastoma due to their versatile antineoplastic functions.

AB  - Self-injurious behaviors (SIB) continue to afflict a significant segment of the clinical and general population, sometimes with fatal consequences. The development of SIB seems to share developmental pathways and mechanisms similar to attachment insecurity. To date, no reviews have explored their relationship. A search of publication databases PubMed and PsychInfo from 1969 through April 2018 was conducted and 17 papers met inclusion criteria. Of the 17 articles identified, 13 reported a positive relationship and 1 reported a negative relationship between attachment insecurity and SIB. Both attachment anxiety and avoidance seem to play a role in the risk for SIB, possibly through different mechanisms and likely with different impacts on the choice for either self-harm or suicide attempts.

AB  - Four databases were searched to identify studies published by Arab researchers on parents' perceptions of autism spectrum disorder and studies conducted by US researchers and published in systematic reviews of this topic. The electronic search resulted in 14 studies published by Arab researchers and 55 studies published by US researchers. The results showed that autism spectrum disorder has many of the same effects on Arab and American families. Six major areas were identified in the results. Financial difficulties associated with raising children with autism spectrum disorder were mentioned more in Arab studies than in US studies. Arab studies had more emphasis on gender than US studies. The results related to quality of life of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder in Arab studies were equivocal. US studies included comparisons with families without a child with autism spectrum disorder, and addressed factors that were associated with quality of life indicators. More health, educational, and social services were available in United States than in Arab countries, but some frustration was reported by US parents in obtaining appropriate services in some studies. A higher percentage of Arab studies mentioned the role of religious faith than US studies. Finally, social stigma was evidenced in both cultures, but not much research was available.

AB  - Background/Objectives: There continues to be a debate on whether Substance Addiction (SA) is best understood as a brain disease or a moral condition. We aim to review the current evidence about substance use disorder and to answer two questions: "should Substance Addiction be conceptualized as a medical disorder, a morality flaw or an intermediate construct?" and "can individuals with substance use disorders be held responsible for their behaviour and, if so, to what extent?".
   Methods: Systematic review of scientific literature (search of scientific articles in PubMed/MEDLINE database and use of a psychiatry textbook) related with SA and its relationship to free will.
   Results: Besides the psychiatry textbook, 38 studies met the inclusion criteria. Much of the scientific knowledge related with SA is in its early stages. Several risk factors were found to influence SA's development. SA's neurobiology includes several brain circuits and neurotransmitters. Drug consumption involves a series of voluntary acts; howbeit, its development is associated with enduring changes in brain function related to automatized behaviour. SA can be a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
   Conclusions: Significant scientific evidence has been found not to consider SA as a simple morality flaw. Exclusively defining it as a medical diagnosis may be too short for its complexity, as a search for a broader multi-faceted perspective may be warranted. These individual's willpower and self-determination is not entirely preserved nor totally disrupted, and their accountability is a complex and not clear matter. Additional research is needed to further characterize SA and its mechanisms. (c) 2019 Asociacion Universitaria de Zaragoza para el Progreso de la Psiquiatria y la Salud Mental.

AB  - To date, medical and surgical interventions offered to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) serve only to manage clinical symptoms; they have not shown the capacity to halt nor reverse degenerative processes. There is therefore an urgent need to identify and/or develop therapeutic strategies that will demonstrate 'disease modifying' capacities. The molecule cystamine, and its reduced form cysteamine, act via a number of pathways determined to be critical to the pathogenesis of PD. In particular, cystamine is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, and both agents (cystamine and cysteamine) can promote the secretion of neurotrophic factors, inhibit oxidative stress, reduce inflammatory responses and importantly, have already been trialed in humans for a number of other clinical indications. In the last decade, our laboratory has accumulated compelling evidence that both cystamine and cysteamine can halt, and even reverse, ongoing neurodegenerative processes in a number of different models of PD, and as such, should now be taken forward to clinical trials in PD.

AB  - Although there is a long history of studying the influence of pubertal hormones on brain function/structure in animals, this research in human adolescents is young but burgeoning. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of findings from neuroimaging studies investigating the relation between pubertal and functional brain development in humans. We quantified the findings from this literature in which statistics required for standard meta-analyses are often not provided (i.e., effect size in fMRI studies). To do so, we assessed convergence in findings within content domains (reward, facial emotion, social information, cognitive processing) in terms of the locus and directionality (i.e., positive/negative) of effects. Face processing is the only domain with convergence in the locus of effects in the amygdala. Social information processing is the only domain with convergence of positive effects; however, these effects are not consistently present in any brain region. There is no convergence of effects in either the reward or cognitive processing domains. This limited convergence in findings across domains is not the result of null findings or even due to the variety of experimental paradigms researchers employ. Instead, there are critical theoretical, methodological, and analytical issues that must be addressed in order to move the field forward.

AB  - Aims. To examine the quality of life (QOL) of parents of children with a specific mental disorder (any age).
   Methods. Relevant articles were searched using different databases. Articles were included that compared the QOL of parents with mentally-ill children to parents of healthy controls or norm values or provided the required data for this comparison. A meta-analysis was conducted to obtain an overall mean effect size estimate. Additional analyses were performed to assess publication bias and moderation.
   Results. Twenty-six out of 10 548 articles met the pre-defined inclusion criteria. Most of these studies focused on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or autism spectrum disorder, used clinical samples that mainly included males and young children and studied the QOL of mothers. The meta-analysis revealed that parents of mentally-ill children are experiencing a clinically relevant reduction in their QOL relative to parents of healthy children and norm values (g = -0.66).
   Conclusions. The compromised QOL of parents of mentally-ill children needs to be considered and addressed by health professionals who are in contact with them. The paper provides insights into existing research gaps and suggests improvements for subsequent work.

AB  - Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, twisting movements, and abnormal postures that may affect one or multiple body regions. Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. Despite its relative frequency, small molecule therapeutics for dystonia are limited. Development of new therapeutics is further hampered by the heterogeneity of both clinical symptoms and etiologies in dystonia. Recent advances in both animal and cell-based models have helped clarify divergent etiologies in dystonia and have facilitated the identification of new therapeutic targets. Advances in medicinal chemistry have also made available novel compounds for testing in biochemical, physiological, and behavioral models of dystonia. Here, we briefly review motor circuit anatomy and the anatomical and functional abnormalities in dystonia. We then discuss recently identified therapeutic targets in dystonia based on recent preclinical animal studies and clinical trials investigating novel therapeutics.

AB  - As the worldwide popularity of animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) increases, the field is quickly approaching a paradigm shift, adjusting its image to incorporate more evidence-based research and aligning its purpose for advancing a new future. Contemporary critical issues that confront the field today include, but are not limited, to research, animal welfare, practice guidelines, and public policy. This article will provide an overview of the history of AAI and the major milestones that the field has undergone. The current state of AAI research will be scrutinized, and the areas that warrant further study will be recommended. Special attention will be given to the current state of animal welfare in AAI, the research that has been done in the area, and practice guidelines that safeguard animal wellbeing. This article will then discuss how evidence-based research and animal welfare guidelines inform the development of comprehensive professional standards and influence changes in public policy regarding AAI. The authors' perceptions for the field's future trajectory will be presented, which will include solutions to move the field in the direction that best advances the human-animal bond in research, practice, and public perception.

AB  - Objective: Seclusion and mechanical restraint are coercive interventions used at psychiatric hospitals when patients are at imminent risk of harming themselves and/or others. Although these interventions have been used for decades, it remains unclear whether seclusion or mechanical restraint is superior in terms of efficacy and safety. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review studies comparing the intended and unintended effects of seclusion and mechanical restraint. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed and Embase was conducted in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. Quantitative studies comparing the intended and unintended effects of seclusion and mechanical restraint were included. Results: The search identified 868 unique records. Fourteen of these (3 reporting on randomized controlled trials and 11 reporting on observational studies) met the predefined inclusion criteria. The study methodology including outcome measures varied significantly across studies. The results of the 11 studies using a subjective outcome measure (patient preference/emotions) were in favour of seclusion, while the 3 studies using an objective outcome measure (duration of coercion/need for transition to other coercive measure) favoured mechanical restraint. There was a high risk of residual confounding by indication and/or bias affecting the reported results. Conclusion: Based on the available literature, it cannot be determined whether seclusion is superior to mechanical restraint or vice versa. Further studies using stringent methodology are required to answer this question. A cautious conclusion based on this review is that the availability of both methods seems necessary - as both have their pros and cons.

AB  - Aims and method The concept of personal resilience is relevant to physician well-being, recruitment and retention, and to delivering compassionate patient care. This systematic review aims to explore factors affecting personal resilience among psychiatrists, in particular, those that may impair well-being and those that facilitate resilience practice. A literature search was performed of the Ovid (R), Embase (R), CINAHL and PsycINFO databases, using keywords to identify empirical studies involving psychiatrists that examined resilience, stress and burnout from the past 15 years.
   Results Thirty-three international English language studies were included, showing that a combination of workplace, personal and non-workplace factors negatively and positively influenced well-being and resilience.
   Clinical implications Given that workplace factors were the most commonly cited, it would appear that any resilience package that predominantly targets interventions at the workplace level would be particularly fruitful. Future research, however, needs to address the absence of a universal measurement of well-being and its moderators so that any potential interventions are better evaluated.

AB  - Technology-based self-help treatment programs for OCD have the potential to offer low to no cost treatment to those who may not have access to OCD treatment providers, to compliment on-going therapy and to assist individuals in maintaining treatment gains. To date, the quality of these programs is largely unassessed. This review examines the currently available technology-based self-help treatment programs for OCD. Search results from Google.com, the Apple App Store, and the Google Play Store were reviewed, with 15 programs included in the final review. Research support for the programs was generally nonexistent or very limited. Seven of the programs were deemed empirically-based, despite little to no research support, due to incorporating quality psychoeducation and exposure and response prevention (ERP) elements. The unique strengths of each of these programs are reviewed. The eight non-empirically-based programs varied in quality and function, but many included potentially useful components. Directions and considerations for future tech-based treatment programs are discussed.

AB  - Scientific progress in understanding human disease can be measured by the effectiveness of its treatment. Anti psychotic drugs have been proven to alleviate acute psychotic symptoms and prevent their recurrence in schizophrenia, but the outcomes of most patients historically have been suboptimal. However, a series of findings in studies of first-episode schizophrenia patients transformed the psychiatric field's thinking about the pathophysiology, course, and potential for disease-modifying effects of treatment. These include the relationship between the duration of untreated psychotic symptoms and outcome; the superior responses of first-episode patients to antipsychotics compared with patients with chronic illness, and the reduction in brain gray matter volume over the course of the illness. Studies of the effectiveness of early detection and intervention models of care have provided encouraging but inconclusive results in limiting the morbidity and modifying the course of illness. Nevertheless, first-episode psychosis studies have established an evidentiary basis for considering a team-based, coordinated specialty approach as the standard of care for treating early psychosis, which has led to their global proliferation. In contrast, while clinical high-risk research has developed an evidence-based care model for decreasing the burden of attenuated symptoms, no treatment has been shown to reduce risk or prevent the transition to syndromal psychosis. Moreover, the current diagnostic criteria for clinical high risk lack adequate specificity for clinical application. What limits our ability to realize the potential of early detection and intervention models of care are the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic criteria for pre-syndromal schizophrenia, validated biomarkers, and proven therapeutic strategies. Future research requires methodologically rigorous studies in large patient samples, across multiple sites, that ideally are guided by scientifically credible pathophysiological theories for which there is compelling evidence. These caveats notwithstanding, we can reasonably expect future studies to build on the research of the past four decades to advance our knowledge and enable this game-changing model of care to become a reality.

AB  - Background: With the emergence of electronic products, smartphones have become an indispensable tool in our daily life. On the other hand, smartphone addiction has become a public health issue. To help reduce smartphone addiction, cost-effective interventions such as exercise are encouraged. Purpose: We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating existing literature on the rehabilitative effects of exercise interventions for individuals with a smartphone addiction. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CNKI, and Wanfang from inception to September 2019. Nine eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT) were finally included for meta-analysis (SMD represents the magnitude of effect of exercise) and their methodological quality were assessed using the PEDro scale. Results: We found significant positive effects of exercise interventions (Taichi, basketball, badminton, dance, run, and bicycle) on reducing the total score (SMD = -1.30, 95% CI -1.53 to -1.07, p < 0.005, I-2 = 62%) of smartphone addiction level and its four subscales (withdrawal symptom: SMD = -1.40, 95% CI -1.73 to -1.07, p < 0.001, I-2 = 81%; highlight behavior: SMD = -1.95, 95% CI -2.99 to -1.66, p < 0.001, I-2 = 79%; social comfort: SMD = -0.99, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.81, p = 0.27, I-2 = 21%; mood change: SMD = -0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.69, p = 0.25, I-2 = 25%). Furthermore, we found that individuals with severe addiction level (SMD = -1.19, I-2 = 0%, 95%CI:-1.19 to -0.98) benefited more from exercise engagement, as compared to those with mild to moderate addiction levels (SMD = - 0.98, I-2 = 50%, 95%CI:-1.31 to -0.66); individuals with smartphone addiction who participated in exercise programs of 12 weeks and above showed significantly greater reduction on the total score (SMD = -1.70, I-2 = 31.2%, 95% CI -2.04 to -1.36, p = 0.03), as compared to those who participated in less than 12 weeks of exercise intervention (SMD = -1.18, I-2 = 0%, 95% CI-1.35 to -1.02, p < 0.00001). In addition, individuals with smartphone addiction who participated in exercise of closed motor skills showed significantly greater reduction on the total score (SMD = -1.22, I-2 = 0 %, 95% CI -1.41 to -1.02, p = 0.56), as compared to those who participated in exercise of open motor skills (SMD = -1.17, I-2 = 44%, 95% CI-1.47 to -0.0.87, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Exercise interventions may have positive effects on treating smartphone addiction and longer intervention durations may produce greater intervention effects.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that is naturally found in the environment and is necessary as a cofactor for many enzymes and is important in several physiological processes that support development, growth, and neuronal function. However, overexposure to Mn may induce neurotoxicity and may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The present review aims to provide new insights into the involvement of Mn in the etiology of AD and PD. Here, we discuss the critical role of Mn in the etiology of these disorders and provide a summary of the proposed mechanisms underlying Mn-induced neurodegeneration. In addition, we review some new therapy options for AD and PD related to Mn overload.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, are common in children and adolescents, but treatment strategies remain limited. Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been studied for neurodevelopmental disorders, there is no clear consensus on its therapeutic effects. This systematic review examined literature on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders published up to 2018 using the PubMed database. The search identified 264 articles and 14 articles met eligibility criteria. Twelve of these studies used conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and two studies used theta burst stimulation. No severe adverse effects were reported in these studies. In patients with autism spectrum disorder, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and intermittent theta burst stimulation applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have therapeutic effects on social functioning and repetitive behaviors. In patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may target inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. In patients with tic disorders, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the bilateral supplementary motor area improved tic symptom severity. This systematic review suggests that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be a promising intervention for children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders. The results warrant further large randomized controlled trials of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Recent meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing clozapine with nonclozapine second-generation antipsychotics (NC-SGAs) in schizophrenia have challenged clozapine's superiority in treatment-resistant patients. However, patients in RCTs are not necessarily generalizable to those in clinical practice.
   OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare various outcomes of clozapine vs oral NC-SGAs in cohort studies.
   DATA SOURCES Systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL without language restriction from database inception until December 17, 2018.
   STUDY SELECTION Nonrandomized cohort studies reporting effectiveness and/or safety outcomes comparing clozapine with NC-SGAs in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent investigators assessed studies and extracted data. Using a random-effects model, the study calculated risk ratio (RR) unadjusted for covariates and follow-up duration, number needed to treat/number needed to harm (NNT/NNH) for dichotomous data, and standardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) for continuous data.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coprimary outcomes were hospitalization and all-cause discontinuation. Secondary outcomes included all effectiveness and safety outcomes reported in at least 3 analyzable studies.
   RESULTS Of 8446 hits, 68 articles from 63 individual cohort studies (n = 109341) (60.3% male; mean [SD] age of 38.8 [6.5] years, illness duration of 11.0 [5.1] years, and study duration of 19.1 [23.3] months) were meta-analyzed. Compared with NC-SGAs, despite greater illness severity (17 studies [n = 38766]; Hedges g, 0.222; 95% CI, 0.013-0.430; P = .04), clozapine was significantly associated with lower hospitalization risk (19 studies [n = 49453]; RR, 0.817; 95% CI, 0.725-0.920; P = .001; NNT, 18; 95% CI, 12-40) and all-cause discontinuation (16 studies [n = 56368]; RR, 0.732; 95% CI, 0.639-0.838; P < .001; NNT, 8; 95% CI, 6-12). Associations were statistically significant for comparisons with quetiapine fumarate and aripiprazole regarding hospitalization and all NC-SGAs, except aripiprazole, for all-cause discontinuation. Clozapine was also significantly associated with better outcomes regarding overall symptoms (SMD, -0.302; 95% CI, -0.572 to -0.032; P = .03) and Clinical Global Impressions scale severity (SMD, -1.182; 95% CI, -2.243 to -0.122; P = .03). Clozapine was significantly associated with increases in body weight (MD, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.31-3.08 kg; P = .02), body mass index (MD, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.24-1.68; P = .009), and type 2 diabetes (RR, 1.777; 95% CI, 1.229-2.570; P = .002; NNH, 27; 95% CI, 13-90).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In cohort studies, despite more severely ill patients being treated with clozapine, use of clozapine was associated with better key efficacy outcomes and higher cardiometabolic-related risk outcomes vs NC-SGAs.

AB  - Delay discounting (DD) is the process of devaluing results that happen in the future. With this review, we intend to identify specificities in the processes of DD in impulsive behavior. Studies were retrieved from multiple literature databases, through rigorous criteria (we included systematic reviews and empirical studies with adult human subjects), following the procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration initiative. Of the 174 documents obtained, 19 were considered eligible for inclusion and were retained for in-depth analysis. In addition, 13 studies from the manual search were included. Thus, a total of 32 studies were selected for review. The objectives/hypotheses, results, and the main conclusion(s) were extracted from each study. Results show that people with pronounced traits of impulsivity discount rewards more markedly, that is, they prefer immediate rewards, though of less value, or postponed losses, even though they worsen in the future. Taken together, the existing data suggest the importance of inserting DD as a tool for initial assessment in conjunction with measures of addiction and stress level, as well as the consideration of new therapies.

AB  - Social participation plays a key role in the integration of refugees and asylum seekers into their host societies, and is also closely tied to the mental health of those populations. The aim of this scoping review was to study how the concept of social participation is described in empirical research, and how it is associated with mental health outcomes. Methods: In total, 64 studies were identified through searches in PubMed, PsycInfo, and Sociological Abstracts. These studies describe various forms of social participation among refugees and asylum seekers, and 33 of them also addressed various forms of mental health outcomes. Results: The identified studies described forms and conditions of social participation-both in the host country and transnationally-that could be synthesized into three broad dimensions: (1) Regulatory frameworks, conditions and initiatives; (2) Established societal organizations and social structures; and (3) Community organized groups. Each of these consisted of several sub-domains. The identified dimensions of social participation were also associated with psychosocial well-being and decreased psychological distress. Conclusions: There is a need for policies to enable and support the participation of refugees and asylum seekers in various dimensions of social structures in host societies. Social participation enhances resilience, re-establishes social lives, and acts as a protective factor against poor mental health outcomes.

AB  - Objective Using an integrative view of psychology, neuroscience, immunology, and psychophysiology, the present review of literature curates the findings that have had an impact on the field of bereavement research and shaped its development. Methods Beginning with pivotal systematic descriptions of medical and psychological responses to the death of a loved one by Lindemann in the mid-1940s, this selective review integrates findings in bereavement research from studies that investigate medical outcomes after loss, their psychological predictors, and biopsychosocial mechanisms. Results Morbidity and mortality after the death of a loved one have long been a topic of research. Early researchers characterized somatic and psychological symptoms and studied immune cell changes in bereaved samples. More recent research has repeatedly demonstrated increased rates of morbidity and mortality in bereaved samples, as compared with married controls, in large epidemiological studies. Recent developments also include the development of criteria for prolonged grief disorder (also termed complicated grief). Newer methods, including neuroimaging, have observed that the greatest impact of the death of a loved one is in those who have the most severe psychological grief reactions. Research addressing the mechanisms tying bereavement to medical outcomes is relatively scarce, but differences in rumination, in inflammation, and in cortisol dysregulation between those who adapt well and those who do not have been offered with some evidence. Conclusions Recommendations to propel the field forward include longitudinal studies to understand differences between acute reactions and later adaptation, comparing samples with grief disorders from those with more typical responses, and integrating responses in brain, mind, and body.

AB  - Work environment factors are highly correlated with employees' health and well-being. Our aim was to sum up current evidence of health promotion interventions in the workplace, focusing on interventions for the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders, psychological and behavioral disorders as well as interventions for older employees and economic evaluations. We conducted a comprehensive literature search including systematic reviews published from April 2012 to October 2017 in electronic databases and search engines, websites of relevant organizations and institutions. It consisted of simple and specific terms and word combinations related to workplace health promotion based on the search strategy of a previous review. After full-text screening, 74 references met the eligibility criteria. Using the same search strategy, there was a higher proportion of relevant high-quality studies as compared with the earlier review. The heterogeneity of health promotion interventions regarding intervention components, settings and study populations still limits the comparability of studies. Future studies should also address the societal and insurer perspective, including costs to the worker such as lost income and lost time at work of family members due to caregiving activities. To this end, more high-quality evidence is needed.

AB  - Mercury is an important pollutant, released into aquatic ecosystems both naturally and by anthropogenic action. This element is transferred to aquatic organisms in different ways, causing potential health risks. In addition, mercury can be accumulated by humans, especially through the consumption of contaminated food. This systematic review aims to present mercury pathways, the major routes through which this element reaches the aquatic environment and its transformations until becoming available to living animals, leading to bioaccumulation and biomagnification phenomena. The key biotic and abiotic factors affecting such processes, the impact of mercury on animal and human health and the issue of seafood consumption as a source of chronic mercury contamination are also addressed. A total of 101 articles were retrieved from a standardized search on three databases (PubMed, Emabse, and Web of Science), in addition to 28 other studies not found on these databases but considered fundamental to this review (totaling 129 articles). Both biotic and abiotic factors display fundamental importance in mediating mercurial dynamics, i.e., muscle tropism, and salinity, respectively. Consequently, mercurial contamination in aquatic environments affects animal health, especially the risk of extinction species and also on human health, with methylmercury the main mercury species responsible for acute and chronic symptomatology.

Acute exposure to air pollution is linked to severe adverse cardiovascular events, including venous thromboembolism risk. The adverse health effects seem to arise from blood-borne metals and transition metal components from exposure to particulate matter that, when breathed, passes through the lungs into the heart and the blood stream. Pollution affects health via mechanisms including oxidative stress and inflammation, and metals may have a detrimental effect on both the blood cells, particularly platelets, and circulation. Some evidences demonstrates atherotrombotic consequences of acute and chronic exposure to air pollution, but few studies have examined exposure effects on the prothrombotic biomarkers leading to venous thromboembolism. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, we performed a systematic review (14 papers) of the past twelve years, focusing on the relationship between inhalable airborne metal exposures and coagulative biomarker disorders leading to lower limb venous thromboembolisms, e.g., deep vein thrombosis. Results support the hypothesis that exposure to inhalable metals, as elemental compounds in particulate matter, cause changes or activation of a number of human prothrombotic hemostatic biomarkers.

AB  - Background Substantial evidence suggests that cognitive deficits might persist after remission of a major depressive episode. However, results are inconsistent relative to the importance, pattern, severity, and moderating factors of this impairment. We aimed to determine how cognitive function following a major depressive episode compares with normal function, to specify the pattern and severity of persistent cognitive dysfunctions, and to examine the potential moderator effect of ten prespecified clinical and demographic variables.
   Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published research. We searched systematically MEDLINE, Embase, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and relevant reviews identified by our database search, for research published from Jan 1, 1972, up to Jan 31, 2018, for studies of patients with past depression. We included all independent studies of patients who were assessed while in remission from a major depressive episode with at least one cognitive test, with inclusion of a healthy control group assessed with either the same test(s) as the major depressive episode group or with a standardised test with published age-stratified normative data. The main outcome was the difference in cognitive performance between major depressive episode remitters and healthy controls. Effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models for cognitive outcomes classified into 18 standard domains. Moderators of between-study variability were assessed using mixed-effects subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.
   Findings Of 10126 citations identified by our search, 75 cognitive variables from 252 eligible studies (11882 major depressive episode remitters and 8533 healthy controls) were included in our meta-analysis. Significant deficits following major depressive episode remission were observed in 55 (73%) of the 75 cognitive variables. These deficits (in the domains of processing speed, visual selective attention, working memory, verbal learning, and executive functioning), were generally small (30 [40%] of the 75 variables) or medium (22 [29%]) in size, although three long-term memory variables showed large deficits: g=-0.81 [95% CI -1.01 to -0.61] for logical memory immediate recall, g=-0.88 [-1.19 to -0.57] for logical memory delayed recall, and g=-0.84 [-1.18 to -0.50] for Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery pattern recognition latency. Auditory attention, general autobiographical memory, inhibition ability unconstrained by speed, and intellectual functioning unconstrained by speed were equivalent between major depressive episode remitters and matched controls. The number of previous depressive episodes explained heterogeneity in the majority of variables (z=-2.06 [p=0.039] to z=-4.26 [p<0.0001]).
   Interpretation Deficits in selective attention, working memory, and long-term memory persist in remission from a major depressive episode and worsen with repeated episodes. Depression treatments, including relapse prevention, need to target these cognitive functions to optimise prognosis. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anger is prevalent in chronic pain and has been associated with pain perception, disability, behavior and treatment outcome. Objectives were (1) to survey in the context of chronic pain the application (and omission) of validated anger self-report instruments, (2) to discuss the instruments found in the context of emotion theories and (3) to identify a possible instrument preference. A systematic search of textbooks and review articles was first performed on validated instruments designed to measure the cognitive, the motivational and the subjective feeling component of anger. Thereafter, a systematic review aimed at finding chronic pain studies from 2005 to 2019 reporting on these instruments. Textbooks and reviews listed 16 validated self-report anger measurement instruments. 28 papers applying four of these were identified and two new instruments were additionally detected. The State-Trait Anger Expression (STAXI) and its precursors were most commonly used. Studies on chronic low back pain patients prevailed. In conclusion, anger in chronic pain patients is reliably measurable at low cost with self-report tools. The STAXI-II qualifies best for this purpose based on its extensive validation history. The majority of instruments lack sufficient theoretical and psychometric adequacy. A more detailed exploration of the cognitive anger component in chronic pain patients in future research is recommended.

AB  - Background: The term "subjective response to antipsychotic" (SRA) refers to changes in the subjective state experienced due to antipsychotic (AP) exposition that is independent of the therapeutic or physical side effects of these drugs. This dimension of analysis has been extensively explored in schizophrenic disorders, finding that negative SRA is an early and independent predictor of compliance as well as a successful pathway to construct current theoretical frameworks of these disorders. There is an increasing use of AP in bipolar disorders' treatment (BD) but no reviews on the topic have been published to date in this population. The aim of this work is to review published data of SRA in BD patients and to discuss their clinical and theoretical implications.
   Methods: An extensive search in online databases was performed. Reports were reviewed and included if they described SRA in BD or included instruments aimed to assess it. Reports of cognitive, sexual, motor autonomic side effects were excluded. Findings were summarized in a narrative fashion.
   Results: Nine reports fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the revision, reporting data from 1282 BD patients. Among these, three were prospective studies and three explored relations between SRA and treatment compliance.
   Conclusions: There is an asymmetry between the increase in the use of antipsychotics in BD and the lack of data regarding the SRA. Phenomenologically, SRA in BD is similar to that found in schizophrenic subjects. Some of these symptoms may be misdiagnosed as depressive symptoms. The existing data show that SRA has a strong correlation with treatment compliance as well as a promising way to develop theoretical paradigms for these disorders. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - The human brain comprises a multiscale network with multiple levels of organization. Neurons with dendritic and axonal connections form the microscale fabric of brain circuitry, and macroscale brain regions and white matter connections form the infrastructure for system-level brain communication and information integration. In this review, we discuss the emerging trend of multiscale neuroscience, the multidisciplinary field that brings together data from these different levels of nervous system organization to form a better understanding of between-scale relationships of brain structure, function, and behavior in health and disease. We provide a broad overview of this developing field and discuss recent findings of exemplary multiscale neuroscience studies that illustrate the importance of studying cross-scale interactions among the genetic, molecular, cellular, and macroscale levels of brain circuitry and connectivity and behavior. We particularly consider a central, overarching goal of these multiscale neuroscience studies of human brain connectivity: to obtain insight into how disease-related alterations at one level of organization may underlie alterations observed at other scales of brain network organization in mental disorders. We conclude by discussing the current limitations, challenges, and future directions of the field.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a systematic review to assess the current evidence available for the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for depression.
   Methods: An electronic search was conducted in eight databases from inception until April 2018. Randomized controlled trials with risk of bias (RoB) score a >= 4 according to the Cochrane RoB tool were included for analyses. The primary outcome was the severity of depression. The secondary outcomes were total effective rate (TER) and adverse events. The minimally important difference (MID) of the severity of depression was a reduction in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 17 items (HAMD-17) scores by 4. RevMan 5.3 Software was used for data analyses. GRADE system was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
   Results: A total of 40 eligible studies with 3549 subjects were identified. Meta-analyses showed that CHM monotherapy had better clinically effects than placebo according to HAMD-17 score (Mean Difference (MD) = -4.53, 95% CI (- 5.69, -3.37), P < 0.00001; Certainty of evidence: Moderate) and TER (Risk Ratio (RR) = 2.15, 95% CI (1.61, 2.88), P < 0.00001, Certainty of evidence: Low). Meta-analyses showed that CHM was as effective as western conventional medications (WCM) in TER (RR = 0.99, 95% CI (0.95, 1.02), P = 0.41, Certainty of evidence: High) and in reducing HAMD-17 score (MD = 0.44, 95% CI (- 0.11, 0.99), P = 0.12, Certainty of evidence: Moderate). Meta-analyses showed that CHM in combination with WCM was better than WCM in TER (RR = 1.16, 95% CI (1.07, 1.27), P = 0.0004, Certainty of evidence: High), while had comparable clinically effects with WCM according to HAMD-17 score (MD = - 2.51, 95% CI (- 3.24, -1.77), P < 0.00001, Certainty of evidence: Moderate). In additional, CHM were associated with less adverse events than WCM, and adding CHM to WCM reduced adverse events.
   Conclusion: The findings of present systematic review, at least to a certain extent, provided supporting evidence for the routine use of CHM for depression.

AB  - Childhood maltreatment is associated with risky sexual behaviors (RSBs). Previous systematic reviews and meta-analysis focused only on the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and RSBs, thus the association between childhood maltreatment and RSBs has yet to be systematically and quantitatively reviewed. We aimed to provide a systematic meta-analysis exploring the effect of childhood maltreatment and its subtypes on subsequent RSBs in adolescence and adulthood. PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Medline were searched for qualified articles up to April 2019. We calculated the pooled risk estimates using either the random-effect model or fixed-effect model. The potential heterogeneity moderators were identified by subgroup and sensitivity analysis. Overall, childhood maltreatment was significantly associated with an early sexual debut (odds ratio (OR) = 2.22; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.64-3.00), multiple sexual partners (OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.78-2.76), transactional sex (OR = 3.05; 95% CI: 1.92-4.86) and unprotected sex (OR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.22-2.09). Additionally, different types of childhood maltreatment were also significantly associated with higher risk of RSBs. Relevant heterogeneity moderators have been identified by subgroup analysis. Sensitivity analysis yielded consistent results. Childhood maltreatment is significantly associated with risky sexual behaviors. The current meta-analysis indicates it is vital to protect children from any types of maltreatment and provide health education and support for maltreated individuals.

AB  - Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex (LGBTI) people experience significant health inequalities. Located within a European Commission funded pilot project, this paper presents a review of the health inequalities faced by LGBTI people and the barriers health professionals encounter when providing care. Methods: A narrative synthesis of 57 papers including systematic reviews, narrative reviews, meta-analyses and primary research. Literature was searched in Cochrane, Campbell Collaboration, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Medline. The review was undertaken to promote understanding of the causes and range of inequalities, as well as how to reduce inequalities. Results: LGBTI people are more likely to experience health inequalities due to heteronormativity or heterosexism, minority stress, experiences of victimization and discrimination, compounded by stigma. Inequalities pertaining to LGBTI health(care) vary depending on gender, age, income and disability as well as between LGBTI groupings. Gaps in the literature remain around how these factors intersect to influence health, with further large-scale research needed particularly regarding trans and intersex people. Conclusion: Health inequalities can be addressed via changes in policy, research and in practice through health services that accommodate the needs of LGBTI people. With improved training to address gaps in their knowledge of LGBTI health and healthcare, health professionals should work in collaboration with LGBTI people to address a range of barriers that prevent access to care. Through structural change combined with increased knowledge and understanding, services can potentially become more inclusive and equally accessible to all.

AB  - Background Arterial hypertension (HT) is common in the Russian adult population, with half of affected individuals inadequately controlled. Low adherence to medication seems likely to be a factor. We report a scoping review of studies on adherence to antihypertensive therapy (AHT) in Russia to determine the extent of research undertaken, the frequency of adherence among adults diagnosed with HT, methodologies used in the studies, and their ability to describe determinants of adherence. Methods A scoping review of published studies that have assessed adherence to AHT in Russian HT patients searched the main Russian and international electronic databases eLIBRARY.ru, Russian Medicine, Embase, MEDLINE for full-text reports published in the Russian language between 2000 and 2017. The last search was on November 28, 2017. Among 520 reports identified, 31 were included in the review. Results Eighteen studies assessed adherence using the 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4); others used bespoke questionnaires or pill counts. 25 studies assessed levels of adherence, 11 examined its determinants, and 18 examined intervention strategies. The proportion of "adherent" patients varied from 11 to 44% using the MMAS-4, from 23 to 74% when using bespoke questionnaires, and from 5 to 43% when using pill counts. Adherence was associated with sociodemographic factors, access to free drugs provided through the Medicine Assistance Scheme (MAS), use of home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, anxiety, and comorbidity. There was no evidence that adherence was associated with income or physical activity. Evidence of an association between MAS, grade of HT, or experience of hypertensive crisis was inconclusive. Various methods to improve adherence were studied including patient education (improved from 1.8 to 3.9 points, p = 0.0002 or 2.80 to 3.79 points, p < 0.0001 measured by the MMAS-4), telephone reminders (p < 0.0001), training in home BP monitoring (p < 0.05), and use of fixed-dose combinations (p < 0.05). Conclusions The main determinants of adherence to AHT are sociodemographic characteristics, the severity of HT, and presence of comorbidity. Patient education and use of fixed-dose combinations of drugs were identified as most important for improving adherence. Most studies assessing adherence use self-reported methods so there is a need for greater use of objective methods.

AB  - Objective: Mental health care is known to be poorly integrated into many health systems and could benefit from improved information sharing facilitated by electronic health records (EHRs). Specific issues appear to have limited the application of EHRs in mental health care, including the sensitivity of mental health-related information and issues with data standardisation. This scoping review aims to explore how EHRs have been implemented and adopted in mental health contexts, and their impacts on information sharing. Further, it aims to explore how the unique issues of sensitive information and data standardisation have been addressed in examples of EHRs, if at all. Method: A comprehensive literature search is planned for relevant electronic databases and grey literature sources. Articles from any date that describe the implementation or adoption of an EHR in a mental health context will be included in the review. Articles that describe only the design or development of an EHR in a mental health context will be excluded. Half of the full-text articles will be screened by a second reviewer, with any disagreement mediated by a third reviewer. Results: Abstract screening is currently underway with results being planned for publication in late 2019. The charting of the results will occur in both tabular form and descriptive summaries with results categorised into themes using a deductive content analysis approach. Discussion: The findings from this scoping review have the potential to inform the development of a conceptual framework to guide empirical research on EHRs in mental health contexts.

AB  - The social modulation of pain in humans has been neglected so far with respect to verbal as well as non-verbal communication of pain. The facial pain expression is a powerful way to communicate pain, and there are some theoretical accounts available on how social modulation may affect the encoding of the facial expression of pain. Some accounts, particularly in the pain field, are proximate explanations on the mechanisms involved, whereas an evolutionary psychology account takes a more comprehensive approach. A review of nine experimental studies revealed that in the majority of studies (6/9), social context had an effect on the facial pain expression, but results were inconsistent. Several conceptual and methodological issues are discussed which may explain these inconsistencies and could help in design of future experimental studies.

AB  - In recent years, grit has drawn increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners. As an important noncognitive indicator, grit has been used to understand individual success and performance in various fields. However, past empirical research has shown inconsistent findings on the relationship between grit and academic achievement. This study aims to review and synthesize past empirical findings on the relationship between grit and academic achievement. Forty-four relevant articles involving a total of 60,133 participants met the inclusion criteria and were synthesized in this meta-analysis. Our findings suggest that (a) overall grit level and its two facets (consistency of interest and perseverance of effort) are positively associated with academic achievement; (b) the association between grit and academic achievement is moderated by grade level; and (c) perseverance of effort shows the largest effect size on students' academic achievement when compared with overall grit level and consistency of interest.

AB  - In September 2017, a workshop was held at Wageningen University and Research to determine the current state of knowledge of multiple stressor effects on aquatic ecosystems and to assess how to improve prediction of these effects. We developed a theoretical framework that integrates species-level responses to stressors to predict how these effects propagate through higher levels of biological organisation. Here, we present the application of the framework for drainage ditch ecosystems in the Netherlands. We used food webs to assess single and multiple stressor effects of common stressors on ditch communities. We reviewed the literature for the effects of targeted stressors (nutrients, pesticides, dredging and mowing, salinization, and siltation) on each functional group present in the food web and qualitatively assessed the relative sensitivity of groups. Using this information, we created a stressor-response matrix of positive and negative direct effects of each stressor-functional group combination. Fungicides, salinization, and sedimentation were identified as particularly detrimental to most groups, although destructive management practices, such as dredging with almost complete community removal, would take precedence depending on frequency. Using the stressor-response matrix we built, first, a series of conceptual null models of single stressor effects on food web structure and, second, a series of additive null models to illustrate potential paired-stressor effects. We compared these additive null models with published studies of the same pairs of combined single stressors to explore more complex interactions. Our approach serves as a first-step to considering multiple stressor scenarios in systems that are understudied or data-poor and as a baseline from which more complex models that include indirect effects and quantitative data may be developed. We make specific suggestions for appropriate management strategies that could be taken to support the biodiversity of these systems for individual stressors and their combined impacts.

AB  - We aimed to (1) determine the extent of the relationship between attachment and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB), (2) investigate whether any gender differences exist, and (3) conduct a theoretical synthesis of the included studies. A systematic search of the databases Web of Science; EBSCO Host Medical and Psychology-related resources, which includes CINAHL, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and PsycINFO; and EMBASE was conducted, with 52 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. While secure attachment acts as protective factor, insecure attachment orientations appear to be vulnerability factors compromising an individual's capacity to cope with relationship issues, increasing suicide risk. There is insufficient evidence about gender differences. The theoretical synthesis suggests that attachment, interacting with other psychological traits in response to negative life events, acts as a vulnerability or protective factor for STB. Implications for treatment are also discussed.

AB  - Objective: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, gastrointestinal condition that involves a range of debilitating bowel symptoms. Adjustment to living with IBD can be negatively impacted by maladaptive cognitive and behavioural factors (e.g. negative illness representations and repressing emotions). Patient samples also report negative reactions from the general public and such perceptions can further negatively impact people living with IBD. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review literature investigating the illness perceptions, perceived stigmatisation, and negative emotional reactions toward IBD within patient and community samples. We also aimed to review how these factors impact those living with IBD (i.e. adjustment, psychological health). Design: A range of databases (e.g. Psych INFO, PubMed) were searched over two years. One reviewer individually screened titles and abstracts using the specified inclusion criteria, and this process was repeated by a second reviewer. Subsequently, the full text articles were screened and data were extracted for the 82 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Following data extraction, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: The review of 82 studies suggested that negative illness perceptions are linked to poorer psychosocial outcomes, that patient samples frequently anticipate stigmatisation, fear relating to bowel accidents was the most common emotion reported, and that the general public direct little enacted stigma towards IBD. Conclusion: For people living with IBD: (i) poorer psychological adjustment was reported by those who held more negative perceptions and reactions toward their illness; and (ii) their concerns regarding public perceptions of IBD warrants further empirical attention. Results emphasise the importance of targeting perceptions, and facilitating education and adaptive responding during treatment.

AB  - Neuropeptides exert essential functions in animal physiology by controlling e.g., reproduction, development, growth, energy homeostasis, cardiovascular activity and stress response. Thus, identification of neuropeptides has been a very active field of research over the last decades. This review article presents the various methods used to discover novel bioactive peptides in vertebrates. Initially identified on the basis of their biological activity, some neuropeptides have also been discovered for their ability to bind/activate a specific receptor or based on their biochemical characteristics such as C-terminal amidation which concerns half of the known neuropeptides. More recently, sequencing of the genome of many representative species has facilitated peptidomic approaches using mass spectrometry and in silico screening of genomic libraries. Through these different approaches, more than a hundred of bioactive neuropeptides have already been identified in vertebrates. Nevertheless, researchers continue to find new neuropeptides or to identify novel functions of neuropeptides that had not been detected previously, as it was recently the case for nociceptin.

AB  - Background: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder which is characterized by altered bowel habits. A growing number of studies investigate the association between IBS and cognitive impairments. Current studies report conflicting results regarding cognitive impairment in IBS patients. We therefore conducted the first systematic review to examine the association between IBS and cognitive impairment and identify the types of cognitive domain involved.
   Study design: Eight databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)) were searched from the inception date up till 15 February 2018. Observational studies published in English or Chinese were independently appraised, and data was extracted, by two reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies. The findings were synthesized using a narrative approach.
   Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Our findings suggested that IBS patients exhibited attentional bias towards GI sensation words and emotionally negative words. There was insufficient evidence of evidences to show that IBS patients had cognitive deficits in memory, intelligence, executive functions and general cognitive functions. A number of limitations were identified, including small sample, limited cognitive domain inclusion, lack of study details, and management of confounding variables.
   Conclusion: There is evidence of attentional bias in individuals with IBS; the evidence on cognitive impairment was either inconclusive or insufficient in other cognitive domains. Further studies are needed to confirm prevalence rates and examine potential mechanisms.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that presents with cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbance. Approximately 5.5 million people in the United States live with AD, most of whom are over the age of 65 with two-thirds being woman. There have been major advancements over the last decade or so in the understanding of AD neuropathological changes and genetic involvement. However, studies of sex impact in AD have not been adequately integrated into the investigation of disease development and progression. It becomes indispensable to acknowledge in both basic science and clinical research studies the importance of understanding sex-specific differences in AD pathophysiology and pathogenesis, which could guide future effort in the discovery of novel targets for AD. Here, we review the latest and most relevant literature on this topic, highlighting the importance of understanding sex dimorphism from a molecular perspective and its association to clinical trial design and development in AD research field.

AB  - The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare sleep outcomes of AS patients and controls. Six electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, IndMed, Cochrane Library, CNKI and Web of Science. Statistical analyses were executed using Revman 5.3 software. Nine studies and a total of 3169 participants were included in the meta-analysis. When sleep was assessed using PSQI, significant differences were observed in subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, sleep medication use and total PSQI between patients with AS and controls, and subjective sleep quality was most severely affected. In PSG, eight variables of sleep quality (stage I sleep, stage II sleep, slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement, arousal index, periodic leg movement index, sleep latency, sleep efficiency) were lower in AS patients than in controls. Three variables of sleep quality assessed by USI (estimated sleep time, sleep sufficiency index, number of awakenings per night) and two variables of sleep quality assessed by MOS sleep scale (sleep disturbance scale, sleep problem index II) were lower in AS patients than in controls. It indicated that AS patients experience more serious sleep disorders. Early recognition and appropriate interventions are essential to improve patients' sleep quality.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is generally thought to be caused by multiple factors, including environmental and genetic factors. Emerging evidence suggests that intestinal disturbances, such as constipation, are common non-motor symptoms of PD. Gut inflammation may be closely associated with pathogenesis in PD. This review aims to discuss the cross-talk between gut inflammation and PD pathology initiation and progression. Firstly, we will highlight the studies demonstrating how gut inflammation is related to PD. Secondly, we will analyze how gut inflammation spreads from the gastro-intestine to the brain. Here, we will mainly discuss the neural pathway of pathologic alpha-syn and the systemic inflammatory routes. Thereafter, we will address how alterations in the brain subsequently lead to dopaminergic neuron degeneration, in which oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, T cell driven inflammation and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are involved. We conclude a model of PD triggered by gut inflammation, which provides a new angle to understand the mechanisms of the disease.

AB  - Objectives: Recent workforce strategies require mental health workers to collaborate across sectors. This scoping review aims to identify the theoretical principles (e.g. frameworks, models, strategies) that inform the implementation of cross-sector initiatives on a workforce level, with an emphasis on the role of leadership. Method: This scoping review was completed according to co-produced principles. Included publications met each criterion: (i) cross-sector; (ii) collaborative-based; (iii) theoretical principles expressed in a framework, strategy, models or initiatives; (iv) mental health and/or alcohol services; and (v) workforce focus. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychINFO) and published grey literature (including reports, guidelines, evaluations) in English-language were searched to December 2018. Results: Database searches identified 1,377 publications. Articles not meeting the selection criteria were excluded; 1,371 were excluded during title/abstract screening, three were excluded during full-text screening, three were included in this review. Grey literature search contributed seven publications. In total 10 publications were included. Five key themes were identified: (i) mental health; ii alcohol and other drugs; (iii) recovery orientated; (iv) lived experience workforce; these impact the structure, sector and workforce, including lived experience workforce. Literature addressing leadership was dearth. Discussion: Existing models of cross-sector collaboration often fail to address factors important to mental health and alcohol and other drug service delivery (e.g. recovery, consumer and carer participation). Future models should emphasise workforce development, including the emerging role of the lived experience workforce.

AB  - Ventriloquism, the illusion that a voice appears to come from the moving mouth of a puppet rather than from the actual speaker, is one of the classic examples of multisensory processing. In the laboratory, this illusion can be reliably induced by presenting simple meaningless audiovisual stimuli with a spatial discrepancy between the auditory and visual components. Typically, the perceived location of the sound source is biased toward the location of the visual stimulus (the ventriloquism effect). The strength of the visual bias reflects the relative reliability of the visual and auditory inputs as well as prior expectations that the two stimuli originated from the same source. In addition to the ventriloquist illusion, exposure to spatially discrepant audiovisual stimuli results in a subsequent recalibration of unisensory auditory localization (the ventriloquism aftereffect). In the past years, the ventriloquism effect and aftereffect have seen a resurgence as an experimental tool to elucidate basic mechanisms of multisensory integration and learning. For example, recent studies have: (a) revealed top-down influences from the reward and motor systems on cross-modal binding; (b) dissociated recalibration processes operating at different time scales; and (c) identified brain networks involved in the neuronal computations underlying multisensory integration and learning. This mini review article provides a brief overview of established experimental paradigms to measure the ventriloquism effect and aftereffect before summarizing these pathbreaking new advancements. Finally, it is pointed out how the ventriloquism effect and aftereffect could be utilized to address some of the current open questions in the field of multisensory research.

AB  - Western societies notice an increasing interest in plant-based eating patterns such as vegetarian and vegan, yet potential effects on the body and brain are a matter of debate. Therefore, we systematically reviewed existing human interventional studies on putative effects of a plant-based diet on the metabolism and cognition, and what is known about the underlying mechanisms. Using the search terms "plant-based OR vegan OR vegetarian AND diet AND intervention" in PubMed filtered for clinical trials in humans retrieved 205 studies out of which 27, plus an additional search extending the selection to another five studies, were eligible for inclusion based on three independent ratings. We found robust evidence for short- to moderate-term beneficial effects of plant-based diets versus conventional diets (duration <= 24 months) on weight status, energy metabolism and systemic inflammation in healthy participants, obese and type-2 diabetes patients. Initial experimental studies proposed novel microbiome-related pathways, by which plant-based diets modulate the gut microbiome towards a favorable diversity of bacteria species, yet a functional "bottom up" signaling of plant-based diet-induced microbial changes remains highly speculative. In addition, little is known, based on interventional studies about cognitive effects linked to plant-based diets. Thus, a causal impact of plant-based diets on cognitive functions, mental and neurological health and respective underlying mechanisms has yet to be demonstrated. In sum, the increasing interest for plant-based diets raises the opportunity for developing novel preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity, eating disorders and related comorbidities. Still, putative effects of plant-based diets on brain health and cognitive functions as well as the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored and new studies need to address these questions.

AB  - Background Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a measurement method for the sensory gating process, which helps the brain adapt to complex environments. PPI may be reduced in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). This study investigated PPI deficits in BD and pooled the effect size of PPI in patients with BD. Methods We conducted a literature search on PPI in patients with BD from inception to July 27, 2019 in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, and Chinese databases. No age, sex, and language restriction were set. The calculation formula was PPI = 100 - [100*((prepulse - pulse amplitude) / pulse amplitude)]. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of studies. Results Ten eligible papers were identified, of which five studies including a total of 141 euthymic patients and 132 healthy controls (HC) were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with HC, euthymic patients with BD had significantly lower PPI at the 60 ms interstimulus interval (ISI) between pulse and prepulse (P = 0.476, I-2 = 0.0%, SMD = - 0.32, 95% CI = - 0.54 - -0.10). Sensitivity analysis shows no significant change in the combined effect value after removing any single study. There was no publication bias using the Egger's test at 60 ms (P = 0.606). The meta-analysis of PPI at the 60 ms ISI could have significant clinical heterogeneity in mood episode state, as well as lack of data on BD I or II subtypes. Conclusions Euthymic patients with BD show PPI deficits at the 60 ms, suggesting a deficit in the early sensory gate underlying PPI. The PPI inhibition rate at a 60 ms interval is a stable index. More research is needed in the future to confirm this outcome, and to delve deeper into the mechanisms behind deficits.

AB  - Aquatic and terrestrial organisms are being exposed to a number of anthropogenically-induced environmental stresses as a consequence of climate change. In addition, climate change is altering various linkages that exist between ecosystems on land and in water. Here we compare and contrast how climate change is altering aquatic and terrestrial environments and address some of the ways that the organisms in these ecosystems, especially the primary producers, are being affected by climate change factors, including changes in temperature, moisture, atmospheric carbon dioxide and solar UV radiation. Whereas there are some responses to climate change in common between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., changes in species composition and shifting geographic ranges and distributions), there are also responses that fundamentally differ between these two (e.g., responses to UV radiation). Climate change is also disrupting land-water connections in ways that influence biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions in ways that can modify how aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are affected by climate change and can influence climate change. The effects of climate change on these ecosystems are having wide-ranging effects on ecosystem biodiversity, structure and function and the abilities of these systems to provide essential services.

AB  - Background Illicit substance misuse is a growing public health problem, with misuse peaking among 18-25 year-olds, and attendance at third-level education identified as a risk factor. Illicit substance misuse has the potential to harm mental and physical health, social relationships, and impact on academic achievements and future career prospects. Digital interventions have been identified as a vehicle for reaching large student populations and circumventing the limited capacity of student health services for delivering face-to-face interventions. Digital interventions have been developed in the area of alcohol and tobacco harm reduction, reporting some effectiveness, but the evidence for the effectiveness of digital interventions targeting illicit substance misuse is lacking. This review aims to systematically identify and critically appraise studies examining the effectiveness of digital interventions for illicit substance misuse harm reduction in third-level students. Methods We systematically searched ten databases in April 2018 using keywords and database specific terms under the pillars of "mHealth," "substance misuse," and "student." To be eligible for inclusion, papers had to present a measure of illicit substance misuse harm reduction. Included articles were critically appraised and included in the qualitative synthesis regardless of quality. Results A total of eight studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies reported harm reduction in terms of substance misuse or initiation, as consequences or problems associated with substance misuse, or as correction of perceived social norms. Overall, five out of the eight studies reported at least one positive outcome for harm reduction. The critical appraisal indicated that the study quality was generally weak, predominantly due to a lack of blinding of study participants, and the use of self-reported substance misuse measures. However, results suggest that digital interventions may produce a modest reduction in harm from illicit substance misuse. Conclusions The results of this review are positive, and support the need for further high-quality research in this area, particularly given the success of digital interventions for alcohol and tobacco harm reduction. However, very few studies focused solely on illicit substances, and those that did targeted only marijuana. This suggests the need for further research on the effectiveness of this type of intervention for other illicit substances.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, are associated with significant illness burden. Accumulating evidence supports an association between these disorders and inflammation. Consequently, anti-inflammatory agents, such as the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, represent a novel avenue to prevent and treat neuropsychiatric illness. In this paper, we first review the role of inflammation in psychiatric pathophysiology including inflammatory cytokines' influence on neurotransmitters, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and microglial mechanisms. We then discuss how cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitors influence these pathways with potential therapeutic benefit, with a focus on celecoxib, due to its superior safety profile. A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and PsychINFO databases, in addition to Clinicaltrials.gov and the Stanley Medical Research Institute trial registries. The results were presented as a narrative review. Currently available outcomes for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017 are also discussed. The evidence reviewed here suggests cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and in particular celecoxib, may indeed assist in treating the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders; however, further studies are required to assess appropriate illness stage-related indication.

AB  - Background: Among twins, lower linguistic skills emerged when compared with singletons. Considering the association found between parental linguistic input and children's language development, exploring the differences between twins and singleton's linguistic environments could find variables that are potentially associated with the lower linguistic skills of twins.
   Aim: The current systematic review aims to analyze and systematize the existing literature focused on the comparison of twins' and singletons' linguistic environments within their first 3 years of life. Methodological issues (i.e., the procedure used to assess the linguistic environment, the coding of the linguistic environment's features, the computational method employed to assess the parental linguistic input, and participant characteristics) and differences found among twins and singletons regarding their linguistic environment (i.e., linguistic input quantity, linguistic input complexity, linguistic features of child-directed speech, parental responsiveness, and directiveness, joint attention, and book reading) were highlighted.
   Method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was followed. Eligible studies were searched through EBSCO, PubMed, and Web of Science. From this search, 1,347 study results emerged, and 8 studies were included.
   Results: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review focused on the comparison of twins' and singletons' linguistic environments. Differences between the groups were found in all of the included studies. Data against twins were generally identified regarding all the considered linguistic environment's features. However, conflicting results within and between the included studies emerged, mainly according to the computational method employed (i.e., twin moms value, twin direct dyadic value, twin direct dyadic + both value, and input directed toward both children simultaneously).
   Conclusion: The disadvantaged linguistic environment of twins is likely due to limited parental resources and demands associated with the management of two children of the same age. However, the limited and conflicting data found did not allow for a firm conclusion to be drawn on the differences in the twins' and singletons' linguistic environments. Further studies on the topic are needed.

AB  - Background
   Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been related to structural brain characteristics that are correlated with the severity of disease. However, the correlation of these structural changes is less well clarified in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).
   Aims
   To summarise the existing literature on structural brain characteristics in TRD to create an overview of known abnormalities of the brain in patients with MDD, to form hypotheses about the absence or existence of a common pathophysiology of MDD and TRD.
   Method
   A systematic search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library for studies published between 1998 and August of 2016 investigating structural brain changes in patients with TRD compared with healthy controls or patients with MDD.
   Results
   Fourteen articles are included in this review. Lower grey matter volume (GMV) in the anterior cingulate cortex, right cerebellum, caudate nucleus, superior/medial frontal gyrus and hippocampus does not seem to differentiate TRD from milder forms of MDD. However, lower GMV in the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, angular- and post-central gyri together with specific mainly parietal white matter tract changes seem to be more specific structural characteristics of TRD.
   Conclusions
   The currently available data on structural brain changes in patients with TRD compared with milder forms of MDD and healthy controls cannot sufficiently distinguish between a 'shared continuum hypothesis' and a 'different entity hypothesis'. Our review clearly suggests that although there is some overlap in affected brain regions between milder forms of MDD and TRD, TRD also comes with specific alterations in mainly the putamen and parietal white matter tracts.

AB  - During the past decade, novel approaches to study social interaction have expanded and questioned long-standing knowledge about how humans understand each other. We aim to portray and reconcile the key psychological processes and neural mechanisms underlying navigation of the social environment. Theoretical accounts mostly revolved around either abstract inferences or embodied simulations, whereas experimental studies mostly focused on theory of mind or mentalizing, empathy, and action imitation. The tension between theories of and experiments on social cognition is systematically revisited to foster new theoretical and empirical studies in the fields. We finally retrace differential impairments in social capacities as a means to re-conceptualize psychopathological disturbance in psychiatry, including schizophrenia, borderline personality, and autism.

AB  - Early diagnose for the prevention of preterm birth is one of the important perinatal challenges. The neonatal care and early treatment for preterm babies are increasing the chance of survival, but anyways it affects the respiratory distress, immature brains, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, visual and hearing impairments, and poor health and growth. If preterm labor is diagnosed in the early period of gestation, then it is easy to give an appropriate treatment to the pregnant woman. The uterine electrical activity assessment is a suitable method for monitoring the labor process especially for the prediction of preterm labor. Electrohysterography is a non-invasive technique to monitor the contraction. The electrohysterogram (EHG) or uterine electromyogram (Uterine EMG) is considered as a biomarker for the prediction or preterm labor. A number of studies in this field by various researchers have been reviewed. On the basis of such reviews, this paper provides the different steps such as pre-processing, feature extraction, classifiers and feature subset selection methods for the detection and prediction of preterm birth.

AB  - Purpose of review After three decades of clinical research on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), major depressive disorder (MDD) has proven to be the primary field of application. MDD poses a major challenge for health systems worldwide, emphasizing the need for improving clinical efficacy of existing rTMS applications and promoting the development of novel evidence-based rTMS treatment approaches. Recent findings Several promising new avenues have been proposed: novel stimulation patterns, targets, and coils; combinatory treatments and maintenance; and personalization and stratification of rTMS parameters, and treatment of subpopulations. This opinion review summarizes current knowledge in the field and addresses the future direction of rTMS treatment in MDD, facilitating the establishment of this clinical intervention method as a standard treatment option and continuing to improve response and remission rates, and take the necessary steps to personalize rTMS-based treatment approaches.

AB  - IntroductionDespite the significant healthcare policy and program implications, a summary measure of health for children with medical complexity (CMC) has not been identified. It is unclear whether existing population health approaches apply to CMC. We conducted a systematic review of the existing peer-reviewed research literature on CMC to describe the health outcomes currently measured for CMC.MethodsWe searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO by linking combinations of key words from three groups of concepts: (1) pediatric, (2) medical complexity, and (3) chronicity or severity. Study eligibility criteria were research studies including CMC with any outcome reported. Data on the outcomes were systematically extracted. Iterative content analysis organized outcomes into conceptual domains and sub-domains.ResultsOur search yielded 3853 articles. After exclusion criteria were applied, 517 articles remained for data extraction. Five distinct outcome domains and twenty-four sub-domains emerged. Specifically, 50% of the articles studied healthcare access and use; 43% family well-being; 39% child health and well-being; 38% healthcare quality; and 25% adaptive functioning. Notably lacking were articles examining routine child health promotion as well as child mental health and outcomes related to family functioning.ConclusionsKey health domains for CMC exist. Adaptations of existing sets of metrics and additional tools are needed to fully represent and measure population health for CMC. This approach may guide policies and programs to improve care for CMC.

AB  - We conducted a narrative literature review on studies that specifically addressed the pharmacokinetics of antidepressants in patients on hemodialysis. The search included the MEDLINE, LILACS, and Web of Knowledge databases and combined Medical Subject Headings and free-text search terms for chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, renal replacement therapy, depression, and antidepressants; it was limited to studies conducted in humans, with no language or time constraints. The search yielded 212 studies. After screening titles and abstracts, 32 studies were read in full and 11 ultimately met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Most of the studies showed no difference in the pharmacokinetics of antidepressant drugs between patients with normal renal function and patients undergoing hemodialysis. However, studies with fluvoxamine and amitriptyline showed that variations in albumin levels might affect serum concentrations of these agents. The included studies have several limitations, and there are many obstacles to the adequate treatment of depression in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Further studies on this topic are needed to support proper treatment of these patients, improving their quality of life and reducing mortality.

AB  - Social perceptual impairment is a common presenting feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) that has the potential to contribute considerably to disease burden. The current study reports a meta-analytic integration of 79 studies which shows that, relative to controls, PD is associated with a moderate emotion recognition deficit (g = -0.57, K = 73), and that this deficit is robust and almost identical across facial and prosodic modalities. However, the magnitude of this impairment does appear to vary as a function of task and emotion type, with deficits generally greatest for identification tasks (g = -0.65, K = 54), and for negative relative to other basic emotions. With respect to clinical variables, dopaminergic medication, deep brain stimulation, and a predominant left side onset of motor symptoms are each associated with greater social perceptual difficulties. However, the magnitude of social perceptual impairment seen for the four atypical parkinsonian conditions is broadly comparable to that associated with PD. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Emissions of metals and metalloids (Hg; Cd; Cr; Cu; Pb; Ni; Zn; Fe; Mn; As; Se) generated by natural (e.g., geothermal activity) or anthropic causes (eg., industry or mining) represent a worldwide contamination problem, especially in developing countries. Exposure to high concentrations of these elements is harmful to living beings, including humans. Information on this type of contamination is scarce and fragmented, limiting research which could benefit from these data. To know the state of the research, we reviewed the studies of environmental pollution by metals and metalloids carried out on animal species in Latin America. The use of animals as biomonitors of contamination by metals and metalloids is a continuously expanding practice that allows for early detection of problems. With this work, we were able to identify the most studied areas in Latin America (Amazon, Gulf of California, coastal area between Rio de Janeiro and Florianopolis and River Plate Estuary). Moreover, we provide information on the most studied metals (Hg, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) and wild species, which evidence the use of endangered species. The data reviewed should help researchers to direct their efforts towards sparsely researched areas and facilitate bibliographic consultation of scientific information on exposure to metals and metalloids in Latin America.

AB  - Introduction This paper synthesises evidence on the organisation of primary health care (PHC) service delivery in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the Asia Pacific and identifies evidence of effective approaches and pathways of impact in this region.
   Methods We developed a conceptual framework describing key inputs and outcomes of PHC as the basis of a systematic review. We searched exclusively for intervention studies from LMICs of the Asia-Pacific region in an effort to identify 'what works' to improve the coverage, quality, efficiency, equity and responsiveness of PHC. We conducted a narrative synthesis to identify key characteristics of successful interventions.
   Results From an initial list of 3001 articles, we selected 153 for full-text review and included 111. We found evidence on the impact of non-physician health workers (NPHWs) on coverage and quality of care, though better integration with other PHC services is needed. Communitybased services are most effective when well integrated through functional referral systems and supportive supervision arrangements, and have a reliable supply of medicines. Many studies point to the importance of community engagement in improving service demand. Few studies adopted a 'systems' lens or adequately considered long-term costs or implementation challenges.
   Conclusion Based on our findings, we suggest five areas where more practical knowledge and guidance is needed to support PHC systems strengthening: (1) NPHW workforce development; (2) integrating non-communicable disease prevention and control into the basic package of care; (3) building managerial capacity; (4) institutionalising community engagement; (5) modernising PHC information systems.

AB  - Objectives: To explore the relationship between severe/serious mental illness (SMI) and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), as the patterns of symptoms and cognitive performance that characterize both disorders share similarities. Methods: We performed a systematic review investigating what has already been published regarding the relationship between bvFTD and SMI. Studies were selected from PubMed and LILACS databases, including those published up to February 12, 2018. The search strategy included the following terms: "frontotemporal dementia" plus "bipolar", OR "frontotemporal dementia" plus "schizophrenia", OR "frontotemporal dementia" plus "schizoaffective". Publications without abstracts, case reports with absent genetic or histopathological confirmation, reviews and non-English language papers were excluded across the search process. Results: The search on PubMed retrieved 186 articles, of which 42 met eligibility criteria. On the LILACS database, none met the requirements. Generally, three major research aims were identified: 1) to look for frontotemporal lobar degeneration-associated genetic abnormalities in patients with prior SMI; 2) to compare the cognitive profile between patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenic patients; 3) to highlight the association between bvFTD and preceding psychiatric conditions and/or distinguish them both. The investigated mutations were found infrequently in the studied SMI samples. Cross-sectional studies comparing cognitive performance between bvFTD and psychiatric disorders mostly found no remarkable differences. There were only a few case reports identifying definite frontotemporal lobar degeneration in patients with previous psychiatric diagnoses. Conclusions: The available evidence demonstrates how fragile the current understanding is regarding the association between bvFTD and prior SMI.

AB  - Background: Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are complex mental disorders, and their etiology is still not fully understood. This paper reviews the literature on diffusion tensor imaging studies in patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa to explore the usefulness of white matter microstructural analysis in understanding the pathophysiology of eating disorders. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to identify diffusion tensor imaging studies that compared patients with an eating disorder to control groups. We searched relevant databases for studies published from database inception to August 2018, using combinations of select keywords. We categorized white matter tracts according to their 3 main classes: projection (i.e., thalamo-cortical), association (i.e., occipital-parietal-temporal-frontal) and commissural (e.g., corpus callosum). Results: We included 19 papers that investigated a total of 427 participants with current or previous eating disorders and 444 controls. Overall, the studies used different diffusion tensor imaging approaches and showed widespread white matter abnormalities in patients with eating disorders. Despite differences among the studies, patients with anorexia nervosa showed mainly white matter microstructural abnormalities of thalamo-cortical tracts (i.e., corona radiata, thalamic radiations) and occipital-parietal-temporal-frontal tracts (i.e., left superior longitudinal and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi). It was less clear whether white matter alterations persist after recovery from anorexia nervosa. Available data on bulimia nervosa were partially similar to those for anorexia nervosa. Limitations: Study sample composition and diffusion tensor imaging analysis techniques were heterogeneous. The number of studies on bulimia nervosa was too limited to be conclusive. Conclusion: White matter microstructure appears to be affected in anorexia nervosa, and these alterations may play a role in the pathophysiology of this eating disorder. Although we found white matter alterations in bulimia nervosa that were similar to those in anorexia nervosa, white matter changes in bulimia nervosa remain poorly investigated, and these findings were less conclusive. Further studies with longitudinal designs and multi-approach analyses are needed to better understand the role of white matter changes in eating disorders.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to collect, analyse and synthesise the evidence on skin picking disorder as defined by Arnold's criteria or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - fifth edition (DSM-5) and to examine whether skin picking disorder warrants inclusion in the DSM-5 as a distinct disorder. Method: The databases CINAHL, Medline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched for articles published between January 2008 and May 2018. Eligible articles were empirical studies that used Arnold's or DSM-5 criteria to diagnose skin picking disorder, published in English, with participants aged 18 years or older. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed according to the National Health and Medical Research Council's guidelines and suggested nosological classification of skin picking disorder were summarised. Eligible studies were assessed against the five criteria proposed by Blashfield and colleagues to determine the validity of the inclusion of skin picking disorder in the DSM-5. Results: A total of 20 studies were considered eligible out of 1554. Most of the papers were case-control studies with small clinical samples. Only one out of Blashfield's five criteria was met; there were commonly accepted diagnostic criteria and assessment scales present in the literature. However, at the time of review, the criterion of 50 published articles (25 of which are required to be empirical) was not met; there had been no publication specifically assessing the clinical utility or validity of skin picking disorder and no studies addressing the differentiation of skin picking disorder from other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Conclusion: Only a small proportion of published studies on skin picking disorder have employed validated criteria. The current literature fulfills only one of Blashfield's five criteria for the inclusion of skin picking disorder as a specific entity in psychiatric diagnostic manuals. Further empirical studies on skin picking disorder are needed in order to substantiate skin picking disorder as a disorder distinct from related disorders under the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders category.

AB  - Epilepsy affects millions of people worldwide and has a great burden on world health. Improvement of seizure outcomes mostly relies on establishment of individualized risk factors for epileptogenesis and drug resistance. Several circulating molecules could serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers at different stages of the disease. Inflammatory markers, blood-brain barrier markers, oxidative stress markers, microRNAs, autoantibodies, hormones and growth factors are promising fields of research for biomarkers in epilepsy. Several experimental studies and only a few clinical studies have revealed associations between inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes of epilepsy. Herein, we detail the clinical and immunological significance of several factors of inflammation that may in due time serve as biomarkers of epilepsy in an effort to potentially inspire the researchers towards the development of reliable prognostic biomarkers for epilepsy.

   Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane database from their inception until July 2018. Additionally, we manually searched the references of included studies and recent systematic reviews of psychotherapy, antidepressants, and collaborative care for cancer patients with depression.
   Results: Of the 1365 retrieved articles, 11 randomized controlled trials and 11 intervention studies ma the inclusion criteria. These were categorized by type of intervention: psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, integrated collaborative care, muscle relaxation and therapeutic walking, and cancer treatment. The trials showed little evidence to confirm the effects of suicide prevention strategies. Seven trials were designed to assess the efficacy of interventions treating depression. In all studies, suicidal behavior or ideation was reported as one of the secondary outcomes. Three trials did not report information about suicidal ideation, despite assessing depressive symptoms using scales that contained suicidal ideation items. Most trials demonstrated inadequate study quality.
   Conclusions: Our review summarized interventions for suicide prevention in patients with cancer and revealed methodological issues. The findings highlighted a need to explore new treatment strategies that focus on unique suicide risk factors among patients with cancer.

Our ability to predict food web changes in response to anthropogenic stress is dependent on our understanding of the interactions among food web-stabilizing mechanisms, making the study of these interactions a critical need for future research in aquatic sciences. This review discusses potential interactions among mechanisms implicated in maintaining aquatic food webs such as changes in functional diversity, compartmentalization, importance of weak interactions and slow energy channels, modification of resource subsidies, stoichiometry and habitat complexity. It outlines potential research directions in aquatic sciences and discusses implications of considering these pathways in management and conservation.

AB  - Mental health represents one of the most significant and increasing burdens to global public health. Over the past decade, the once invisible field has gained recognition on the global health agenda and this increased recognition is expected to increase international funding for mental health. Our review found that few studies have been conducted as to the level of international funding for mental health and there is a need for a differentiated assessment. We conducted such an assessment of global development-related assistance for mental health between 2006 and 2016 and established categories to serve as a baseline for future measurement. We found that development assistance specifically dedicated to mental health accounted for just 0.3% of all development assistance for health. Given the limited public expenditure on mental health by national governments in low- and middle-income countries, renewed efforts by the international community and development partners to substantially increase funding for mental health are critical.

AB  - Purpose of review To identify recent advances in the field of dementia care in high-income countries. Recent findings New national and international initiatives identified support the notion of an increased commitment to face the challenge of dementia care. Recent research has documented barriers and facilitators to provide good care, and provided data on the specific needs of caregivers; the needs for better training of general practitioners; the negative influence of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD); the palliative care needs; and the increased risk of dementia associated with anxiety (the population-attributable fraction of Alzheimer's risk was 6.1%). Significant advances in new technologies applicable in the care of dementia have also been reported. The increased awareness of the needs in dementia care is promising, although the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has alerted about the limited implementation of the programmes. Barriers and facilitators identified have implications for both clinical practice and research. Particular implications for psychiatric action have the findings on BPSDs and on the preventive potential of the treatment of anxiety detected in the community. The data on palliative care needs and particularly on the advances of new technologies also have clinical implications.

This systematic review seeks to identify, classify, and discuss several of these barriers, as well as facilitators, integrate important theories that explain their effects on behavior outcomes and provide scientific evidence for their existence and importance in employee health behavior choices. Our search identified 14 articles that sought specifically to identify barriers and/or facilitators to healthy choices in the workplace. An analysis of these barriers and facilitators determined that they could be classified into one of four categories: physical, personal, social, and organizational factors. Suggestions for best practices for utilizing this information for health promotion and future research avenues are also discussed.

Several studies have evaluated the association of the type of delivery with PPD; however, there are controversies regarding this association. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to estimate the overall association between cesarean section (CS) and PPD.
   Methods: The international databases of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, EMBASE and Ovid were searched until May 2017. Quality assessment was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The pooled odds ratio in case-control and relative risk in cohort studies were used as the measures of association. A random-effects model was applied for the report of the results with 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: Of 989 studies, 32 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The adjusted OR of the association between CS and PPD was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.34) and the crude odds ratio of this association was 1.36 (1.20, 1.55). The odds ratio of the association of elective and emergency CS and PPD was 1.29 (1.12, 1.49) and 1.36 (1.20, 1.55), respectively. In addition, the pooled relative risk of the association between CS and PPD was 1.22 (0.94, 1.58) in cohort studies.
   Conclusions: Based on the results of this meta-analysis, it seems CS, regardless of the type of cesarean, is a risk factor for PPD.

AB  - Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by several impairments in communications and social interactions, as well as restricted interests or Stereotyped behaviors. Interventions applied for this disorder are based on multi-modal approaches, including pharmacotherapy. No definitive cure or medication has been introduced so far; therefore, researchers Still investigate potential drugs for treating ASD. One of the new medications introduced for this purpose is bumetanide. The present article aimed to review the efficacy of this drug on the core symptoms of ASD and its potential side effects.
   Methods: We searched all papers reported on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and adverse effects of bumetanide on animal models and humans with ASD. The papers were extracted from the main databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus.
   Results: The findings revealed that cortical neurons have high Chloride ion (Cl-)i and excitatory actions of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the valproic acid animal model with ASD and mice with fragile X syndrome. Bumetanide, which has been introduced as a diuretic, is also a high-affinity-specific Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) antagoniSt that can reduce Cl- level. The results also indicate that bumetanide can attenuate behavioral features of autism in both animal and human models. Moreover, the studies showed that such medication could activate fusifonn face area in individuals with ASD while viewing emotional faces. Also, recent findings suggeSt that a dose of 1 mg/d of this drug, taken twice daily, might be the besct compromise between safety and efficacy.
   Conclusion: Recent studies provided some evidence that bumetanide can be a novel pharmacological agent in treating core symptoms of ASD. Future studies are required to confirm the efficacy of this medication in individuals with ASD.

The results confirmed the presence of different psychosocial risk factors derived from working conditions linked to the higher education international policies. In the study, the relationships of these factors with different psychological and biological health effects are shown. The need for more and better quality studies and the importance of implementing health and welfare prevention programmes in the academic sector are also discussed.

AB  - Background: In-patient (IP) suicides contribute a small but significant proportion of overall suicides. Despite this, suicide prevention strategies focusing on the general hospital IP population remain relatively underresearched. This paper is intended to provide an overview of various proposed suicide prevention approaches in the general hospital, including psychiatric IP, settings, and their evidence base. Methodology: Electronic searches of MEDLINE through PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were performed to identify potentially relevant articles from inception till January 2019. The generated abstracts were systematically screened for their eligibility to be included in the review. Included articles were grouped under five broad themes: environmental modification, staff education, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and brain stimulation. Data extraction was done using a structured proforma. Results: Environmental modifications and educating the health care professionals appear to be the most promising strategies to reduce suicide-related mortality among IPs. Among pharmacological methods, ketamine has shown initial promise in reducing suicidal ideations. Follow-up data are lacking for most of the described methods. Limited but positive evidence exists for cognitive therapies focusing on the immediate postadmission period and brain stimulation techniques, and it warrants further replication. Conclusion: There is a striking paucity of original research on IP suicide prevention. Given the ethical and methodological issues in carrying out studies with IP suicide as the primary outcome, there is a need to focus on intermediate suicide outcome measures, such as knowledge, attitude, and skills among staff handlers of suicidal patients.

AB  - The cooperation between humans and robots is becoming increasingly important in our society. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of models that can enhance and enrich the interaction between humans and robots. A key challenge in the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) field is to provide robots with cognitive and affective capabilities, by developing architectures that let them establish empathetic relationships with users. Over the last several years, multiple models were proposed to face this open-challenge. This work provides a survey of the most relevant attempts/works. In details, it offers an overview of the architectures present in literature focusing on three specific aspects of HRI: the development of adaptive behavioral models, the design of cognitive architectures, and the ability to establish empathy with the user. The research was conducted within two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. Accurate exclusion criteria were applied to screen the 4916 articles found. At the end, 56 articles were selected. For each work, an evaluation of the model is made. Pros and cons of each work are detailed by analyzing the aspects that can be improved to establish an enjoyable interaction between robots and users.

AB  - The objective is to systematically review previous literature on the diagnostic stability of schizophrenia, particularly to investigate prospective and retrospective consistency. We carried out a systematic literature search in PubMed and other minor sources from 1980 to July 2017. Specifically, prospective and retrospective consistency were examined. Thirty-nine studies were included, 5 focused on schizophrenia, 23 on psychotic episodes and 11 on psychiatric disorders in general. Samples sizes range from 60 to 10 058 subjects (total N = 39 965). The majority of studies (n = 26, 66.67%) were performed in Europe and North America and they had a prospective design (n = 27, 69.23%), with a median follow-up of 3 years. Prospective and retrospective consistency means were 84.29% and 67.15% respectively. Diagnostic change was also frequently measured (n = 12, mean 31.28%). The factors more commonly associated with diagnostic stability were: male sex, older age at the study inception, older age at onset, late stages of illness, family history of mental illness, poorer functioning and longer length of stay. Schizophrenia was found to have high diagnostic stability over time, although research on this topic is mainly focused in first psychotic episodes. More standardized methods are needed to further research diagnostic stability of schizophrenia over time and its determinants.

AB  - The scale at which humans can handle complex social situations is massively increased compared to other animals. However, the neural substrates of this scaling remain poorly understood. In this review, we discuss how the expansion and rearrangement of the temporoparietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus (TPJ-pSTS) may have played a key role in the growth of human social abilities. Comparing the function and anatomy of the TPJ-pSTS in humans and macaques, which are thought to be separated by 25 million years of evolution, we find that the expansion of this region in humans has shifted the architecture of the dorsal and ventral processing streams. The TPJ-pSTS contains areas related to face-emotion processing, attention, theory of mind operations, and memory; its expansion has allowed for the elaboration and rearrangement of the cortical areas contained within, and potentially the introduction of new cortical areas. Based on the arrangement and the function of these areas in the human, we propose that the TPJ-pSTS is the basis of a third frontoparietal processing stream that underlies the increased social abilities in humans. We then describe a model of how the TPJ-pSTS areas interact as a hub that coordinates the activities of multiple brain networks in the exploration of the complex dynamic social scenes typical of the human social experience.

AB  - Identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been occurring at earlier ages, leading to a need for interventions that suit this age range. Because young children's development is highly dependent on adults and positive adult relationships, fields that traditionally have success in treating ASD, such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), must explicitly consider relationships. At the same time, Infant/Early Childhood Mental Health (I/ECMH) specialists that have traditionally focused on the parent and child relationship must recognize the importance of addressing atypical or difficult child behavior as major motivating factor or port of entry with families. This paper discusses two seemingly different approaches to the treatment of young children, the Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) informed Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) and Infant/Early Childhood Mental Health (I/ECMH) and proposes that they are complementary therapies that can be used simultaneously within the context of an interdisciplinary team to treat the "whole" child and his/her relationships. As demonstrated by the case example, combining the strengths of ABA and mental health services when working with very young children and families has the potential for many benefits.

AB  - The current review provides an original examination of the literature involving mood as a dependent variable in behavioral interventions designed for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty-nine single-subject experimental design studies were identified through systematic searches and evaluated in relation to the following variables: (a) participant and setting characteristics, (b) experimental design, (c) approach to mood assessment, (d) intervention procedures, and (e) intervention effects on mood. The experimental rigor of the included studies was evaluated on the National Autism Center's Scientific Merit Rating Scale (2009). Results suggest that behavioral interventions can be successfully used to improve the mood of individuals with ASD and that observable indices of mood can be operationally defined and measured among these individuals. These observable indices of mood could be more often measured in behavioral intervention research, particularly when improved quality of life (QoL) is a stated goal of intervention. Limitations of the current research base are discussed and suggestions for future studies incorporating measures of mood in ASD populations are offered.

AB  - Background This article overviews Canadian work on the social determinants of oral and general health noting their affinities and differences.
   Methods A literature search identified Canadian journal articles addressing the social determinants of oral health and/or oral health inequalities. Analysis identified affinities and differences with six themes in the general social determinants of health literature.
   Results While most Canadian social determinants activity focuses on physical and mental health there is a growing literature on oral health-literature reviews, empirical studies and policy analyses-with many affinities to the broader literature. In addition, since Canada provides physical and mental health services on a universal basis, but does not do so for dental care, there is a special concern with the reasons behind, and the health effects-oral, physical and mental-of the absence of publicly financed dental care.
   Conclusions The affinities between the social determinants of oral health and the broader social determinants of health literature suggests the value of establishing a common research and action agenda. This would involve collaborative research into common social determinants of oral and general health and combined policy advocacy efforts to improve Canadians' living and working conditions as means of achieving health for all.

AB  - Objective: Workplace-based employee health promotion programs often target weight loss or physical activity, yet there is growing attention to sleep as it affects employee health and performance. The goal of this review is to systematically examine workplace-based employee health interventions that measure sleep duration as an outcome.
   Data Source: We conducted systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Knowledge, EMBASE, Scopus, and PsycINFO (n = 6177 records).
   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: To be included in this systematic review, studies must include (1) individuals aged >18 years, (2) a worker health-related intervention, (3) an employee population, and (4) sleep duration as a primary or secondary outcome.
   Results: Twenty studies met criteria. Mean health promotion program duration was 2.0 months (standard deviation [SD] = 1.3), and mean follow-up was 5.6 months (SD = 6.5). The mean sample size of 395 employees (SD = 700.8) had a mean age of 41.5 years (SD = 5.2). Measures of sleep duration included self-report from a general questionnaire (n = 12, 66.6%), self-report based on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (n = 4, 22.2%), and self-report and actigraphy combined (n = 5, 27.7%). Studies most commonly included sleep hygiene (35.0%), yoga (25.0%), physical activity (10.0%), and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (10.0%) interventions. Across the interventions, 9 different behavior change techniques (BCTs) were utilized; the majority of interventions used 3 or fewer BCTs, while 1 intervention utilized 4 BCTs. Study quality, on average, was 68.9% (SD = 11.1). Half of the studies found workplace-based health promotion program exposure was associated with a desired increase in mean nightly sleep duration (n = 10, 50.0%).
   Conclusions: Our study findings suggest health promotion programs may be helpful for increasing employee sleep duration and subsequent daytime performance.

AB  - Background: There is consistent evidence showing an interplay between psychological processes and immune function in health and disease processes. Objectives: The present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide a concise overview of the effectiveness of stress-reducing psychological interventions on the activation of immune responses in both healthy subjects and patients. Methods: Included are 3 types of challenges: in vivo, in vitro, and psychophysiological. Such challenges are designed to mimic naturally occurring immune-related threats. Results: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and PsychInfo, resulting in 75 eligible studies. The risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Across all studies, a small-to-medium effect size was found for the effects of psychological interventions on optimization of the immune function (g = 0.33; 95% CI 0.22-0.43). While the largest effects were found for in vivo immune-related challenges (g = 0.61; 95% CI 0.34-0.88; especially on studies that incorporated skin tests and wound healing), studies incorporating psychophysiological challenges and in vitro immune-related stimulations similarly suggest more optimal immune responses among those receiving stress-reducing interventions (g = 0.28; 95% CI 0.15-0.42). Conclusion: These findings showed substantial heterogeneity depending on the type of challenge, the study populations, and the intervention types. These data demonstrate support for the effectiveness of stress-reducing psychological interventions in improving immunity in studies that tested immune function by means of incorporating an in vivo,in vitro, or psychophysiological challenge. Future research should more consistently incorporate challenges into the study design to gather more insights in the mechanisms underlying the optimized immune function following a psychological intervention. This is also relevant for clinical practice, as psychological interventions can possibly supplement, or at least partially replace, current drug treatments in various somatic conditions to reduce side effects.

AB  - Background Antipsychotic drugs might cause acutely occurring, serious side-effects and thus contribute to the increased physical morbidity and mortality observed in patients with severe mental health disorders. We examined this hypothesis by doing a meta-analysis of International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice-defined serious adverse events occurring in placebo-controlled trials of antipsychotics.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing second-generation antipsychotics with placebo. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for trials published in any language from database inception up until Jan 27, 2017. Trials were included without limitations in population (diagnostic category, age, sex, ethnicity), dosing regimen, blinding status, duration, or publication year. Only psychological studies lasting less than 1 day and trials done in mainland China were excluded. We contacted pharmaceutical companies, drug regulatory authorities, and study investigators for additional data. The primary outcome was the number of patients with at least one somatic serious adverse event. We estimated minimum and maximum numbers of patients with the outcome in each study group and synthesised the results with odds ratios (ORs) in a common-effects meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016033930.
   Findings We identified 597 RCTs, comprising 108 664 participants, that met the inclusion criteria. 314 trials (67 642 participants) with details on individual serious adverse events available constituted the main dataset for meta-analysis. 88% of these were 13 weeks (approximately 3 months) or shorter in duration (median 6 weeks, IQR 4-9). At least one somatic serious adverse event occurred in 698 (1.63%) to 862 (2.02%) of 42 600 patients on antipsychotics, and in 343 (1.37%) to 419 (1.67%) of 25 042 patients on placebo. The odds ratios (ORs) were 1.24 (95% CI 1.08-1.42) and 1.24 (1.10-1.41) based on the minimum and maximum estimate, respectively. In predefined subgroup analyses we found evidence suggesting a larger effect in older patients (>65 years; OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.22-1.98; 1.58, 1.25-1.99) as compared with adults (18-65 years; 1.09, 0.91-1.29; 1.10, 0.95-1.28); likewise in children or adolescents (<18 years) although the evidence was more uncertain (1.49, 0.81-2.75; 1.54, 0.85-2.77). Of 597 included RCTs, 30 (5%), 358 (60%), and 209 (35%) were rated at high, moderate, or low risk of bias, respectively. tau(2) was zero for both analyses of the primary outcome (minimum estimate, maximum estimate). A Bayesian sensitivity analysis using external information on heterogeneity gave similar results.
   Interpretation We found evidence that antipsychotics cause short-term somatic serious adverse events on top of somatic serious adverse events occurring independent of treatment. This effect appears to be mainly driven by results in older patients. Hence, clinicians should be aware that antipsychotics are potentially toxic, particularly when treating patients sharing risk factors with the older population. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although deception is used by many high-risk occupations, including military leaders, lawyers and politicians, there are currently no selection tests to determine which people have superior lie production abilities for these roles. The lack of selection tests is particularly crucial in the high-risk covert roles of undercover operations and human source management within policing. This paper uses the PRISMA systematic review technique to summarise and synthesis the extant literature examining deception theories and lie production. This paper also examines the relationship between lie production and Emotional Intelligence, and the personality traits of the Dark Triad and the HEXACO, to elucidate the characteristics of good liars. The scant research published within this field has been conducted with a variety of experimental designs and dependent variables. Generally, results indicate that the traits, skills and abilities behind sender demeanour, such as believability and honesty, may be fundamental to lie production ability. These characteristics could be considered in selection testing for to identify people with the ability to deceive effectively.

AB  - Functional traits are ecologically relevant characteristics of species. They are relevant to community structuring in face of environmental drivers (response traits) and to ecosystem processes (effect traits). For planktonic microcrustaceans, the link between functional traits and their responses or effects is not always clear. Our objective was to review the literature on linking functional traits to environmental drivers and ecosystem processes for planktonic cladocerans and copepods. Response traits are discussed in four categories: morphological, life history, behavioral, or physiological. Temperature, predation, resources, and stressors are important drivers of morphological and life-history traits. Body size, a morphological trait, is probably the most important trait, because it responds to several environmental characteristics and is correlated with physiological traits and to zooplankton impact on ecosystems functions. In an ecosystem perspective, zooplankton is an important energy link between primary producers and secondary consumers. In trophic webs, it may control phytoplankton biomass and productivity, with consequences for whole lakes. Its influence on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles is expected to increase with body size. Other traits may be important, but there is a lack of information. We point out the need of more functional trait research, especially with freshwater copepods and neglected tropical species. For a better understanding of natural systems, an integrative approach of multiple traits with multiple environmental drivers and ecosystem functions is necessary.

AB  - Background: Graphical materials can be effective communication tools, and maps in particular are a potentially powerful means of conveying spatial information. Previous reviews have provided insights on the application of cartographic best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and considerations related to risk perception and communication, but none has reviewed primary studies of the effectiveness or utility of maps to users, nor have they addressed the issue from the perspective of health literacy, environmental health literacy, or public health ethics.
   Objectives: To systematically identify and review the literature pertaining to evaluation of maps in general, or specific map features, as environmental exposure and health risk communication tools; to formulate best practice recommendations; and to identify future research priorities.
   Methods: A health science librarian searched the literature for commentaries, reviews, and primary studies. Titles, abstracts, and full-text papers were screened for inclusion, and details of methods and results were extracted from 4 reviews and commentaries and 18 primary studies. This was supplemented by one additional review and 13 additional primary studies pertaining to use of maps for communication about wildfires and floods. One additional paper was identified by reviewing reference lists of all relevant papers.
   Results: and Discussion: While there are significant gaps in the evidence, we formulated best practice recommendations highlighting the perspectives of health literacy and environmental health literacy. Key recommendations include: understanding the map developer's societal role and mental model underlying map design; defining, understanding and iteratively engaging with map users; informing map design using key theoretical constructs; accounting for factors affecting risk perception; adhering to risk communication principles and cartographic best practices; and considering environmental justice and public health ethics implications. Recommendations for future research are also provided.

AB  - Background Self-efficacy is an important determinant of physical activity but it is unclear how best to increase self-efficacy for physical activity and to maintain these changes.
   Purpose This systematic review aimed to identify which specific behavior change techniques (BCTs), BCT clusters, and number of BCTs were associated with changes in postintervention and maintained changes in self-efficacy for physical activity across all adult populations.
   Methods A systematic search yielded 180 randomized trials (204 comparisons) which reported changes in self-efficacy. BCTs were coded using the BCT Taxonomy v1. Hierarchical cluster analysis explored the clustering of BCTs. Meta-analyses and moderator analyses examined whether the presence and absence of individual BCTs in interventions were associated with effect-size changes for self-efficacy.
   Results Small intervention effects were found for postintervention self-efficacy for physical activity (d = 0.26; 95% CI: [0.21, 0.31]; I-2 = 75.8 per cent). "Information about social, environmental, and emotional consequences" was associated with higher effect sizes, whereas "social support (practical)" was associated with lower effect sizes. Small and nonsignificant effects were found for maintained changes in self-efficacy for physical activity (d = 0.08; CI: [-0.05, 0.21]; I-2 = 83.8 per cent). Lack of meaningful clustering of BCTs was found. A significant positive relationship was found between number of BCTs and effect sizes for maintained changes in self-efficacy for physical activity.
   Conclusions There does not appear to be a single effective approach to change self-efficacy for physical activity in all adults: different approaches are required for different populations. Interventions with more BCTs seem more effective at maintaining changes in self-efficacy for physical activity.

We systematically reviewed the effects of SSRIs on glycemia and whether metabolic and psychological factors moderated these effects. Methods We systematically searched for placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of SSRIs on glycemia (fasting blood glucose or HbA1c) as a primary or secondary outcome. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted to compute an overall treatment effect. Meta-regression tested whether depression, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, treatment duration, and weight loss moderated treatment effects. Results Sixteen randomized controlled trials (n = 835) were included and glycemia was usually a secondary outcome. Overall, SSRIs improved glycemia versus placebo (pooled effect size (ES) = -0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.48 to -0.21; p < .001, I-2 = 0%). Individually, fluoxetine (ES = -0.29, 95% CI = -0.54 to -0.05; p = .018) and escitalopram/citalopram (ES = -0.33, 95% CI = -0.59 to -0.07; p = .012) outperformed placebo, but paroxetine (ES = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.58 to 0.19; p = .33) did not. Results were similar in populations selected for depression as those not. Across studies, baseline insulin resistance (p = .46), treatment duration (p = .47), diabetes status (p = .41), and weight loss (p = .93) did not moderate changes. Heterogeneity for all analyses was nonsignificant. Conclusions SSRIs seem to have an association with improvement in glycemia, which is not moderated by depression status, diabetes status, or change in weight across studies. Future powered trials with longer treatment duration are needed to confirm these findings. Registration PROSPERO ID: CRD4201809239.

AB  - Gentrification is a process in which formerly declining, under-resourced, neighborhoods experience reinvestment and in-migration of increasingly affluent new residents, with understudied implications for individual health and health-protective community resources for low-income and minority residents. Increased attention on urban health inequities have propelled research on the relationship between gentrification and health. Yet, there are significant challenges inherent in the study of gentrification given its non-linear process occurring at multiple levels and via various mechanisms in a complex web of urban systems. How then have empirical studies addressed questions regarding the relationship between gentrification and health and wellness from a conceptual and methodological standpoint? Applying key search terms to PubMed and Web of Science, we identified 546 papers published in the United States. This review is guided by three foundational premises informing the inclusion and exclusion of articles. These include: 1. a clear definition of gentrification and explicit health outcome; 2. identification of a specific geographic context (United States) in which gentrification occurs, and 3. use of a social determinants of health framework to identify potential health outcomes of interest. 17 papers ma our inclusion criteria. Through systematic content analysis using MaxQDA software, we evaluated the included studies using three critical frames: 1. conceptualization of gentrification; 2. mechanisms linking gentrification and health; and 3. spatio-temporal considerations. Based on this analysis, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing research, and offer three methodological approaches to strengthen the current literature on gentrification and health. We recommend that future studies: 1. explicitly identify the mechanisms and levels at which processes can occur and systems are organized; 2. incorporate space and time into the analytical strategy and 3. articulate an epistemological standpoint driven by their conceptualization of the exposure and identification of the relevant mechanism and outcome of interest.

AB  - Objective: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of different types of physical exercise (PE) on negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Mind-body exercise (MBE), aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance training (RT) will be investigated.
   Method: The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched from their inception until April 26, 2018. Randomized controlled trials comparing PE with any control group in patients with schizophrenia were included when negative symptoms had been assessed. This meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool. Moderator, sensitivity, and meta regression analyses were conducted to explore causes of heterogeneity and impact of study quality.
   Results: We included 22 studies (N = 1249). The overall methodological quality was poor. The meta-analysis (random effects model) showed a medium significant effect in favor of any PE intervention (Hedges' g = 0.434, 95% CI = 0.196-0.671) versus any control condition. MBE and AE respectively showed a medium significant effect (Hedges' g = 0.461) and a small significant effect (Hedges' g = 0.341) versus any control condition. The effect of RT could not be examined. The overall heterogeneity was high (I-2 = 76%) and could not be reduced with moderator or sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrated that PE could be a promising intervention in the treatment of negative symptoms. However, the quality of the included studies was low and heterogeneity was high, which makes it impossible to make a clear recommendation. Therefore, results should be interpreted with care.

AB  - Objectives: We systematically reviewed the literature on risk factors for obesity in American Indians (AIs) and Alaska Natives (ANs) of all ages.
   Study design: We searched titles and abstracts in PubMed with combinations of the following terms: obesity, body mass index (BMI), American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native American.
   Methods: We limited our review to articles that provided an empirically testable claim about a variable associated with obesity, measured obesity as a dependent variable, and provided data specific to AI/ANs.
   Results: Our final sample included 31 articles; 20 examined AI/AN youth (<18 years), and 11 examined AI/AN adults (>= 18 years). Risk factors for obesity varied by age. In infants, low birth weight, early termination of breastfeeding, and high maternal BMI, and maternal diabetes increased the risk of childhood obesity. In children and adolescents, parental obesity, sedentary behaviors, and limited access to fruits and vegetables were associated with obesity. In adulthood, sedentary behaviors, diets high in fats and carbohydrates, stress, verbal abuse in childhood, and the belief that health cannot be controlled were associated with obesity.
   Conclusions: Extant studies have three limitations: they do not apply a life course perspective, they lack nationally representative data and have limited knowledge of the resilience, resistance and resourcefulness of AI/ANs. Future studies that avoid these shortcomings are needed to inform interventions to reduce the prevalence of obesity in AI/ANs across the life course. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB  - Mutations in GBA1, the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, are among the most common known genetic risk factors for the development of Parkinson disease and related synucleinopathies. A great deal is known about GBA1, as mutations in GBA1 are causal for the rare autosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease. Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the genetics and cell biology of glucocerebrosidase. A least 495 different mutations, found throughout the 11 exons of the gene are reported, including both common and rare variants. Mutations in GBA1 may lead to degradation of the protein, disruptions in lysosomal targeting and diminished performance of the enzyme in the lysosome. Gaucher disease is phenotypically diverse and has both neuronopathic and non-neuronopathic forms. Both patients with Gaucher disease and heterozygous carriers are at increased risk of developing Parkinson disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, although our understanding of the mechanism for this association remains incomplete. There appears to be an inverse relationship between glucocerebrosidase and alpha-synuclein levels, and even patients with sporadic Parkinson disease have decreased glucocerebrosidase. Glucocerebrosidase may interact with alpha-synuclein to maintain basic cellular functions, or impaired glucocerebrosidase could contribute to Parkinson pathogenesis by disrupting lysosomal homeostasis, enhancing endoplasmic reticulum stress or contributing to mitochondrial impairment. However, the majority of patients with GBA1 mutations never develop parkinsonism, so clearly other risk factors play a role. Treatments for Gaucher disease have been developed that increase visceral glucocerebrosidase levels and decrease lipid storage, although they have yet to properly address the neurological defects associated with impaired glucocerebrosidase. Mouse and induced pluripotent stem cell derived models have improved our understanding of glucocerebrosidase function and the consequences of its deficiency. These models have been used to test novel therapies including chaperone proteins, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and gene therapy approaches that enhance glucocerebrosidase levels and could prove efficacious in the treatment of forms of parkinsonism. Consequently, this rare monogenic disorder, Gaucher disease, provides unique insights directly applicable to our understanding and treatment of Parkinson disease, a common and complex neurodegenerative disorder.

AB  - Purpose The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children and young people is increasing, leading to recommendations that medical schools re-consider their curriculum content and teaching practices for child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP). The purpose of this paper is to seek guidance for undergraduate curriculum development from the wider literature on CAP curriculum content and teaching practices. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted, focussing on studies that examined undergraduate teaching of CAP. In an attempt to establish whether there is an agreed level of curriculum content and teaching practices, literature from all over the world was included. Findings Findings suggest that curriculum content and teaching practices are varied, therefore it was difficult to identify best practice upon which recommendations can be made. In addition, despite previous calls for curriculum improvements and expansion of learning objectives, recent studies suggest that there has been little change. Originality/value This paper reviewed the literature on undergraduate CAP teaching, highlighting common themes from the wider literature on medical curriculum development to inform how CAP curricula content can be developed to equip future doctors.

AB  - Understanding the threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem services posed by human impacts on coastal and marine environments requires the establishment and maintenance of ecological observatories that integrate the biological, physical, geological, and biogeochemical aspects of ecosystems. This is crucial to provide scientists and stakeholders with the support and knowledge necessary to quantify environmental change and its impact on the sustainable use of the seas and coasts. In this paper, we explore the potential for the coastal and marine components of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER) to fill this need for integrated global observation, and highlight how ecological observations are necessary to address the challenges posed by climate change and evolving human needs and stressors within the coastal zone. The ILTER is a global network encompassing 44 countries and 700 research sites in a variety of ecosystems across the planet, more than 100 of which are located in coastal and marine environments (ILTER-CMS). While most of the ILTER-CMS were established after the year 2000, in some cases they date back to the early 1900s. At ILTER sites, a broad variety of abiotic and biotic variables are measured, which may feed into other global initiatives. The ILTER community has produced tools to harmonize and compare measurements and methods, allowing for data integration workflows and analyses between and within individual ILTER sites. After a brief historical overview of ILTER, with emphasis on the marine component, we analyze the potential contribution of the ILTER-CMS to global coastal and ocean observation, adopting the "Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT)" approach. We also identify ways in which the in situ parameters collected at ILTER sites currently fit within the Essential Ocean Variables framework (as proposed by the Framework for Ocean Observation recommendations) and provide insights on the use of new technology in long-term studies. Final recommendations point at the need to further develop observational activities at LTER sites and improve coordination among them and with external related initiatives in order to maximize their exploitation and address present and future challenges in ocean observations.

AB  - Despite changes in their representation and visibility, there are still serious concerns about the inclusion and day-to-day workplace challenges various groups face (e.g., women, ethnic and cultural minorities, LGBTQ+, people as they age, and those dealing with physical or mental disabilities). Men are also underrepresented in specific work fields, in particular those in Health care, Elementary Education, and the Domestic sphere (HEED). Previous literature has shown that group stereotypes play an important role in maintaining these inequalities. We outline how insights from research into stigma, social identity, and self-regulation together increase our understanding of how targets are affected by and regulate negative stereotypes in the workplace. This approach starts from the basis that members of negatively stereotyped groups are not just passive recipients of negative attitudes, stereotypes, and behaviors but are active individuals pursuing multiple goals, such as goals for belonging and achievement. We argue that it is only by understanding stigma from the target's perspective (e.g., how targets are affected and respond) that we can successfully address workplace inequality. Key in this understanding is that stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination have taken on much more subtle forms, with consequences for the way members of stigmatized groups cope. These insights lead us to propose an approach to understanding barriers to workplace equality that highlights four key aspects: (1) the different (often subtle) potential triggers of identity threat in the workplace for members of stigmatized groups; (2) the ways in which members of stigmatized groups cope with these threats; (3) the role of supportive factors that mitigate potential threats and affect self-regulation; and (4) potential hidden costs for the self or others of what appears at first to be effective self-regulation. The focus on threats, coping, support, and potential hidden costs helps us understand why current diversity efforts are not always successful in increasing and maintaining members of stigmatized groups in organizations and provides insight into how we can aid efforts to effectively lower barriers to workplace equality.

AB  - Objectives Internet- and mobile phone-based psychological interventions have the potential to overcome many of the barriers associated with accessing traditional face-to-face therapy. Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (STB) are prevalent global health problems that may benefit from Internet- and mobile-based interventions. We provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating mobile- and Internet-based interventions for STB, including nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Methods Online databases (PsycINFO, Web of Science, Medline) were searched up to March 2019 for single-arm and controlled trials of Internet- or mobile-based interventions for STB. The potential for bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results Twenty-two eligible trials were identified. The research was limited by a lack of controlled designs and small samples. Evidence supports the acceptability of interventions. There is preliminary evidence that these interventions are associated with a decline in STB. A meta-analysis suggested a positive treatment effect on suicidal ideation when compared to treatment as usual, but not when trials with active controls were also considered. Conclusions Overall, Internet- and mobile-based interventions show promise and further controlled trials are warranted, focusing on behavioral outcomes (NSSI, suicidal behavior). This review was preregistered with PROSPERO (CRD42017074065).

AB  - Background Major efforts are underway to improve access to mental health care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) including systematic training of non-specialized health professionals and other care providers to identify and help individuals with mental disorders. In many LMIC, this effort is guided by the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) established by the World Health Organization, and commonly centres around one tool in this program: the mhGAP-Intervention Guide. Objective To identify cultural and contextual challenges in mhGAP training and implementation and potential strategies for mitigation. Method An informal consultative approach was used to analyze the authors' combined field experience in the practice of mhGAP implementation and training. We employed iterative thematic analysis to consolidate and refine lessons, challenges and recommendations through multiple drafts. Findings were organized into categories according to specific challenges, lessons learned and recommendations for future practice. We aimed to identify cross-cutting and recurrent issues. Results Based on intensive fieldwork experience with a focus on capacity building, we identify six major sets of challenges: (i) cultural differences in explanations of and attitudes toward mental disorder; (ii) the structure of the local health-care system; (iii) the level of supervision and support available post-training; (iv) the level of previous education, knowledge and skills of trainees; (v) the process of recruitment of trainees; and (vi) the larger socio-political context. Approaches to addressing these problems include: (1) cultural and contextual adaptation of training activities, (2) meaningful stakeholder and community engagement, and (3) processes that provide support to trainees, such as ongoing supervision and Communities of Practice. Conclusion Contextual and cultural factors present major barriers to mhGAP implementation and sustainability of improved services. To enable trainees to effectively apply their local cultural knowledge, mhGAP training needs to: (1) address assumptions, biases and stigma associated with mental health symptoms and problems; (2) provide an explicit framework to guide the integration of cultural knowledge into assessment, treatment negotiation, and delivery; and (3) address the specific kinds of problems, modes of clinical presentations and social predicaments seen in the local population. Continued research is needed to assess the effectiveness these strategies.

AB  - Effective treatments for pain management remain elusive due to the dangerous side-effects of current gold-standard opioid analgesics, including the respiratory depression that has led to skyrocketing death rates from opioid overdoses over the past decade. In an attempt to address the horrific opioid crisis worldwide, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has recently proposed boosting research on specific pharmacological mechanisms mediated by a number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This research is expected to expedite the discovery of medications for opioid overdose and opioid use disorders, leading toward a safer and more effective treatment of pain. Here, we review mechanistic insights from recent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a specific subset of GPCRs for which high-resolution experimental structures are available, including opioid, cannabinoid, orexin, metabotropic glutamate, and dopamine receptor subtypes.

AB  - Mental health disorders cause a large burden on global public health, with many patients living years with the disability. However, many doctors are ill-equipped to treat mental health disorders given inadequate training during their undergraduate years. In some countries, psychiatry is even considered an elective course rather than a core module. There is, therefore, a pressing need to improve the training of medical students in managing mental health disorders. Measures need to be implemented to attract students to choose psychiatry as their career. Given the developments in the fields and the challenges currently faced by trainees and early career psychiatrists, changes may also be made to the training programme in the postgraduate stage to unify the variations across the world in terms of the training duration and format. This paper will describe the ways that undergraduate and postgraduate psychiatry training may be ameliorated to improve the delivery of mental healthcare around the world and to equip doctors to face challenges in the future.

AB  - Background: Studies on teacher emotion have steadily become more prominent. However, it has been observed that scholarship on teacher emotion has been dominated by contributions from Western societies. In the absence of a critical mass of empirical research generated from within the region such as Asia, lack of knowledge and capacity to inform policy and practice in teacher education and evaluation mechanism.
   Methods: The current study sought to mirror the patterns of knowledge production in teacher emotion in terms of research topics, types, and methods and how they have evolved over time in Asia between 1989 and 2018. By using a descriptive quantitative analysis approach, we review a corpus of 154 articles on teacher emotion published in peer-review journals in Asia. It began with a systematic search in seven widely used electronic databases for abstracts of potentially relevant studies.
   Results: As observed, the trend represents a sea change in the volume of publications in Asia although the overall volume of research is still relatively low. Results also identify that although quantitative methods were most commonly used, the findings reveal a more balanced distribution since 1993. Furthermore, the use of qualitative and mixed methods of research has undergone amarked increase in the past 10 years. However, as the majority of articles were exploratory-oriented, intervention and experimental studies were largely lacking, which resulted in the 'so-what' story being missing.
   Conclusions: A functionalist perspective suggests that knowledge production in teacher emotion research in Asia is either at the late first stage or the emerging second stage. Recommendations have been provided based on the major results and challenges.

AB  - Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator that mainly exists in the nervous system. It plays a neuroprotective role in organisms and widely participates in the regulation of various physiological processes in vivo. Studies in both humans and animal models have been revealed that NPY levels are altered in some neurodegenerative and neuroimmune disorders. NPY plays various roles in these diseases, such as exerting a neuroprotective effect, increasing trophic support, decreasing excitotoxicity, regulating calcium homeostasis, and attenuating neuroinflammation. In this review, we will focus on the roles of NPY in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases, highlighting NPY as a potential therapeutic target in these diseases.

AB  - Closed-loop or intelligent neuromodulation allows adjustable, personalized neuromodulation which usually incorporates the recording of a biomarker, followed by implementation of an algorithm which decides the timing (when?) and strength (how much?) of stimulation. Closed-loop neuromodulation has been shown to have greater benefits compared to open-loop neuromodulation, particularly for therapeutic applications such as pharmacoresistant epilepsy, movement disorders and potentially for psychological disorders such as depression or drug addiction. However, an important aspect of the technique is selection of an appropriate, preferably neural biomarker. Neurochemical sensing can provide high resolution biomarker monitoring for various neurological disorders as well as offer deeper insight into neurological mechanisms. The chemicals of interest being measured, could be ions such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl-), hydrogen (H+) or neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and glutamate. This review focusses on the different building blocks necessary for a neurochemical, closed-loop neuromodulation system including biomarkers, sensors and data processing algorithms. Furthermore, it also highlights the merits and drawbacks of using this biomarker modality.

AB  - Screening for autism spectrum disorder is the first step toward early detection and diagnosis, thereby impacting the likelihood of children accessing early intervention and, importantly, improving long-term outcomes. This systematic review aimed to (a) establish a clear baseline of autism spectrum disorder screening tools currently used throughout mainland China and surrounding regions, (b) identify the strengths and limitations of these instruments, and (c) develop specific recommendations regarding screening for autism spectrum disorder throughout Chinese-speaking countries. Databases were searched for recent (2015-2018) articles published in Chinese or English languages. Twenty-two studies (13 Chinese, 9 English) met inclusion criteria; two from Taiwan and the remainder from mainland China. Studies varied greatly in the extent of psychometric analyses and reported autism spectrum disorder prevalence. The majority of diagnoses were based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. (DSM-IV) or 5th ed. (DSM-5)) criteria, although a small number of studies utilized gold-standard diagnostic assessment instruments. It is recommended that a systematic, multi-tiered, screening network be established to improve the identification of autism spectrum disorder in China and surrounding regions. Assessment and diagnosis need to be culturally appropriate, and amenable to low-resource settings. In addition, increased public awareness programs to reduce stigma will be important in improving outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - Astrocytes are key cellular partners for neurons in the central nervous system. Astrocytes react to virtually all types of pathological alterations in brain homeostasis by significant morphological and molecular changes. This response was classically viewed as stereotypical and is called astrogliosis or astrocyte reactivity. It was long considered as a nonspecific, secondary reaction to pathological conditions, offering no clues on disease-causing mechanisms and with little therapeutic value. However, many studies over the last 30 years have underlined the crucial and active roles played by astrocytes in physiology, ranging from metabolic support, synapse maturation, and pruning to fine regulation of synaptic transmission. This prompted researchers to explore how these new astrocyte functions were changed in disease, and they reported alterations in many of them (sometimes beneficial, mostly deleterious). More recently, cell-specific transcriptomics revealed that astrocytes undergo massive changes in gene expression when they become reactive. This observation further stressed that reactive astrocytes may be very different from normal, nonreactive astrocytes and could influence disease outcomes. To make the picture even more complex, both normal and reactive astrocytes were shown to be molecularly and functionally heterogeneous. Very little is known about the specific roles that each subtype of reactive astrocytes may play in different disease contexts. In this review, we have interrogated researchers in the field to identify and discuss points of consensus and controversies about reactive astrocytes, starting with their very name. We then present the emerging knowledge on these cells and future challenges in this field.

AB  - The advances in medicine, together with lifestyle modifications, led to a rising life expectancy. Unfortunately, however, aging is accompanied by an alarming boost of age-associated chronic pathologies, including neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Interestingly, a non-negligible interplay between alterations of glucose homeostasis and brain dysfunction has clearly emerged. In particular, epidemiological studies have pointed out a possible association between Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Insulin resistance, one of the major hallmark for etiology of T2D, has a detrimental influence on PD, negatively affecting PD phenotype, accelerating its progression and worsening cognitive impairment. This review aims to provide an exhaustive analysis of the most recent evidences supporting the key role of insulin resistance in PD pathogenesis. It will focus on the relevance of insulin in the brain, working as pro-survival neurotrophic factor and as a master regulator of neuronal mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Insulin action as a modulator of dopamine signaling and of alpha-synuclein degradation will be described in details, too. The intriguing idea that shared deregulated pathogenic pathways represent a link between PD and insulin resistance has clinical and therapeutic implications. Thus, ongoing studies about the promising healing potential of common antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, exenatide, DPP IV inhibitors, thiazolidinediones and bromocriptine, will be summarized and the rationale for their use to decelerate neurodegeneration will be critically assessed.

AB  - A changing climate is driving increasingly common and prolonged marine heatwaves (MHWs) and these extreme events have now been widely documented to severely impact marine ecosystems globally. However, MHWs have rarely been considered when examining temperature-induced degradation of coral reef ecosystems. Here we consider extreme, localized thermal anomalies, nested within broader increases in sea surface temperature, which fulfill the definitive criteria for MHWs. These acute and intense events, referred to here as MHW hotspots, are not always well represented in the current framework used to describe coral bleaching, but do have distinct ecological outcomes, including widespread bleaching, and rapid mass mortality of putatively thermally tolerant coral species. The physical drivers of these localized hotspots are discussed here, and in doing so we present a comprehensive theoretical framework that links the biological responses of the coral photo-endosymbiotic organism to extreme thermal stress and ecological changes on reefs as a consequence of MHW hotspots. We describe how the rapid onset of high temperatures drives immediate heat-stress induced cellular damage, overwhelming mechanisms that would otherwise mitigate the impact of gradually accumulated thermal stress. The warm environment, and increased light penetration of the coral skeleton due to the loss of coral tissues, coupled with coral tissue decay support rapid microbial growth in the skeletal microenvironment, resulting in the widely unrecognized consequence of rapid decay, and degeneration of the coral skeletons. This accelerated degeneration of coral skeletons on a reef scale hinder the recovery of coral populations and increase the likelihood of phase shifts toward algal dominance. We suggest that MHW hotspots, through driving rapid heatinduced mortality, compromise reefs' structural frameworks to the detriment of long term recovery. We propose that MHW hotspots be considered as a distinct class of thermal stress events in coral reefs, and that the current framework used to describe coral bleaching and mass mortality be expanded to include these. We urge further research into how coral mortality affects bioerosion by coral endoliths.

AB  - Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta and intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies (LB). During the course of disease, misfolded alpha-synuclein, the major constituent of LB, spreads to different regions of the brain in a prion-like fashion, giving rise to successive non-motor and motor symptoms. Etiology is likely multifactorial, and involves interplay among aging, genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Main body The prevalence of PD rises exponentially with age, and aging is associated with impairment of cellular pathways which increases susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons to cell death. However, the majority of those over the age of 80 do not have PD, thus other factors in addition to aging are needed to cause disease. Discovery of neurotoxins which can result in parkinsonism led to efforts in identifying environmental factors which may influence PD risk. Nevertheless, the causality of most environmental factors is not conclusively established, and alternative explanations such as reverse causality and recall bias cannot be excluded. The lack of geographic clusters and conjugal cases also go against environmental toxins as a major cause of PD. Rare mutations as well as common variants in genes such as SNCA, LRRK2 and GBA are associated with risk of PD, but Mendelian causes collectively only account for 5% of PD and common polymorphisms are associated with small increase in PD risk. Heritability of PD has been estimated to be around 30%. Thus, aging, genetics and environmental factors each alone is rarely sufficient to cause PD for most patients. Conclusion PD is a multifactorial disorder involving interplay of aging, genetics and environmental factors. This has implications on the development of appropriate animal models of PD which take all these factors into account. Common converging pathways likely include mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, which are associated with the accumulation and spread of misfolded alpha-synuclein and neurodegeneration. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of PD may lead to potential therapeutic targets to prevent PD or modify its course.

AB  - Amending soils with biochar is increasingly proposed as a solution to many pressing agricultural and environmental challenges. Biochar, created by thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment, has several purported benefits, including remediation of contaminated soils, increased crop yields, reduced fertilizer demands, increased plant available water, and mitigation of climate change. Due to these potential benefits, biochar-related research has flourished in the past decade, though there remains a critically understudied area of research regarding biochar's potential impact on human health. Because biochar characteristically has low bulk density and high porosity, the material is susceptible to atmospheric release via natural or mechanical soil disturbance. The specific risks of biochar inhalation have not been elucidated; however, recent publications have demonstrated that biochar can increase soil dust emissions of particles <10 mu m (PM10) or possess elevated levels of toxic chemicals. These data should not be interpreted to suggest that all biochars are problematic, but rather to highlight an important and overlooked field of study, and to stress the need to critically assess parameters for biochar production and management strategies that safeguard human health. Here the literature on biochar-related dust emissions and potentially toxic properties (PTPs) is reviewed in order to summarize what is known, highlight areas for future study, and aggregate solutions to minimize potential harm.

AB  - Background Targeted chronic disease programs are vital to improving health outcomes for Indigenous people globally. In Australia it is not known where evaluated chronic disease programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been implemented. This scoping review geographically examines where evaluated chronic disease programs for Aboriginal people have been implemented in the Australian primary health care setting. Secondary objectives include scoping programs for evidence of partnerships with Aboriginal organisations, and use of ethical protocols. By doing so, geographical gaps in the literature and variations in ethical approaches to conducting program evaluations are highlighted. Methods The objectives, inclusion criteria and methods for this scoping review were specified in advance and documented in a published protocol. This scoping review was undertaken in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology. The search included 11 academic databases, clinical trial registries, and the grey literature. Results The search resulted in 6894 citations, with 241 retrieved from the grey literature and targeted organisation websites. Title, abstract, and full-text screening was conducted by two independent reviewers, with 314 citations undergoing full review. Of these, 74 citations evaluating 50 programs met the inclusion criteria. Of the programs included in the geographical analysis (n = 40), 32.1% were implemented in Major Cities and 29.6% in Very Remote areas of Australia. A smaller proportion of programs were delivered in Inner Regional (12.3%), Outer Regional (18.5%) and Remote areas (7.4%) of Australia. Overall, 90% (n = 45) of the included programs collaborated with an Aboriginal organisation in the implementation and/or evaluation of the program. Variation in the use of ethical guidelines and protocols in the evaluation process was evident. Conclusions A greater focus on the evaluation of chronic disease programs for Aboriginal people residing in Inner and Outer Regional areas, and Remote areas of Australia is required. Across all geographical areas further efforts should be made to conduct evaluations in partnership with Aboriginal communities residing in the geographical region of program implementation. The need for more scientifically and ethically rigorous approaches to Aboriginal health program evaluations is evident.

AB  - This systematic review aimed to examine the associations between health-related outcomes and the built environment (BE) characteristics of compact metropolitan cities in Korea using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Searching the three Korean academic databases and PubMed, two independent reviewers identified 27 empirical articles published between 2011 and 2016. Data extracted for review included the study characteristics, the variables and measurement methods related to the BE and health-related outcomes, and the findings on the associations between the BE characteristics and health-related outcomes. Vote counting was used to assess the consistency of associations and the direction of associations between the BE characteristics and health-related outcomes. All of the reviewed studies used cross-sectional designs. The objective BE qualities were commonly examined. The BE characteristics associated with health-related outcomes in the reviewed articles included land use, street environment, transportation infrastructure, green and open spaces, and neighborhood facilities. Street environment, transportation infrastructure, and green and open spaces had consistent positive associations with physical health. Mixed land use and neighborhood facilities, however, had inconsistent associations with physical health. Generally, insufficient findings were reported in the association between the BE characteristics and mental and social health. The accessibility of the BE in a compact urban environment was the prominent attribute related to health promotion, health challenges, and health equity. An international comparative analysis of compact cities with different urban contexts and scale is required. Interdisciplinary urban health strategies are recommended based on the associations between the BE characteristics and health-related outcomes.

AB  - The association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and pubertal timing has been a topic of enduring controversy. A systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science databases was undertaken to quantify the magnitude of total and specific forms of ACEs effects on early pubertal timing among girls. Our search identified 3280 records, of which 43 studies with 46 independent data sets met inclusion criteria. We estimated pooled effect sizes (Cohen's ds) for the association between ACEs with early pubertal timing. Total ACEs was not associated with early pubertal timing. When we examined the specific types of ACEs, associations were small to medium for father absence (d = -0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.63, -0.16) and small for sexual abuse (d = -0.13, CI: -0.17, -0.10) and family dysfunction (d = -0.08, CI: -0.11, -0.02). We identified considerable heterogeneity between estimates for almost all of the outcomes. ACEs exposure may affect female reproductive reproduction, particularly father absence, sexual abuse, and family dysfunction. We propose that future research in this area test a theoretical model linking adversity with earlier reproductive strategy, which includes early pubertal timing as a core component linking early adversity and stress physiology with poor health outcomes later in life in females.

AB  - Culture plays a significant role in the variations observed in the manifestation, expression, and meaning of attachment behaviors. Africa is home to multiple cultures, with distinct organizations of caregiving relationships underlying the development of attachment. This review aims to consolidate knowledge about African attachment by describing studies of infant attachment conducted in Africa since Mary Ainsworth's Ugandan findings in 1967. Electronic databases were searched with the terms "Africa" ("attachment" or "bond") and "infant." Nine studies that assessed infant attachment style with self-report or observation methods were included, but spanned only five countries. The Strange Situation Procedure was most frequently used. Most studies described dyads living in peri-urban or township areas. Multiple socioeconomic factors affecting living conditions were identified, including, unemployment, financial difficulties, limited education, poor housing, single parenthood, lack of partner support, substance abuse, and depression. Overall distributions of attachment classification proportions appear consistent with global attachment-classification patterns. Despite adverse conditions, secure attachment was relatively widespread, and some populations had low rates of avoidant attachment. Relatively high rates of disorganized attachment were found when the category was included. Africa remains an understudied continent regarding infant attachment. The continent's cultural diversity may hold important truths necessary for understanding the complex relationship between infant and attachment figure.

AB  - Purpose of Review Neuropsychiatric syndromes (NPS) are common in neurodegenerative disorders (NDD). This review describes the role of NPS in the diagnosis of NDD, criteria for the diagnosis of NPS, management of NPS, and agents in clinical trials for NPS. Recent Findings NPS play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of NDD. Consensus diagnostic criteria have evolved for psychosis, depression, agitation, and apathy in NDD. With one exception-pimavanserin is approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson's disease-there are no drugs approved by the FDA for treatment of NPS in NDD. Trials show that atypical antipsychotics reduce psychosis in AD and in Parkinson's disease, although side effect concerns have constrained their use. Antidepressants show benefit in treatment of Parkinson's disease with depression. Several agents are in clinical trials for treatment of NPS in NDD. Neuropsychiatric syndromes play a major role in NDD diagnosis. Clinical criteria allow recognition of NPS in NDD. Psychotropic medications are often useful in the treatment of NPS in NDD; efficacious, safe, and approved agents are needed.

AB  - Progressive neurological deterioration poses enormous burden on the aging population with ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative disease patients, such as Alzheimers' disease and Parkinson's disease. The past two decades have witnessed remarkable advances in the research of neurovascular unit dysfunction, which is emerging as an important pathological feature that underlies these neurological disorders. Dysfunction of the unit allows penetration of blood-derived toxic proteins or leukocytes into the brain and contributes to white matter injury, disturbed neurovascular coupling and neuroinflammation, which all eventually lead to cognitive dysfunction. Recent evidences suggest that aging-related oxidative stress, accumulated DNA damage and impaired DNA repair capacities compromises the genome integrity not only in neurons, but also in other cell types of the neurovascular unit, such as endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Combating DNA damage or enhancing DNA repair capacities in the neurovascular unit represents a promising therapeutic strategy for vascular and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we focus on aging related mechanisms that underlie DNA damage and repair in the neurovascular unit and introduce several novel strategies that target the genome integrity in the neurovascular unit to combat the vascular and neurodegenerative disorders in the aging brain.

AB  - The brain is the most complex of human organs, and the pathophysiology underlying abnormal brain function in psychiatric disorders is largely unknown. Despite the rapid development of diagnostic tools and treatments in most areas of medicine, our understanding of mental disorders and their treatment has made limited progress during the last decades. While recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have a large potential, the complexity and multidimensionality of the brain processes hinder the discovery of disease mechanisms that would link genetic findings to clinical symptoms and behavior. This applies also to schizophrenia, for which genome-wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic risk loci, spanning hundreds of genes with diverse functionalities. Importantly, the multitude of the associated variants and their prevalence in the healthy population limit the potential of a reductionist functional genetics approach as a stand-alone solution to discover the disease pathology. In this review, we outline the key concepts of a "biophysical psychiatry," an approach that employs large-scale mechanistic, biophysics-founded computational modelling to increase transdisciplinary understanding of the pathophysiology and strive toward robust predictions. We discuss recent scientific advances that allow a synthesis of previously disparate fields of psychiatry, neurophysiology, functional genomics, and computational modelling to tackle open questions regarding the pathophysiology of heritable mental disorders. We argue that the complexity of the increasing amount of genetic data exceeds the capabilities of classical experimental assays and requires computational approaches. Biophysical psychiatry, based on modelling diseased brain networks using existing and future knowledge of basic genetic, biochemical, and functional properties on a single neuron to a microcircuit level, may allow a leap forward in deriving interpretable biomarkers and move the field toward novel treatment options.

AB  - We conducted this meta-analysis of double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials to estimate the efficacy of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in the improvement of depression. We applied a systematic bibliographic search in PubMed and EMBASE for articles published prior to 20 December 2017. This meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and R 3.4.3, and means and standard deviations were calculated in fixed- or random-effects models based on the results of the Q-test. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the stability of the results, and publication bias was evaluated by a funnel plot and Egger's linear regression analysis. Our search resulted in 180 articles; we analyzed 26 studies, which included 2160 participants. The meta-analysis showed an overall beneficial effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on depression symptoms (SMD = -0.28, P = 0.004). Compared with placebo, EPA-pure (= 100% EPA) and EPA-major formulations (>= 60% EPA) demonstrated clinical benefits with an EPA dosage <= 1 g/d (SMD = -0.50, P = 0.003, and SMD = -1.03, P = 0.03, respectively), whereas DHA-pure and DHA-major formulations did not exhibit such benefits. Current evidence supports the finding that omega-3 PUFAs with EPA >= 60% at a dosage of <= 1 g/d would have beneficial effects on depression. Further studies are warranted to examine supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs for specific subgroups of subjects with inflammation, severity of depression, and the dose response for both EPA and DHA supplementation.

AB  - Purpose/aim: Motor imagery (MI) is the mental representation of a movement without engaging its actual execution. MI shares neuroanatomical correlates with brain motor networks. Neurologic disorders affecting motor skills, such as stroke, have been related to impairments in MI. A descriptive review was conducted to explore the effects of stroke on MI ability and its background mechanisms.Materials and Methods: We searched on PubMed and Web of Science databases and screening references of included studies and review articles for additional citations.Results: On a total of 885 studies, only 15 articles met inclusion criteria. Results suggested that MI is impaired after stroke, in implicit and explicit abilities. Impairments in mental chronometry as well as in accuracy and reaction times were observed.Conclusions: Neuroimaging findings confirmed a brain reorganization after a stroke and a compensatory over-usage of contralesional hemisphere was highlighted.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review to summarise currently implemented interventions, investigating their effectiveness in reducing alcohol use and sexual risk taking behaviour in teenagers and young adults.
   Study design: This is a systematic review.
   Methods: Studies published in English language with both alcohol and sexual risky behaviour reduction interventions were searched using five electronic database platforms. All review tasks such as study screening, selection, data extraction, quality rating and synthesis were performed in accordance with systematic review guidelines.
   Results: The review included 18 studies. Fifteen studies were randomised control trials (RCTs), whereas three were interventional studies having pre-intervention and postintervention analysis. Overall study duration ranged from 6 months to 24 months. The retention rate decreased with an increase in study duration and ranged from 60% to 80% for majority of studies, whereas some studies particularly planned for a shorter period had a higher retention rate (>= 90%). The study site showed a range of patterns (in schools/ college = 5, at family level/home environment = 3, web based = 2, sexual health clinics = 2, mental health clinics = 1, community level = 1 and juvenile detention facility = 4). The study quality assessment showed that most studies were of medium to high quality. Evidence from this systematic review suggests that after interventions, young people are less likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour and choose harmful alcohol drinking. The major factors influencing individuals during adolescence and early adulthood include local cultural norms, acceptability of casual sex and binge drinking trends in the teenage and young communities. It was also observed that study setting and target population determine the type of intervention required and impacts on outcomes.
   Conclusions: This review suggests that interventions to reduce risky sexual behaviour and alcohol consumption work in teenagers and young adults. However, selection of appropriate intervention type/design, delivery methods and follow-up plans are key elements to ensure both uptake and success of such intervention projects.

AB  - This paper proposes a state-of-the-art research for aspect-based sentiment analysis of Arabic Hotels' reviews using two implementations of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The first one is (a) a character-level bidirectional LSTM along with conditional random field classifier (Bi-LSTM-CRF) for aspect opinion target expressions (OTEs) extraction, and the second one is (b) an aspect-based LSTM for aspect sentiment polarity classification in which the aspect-OTEs are considered as attention expressions to support the sentiment polarity identification. Proposed approaches are evaluated using a reference dataset of Arabic Hotels' reviews. Results show that our approaches outperform baseline research on both tasks with an enhancement of 39% for the task of aspect-OTEs extraction and 6% for the aspect sentiment polarity classification task.

AB  - Background: Studies evaluating the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies for major depressive disorder (MDD) commonly include participants who do not demonstrate elevated concentrations of baseline inflammatory mediators, or simply fail to assess baseline inflammation. This may result in an underestimation of the efficacy of such treatment strategies.
   Sampling and methods: This systematic review included randomized controlled trials related to the use of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies in individuals who demonstrate elevated concentrations of inflammatory mediators, identified by searching OVID MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE, and OVID PsychINFO.
   Results: Fifty-one randomized controlled trials were identified via a title and abstract screen, of which 43 were excluded following full-text screening. Of the 8 included trials (n = 437), 5 utilized anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals, 2 utilized omega-3 fatty acids, and 1 utilized exercise and meditation. Among these studies, only the trial related to exercise and meditation demonstrated both an elevation in baseline inflammation, and a significant reduction in inflammation following intervention. Issues related to insufficient interventions and/or lack of reporting of inflammatory mediators at one or more time-points were common.
   Conclusion: Among the growing number of studies which examine the potential antidepressant benefit of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies, few have studied populations which demonstrate elevated baseline concentrations. Further, studies commonly fail to induce significant changes in inflammation following intervention. Together, this may explain the low efficacy frequently reported with such interventions. Future studies which utilize both stronger interventions (sufficient to reduce levels of inflammation), and participants with elevated baseline concentrations, may produce a more substantial influence on symptoms of (MDD).

AB  - Purpose of ReviewEvidence regarding the treatment of late-life depression is not necessarily generalizable to persons with a neurocognitive disorder and comorbid depression. Thus, this article reviews recent evidence that pertains to the treatment of depression in older adults with neurocognitive disorders, and synthesizes and critically analyzes this literature to identify methodological issues and gaps for the purpose of future research.Recent FindingsControlled trials and meta-analyses examining depression treatment in neurocognitive disorders, published between 2015 and 2019 (N=16 reports), can be divided into those addressing pharmacotherapy, psychological and behavioral therapy, and somatic therapy. The evidence generally does not support benefit of antidepressant medication over placebo in treating depressive disorders in dementia. No pharmacological studies since 2015 have examined antidepressant medication in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Problem adaptation therapy demonstrates efficacy for depression in MCI and mild dementia. Other psychological and behavioral interventions for depressive symptoms in dementia demonstrate mixed findings. The only somatic treatment trials published since 2015 have assessed bright light therapy, with positive findings but methodological limitations.SummaryPsychological, behavioral, and somatic treatments represent promising treatment options for depression in neurocognitive disorders, but further studies are needed, particularly in participants with depressive disorders rather than subclinical depressive symptoms. Little is known about the treatment of depression in patients with MCI, and rigorous identification of MCI in late-life depression treatment trials will help to advance knowledge in this area. Addressing methodological issues, particularly the diagnosis and measurement of clinically significant depression in dementia, will help to move the field forward.

AB  - The frequency of extreme heat events, such as the summer of 2003 in Europe, and their corresponding consequences for human beings are expected to increase under a warmer climate. The joint collaboration of institutional agencies and multidisciplinary approaches is essential for a successful development of heat-health warning systems and action plans which can reduce the impacts of extreme heat on the population. The present work constitutes a state-of-the-art review of 16 European heat-health warning systems and heat-health action plans, based on the existing literature, web search (over the National Meteorological Services websites) and questionnaires. The aim of this study is to pave the way for future heat-health warning systems, such as the one currently under development in the framework of the Horizon 2020 HEAT-SHIELD project. Some aspects are highlighted among the variety of examined European warning systems. The meteorological variables that trigger the warnings should present a clear link with the impact under consideration and should be chosen depending on the purpose and target of the warnings. Setting long-term planning actions as well as pre-alert levels might prevent and reduce damages due to heat. Finally, education and communication are key elements of the success of a warning system.

AB  - Introduction: Mindfulness interventions have been increasingly incorporated into clinical settings. Evidence supporting mindfulness practices are predominantly established in Western populations. Neurophysiological evidence has not been established to support the effectiveness of mindfulness practice in Asian populations. Greater understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying mindfulness would enable hemodynamics as measured by fNIRS to be used to monitor mindfulness practice as an adjunct to psychotherapy with Asian clients.
   Method: Research relating to fNIRS and hemodynamics for mindfulness in Asians was reviewed. The inclusion criteria for this review were recent publications in peer-reviewed journals from 2008 to 2018, with the search terms 'fNIRS', 'hemodynamics' and 'mindfulness', for studies in Asia.
   Findings: Databases included Medline, PubMed, PSYCINFO, Google Scholar and SCOPUS. Initial searches yielded 86 results. Five duplicated articles were removed, and remaining abstracts were screened; and assessed for eligibility against the structured performa. Three full text papers which fit the inclusion criteria were included in the current review.
   Conclusion: This review highlighted the paucity of rigorous empirically validated research for hemodynamics as measured with fNIRS for mindfulness practice in Asia.

AB  - Studies related to psychopathy and EEG have increased over the past decade making it a good time to examine where the field is on this topic as well as to determine future directions. The current study reviewed 68 research reports that focused on psychopathy and various components of EEG. We examined early, mid, and late level ERP processing as well as spectra analyses. The results indicate that psychopathic individuals exhibit generally unencumbered performance categorizing cognitive stimuli and demonstrate the typical facilitation of physical responses commensurate with an intact orienting response. Moreover, the results suggest that individuals with elevated psychopathic traits are especially adept at screening out distracting threat-related and other irrelevant information allowing them to allocate attention to stimuli that are goal-relevant. Those with elevated psychopathic traits also do not appear to have significant impairments in associative learning or error processing. Where psychopathic individuals diverge most from those with low levels of these traits is in relation to processing affect-laden content. In some contexts, psychopathic individuals appear to quickly terminate the processing of emotional information and in other contexts (e.g., seeing others in pain) they elaborately process emotional information both of which may help explain their prototypical lack of conscience. Much of the aberrant functioning of those with elevated psychopathic traits depends on the psychopathy factor being examined with F1 traits showing less cognitive impairment than F2 traits. Recommendations for future research are provided.

AB  - Bioactive sphingolipids-ceramide, sphingosine, and their respective 1-phosphates (C1P and S1P)-are signaling molecules serving as intracellular second messengers. Moreover, S1P acts through G protein-coupled receptors in the plasma membrane. Accumulating evidence points to sphingolipids' engagement in brain aging and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Metabolic alterations observed in the course of neurodegeneration favor ceramide-dependent pro-apoptotic signaling, while the levels of the neuroprotective S1P are reduced. These trends are observed early in the diseases' development, suggesting causal relationship. Mechanistic evidence has shown links between altered ceramide/S1P rheostat and the production, secretion, and aggregation of amyloid beta/alpha-synuclein as well as signaling pathways of critical importance for the pathomechanism of protein conformation diseases. Sphingolipids influence multiple aspects of Akt/protein kinase B signaling, a pathway that regulates metabolism, stress response, and Bcl-2 family proteins. The cross-talk between sphingolipids and transcription factors including NF-kappa B, FOXOs, and AP-1 may be also important for immune regulation and cell survival/death. Sphingolipids regulate exosomes and other secretion mechanisms that can contribute to either the spread of neurotoxic proteins between brain cells, or their clearance. Recent discoveries also suggest the importance of intracellular and exosomal pools of small regulatory RNAs in the creation of disturbed signaling environment in the diseased brain. The identified interactions of bioactive sphingolipids urge for their evaluation as potential therapeutic targets. Moreover, the early disturbances in sphingolipid metabolism may deliver easily accessible biomarkers of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - There are many systematic reviews on social capital (SC) and various health outcomes, but each of these reviews shows one piece of the larger SC and health puzzle. The aim of this research was to systematically review systematic reviews on SC and health, in order to provide an overview of existing evidence and to identify strategies for future research. Nine databases were searched for key words that could fall under the broad umbrella of SC and health outcomes. We screened 4941 titles and abstracts and read 187 reviews before retaining 20 of them. A critical appraisal of each review was conducted. The reviews show there is good evidence to suggest that SC predicts better mental and physical health, and indicators of SC are protective against mortality. At the same time, many reviews also found numerous non-significant and negative relationships that are important to consider. It was unclear whether SC interventions for health were really improving SC, or other aspects of the social environment. Overall, this research shows that evidence on how various aspects of SC affect different health outcomes for different actors remains unclear. Intergroup and lifecourse perspectives could help clarify this link. Future research could benefit from conceptualizing the link between SC and health in a what, who, where, when, why and how framework.

AB  - As molecular biology advances, an increasing number of proteins are becoming detectable at very low levels in different biological tissues. In this regard, saliva holds vast promise. Unlike blood, saliva can be sampled 1) non-invasively; 2) across all ages (newborn to elderly); 3) in the field; 4) by study participants; and 5) many times per day. With respect to psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), physiological measures of stress such as cortisol have been well characterized. Alpha amylase provides another physiological index of stress; it is a measure of autonomic nervous system activation and is quantifiable in saliva. Other salivary measures, such as inflammatory biomarkers and immunoglobulin A (IgA), provide valuable information pertaining to the effects of stress on inflammation, mucosal immunity, and oral health. Importantly, due to various methodological issues and a lack of strong correlation between saliva and blood measures, investigators should proceed with caution in drawing conclusions from measures of salivary inflammation that pertain to systemic immunity or generalized health.

AB  - Maintained gamma band activity is a key element of higher brain function, participating in perception, executive function, and memory. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as part of the reticular activating system (RAS), is a major source of the "bottom-up" flow of gamma activity to higher regions. However, interruption of gamma band activity is associated with a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review will focus on the role of the PPN in activating higher regions to induce arousal and descending pathways to modulate posture and locomotion. As such, PPN deep brain stimulation (DBS) can not only help regulate arousal and stepping, but continuous application may help maintain necessary levels of gamma band activity for a host of other brain processes. We will explore the potential future applications of PPN DBS for a number of disorders that are characterized by disturbances in gamma band maintenance.

AB  - The Mindfulness-to-Meaning Theory (MMT) is a temporally dynamic process model of mindful positive emotion regulation that elucidates downstream cognitive-affective mechanisms by which mindfulness promotes health and resilience. Here we review and extend the MMT to explicate how mindfulness fosters self-transcendence by evoking upward spirals of decentering, attentional broadening, reappraisal, and savoring. Savoring is highlighted as a key, potential means of inducing absorptive experiences of oneness between subject and object, amplifying the salience of the object while imbuing the sensory-perceptual field with affective meaning. Finally, this article provides new evidence that inducing self-transcendent positive emotions and nondual states of awareness through mindfulness-based interventions may restructure reward processing and thereby produce therapeutic effects on addictive behavior (e.g. opioid misuse) and chronic pain syndromes.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is a global epidemic. Sri Lanka has experienced a doubling of the disease every 4 or 5 years since it was first identified in the North Central province in the mid-1990s. The disease primarily affects people in agricultural regions who are missing the commonly known risk factors for CKD. Sri Lanka is not alone: health workers have reported prevalence of CKDu in Mexico, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. A global search for the cause of CKDu has not identified a single factor, but rather many factors that may contribute to the etiology of the disease. Some of these factors include heat stroke leading to dehydration, toxic metals such as cadmium and arsenic, fluoride, low selenium, toxigenic cyanobacteria, nutritionally deficient diet and mycotoxins from mold exposure. Furthermore, exposure to agrichemicals, particularly glyphosate and paraquat, are likely compounding factors, and may be the primary factors. Here, we argue that glyphosate in particular is working synergistically with most of the other factors to increase toxic effects. We propose, further, that glyphosate causes insidious harm through its action as an amino acid analogue of glycine, and that this interferes with natural protective mechanisms against other exposures. Glyphosate's synergistic health effects in combination with exposure to other pollutants, in particular paraquat, and physical labor in the ubiquitous high temperatures of lowland tropical regions, could result in renal damage consistent with CKDu in Sri Lanka.

AB  - The issue of potential long-term or hereditary effects for both humans and wildlife exposed to low doses (or dose rates) of ionising radiation is a major concern. Chronic exposure to ionising radiation, defined as an exposure over a large fraction of the organism's lifespan or even over several generations, can possibly have consequences in the progeny. Recent work has begun to show that epigenetics plays an important role in adaptation of organisms challenged to environmental stimulae. Changes to so-called epigenetic marks such as histone modifications, DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs result in altered transcriptomes and proteomes, without directly changing the DNA sequence. Moreover, some of these environmentally-induced epigenetic changes tend to persist over generations, and thus, epigenetic modifications are regarded as the conduits for environmental influence on the genome.
   Here, we review the current knowledge of possible involvement of epigenetics in the cascade of responses resulting from environmental exposure to ionising radiation. In addition, from a comparison of lab and field obtained data, we investigate evidence on radiation-induced changes in the epigenome and in particular the total or locus specific levels of DNA methylation. The challenges for future research and possible use of changes as an early warning (biomarker) of radiosensitivity and individual exposure is discussed. Such a biomarker could be used to detect and better understand the mechanisms of toxic action and inter/intra-species susceptibility to radiation within an environmental risk assessment and management context.

AB  - Objective: Housing First is increasingly put forward as an important component of a pragmatic plan to end homelessness. The literature evaluating the impact of Housing First on criminal justice involvement has not yet been systematically examined. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the impact of Housing First on criminal justice outcomes among homeless people with mental illness. Method: Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science) were searched up until July 2018 for randomised and nonrandomised studies of Housing First among homeless people with a serious mental disorder. Results: Five studies were included for a total of 7128 participants. Two studies from a randomised controlled trial found no effect of Housing First on arrests compared to treatment as usual. Other studies compared Housing First to other programs or compared configurations of HF and found reductions in criminal justice involvement among Housing First participants. Conclusions: This systematic review suggests that Housing First, on average, has little impact on criminal justice involvement. Community services such as Housing First are potentially an important setting to put in place strategies to reduce criminal justice involvement. However, forensic mental health approaches such as risk assessment and management strategies and interventions may need to be integrated into existing services to better address potential underlying individual criminogenic risk factors. Further outcome assessment studies would be necessary.

AB  - Although there is substantial evidence supporting the existence of neurocognitive impairment in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), few studies have explored the field from an endophenotypic perspective. The present systematic review sought to identify longitudinal family studies exploring suitable neurocognitive endophenotypes in unaffected relatives of patients with SZ and/or BD. Following the PRISMA statement, only five follow-up studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 79 SZ patients, 159 SZ unaffected relatives of SZ, 131 BD patients, 77 unaffected relatives of BD, and 248 controls. Verbal memory, auditory attention, face memory and emotion processing were found as putative endophenotypic candidates for SZ, whereas this strategy identified none for BD. Substantial heterogeneity and lack of standardization in global neurocognitive assessment within this area should be pointed out; nevertheless, several candidate endophenotypes were identified for SZ, except for executive impairment.

AB  - Prospection, or thinking about the future, is currently a topic of significant interdisciplinary research interest. Episodic foresight is considered a complex form of prospection that enables people to generate mental models of future scenarios with which to guide actions. In this article, we systematically review the available episodic foresight measurement instruments. PubMed and PsycInfo were searched through July, 2017 and manual searches of published reviews and snowball searches of included studies were also performed. The initial search yielded 970 records after the removal of duplicates, of which 363 underwent full-text screening. Studies that did not measure the imagination of future scenarios in adult humans, or that were not reported in English, were excluded. The review consists of 303 articles classified into two broad categories, content measures and generation measures, that were further subdivided into one or more of six subcategories: (i) phenomenology (60%); (ii) examination (49%); (iii) fluency (12%); (iii) reaction time (12%); sentence completion (5%); and thought sampling (2%). We catalogue the available instruments in these sections, and provide a summary overview of each category. Following phenomenological measures, the adapted Autobiographical Interview and measures of specificity were the most frequently used instruments. We conclude that none of the available instruments have been appropriately validated for use, and therefore suggest caution with the use of any of the included measures. The development of behavioural measures designed to capture degrees of episodic foresight ability in functionally relevant contexts among humans would provide a major advance over the currently available instruments.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a complex disorder with clinical manifestations in early adulthood. However, it may start with disruption of brain development caused by genetic or environmental factors, or both. Early deteriorating effects of genetic/environmental factors on neural development might be key to described disease causing mechanisms. Establishing cellular models with cells from affected individual using the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) technology could be used to mimic early neurodevelopment alterations caused by risk genes or environmental stressors. Indeed, cellular models have allowed identification and further study of risk factors and the biological pathways in which they are involved. New advancements in differentiation methods such as defined and robust monolayer protocols and cerebral 3D organoids have made it possible to faithfully mimic neural development and neuronal functionality while CRISPR-editing tools assist to engineer isogenic cell lines to precisely explore genetic variation in polygenic diseases such as schizophrenia. Here we review the current field of iPSC models of schizophrenia and how risk factors can be modelled as well as discussing the common biological pathways involved. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia and a strong predictor of functional outcome. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of behaviorally based cognitive training programs, although the neural basis of these benefits is unclear. To address this, we reviewed all published studies that have used neuroimaging to measure neural changes following cognitive training in schizophrenia to identify brain regions most consistently affected.
   METHODS: We searched PubMed for all neuroimaging studies examining cognitive training in schizophrenia published until December 2018. An activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis was conducted on a subset of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to examine whether any brain regions showed consistent effects across studies.
   RESULTS: In total, 31 original neuroimaging studies of cognitive training were retrieved. Of these studies, 16 were functional neuroimaging studies, and 15 of these studies reported increased neural activation following cognitive training, with increased left prefrontal activation being the most frequently observed finding. However, activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis did not reveal any specific brain regions showing consistent effects across studies but rather suggested a broader, more distributed pattern of effects resulting from the interventions tested.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although several studies reported increased left prefrontal cortical activation after cognitive training, the lack of statistically significant overlap of brain regions affected by training across studies suggests broad effects of training on brain activation, possibly due to the variety of training programs used.

AB  - Mitochondrial psychobiology is the study of the interactions between psychological states and the biological processes that take place within mitochondria. It also examines how mitochondrial behavior influence neural, endocrine, and immune systems known to transduce psychological experiences into health outcomes. Unlike traditional biological outcomes and mediators, mitochondria are dynamic and multifunctional living organisms. By leveraging a variety of laboratory tools including omics, scientists can now map mitochondrial behavior at multiple levels of complexity - from isolated molecular markers to dynamic functional and signaling outcomes. Here, we discuss current efforts to develop relevant measures of mitochondrial behavior in accessible human tissues, increase their biological specificity by applying precise measurements in defined cell populations, create composite indices reflecting mitochondrial health, and integrate these approaches with psycho-neuro-endocrino-immune outcomes. This systematic interdisciplinary effort will help move the field of mitochondrial psychobiology toward a predictive science explaining how, and to what extent, mitochondria contribute to the biological embedding of stress and other psychological states.

AB  - We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine if hypoxic conditioning, compared to similar training near sea level, maximizes body mass loss and further improves cardiometabolic markers in overweight and obese individuals. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases (up to January 2019) was performed. This analysis included randomized controlled trials with humans with overweight or obesity assessing the effects of HC on body mass loss or cardiometabolic markers. A subgroup analysis was performed to examine if HC effects differed between individuals with overweight or obesity. 13 articles (336 participants) qualified for inclusion. HC significantly decreased body mass (p = .01), fat mass (p = .04), waist/ hip ratio (p < .001), waist (p < .001), LDL (p = .01), diastolic (p < .01) and systolic blood pressure (p < .01) with these effects not being larger than equivalent normoxic interventions. There were trends towards higher triglycerides decrement (p = .06) and higher muscle mass gain in hypoxic (p = .08) compared with normoxic condition. Also, the two BMI categories displayed no difference in the magnitude of the responses. Compared to normoxic equivalent, HC provides greater reductions in triglycerides and greater muscle growth, while body mass changes are similar. In addition, HC responses were essentially similar between individuals with overweight or obesity.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an issue that affects women across all cultures. It is essential to understand how women could be assisted to prevent and reduce the effects of violence. This systematic review examined studies that made cross-cultural comparisons of differences in help-seeking behaviour of women who have experienced IPV. Databases including the Cochrane Library, PsychInfo and others were searched for literature published between 1988 and 2016. Seventeen articles with a total of 40,904 participants met the inclusion criteria. This review found some differences in the procurement of support across cultural groups. While Caucasian women were more likely to seek assistance from formal services such as mental health and social services, Latina/Hispanic and African-American women were more likely to utilize other types of formal supports such as hospital and law enforcement services. The findings regarding utilization of informal support systems showed mixed results. Overall, the findings of this systematic review suggest that women from culturally diverse minority backgrounds should be educated and encouraged to access support before and after experiencing IPV. Further, potential barriers to help-seeking need to be identified and addressed across women from all cultures.

AB  - Mental workload (MWL) can affect human performance and is considered critical in the design and evaluation of complex human-machine systems. While numerous physiological measures are used to assess MWL, there appears no consensus on their validity as effective agents of MWL. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive understanding of the use of physiological measures of MWL and to synthesize empirical evidence on the validity of the measures to discriminate changes in MWL. A systematical literature search was conducted with four electronic databases for empirical studies measuring MWL with physiological measures. Ninety-one studies were included for analysis. We identified 78 physiological measures, which were distributed in cardiovascular, eye movement, electroencephalogram (EEG), respiration, electromyogram (EMG) and skin categories. Cardiovascular, eye movement and EEG measures were the most widely used across varied research domains, with 76%, 66%, and 71% of times reported a significant association with MWL, respectively. While most physiological measures were found to be able to discriminate changes in MWL, they were not universally valid in all task scenarios. The use of physiological measures and their validity for MWL assessment also varied across different research domains. Our study offers insights into the understanding and selection of appropriate physiological measures for MWL assessment in varied human-machine systems.

AB  - Since the landmark discovery that point mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) cause familial Parkinson's disease (PD) more than 2 decades ago, extensive research has been conducted to unravel the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which alpha-synuclein drives PD pathogenesis resulting in selective neurodegeneration of vulnerable neuronal populations. Current interest focuses on the identification of relevant toxic alpha-synuclein conformers and their interaction with basic cellular functions. In this context, seminal advances have been made in defining mechanisms of alpha-synuclein's toxicity in neurons, but many open questions remain regarding its neuronal subtype pathophysiology, as well as the defining the most disease relevant conformations. Moreover, we still only have a partial understanding of the full spectrum of alpha-synuclein's physiological functions both in neurons and in other cells. In this short review, we focus on cell-specific responses to alpha-synuclein with a focus on the toxic conformers of alpha-synuclein. We will not discuss more general cellular death pathways, which have been comprehensively covered by a number of elegant recent reviews. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective Several depressed patients do not respond to traditional antidepressants. Our aim was to systematically review the effectiveness and safety of pramipexole in unipolar and bipolar depression. Methods We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies on pramipexole for patients with major depressive episodes, following PRISMA guidelines. Our primary outcome measure was treatment response at endpoint. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO: CRD42018108699. Results We found five RCTs, three open-label trials and five observational studies, with 504 participants (57% women; mean age, 45.3 years; mean sample size, 39; median duration of treatment, 8 weeks; mean follow-up duration, 45 weeks; mean maximum dose, 1.62 mg). We found an overall short-term response rate of 52.2% and remission rate of 36.1%, and an overall long-term response rate of 62.1% and remission rate of 39.6%. In RCTs, patients treated with pramipexole had a superior response rate compared with placebo (RR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.11-2.82) and similar to SSRIs (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.44-1.95). Acceptability and tolerability were good, with nausea being the most frequent side-effect. Conclusion Our study found some evidence for an effect of pramipexole for the treatment of major depressive episodes.

AB  - Alterations in the interactions between the gut microbiome, its metabolites, and the brain have been implicated in numerous brain disorders, including developmental disorders, disorders of mood and affect, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune conditions, eating disorders and functional gastrointestinal disorders. The specific components of brain gut microbiome disorders include disturbances of the microbial community and metabolite production, altered bidirectional signaling from the gut microbes to the brain and associated alterations in brain structure and function. These disruptions are correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms and disease progression in human and mouse models. Novel therapies are being directed at targets within the brain gut microbiome axis and include prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplants.

AB  - One potential pathway by which mindfulness-based meditation improves health outcomes is through changes in cognitive functioning. Here, we summarize and comment upon three systematic reviews conducted over the last seven years that have had the goal of identifying the impact of mindfulness on cognitive outcomes. In our analysis, we identified a number of methodological limitations and potential confounding factors that interfere with and limit our ability to interpret the results. In order to gain a granular view of the relationship between mindfulness training and cognition, we report on the following: 1) What do we know? How does mindfulness affect cognition? 2) variable criteria that define an MBI; 2) limitations of assays used to measure cognition; and 3) methodological quality of an MBI trial and reporting of findings. Finally, we offer constructive means for interpretation and recommendations for moving the field of mindfulness research forward regarding effects on cognition.

AB  - Despite the exponential increase in fear research during the last years, few studies have included female subjects in their design. The need to include females arises from the knowledge gap of mechanistic processes underlying the behavioral and neural differences observed in fear extinction. Moreover, the exact contribution of sex and hormones in relation to learning and behavior is still largely unknown. Insights from this field could be beneficial as fear-related disorders are twice as prevalent in women compared to men. Here, we review an up-to-date summary of animal and human studies in adulthood that report sex differences in fear extinction from a structural and functional approach. Furthermore, we describe how these factors could contribute to the observed sex differences in fear extinction during normal and pathological conditions.

AB  - There is a growing and promising quantitative evidence base on mindfulness in schools, which has continued to emerge over the last two years and which consistently suggests small to moderate impacts across a range of outcomes, most strongly and reliably on psycho-social health and well-being, especially mental health problems, with less definitive but promising evidence for small effects on behaviour, cognition, learning, and physical health. The overlapping field of 'contemplative education' is less concerned with measurable outcomes, aiming instead to put the learner, and their self-reflective mindfulness at the heart of the teaching and learning process. Interest is growing on how best to implement mindfulness and integrate it into the policies, practice and ethos of the whole institution, with some promising early findings, mainly from qualitative data. There is a particular and growing emphasis, supported by some emerging quantitative evidence, on the need for teachers to learn mindfulness themselves and establish their own practice if they are to cultivate mindfulness in schools effectively.

AB  - Older caregivers of dementia patients have been studied as a model of chronic stress influencing psychological and physical well-being and the function of the immune system. These immune decrements can relate to altered stress hormone levels, and caregivers show elevated or reduced cortisol compared to age-matched controls as well as dysregulation in other cortisol indices. Recently, this field has developed to examine a range of immune outcomes and cortisol measures in younger caregivers too, as well as other potential underlying mechanisms including genetic variation, acute stress reactivity and inflammation. Several interventions have also been trialled to reduce the negative physical impact of caregiving stress. This paper reviews the latest developments in the field and gives suggestions for future research.

Nevertheless, there is still debate concerning the sources of these changes, including the role of environmental exposure and several cognitive mechanisms associated with learning, representation, and retrieval of information. We review the current status of research in this field and outline a framework that promises to assess the contribution of both ecological and psychological aspects to the aging lexicon.

AB  - Salinity poses serious threats to landscapes across the globe, decreasing the capacity of all types of terrestrial ecosystems in providing services by threatening our biodiversity, lowering agricultural productivity, deteriorating the environment, contaminating groundwater below standard level, enhancing flood risks, food security issues and restricting the economic growth of a community. Reclamation measures are required to reverse the process of land degradation caused by salinization; otherwise, the trend towards salinization is expected to grow beyond control in developing countries. The scientific community and the policy-makers around the globe have been testing long-term technologies including physicochemical, conventional breeding and genetic engineering involving state of the art molecular tools for more than three decades. Nevertheless, they have failed due to reasons like non-technical feasibility reports, reliability and affordability issues coupled with sustainability constraints at field level. This review discusses the potential prospects of Pennisetum genus (Poaceae) for integrated, sustainable, robust and profitable saline agriculture based on phytoremediation agro-technique. Our approach is the first ever record, providing a novel insight into a cost-effective biotech agro-technique. Pennisetum species are environment-friendly future candidates with prospects for all stakeholders to materialize higher average productivity at the field level, posing lesser competition for resources with standard conventional crops.

AB  - y A central question in contemporary ecology is how climate change will alter ecosystem structure and function across scales of space and time. Climate change has been shown to alter ecological patterns from individuals to ecosystems, often with negative implications for ecosystem functions and services. Furthermore, as climate change fuels more frequent and severe extreme climate events (ECEs) like marine heatwaves (MHWs), such acute events become increasingly important drivers of rapid ecosystem change. However, our understanding of ECE impacts is hampered by limited collection of broad scale in situ data where such events occur. In 2011, a MHW known as the Ningaloo Nino bathed the west coast of Australia in waters up to 4 degrees C warmer than normal summer temperatures for almost 2 months over 1000s of kilometers of coastline. We revisit published and unpublished data on the effects of the Ningaloo Nino in the seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Western Australia (24.6-26.6 degrees S), at the transition zone between temperate and tropical seagrasses. Therein we focus on resilience, including resistance to and recovery from disturbance across local, regional and ecosystem-wide spatial scales and over the past 8 years. Thermal effects on temperate seagrass health were severe and exacerbated by simultaneous reduced light conditions associated with sediment inputs from record floods in the south-eastern embayment and from increased detrital loads and sediment destabilization. Initial extensive defoliation of Amphibolis antarctica, the dominant seagrass, was followed by rhizome death that occurred in 60-80% of the bay's meadows, equating to decline of over 1,000 km(2) of meadows. This loss, driven by direct abiotic forcing, has persisted, while indirect biotic effects (e.g., dominant seagrass loss) have allowed colonization of some areas by small fast-growing tropical@species (e.g., Halodule uninervis). Those biotic effects also impacted multiple consumer populations including turtles and dugongs, with implications for species dynamics, food web structure, and ecosystem recovery. We show multiple stressors can combine to evoke extreme ecological responses by pushing ecosystems beyond their tolerance. Finally, both direct abiotic and indirect biotic effects need to be explicitly considered when attempting to understand and predict how ECEs will alter marine ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - BackgroundHomelessness is increasing globally. It results in poorer physical and mental health than age matched people living in permanent housing. Better information on the health needs of people experiencing homelessness is needed to inform effective resourcing, planning and service delivery by government and care organisations.The aim of this review was to identify assessment tools that are valid, reliable and appropriate to measure the health status of people who are homeless.MethodsData sources: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed (and Medline), PsychInfo, Scopus, CINAHL and ERIC from database inception until September 2018. Key words used were homeless, homelessness, homeless persons, vagrancy, health status, health, health issues, health assessment and health screening. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO. The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) hierarchy of evidence was applied; methodological quality of included articles was assessed using the McMaster critical appraisal tools and psychometric properties of the tools were appraised using the International Centre for Allied Health Evidence Ready Reckoner.ResultsDiverse tools and measures (N=71) were administered within, and across the reviewed studies (N=37), with the main focus being on general health, oral health and nutrition. Eleven assessment tools in 13 studies had evidence of appropriate psychometric testing for the target population in domains of quality of life and health status, injury, substance use, mental health, psychological and cognitive function. Methodological quality of articles and tools were assessed as moderate to good. No validated tools were identified to assess oral health, chronic conditions, anthropometry, demography, nutrition, continence, functional decline and frailty, or vision and hearing. However, assessments of physical constructs (such as oral health, anthropometry, vision and hearing) could be applied to homeless people on a presumption of validity, because the constructs would be measured with clinical indicators in the same manner as people living in permanent dwellings.ConclusionsThis review highlighted the need to develop consistent and comprehensive health assessment tools validated with, and tailored for, adults experiencing homelessness.

KW  - ADAPTATION
AB  - Nepal, a least-developed, mountainous, and land-locked country is consistently ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate change. Poor socioeconomic development, rough and highly unstable geography, inadequate institutional capacity to deal with research, development and policy and mostly underdeveloped infrastructures, all have contributed to increasing vulnerability of communities and ecosystems, and have limited their adaptive capacity. Over the past decade, Nepal has made significant progress, particularly in developing and implementing policies and frameworks and establishing institutional mechanisms with the support of donor countries, UN and multilateral agencies. As the global climate politics is getting more complicated, international financing patterns-both climate and development finance-are shifting their ways, forcing the countries like Nepal to diversify the funding base for climate change actions and integrate them within national development plans and strategies. Using the data and information currently available, we analyze the existing financing situations, discuss the future scenarios and suggest policy recommendations to develop a set of long-term adaptation and impact mitigation strategies in specific and environmental change at large. When short-term adaptation strategies funded from existing financial arrangements and other related bilateral and multilateral sources particularly European countries, seem to be encouraging, we stress the need of public-private partnership-driven full-fledged green economy focusing on renewable energy and transport, agriculture and forestry, water and water-induced disasters, as well as tourism and hospitality.

AB  - BackgroundCommunity-based, integrated youth service hubs have the potential to address some of the longstanding issues with mental health services for youth, including problems with access and system fragmentation. Better understanding of these approaches, particularly efforts to create a single point of entry to comprehensive, evidence-based services through youth service hubs, is needed to help guide future implementation and evaluation. This scoping review identifies the key principles and characteristics of these models of care, as well as the state of the literature, particularly with regard to implementation and replicability.MethodElectronic databases and grey literature sources were searched for material from 2001 to 2019, with diverse search terms capturing the concept of integrated or one-stop shop youth mental health services. Title/abstract and full text review were conducted, as well as additional focused searching. After screening 4891 texts at the title/abstract level and 496 at the full-text level, 110 documents were included for data extraction.ResultsSeveral integrated care hub models for youth mental health services and related frameworks were identified internationally, largely in high-income countries. Common principles included an emphasis on rapid access to care and early intervention, youth and family engagement, youth-friendly settings and services, evidence-informed approaches, and partnerships and collaboration. Program characteristics also revealed similarities (e.g., providing evidence-informed or evidence-based services in youth-friendly spaces), with some differences (e.g., care coordination methods, types of service providers), potentially attributable to lack of available information about key ingredients. Outcome research was limited, with few rigorous evaluations of youth outcomes. Moreover, sufficient information for replication, community evaluation of feasibility or actual implementation was rarely provided.ConclusionInternationally, integrated youth service hubs were found to share common key principles, while providing comprehensive services to youth with mental health difficulties. There is a great need for common language and measurement framework to facilitate replication, rigorous evaluation of outcomes, knowledge exchange, and dissemination of findings.

AB  - After several decades of debate on the so-called protest vote, the extant literature in this field is still far from consistent in conceptualization and analytical perspectives. Yet, at a time of increasing democratic stress, it becomes crucial for political studies to take stock of current research on this topic and assess its general state of health. In the light of this, aim of the present contribution is to piece together the puzzle of analytical perspectives from which scholars and pundits have approached the matter over the years. First, this article will do so at a conceptual level, disentangling different conceptualizations of protest voting. In parallel, it will do so at the technical and empirical level, categorizing both operationalization strategies and findings into alternative strands of research. As a last step, it will summarize the still open issues, organizing them within a unified platform and identifying possible lines of development for future research.

AB  - Aims: We aimed to map out the scope and type of health research studies with patients involved as co-researchers throughout the research process and to explore the outcomes and experiences of such research. Methods: We conducted a narrative review by systematically searching selected databases. A total of 1451 hits were identified and screened, and 17 studies were included and categorised by type of health problem, design, publication sources and modes of presentation. We conducted an inductive, iterative analysis of outcomes and experiences of patient involvement. Results: We identified two types of impact from studies with patients participating as co-researchers: (a) patient involvement as primary focus, where seven articles largely reported and reflected upon the shared experiences, and (b) patient involvement as strategy, where 10 articles presented results from empirical studies of specific health problems, with patient involvement used as a strategy to expand understanding. The first group of studies reported collaborative processes and resource investments, while the second group addressed specific health problems from a distinctive perspective due to patient involvement. Several studies in both groups repeated or confirmed positive values of user involvement rather than providing original findings. In both groups, methodological standards were often downgraded to provide access for the co-researchers. Conclusions: These articles, where the co-researcher model represents the contemporary superior level of patient involvement, may indicate that mere collaboration efforts are prioritised at the expense of knowledge outcomes and scientific quality. Collaboration formats other than participation as co-researchers may be necessary for patient involvement in medical research to add to the existing knowledge.

Primary database and secondary searches for qualitative and/or quantitative English-language research with an explicit focus on informal carers of people with multimorbidity (no date restrictions). Quality appraisal of included papers. Thematic analysis to identify key themes in the findings of included papers. Results: Thirty-four papers (reporting on 27 studies) were eligible for inclusion, the majority of which were rated good quality, and almost half of which were published from 2015 onwards. The review highlights common difficulties for informal carers of people with multiple chronic illnesses, including practical challenges related to managing multiple health care teams, appointments, medications and side effects, and psychosocial challenges including high levels of psychological symptomatology and reduced social connectedness. Current gaps in the literature include very few studies of interventions which may help support this caregiver group. Conclusion: Interest in this research area is burgeoning. Future work might fruitfully examine the potential benefits of audio-recorded health care consultations, and digitally delivered psychosocial interventions such as online peer support forums, for supporting and enhancing the caring activities and wellbeing of this caregiver group.

AB  - The neural basis of defensive behaviors continues to attract much interest, not only because they are important for survival but also because their dysregulation may be at the origin of anxiety disorders. Recently, a dominant approach in the field has been the optogenetic manipulation of specific circuits or cell types within these circuits to dissect their role in different defensive behaviors. While the usefulness of optogenetics is unquestionable, we argue that this method, as currently applied, fosters an atomistic conceptualization of defensive behaviors, which hinders progress in understanding the integrated responses of nervous systems to threats. Instead, we advocate for a holistic approach to the problem, including observational study of natural behaviors and their neuronal correlates at multiple sites, coupled to the use of optogenetics, not to globally turn on or off neurons of interest, but to manipulate specific activity patterns hypothesized to regulate defensive behaviors.

AB  - Introduction: Resilience is enabled by internal, individual assets as well as the resources available in a person's environment to support healthy development. For Indigenous people, these resources and assets can include those which enhance cultural resilience. Measurement instruments which capture these core resilience constructs are needed, yet there is a lack of evidence about which instruments are most appropriate and valid for use with Indigenous adolescents. The current study reviews instruments which have been used to measure the resilience of Indigenous adolescents in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (the CANZUS nations). The aim is to provide guidance for the future use of instruments to measure resilience among Indigenous adolescents and provide recommendations for research to strengthen evidence in this area.
   Method: Instruments were identified through a systematic search of resilience intervention and indicator studies targeting Indigenous youth from CANZUS nations. The studies were analyzed for information on the constructs of resilience measured in the instruments, their use with the targeted groups, and their psychometric properties. A second search was conducted to fill in any gaps in information. Instruments were included if they measured at least one construct of resilience reflecting individual assets, environmental resources, and/or cultural resilience.
   Results: A total of 20 instruments were identified that measured constructs of resilience and had been administered to Indigenous adolescents in the CANZUS nations. Instruments which measured both individual assets and environmental resources (n = 7), or only environmental resources (n = 6) were most common. Several instruments (n = 5) also measured constructs of cultural resilience, and two instruments included items addressing all three constructs of individual assets, environmental resources, and cultural resilience. The majority of the reviewed studies tested the reliability (75%) and content or face validity (80%) of instruments with the target population.
   Conclusion: There are several validated instruments available to appropriately measure constructs of resilience with Indigenous adolescents from CANZUS nations. Further work is needed on developing a consistent framework of resilience constructs to guide research efforts. Future instrument development and testing ought to focus on measures which include elements of all three core constructs critical to Indigenous adolescent resilience.

AB  - The discovery of rare familial monogenic forms of early-onset Parkinson's disease has led to the identification of a mitochondrial quality control process as a key player in this disease. Loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding PINK1 or Parkin result in insufficient removal of dysfunctional mitochondria through autophagy, a process termed mitophagy. Understanding the mechanism of this process and the function of its two key players, PINK1 and Parkin, has led to the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. Small molecule activators of mitophagy, either activating PINK1 or Parkin directly or inhibiting Parkin's counterplayer, the ubiquitin-specific protease USP30, are in preclinical development. To enable clinical success of future small molecule mitophagy enhancers, biomarkers for mitochondrial integrity and mitophagy are being developed. Only a few years after the discovery of mitophagy deficits in Parkinson's disease, research of the underlying mechanisms, drug discovery of modulators for this mechanism and identification of biomarkers provide new avenues towards the development of disease-modifying therapies.

AB  - Background
   Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of mental disorders and a high incidence of morbidity, but if diagnosed and treated promptly individuals can benefit from full recovery. However, there are numerous problems at the healthcare interface (i.e. primary and secondary care) for eating disorders. It is important to examine these to facilitate appropriate, seamless treatment and improve access to specialist care.
   Aims
   To examine the current literature on the experiences and perspectives of those across healthcare interfaces for eating disorders, to include individuals with eating disorders, people close to or caring for those with eating disorders such as family and friends, and health professionals.
   Method
   To identify relevant papers, a systematic search of electronic databases was conducted. Other methods, including hand-searching, scanning reference lists and internet resources were also used. Papers that met inclusion criteria were analysed using a systematic methodology and synthesised using an interpretative thematic approach.
   Results
   Sixty-three papers met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality was relatively good. The included papers were of both qualitative (n = 44) and quantitative studies (n = 24) and were from ten different countries. By synthesising the literature of these papers, three dominant themes were identified, with additional subthemes. These included: 'the help-seeking process at primary care'; 'expectations of care and appropriate referrals' and 'opposition and collaboration in the treatment of and recovery from eating disorders'.
   Conclusions
   This review identifies both facilitators and barriers in eating disorder healthcare, from the perspectives of those experiencing the interface first hand. The review provides recommendations for future research and practice.

AB  - Sentiment discovery and analysis (SDA) aims to automatically identify the underlying attitudes, sentiments, and subjectivity towards a certain entity such as learners and learning resources. Due to its enormous potential for smart education, SDA has been deemed as a powerful technique for identifying and classifying sentiments from multimodal and multisource data over the whole process of education. For big educational data streams, SDA faces challenges in unimodal feature selection, sentiment classification, and multimodal fusion. As such, a large body of studies in the literature explores diverse approaches to SDA for educational applications. This paper provides a self-contained, uniform overview of the SDA techniques for education. In particular, we focus on prominent studies in unimodal sentiment features and classifications (e.g., text, audio, and visual). In addition, we present a novel SDA framework of multimodal fusions, together with description of their crucial components. Based on this framework, we review different approaches to SDA on education from the perspectives of approaches and applications. After comprehensively reviewing the SDA techniques on education, we present the trends and prospectives of the future SDA research under ubiquitous education contexts.

AB  - Research investigating female gaming has begun to emerge despite gaming being traditionally more popular with males. Research in the 21st century has drawn attention to the role of women in culture, society, and technology, and female gaming is one of the growing phenomena not to have been researched in depth. The aim of the present paper was to review female gaming (i.e., the role of females within video game culture) and identify any associated psychopathological symptomatology. The review adapted the Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research (SPIDER) model in conducting a narrative literature review. A search of three scientific electronic databases yielded 49 papers for further evaluation. From a methodological perspective, studies had to fulfill the following criteria to be included: i) published between the years 2000 and 2018; ii) assessed female gaming or the female position within gaming culture, iii) contained quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approaches to produce empirical data or discuss theoretical implications through reviews, iv) be retrievable as a full-text peer-reviewed journal paper, and v) published in English, German, Polish, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or French. Four categories emerged from the papers: i) the benefits of female gaming, ii) why women might play video games less than men, iii) perceptions and realities of female characters within video games, and iv) women's position in gaming culture. The main findings showed playing video games has benefits for women in terms of enhancing cognitive, social, and physical abilities. However, they are less encouraged to play video games due to negative expectations based on gender and/or experiences during game play. Video games are associated with stereotypical male characteristics, such as being overly aggressive, and frequently contain sexualized content. Female gamers appear to require coping strategies to handle online harassment. Females look for different things in video games, which are not often included in game designs thereby limiting their abilities. For instance, female avatar representation-which is exaggerated and hypersexualized-can prompt social comparisons and lead to feelings of decreased self-esteem, depression, and other impacts on well-being. Overall, there are still obstacles for women playing video games even though they comprise half of the gaming population.

AB  - Background: Rising percentages of working mothers and increasing numbers of dual-earner couples are putting work-family conflicts on the agenda. Studies based on data from the US have already proven a link between work-family conflict and health in working parents with heterogeneous results for certain health outcomes and subgroups. Also, to date no comprehensive overview of the existing evidence regarding the impact of work-family conflict on health among European working parents exist.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted to identify and analyze knowledge gaps regarding health-related consequences of work-family conflicts. To search for relevant publications on work-family conflicts and health, a systematic prospective literature search was carried out in two international databases (PubMed and Scopus) based on four landmark publications. The search was complemented by a systematic retrospective search in Scopus and hand searches. Inclusion criteria were a focus on work-family conflict, an analysis of health-related outcomes, and the presentation of empirical results. The publications were summarized in narrative style.
   Results: A total of n = 25 publications on work-family conflict and health in Europe were identified. The data suggests that a variety of instruments is used to measure work-family conflict. Also, work-family conflict and health are linked in Europe, although longitudinal data do not always show robust causal interrelations. Most studies focus on self-rated, mental, and physical health. Results for gender-specific health outcomes remain controversial.
   Conclusion: The review provides an overview of existing evidence for health-related consequences of work-family conflicts in Europe. The results of the review strengthen the evidence for a link between work-family conflict and health. However, heterogeneous results regarding the direction of work-family conflict and high-risk groups are a matter for discussion. This study investigates whether differences in the results can be accounted for by diverse measurement methods and study populations. Furthermore, different family policies in the European region as well intersectional approaches should be taken into account in further research.

AB  - Background: The clinical pathways for treating mental illness have received global attention. Several empirical studies have been undertaken on treatment pathways in Ghana. No study, however, has systematically reviewed the literature related to the pathways of mental health treatment in Ghana. Aim: This article aims to identify the pathways used to treat mental illnesses; examine the evidence about the possibility of collaboration between biomedical, faith and traditional healing pathways; and draw attention to the barriers hindering such collaboration. Methods: A search of the published literature was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science and Scopus databases. The search was limited to the articles that were published in English and released between 2000 and June 2018. The review synthesises both qualitative and quantitative data. Results: The findings showed that mental illnesses in Ghana are treated using a mixture of biomedical and faith-based and traditional healing services. Faith and traditional healing pathways are typically used as a preliminary source of cultural assessment before seeking biomedical treatment. There is an increasing desire for collaboration between biomedical, faith and traditional healing pathways. However, several individual factors (attitude or stigma, the perceived efficacy of treatment and differences in the treatment process) and health system factors (a lack of policy and regulation, a limited number of biomedical service providers, limited financial support and geographical isolation of services) jointly contribute to barriers precluding establishing such collaboration. Conclusion: This review recommends that policies, regulations, educational support and financial incentives should be developed to facilitate collaboration between biomedical, faith and traditional healing service provision.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that personality pathology is common among patients at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Despite the important impact that this comorbidity might have on presenting high-risk psychopathology, psychological functioning, and transition to full psychotic disorders, the relationship between personality syndromes and CHR state has received relatively little empirical attention. The present meta-analytic review aimed at 1) estimating the prevalence rates of personality disorders (PDs) in CHR individuals and 2) examining the potential role of PDs in predicting transition from CHR state to a full-blown psychotic disorder. The systematic search of the empirical literature identified 17 relevant studies, including a total of 1,868 CHR individuals. Three distinct meta-analyses were performed to provide prevalence estimates of PDs in the CHR population. The first and more comprehensive meta-analysis focused on any comorbid PD (at least one diagnosis), the second one focused on schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), and the last one focused on borderline personality disorder (BPD). Moreover, a narrative review was presented to define the predictive role of personality disorders in promoting more severe outcomes in CHR patients. The findings showed that the prevalence rate of personality disorders in CHR patients was 39.4% (95% CI [26.5%-52.3%]). More specifically, 13.4% (95% CI [8.2%-18.5%]) and 11.9% (95% CI [0.73%-16.6%]) of this clinical population presented with SPD and BPD, respectively. Finally, the studies examining the effects of baseline personality diagnoses on conversion to psychotic disorders showed contradictory and insufficient results concerning the potential significant impact of SPD. Conversely, no effect of BPD was found. This meta-analytic review indicated that the CHR population includes a large subgroup with serious personality pathology, that may present with attenuated psychotic symptoms conjointly with distinct and very heterogeneous personality features. These findings support the need for improved understanding of both core psychological characteristics of CHR patients and differentiating aspects of personality that could have relevant clinical implications in promoting individualized preventive interventions and enhancing treatment effectiveness.

AB  - Exposure to early life stress has been linked to impairment in cognitive functioning in adulthood. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on the relationship between early life stress and working memory, a central component of cognitive functioning. Database searches yielded 358 abstracts matching the search terms. Abstract screening followed by full-text review resulted in 26 publications suitable for inclusion, of which 23 were included in the meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis suggested exposure to early life stress was associated with poorer working memory. Even though there were a wide variety of working memory tasks used, this effect was significant for both phonological and visuospatial working memory tasks, and both visual and aural task presentation modalities. The effect was also found in samples with and without clinical psychopathology. This review provides recommendations for future research and implications for clinical practice.

AB  - Good health and rapid progress depend on an optimal dose of nicotinamide. Too little meat triggers the neurodegenerative condition pellagra and tolerance of symbionts such as tuberculosis (TB). risking dysbioses and impaired resistance to acute infections. Nicotinamide deficiency is an overlooked diagnosis in poor cereal-dependant economies masquerading as 'environmental enteropathy' or physical and cognitive stunting. Too much meat (and supplements) may precipitate immune intolerance and autoimmune and allergic disease, with relative infertility and longevity, via the tryptophan-nicotinamide pathway. This switch favours a dearth of regulatory T (Treg) and an excess of T helper cells. High nicotinamide intake is implicated in cancer and Parkinson's disease. Pro-fertility genes. evolved to counteract high-nicotinamide-induced infertility, may now be risk factors for degenerative disease, Moderation of the dose of nicotinamide could prevent some common diseases and personalised doses at times of stress or, depending on genetic background or age, may treat some other conditions.

AB  - Social neuroscience is unveiling how the brain coordinates the construal of social categories and the generation of intergroup biases from facial perception. Recent evidence indicates that social categorization is more sensitive and malleable to elemental facial features than previously assumed. At the same time, perception of social categories can be crafted by top-down factors, including prior knowledge, motivations, and social expectations. In this review, we summarize extant wisdom and propose a model that goes beyond traditional accounts that have conceived stereotypes and prejudices as the end result of "reading out" social categories in the face, and have assumed a hierarchical brain organization. Our model proposes recursive and dynamic interactions amid distant brain regions. Accordingly, the reciprocal exchange of sensory evidence and predictions biases and "explains away" visual input in face perception regions until a compromise is achieved and social perception stabilizes. Ideally, this effort would contribute to shape a research field at the interface between neural and social sciences, which is often referred to as social vision.

AB  - Psychopathology refers to the scientific exploration of abnormal mental states. The advent of internet has changed the way human beings experience their life and the world around them. There is hardly any aspect of the modern living experience that has remained uninfluenced from internet. The same is true for the field of psychopathology as well. The unprecedented pace of digital revolution with ever increasing utilization of internet-based technologies for different purposes, apart from providing a world of exciting opportunities, has also been associated with several negative consequences. This relatively newer addition to the human living experience is also reflected in the inclusion of newer diagnostic categories in the current diagnostic system (thereby meaning addition of new psychopathology). It has also impacted the experience, manifestation, and communication of psychopathology that existed for years even before advent of the Internet. The current article offers a description of the various clinically relevant human behavioral manifestations that are shaped by our exposure to the Internet and related technology. It also proposes a scheme for categorizing these clinically relevant human behavioral manifestations. This categorization is expected to have clinical and research implications going ahead.

AB  - Objective: Major depression with peripartum onset (MDP) has been associated with multiple adverse offspring health outcomes. The biological mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear, but DNA methylation (DNAm) represents a plausible mechanism for mediating MDP exposures and changes in offspring development, behavior, and health. Advances in DNAm research necessitate reevaluating the MDP-DNAm literature to determine how well past studies conform with current best practices.
   Method: Five databases were searched to identify studies of prenatal-onset MDP and DNAm. Quality scores were assigned to each article independently by two raters using a novel scale specific for MDP-DNAm research.
   Results: Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. Quality scores ranged from 10 to 17 out of 24 points (M = 12.8; SD = 1.9), with higher scores indicating increased study rigor. Poor covariate reporting was the most significant contributor to lower scores.
   Conclusion: No longitudinal MDP-DNAm studies exist. Earlier MDP-DNAm studies should be interpreted with caution, and future research must commit to sharing methodology and data to facilitate cross-study comparisons and maximize dataset utility.

AB  - Objective: Preconception health is an important determinant of maternal, paternal, and infant outcomes. Knowledge is commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to promote preconception health. Our objective was to examine how preconception health knowledge has been measured in the existing literature and to identify measurement gaps, biases, and logistical challenges.
   Data Source: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and gray literature were searched from database inception to January 2018.
   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Studies were included if they measured preconception or interconception health knowledge and included reproductive-aged women and/or men.
   Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers completed data extraction and quality appraisal using standardized instruments.
   Data Synthesis: Due to measurement heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was performed.
   Results: The review included 34 studies from 14 countries with data collected in 2000 to 2017. Most studies used cross-sectional (n = 24) or prepost designs (n = 7). Studies primarily sampled women (n = 25), and methodological quality was rated largely as weak (n = 18) or moderate (n = 14). Preconception health knowledge tools focused on fertility, folic acid, and alcohol, with few questions pertaining to men's health, mental health, or the interconception period. Only 19 (56%) studies reported psychometric properties of their knowledge tools.
   Conclusions: This systematic review revealed the need for a valid and reliable knowledge tool that reflects a holistic conceptualization of preconception health.

AB  - Some lines of evidence have indicated that immune dysregulation could play a role in the pathophysiology of obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD). However, results have been inconsistent across studies. Thus, a systematic review and metaanalysis of studies measuring immune mediators in participants with OCD compared to healthy controls (HC) was conducted. The PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE electronic databases were systematically searched from inception through June 21, 2018. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria comprising data from 1001 participants (538 with OCD and 463 were HCs). Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-10, and interferon-gamma did not significantly differ between participants with OCD and healthy controls. In addition, the ex vivo production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by isolated macrophages did not significantly differ between participants with OCD and HCs. Nevertheless, included studies have varied in methodological quality with the enrollment of samples that differed regarding medication status, the proper matching of OCD participants and HCs, age groups, and the presence of psychiatric comorbidities. In conclusion, an association between immune dysregulation and OCD remains unproven. Future studies should consider enrolling larger and more homogeneous samples with OCD.

AB  - Thanks to patients Phineas Gage and Henry Molaison, we have long known that behavioral control depends on the frontal lobes, whereas declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For decades, cognitive functions - behavioral control, declarative memory - have served as labels for characterizing the division of labor in cortex. This approach has made enormous contributions to understanding how the brain enables the mind, providing a systems-level explanation of brain function that constrains lower-level investigations of neural mechanism. Today, the approach has evolved such that functional labels are often applied to brain networks rather than focal brain regions. Furthermore, the labels have diversified to include both broadly-defined cognitive functions (declarative memory, visual perception) and more circumscribed mental processes (recollection, familiarity, priming). We ask whether a process - a high-level mental phenomenon corresponding to an introspectively-identifiable cognitive event - is the most productive label for dissecting memory. For example, recollection conflates a neurocomputational operation (pattern completion-based retrieval) with a class of representational content (associative, high-dimensional memories). Because a full theory of memory must identify operations and representations separately, and specify how they interact, we argue that processes like recollection constitute inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms. Instead, we advocate considering the component operations and representations of processes like recollection in isolation. For the organization of memory, the evidence suggests that pattern completion is recapitulated widely 53 across the ventral visual stream and MTL, but the division of labor between sites within this pathway can be explained by representational content.

AB  - Statistics anxiety, which is widespread among students taking courses related to statistics or research methods, refers to a specific field of academic anxiety. This paper provides a systematic overview of the definition of statistics anxiety, followed by a comparison with mathematics anxiety. We then present an in-depth discussion of the antecedents of statistics anxiety (situational, dispositional, and cognitive). Given recent findings on statistics anxiety, its cognitive antecedents deserve particular attention among relevant studies. Future studies would need to include other aspects, such as longitudinal design, improvement of measuring tools, and underlying mechanisms. This paper may help future researchers investigate efficient ways of lowering students' statistics anxiety.

AB  - Neuroimaging of pain in animals allows us to better understand mechanisms of pain processing and modulation. In this review, we discuss recently published brain imaging studies in rats, mice, and monkeys, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), manganese-enhanced MRI, positron emission tomography, and electroencephalography. We provide an overview of innovations and limitations in neuroimaging techniques, as well as results of functional brain imaging studies of pain from January 1, 2016, to October 10, 2018. We then discuss how future investigations can address some bias and gaps in the field. Despite the limitations of neuroimaging techniques, the 28 studies reinforced that transition from acute to chronic pain entails considerable changes in brain function. Brain activations in acute pain were in areas more related to the sensory aspect of noxious stimulation, including primary somatosensory cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, thalamus, retrosplenial cortex, and periaqueductal gray. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments modulated these brain regions in several pain models. On the other hand, in chronic pain models, brain activity was observed in regions commonly associated with emotion and motivation, including prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and nucleus accumbens. Neuroimaging of pain in animals holds great promise for advancing our knowledge of brain function and allowing us to expand human subject research. Additional research is needed to address effects of anesthesia, analysis approaches, sex bias and omission, and potential effects of development and aging.

AB  - The recent rise in controversial politicians has garnered substantial interest in the assessment of their personality. Observer ratings of politicians' personality, however, may suffer from evaluative and value-related biases. Evaluative biases are likely to differentially affect personality ratings of preferred and non-preferred politicians, whereas value-related biases are likely to affect ratings of honesty-humility and openness to experience of preferred politicians in line with the self-based heuristic or assumed similarity effect. In a stratified sample (final N = 203) of the Dutch population, respondents/voters provided self-ratings and observer ratings of the political leaders of the seven largest political parties on the HEXACO Simplified Personality Inventory (HEXACO-SPI). Findings showed evaluative biases on honesty-humility, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Furthermore, observer ratings of politicians were generally lower than self-ratings on honesty-humility and higher on extraversion, suggesting high perceived politicians' narcissism. Findings on the value-related bias showed that assumed similarity was higher for honesty-humility and openness to experience among politicians of a preferred party than among politicians of non-preferred parties. Additionally, assumed similarity effects were also present for emotionality among preferred politicians and for extraversion and conscientiousness among both preferred and non-preferred politicians, suggesting a self-based prototypicality effect.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to determine whether structural alterations can be used as neuroimaging markers to detect individuals with ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis for the diagnosis of schizophrenia and improvement of treatment outcomes.
   Methods: Embase and Pubmed databases were searched for related studies in July 2018. The search was performed without restriction on time and regions or languages. A total of 188 articles on voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and 96 articles on cortical thickness were obtained, and another 6 articles were included after the reference lists were checked. Our researchers assessed and extracted the data in accordance with the PRISMA guideline. The data were processed with a seed-based mapping method.
   Results: Fourteen VBM and nine cortical thickness studies were finally included in our study. In individuals with UHR, the gray matter volumes in the bilateral median cingulate (Z = 1.034), the right fusiform gyms (Z = 1.051), the left superior temporal gyrus (Z = 1.048), and the right thalamus (Z = 1.039) increased relative to those of healthy controls. By contrast, the gray matter volumes in the right gyrus rectus (Z = -2.109), the light superior frontal gyrus (Z = 2.321), and the left superior frontal gyrus (Z = -2228) decreased. The robustness of these findings was verified through Jackknife sensitivity analysis, and heterogeneity across studies was low. Typically, cortical thickness alterations were not detected in individuals with UHR.
   Conclusions: Structural abnormalities of the thalamocortical circuit may underpin the neurophysiology of psychosis and mark the vulnerability of transition to psychosis in UHR subjects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: This systematic literature review provides evidence concerning the association of school race/ethnic composition in mental health outcomes among adolescents (ages 11-17 years). A range of mental health outcomes were assessed (e.g., internalizing behaviors, psychotic symptoms) in order to broadly capture the relationship between school context on mental health and psychological wellbeing. Methods: A search across six databases from 1990 to 2018 resulted in 13 articles from three countries (United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) that met inclusion criteria following a two step review of titles/abstracts and full-text. Results: The existing research on school race/ethnic composition and mental health point to two distinct measures of school composition: density-the proportion of one race/ethnic group enrolled in a school, and diversity-an index capturing the range and size of all race/ethnic groups enrolled in a school. Overall, higher same race/ethnic peer density was associated with better mental health for all adolescents. In contrast, there was no overall strong evidence of mental health advantage in schools with increased diversity. Conclusions: Theoretical and methodological considerations for future research towards strengthening causal inference, and implications for policies and practices concerning the mental health of adolescent-aged students are discussed.

AB  - Despite mixed findings, increasing evidence suggests that people with first-episode psychosis (FEP) show increased pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative status. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct a systematic literature search of cross-sectional studies comparing in vivo inflammatory and oxidative blood markers between FEP patients and healthy controls. We analyzed 61 independent samples from 59 publications, including 3002 patients with FEP (ie, patients with FEP, early psychosis, first-episode schizophrenia or early schizophrenia) and 2806 controls. After controlling for multiple comparisons, our meta-analysis showed that total antioxidant status and docosahexaenoic acid levels were significantly lower in FEP patients than in controls, whereas levels of homocysteine, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were significantly higher in FEP patients than in controls. This suggests that FEP patients had reduced antioxidant status and a pro-inflammatory imbalance, and that these biological processes may be targets for managing FEP.

AB  - The health effects of visible wind turbine features on residents were investigated. Further, it was examined, if visual annoyance has an influence on residents' health, and if wind turbine visibility impacts residents' health independently of or in combination with acoustical aspects.
   Medical databases, Google Scholar, public health institutions, and reference lists were searched systematically (PROSPERO registry number: CRD42016041737). Two independent reviewers screened titles/abstract and full texts, extracted data, and critically appraised the methodology of included studies. Study findings were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.
   Seventeen studies from 19 publications of varying methodological quality were included (two cohort studies, fifteen cross-sectional studies). The pooled prevalence of high annoyance due to altered views and shadow flicker was 6% each. The results of other health effects were inconsistent, with some indications showing that direct wind turbine visibility increases sleep disturbance. Annoyance by direct visibility, shadow flicker, and blinking lights was significantly associated with an increased risk for sleep disorders. One study indicated reactions to visual wind turbine features may be influenced by acoustical exposures.
   In interpreting the results, the differing methodological quality of the included studies needs to be considered. Direct and indirect wind turbine visibility may affect residents' health, and reactions may differ in combination with noise. Further, annoyance by wind turbine visibility may interact as mediator between visual exposures and the health of local residents. To confirm the results, more high-quality research is needed.

KW  - ANTIDEPRESSANTS
KW  - OCCUPANCY
KW  - SCALE
AB  - Background Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.
   Methods We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4-12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.
   Findings 28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11 .0; 7156 [60 .9%] of 11 749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75-150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.
   Interpretation For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder and a major cause of disability worldwide. This neurological condition is commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), and has a significant impact on the increasing burden of these neuropathologies. Over the past decades, some of the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms that contribute to these diseases have been elucidated and these findings indicate that, despite presenting distinct features, there are several similarities between the neurobiological alterations that lead to MDD and neurodegeneration in AD, PD, and HD. For instance, disturbances in monoaminergic transmission and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increased oxidative and neuroinfiammatory events, and impaired trophic support are thought to contribute to neuronal atrophy and death in all these diseases. In addition, neuroimaging findings have helped elucidate the structural and functional changes implicated in the relationship between depression and neurodegeneration, thus establishing a neuroanatomical signature to explain, at least in part, the comorbidity between MDD and AD, PD, and HD. The present review summarizes these findings and the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of common antidepressant therapies for the treatment of MDD in patients with these neurodegenerative diseases. This population is particularly vulnerable to the drawdowns of conventional antidepressant therapy (namely inadequate response and high risk of side effects), and the development of emerging therapeutic approaches to treat MDD in patients with AD, PD, and HD is thus of paramount importance to improve the quality of life of these individuals.

AB  - Background Globally, there are more than 150 million international migrant workers-individuals who are employed outside of their country of origin-comprising the largest international migrant group. A substantial number of migrants work in hazardous and exploitative environments, where they might be at considerable risk of injury and ill health. However, little data on occupational health outcomes of migrant workers exist, with which to inform global policy making and delivery of health services.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, MEDLINE, Ovid Global Health, and PsychINFO databases for primary research published between Jan 1, 2008, and Jan 24, 2018, reporting occupational health outcomes among international migrant workers (defined as individuals who are or have been employed outside their country of origin), without language or geographical restrictions. We excluded studies containing mixed cohorts of migrants and native workers in which migrant data could not be disaggregated, and studies that did not explicitly report migrant status. The main outcome was prevalence of occupational health outcomes (defined as any injury, mortality, or physical or psychiatric morbidity due to an individual's work or workplace environment) among international migrant workers. Summary estimates were calculated using random-effects models. The study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018099465.
   Findings Of the 1218 studies identified by our search, 36 studies were included in our systematic review, and 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The systematic review included occupational health outcomes for 12168 international migrant workers employed in 13 countries and territories, mostly employed in unskilled manual labour. Migrant workers originated from 25 low-income and middle-income countries, and worked in the following sectors: agriculture; domestic, retail, and service sectors; construction and trade; and manufacturing and processing. Migrant workers had various psychiatric and physical morbidities, and workplace accidents and injuries were relatively common. In the meta-analysis, among 7260 international migrant workers, the pooled prevalence of having at least one occupational morbidity was 47% (95% CI 29-64; I-2=99.70%). Among 3890 migrant workers, the prevalence of having at least one injury or accident, including falls from heights, fractures and dislocations, ocular injuries, and cuts was 22% (7-37; I-2=99.35%).
   Interpretation International migrant workers are at considerable risk of work-related ill health and injury, and their health needs are critically overlooked in research and policy. Governments, policy makers, and businesses must enforce and improve occupational health and safety measures, which should be accompanied by accessible, affordable, and appropriate health care and insurance coverage to meet the care needs of this important working population.

AB  - Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have shown an increased risk for violence and victimization. However, research on exposure to multiple forms of victimization in different contexts are scarce. Hence, the current aim is to review the evidence about polyvictimization among children with ASD or ADHD. PsycInfo, ERIC, ERC, Scopus, and PubMed databases were systematically searched until 12 March 2019 to identify empirical studies with reported prevalence rates of at least four forms of victimization among children with ASD or ADHD. A total of 6/1300 articles were included in the review, ranging in sample sizes from 92 to 4114. The reported prevalence rates for polyvictimization were 1.8% and 23.1% for children with ASD and 7.3% for children with ADHD. The results emphasize the high prevalence of violence and victimization, including polyvictimization, among children with ASD or ADHD. Polyvictimization among children with ASD or ADHD is a highly under researched area. Significant knowledge gaps and important methodological considerations that provide important implications for future research include lack of information on cyber bullying, frequency or intensity of victimization, and the failure to include children as informants and to report health outcomes associated with polyvictimization.

AB  - Whilst chemotherapy is a widely used anti-cancer treatment, a subset of patients experience cognitive decline. However, cancer type, treatment regimen, fatigue and anxiety can influence cognitive status. Rodent research has overcome these confounds to systematically evaluate cognitive domains and underlying neural mechanisms disrupted by chemotherapy treatment. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted in June 2017 to examine the relationship between chemotherapy and cognitive decline in animal models. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus and Medline databases. A quality assessment yielded a total of 83 papers to be considered for the review. A critical assessment of research papers indicated that cisplatin, CMF and MIX + 5-FU chemotherapy regimens produced strong deficits in short term memory, long term memory and executive control. An assessment of specific cognitive domains illustrated that short term memory was strongly impaired by chemotherapy treatment, often associated with impaired neurogenesis, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus. Pharmacological treatments were the most common intervention to reduce the prevalence of chemobrain.

AB  - Background: Family abandonment and rejection resulting in homelessness are detrimental to women diagnosed with mental illness in India. A majority of the literature related to homelessness holds a western background, and women's homelessness in relation to mental illness is relatively unexplored in the Indian context. This review was conducted to understand the sociocultural factors influencing family rejection and to synthesize the living situation of institutionalized women with mental illness in India. Methods: Literature search in electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar), carried out using appropriate keywords, and a manual search in the library catalog. Results: As per the selection criteria, 19 reports, including original research articles and conceptual papers, were included and reviewed. Conclusion: There is a shortage of methodologically sound research in understanding the connection of mental illness-women homelessness-and the institutionalization scenario. This review highlights the necessity of shifting focus from institutionalization to innovative psychiatric rehabilitation strategies using the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017.

AB  - Purpose of review
   The Lancet Commission on global mental health and sustainable development claims the field of global mental health is undergoing a 'transformational shift' toward an ethic of 'nothing about us without us'. Yet a systematic review published in 2016 identified few examples of meaningful participation by service users in mental health systems strengthening in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). To investigate whether this is still the case, we conducted a rapid review of primary research published between June 2017 and December 2018.
   Recent findings
   We identified 10 studies reporting on user involvement in LMICs, including three in mental health policy and planning, three in mental health services or capacity-building and three in treatment decision-making. An additional study was identified as having involved users in data collection, although this was unclear from the original text. Included studies were mostly qualitative and conducted as part of a situation analysis, pilot study, or other formative research. Few reported the results of efforts to improve involvement, suggesting this shift remains at an early stage.
   Summary
   Although the number of studies published on user involvement is rapidly increasing, the potentially 'transformational' effects of this shift in global mental health are not yet being felt by most users in LMICs.

AB  - Background. Lifestyle medicine has emerged as a transformational force in mainstream health care. Numerous health promotion and wellness programs have been created to facilitate the adoption of increased positive, modifiable health behaviors to prevent and lessen the effects of chronic disease. This article provides a scoping review of available health promotion interventions that focus on healthy adult populations in the past 10 years. Methods. We conducted a scoping review of the literature searching for health promotion interventions in the past 10 years. Interventions were limited to those conducted among healthy adults that offered a face-to-face, group-based format, with positive results on one or more health outcomes. We then developed a new health promotion intervention that draws on multiple components of included interventions. Results. Fifty-eight articles met our inclusion criteria. Physical activity was the primary focus of a majority (N = 47) of articles, followed by diet/nutrition (N = 40) and coping/social support (N = 40). Conclusions. Efficacious health promotion interventions are critical to address the prevention of chronic disease by addressing modifiable risk factors such as exercise, nutrition, stress, and coping. A new intervention, discussed is this article, provides a comprehensive approaches to health behavior change and may be adapted for future research.

AB  - BackgroundOne in three women experience intimate partner violence worldwide, according to many primary studies. However, systematic review and meta-analysis of intimate partner violence is very limited. Therefore, we set to summarize the findings of existing primary studies to generate evidence for informed decisions to tackle domestic violence against women in low and lower-middle income countries.MethodsStudies were searched from main databases (Medline via PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PopLine and Web of Science), Google scholar and other relevant sources using electronic and manual techniques. Published and unpublished studies written in English and conducted among women aged (15-49years) from 1994 to 2017 were eligible. Data were extracted independently by two authors, and recorded in Microsoft Excel sheet. Heterogeneity between included studies was assessed using I-2, and publication bias was explored using visual inspection of funnel plot. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine the pooled prevalence using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. In addition, sub-group analysis was carried out by study-setting and types of intimate partner violence.ResultsFifty two studies were included in the systematic review. Of these, 33 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of lifetime intimate partner violence was 55% (95% CI: 52, 59%). Of these, main categories were lifetime physical violence [39% (95% CI: 33, 45%); psychological violence [45% (95% CI: 40, 52%)] and sexual violence [20% (95% CI: 17, 23%)]. Furthermore, the pooled prevalence of current intimate partner violence was 38% (95% CI: 34, 43%). Of these, physical violence [25% (95% CI: 21, 28%)]; psychological violence [30% (95% CI: 24, 36%)] and sexual violence [7.0% (95% CI: 6.6, 7.5%)] were the pooled prevalence for the major types of intimate partner violence. In addition, concurrent intimate partner violence was 13% (95% CI: 12, 15%). Individual, relationship, community and societal level factors were associated with intimate partner violence. Traditional community gender-norm transformation, stakeholders' engagement, women's empowerment, intervention integration and policy/legal framework were highly recommended interventions to prevent intimate partner violence.ConclusionLifetime and current intimate partner violence is common and unacceptably high. Therefore, concerned bodies will need to design and implement strategies to transform traditional gender norms, engage stakeholders, empower women and integrate service to prevent violence against women.Protocol registrationPROSPERO: 2017: CRD42017079977.

AB  - To better understand human behavior, the emerging field of model-based cognitive neuroscience seeks to anchor psychological theory to the biological substrate from which behavior originates: the brain. Despite complex dynamics, many researchers in this field have demonstrated that fluctuations in brain activity can be related to fluctuations in components of cognitive models, which instantiate psychological theories. In this review, we discuss a number of approaches for relating brain activity to cognitive models, and expand on a framework for imposing reciprocity in the inference of mental operations from the combination of brain and behavioral data.

AB  - The impact of neurodegenerative disorders in humans has multiple consequences because of the progressive decline in cognitive and physical performances. These disorders have diverse manifestations and are influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors, concurrent health conditions as well as un-modifiable predisposing risk factors, including gender and advanced age. Accumulating evidence indicates a gender-dependent natural bias of neurodegenerative diseases, such as, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis, with the ratio of male to female prevalence as well as the severity of the disease differing significantly between the two sexes. This observation has recently garnered much attention and it is now being realized that understanding the sex as a biological variable in the etiology of the neurodegenerative diseases may advance the status of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies while improving the associated decline in cognitive and functional abilities. This review highlights the influence of gender in neurodegenerative disorders and further discusses the sex-specific pre-determined microenvironments that are critical in predisposing the individuals to such disorders.

AB  - A systematic review was conducted to investigate whether bilingualism has a protective effect against cognitive decline in aging and can protect against dementia. We searched the Medline, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and ERIC databases with a cut-off date of 31 March 2019, thereby following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol. Our search resulted in 34 eligible studies. Mixed results were found with respect to the protective effect of bilingualism against cognitive decline. Several studies showed a protective effect whereas other studies failed to find it. Moreover, evidence for a delay of the onset of dementia of between 4 and 5.5 years in bilingual individuals compared to monolinguals was found in several studies, but not in all. Methodological differences in the set-up of the studies seem to explain these mixed results. Lifelong bilingualism is a complex individual process, and many factors seem to influence this and need to be further investigated. This can be best achieved through large longitudinal studies with objective behavioral and neuroimaging measurements. In conclusion, although some evidence was found for a cognitive reserve-enhancing effect of lifelong bilingualism and protection against dementia, to date, no firm conclusions can be drawn.

We included 13 BPD studies (395 patients with BPD and 415 healthy controls) and 47 bipolar disorder studies (2111 patients with bipolar disorder and 3261 healthy controls). Peak coordinates from clusters with significant group differences were extracted. Effect-size signed differential mapping meta-analysis was performed to analyse peak coordinates of clusters and thresholds (P < 0.005, uncorrected). Conjunction analyses identified regions in which disorders showed common patterns of volumetric alteration. Correlation analyses were also performed.ResultsPatients with BPD showed decreased GMV and GMD in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex network (mPFC), bilateral amygdala and right parahippocampal gyrus; patients with bipolar disorder showed decreased GMV and GMD in the bilateral medial orbital frontal cortex (mOFC), right insula and right thalamus, and increased GMV and GMD in the right putamen. Multi-modal analysis indicated smaller volumes in both disorders in clusters in the right medial orbital frontal cortex. Decreased bilateral mPFC in BPD was partly mediated by patient age. Increased GMV and GMD of the right putamen was positively correlated with Young Mania Rating Scale scores in bipolar disorder.ConclusionsOur results show different patterns of GMV and GMD alteration and do not support the hypothesis that bipolar disorder and BPD are on the same affective spectrum.Declaration of interestNone.

AB  - Background Compromised neurocognition is a core feature of schizophrenia. With increasing studies researching cognitive function of Chinese patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) using MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), it is not clear about the level and pattern of cognitive impairment among this population. Aim To provide a meta-analysis systematically analysing studies of neurocognitive function using MCCB in Chinese patients with FES. Methods An independent literature search of both Chinese and English databases up to 13 March 2019 was conducted by two reviewers. Standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated using the random effects model to evaluate the effect size. Results 56 studies (FES=3167, healthy controls (HC)=3017) were included and analysed. No study was rated as 'high quality' according to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology. Compared with HCs, Chinese patients with FES showed impairment with large effect size in overall cognition (SMD=-1.60, 95% CI -1.82 to -1.38, I-2=67%) and all seven cognitive domains, with the SMD ranging from -0.87 to -1.41. In nine MCCB subtests, patients with FES showed significant difference in Symbol Coding (SMD=-1.90), Trail Making Test (TMT) (SMD=-1.36), Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs (SMD=-1.33), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (SMD=-1.24), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (SMD=-1.18), Mazes (SMD=-1.16), Category Fluency (SMD=-1.01), Spatial Span (SMD=-0.69) and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (SMD=-0.38). Conclusions Our meta-analysis demonstrates that Chinese patients with FES show neurocognitive deficits across all seven MCCB cognitive domains and all nine subtests, particularly in two neurocognitive domains: speed of processing and attention/vigilance, with the least impairment shown in social cognition. Symbol Coding and TMT may be the most sensitive tests to detect cognitive deficit in Chinese patients with FES.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression among elderly population in India.MethodsPubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, IndMed, and Google Scholar were searched to identify articles reported community-based prevalence of depression among elderly population using screening tools. This study included the articles published during the years 1997 to 2016. Studies conducted in the special population groups, hospitals, reported only a subcategory of depression, and not specified the screening tool were excluded. Data were extracted from published reports and any missing information was requested from authors. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were performed. The publication bias was evaluated by using Egger's test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots.ResultsFifty-one studies from 16 States of India were included as 56 datasets, which estimated the prevalence of depression among Indian elderly population as 34.4% (95% CI: 29.3-39.7). In sub-group analysis, the pooled prevalence was higher among females, rural populations, and in the eastern part of the country. Studies using non-probability sampling, and GDS and CES-D screening tool showed higher prevalence. Exclusion of the studies with sample size less than 100 and low-quality studies (score<5/8) had no effect on the estimate of the prevalence. The studies that excluded dementia before assessment of depression had lower prevalence.ConclusionAbout one third elderly population of India suffered from depression with female preponderance. The estimates varied with type of study tool, geographic region, sampling methods, and presence of dementia. The pooled estimate should be interpreted with caution as the studies included in this review had varied methodological approach and screening tools.

AB  - Occupational or environmental exposure to manganese (Mn) can lead to the development of "Manganism," a neurological condition showing certain motor symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease (PD). Like PD, Mn toxicity is seen in the central nervous system mainly affecting nigrostriatal neuronal circuitry and subsequent behavioral and motor impairments. Since the first report of Mn-induced toxicity in 1837, various experimental and epidemiological studies have been conducted to understand this disorder. While early investigations focused on the impact of high concentrations of Mn on the mitochondria and subsequent oxidative stress, current studies have attempted to elucidate the cellular and molecular pathways involved in Mn toxicity. In fact, recent reports suggest the involvement of Mn in the misfolding of proteins such as alpha-synuclein and amyloid, thus providing credence to the theory that environmental exposure to toxicants can either initiate or propagate neurodegenerative processes by interfering with disease-specific proteins. Besides manganism and PD, Mn has also been implicated in other neurological diseases such as Huntington's and prion diseases. While many reviews have focused on Mn homeostasis, the aim of this review is to concisely synthesize what we know about its effect primarily on the nervous system with respect to its role in protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, and consequently, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Based on the current evidence, we propose a 'Mn Mechanistic Neurotoxic Triad' comprising (1) mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, (2) protein trafficking and misfolding, and (3) neuroinflammation.

AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a risk factor for the development and persistence of substance use disorders (SUD). The prevalence of ADHD in patients with SUD varies across countries and cultures. So far, cross-cultural variance in ADHD prevalence rates among SUD patients was mainly ascribed to methodological differences between studies, leaving the role of societal and cultural practices in the ADHD-SUD link hardly acknowledged. The aim of the present mini review is to address this gap in the literature by providing evidence for the effect of socio-cultural practices on the ADHD-SUD link and suggesting directions for future research. To achieve this goal, we map the influence of socio-cultural factors on the ADHD-SUD link along three lines of research. The first line is concerned with the role of socio-cultural factors in the recognition, diagnosis and treatment of childhood ADHD. The second line of research is concerned with socio-cultural influences on substance use (e.g., religion, ethnic identity, acculturation, and socio-economic status). Finally, we describe potential socio-cultural factors which may operate as mechanisms for reducing or increasing access to substance abuse treatment (e.g., ethnic disparities in health care utilization). Identifying socio-cultural influences on the ADHD-SUD link may provide further insight into the bidirectional association between ADHD and SUD in different contexts and encourage future research in the field.

AB  - Background
   Despite being a global problem, little is known about the relationship between severe mental illness (SMI) and homelessness in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Homeless people with SMI are an especially vulnerable population and face myriad health and social problems. In LMICs, low rates of treatment for mental illness, as well as differing family support systems and cultural responses to mental illness, may affect the causes and consequences of homelessness in people with SMI.
   Aims
   To conduct a systematic, scoping review addressing the question: what is known about the co-occurrence of homelessness and SMI among adults living in LMICs?
   Method
   We conducted an electronic search, a manual search and we consulted with experts. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts, assessed publications for eligibility and appraised study quality.
   Results
   Of the 49 included publications, quality was generally low: they were characterised by poor or unclear methodology and reporting of results. A total of 7 publications presented the prevalence of SMI among homeless people; 12 presented the prevalence of homelessness among those with SMI. Only five publications described interventions for this population; only one included an evaluation component.
   Conclusions
   Evidence shows an association between homelessness and SMI in LMICs, however there is little information on the complex relationship and direction of causality between the phenomena. Existing programmes should undergo rigorous evaluation to identify key aspects required for individuals to achieve sustainable recovery. Respect for human rights should be paramount when conducting research with this population.

AB  - Objectives: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders with a 25% comorbidity rate with each other. In this study, we overview the comorbidity between ADHD and anxiety disorders in a longitudinal perspective across the lifespan and we discuss possible therapeutic strategies. Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed to identify clinical studies assessing comorbidity between ADHD and anxiety disorders from childhood to adulthood. Results: Anxiety disorders may substantially change the presentation, the prognosis, and the treatment of ADHD itself. In childhood, the presence of generalised anxiety disorder, could prevent the typical inhibitory dysfunction present in ADHD, in adolescence may increase the deficit of working memory, and in adulthood may enhance the presence of sleep problems. Individuals with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorders would benefit from adjunctive psychosocial or adjunctive pharmacotherapy interventions to cognitive behavioural treatment. Conclusions: The management of individuals with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorders could be challenging for clinicians, and assessing the developmental course is crucial in order to shed light on individualised treatment.Keypoints The comorbidity between ADHD and anxiety disorders changes the clinical presentation, the prognosis and treatment of patients with ADHD across lifespan. ADHD and anxiety disorders shared common neurobiological dysfunctions but have also different neurobiological abnormalities suggesting that they are different diagnoses. These patients are less likely to benefit from cognitive behavioural treatment strategies alone and often need adjunctive pharmacological treatments. Studies that evaluated the response to MPH reported conflicting results. These patients could respond less well and get more unpleasant arousal side-effects, but these findings need to be confirmed. For his unique mechanism of action, low dose aripiprazole treatment in adolescents and adults with this comorbid condition could be an intriguing avenue of exploration.

AB  - BackgroundWorkplace presenteeism is common and leads to the spread of infectious diseases. Previous reviews have focused on presenteeism in relation to general physical or mental ill health. In this systematic review we identified the prevalence of, and reasons and risk factors for, presenteeism in relation to an infectious illness.MethodWe searched Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES with terms relating to infectious illnesses and presenteeism at the work place or school; reference lists of relevant articles were also hand-searched.ResultOur search yielded 3580 papers after deduplication. After title, abstract and full text screening, 23 papers reporting on 24 studies were included. Twenty-three studies were cross-sectional studies and one was prospective. The quality of included studies was relatively poor due to problems such as sampling and non-response bias. Presenteeism prevalence ranged from 35 to 97%. Self-reported reasons for presenteeism fell into three main themes: 1. Organisational factors (organisational policy, presenteeism culture, disciplinary action), 2. Job characteristics (lack of cover, professionalism, job demand), and 3. Personal reasons (burden on colleagues, colleague perceptions, threshold of sickness absence and financial concerns). Statistical risk factors fell into four themes: 1. Sociodemographic, 2. Health, 3. Influenza-related behaviour, and 4. Employment characteristics. Most of the risk factors had insufficient evidence to allow us to draw any firm conclusions, and evidence regarding gender and age was inconsistent. The risk factor with the most consistent findings concerned occupation type, suggesting that those who worked in the healthcare sector, and specifically physicians, were at a higher risk of infectious illness presenteeism.ConclusionInfectious illness presenteeism is common. To address the public health consequences, organisations should focus on promoting a positive working culture and developing sickness absence policies that reduce presenteeism. Further research is needed in non-health sector organisations and schools to identify risk factors related to different organisations, which can then be used to tailor interventions at the organisational and individual level.

AB  - BackgroundInternet-based interventions can make self-management and recovery-oriented information and tools more accessible for people experiencing severe mental illness, including psychosis. The aim of this scoping review was to identify and describe emerging joint uses of these Internet-based interventions by service users experiencing psychosis and mental health workers. It also investigated how using these Internet-based interventions influenced interactions between service users and workers and whether recovery-oriented working practices were elicited.MethodsA scoping review method was used. Iterative review stages included identifying the review question, a comprehensive search including searching six electronic databases to locate relevant studies, selecting studies, charting the data, and collating and reporting the results. Rigour of the scoping review was enhanced by using an appraisal tool to evaluate the quality of included studies, and by using a published template for systematic description of interventions.ResultsFifteen papers about eleven Internet-based interventions that focused on self-management and/or recovery were identified. Interventions were web-based, mobile-device based, or both. The eleven interventions were used by service users either with their usual mental health workers, or with mental health workers employed in a research project. Emerging evidence suggested that jointly using an Internet-based intervention could support a positive sense of working together. However, mismatched expectations and poor integration of Internet-based interventions into service systems could also negatively influence interactions, leading to mistrust. The interventions demonstrated potential to elicit recognised recovery-oriented practices, specifically understanding service users' values and supporting their goal striving.ConclusionsThe use of Internet-based interventions focused on self-management and recovery in mental health services by service users and workers jointly demonstrates potential to support working together and recovery-oriented practice. Given that the quality of relationships is critical in recovery-oriented practice, greater focus on human support in Internet-based interventions is needed in future research and practice.

AB  - BackgroundThe effect of antipsychotic (AP) drugs on risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) remains unclear due to methodological limitations of, and inconsistencies across, existing studies. We aimed to systematically review studies reporting on the associations between AP drug use and stroke or MI risk, and to investigate whether associations differed among different sub-populations.MethodsWe searched Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Cochrane Library (from inception to May 28, 2017) for observational studies reporting on AP drug use and MI or stroke occurrence. We performed random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome, performing sub-groups analyses by study population - specifically general population (i.e. those not restricted to patients with a particular indication for AP drug use), people with dementia only and psychiatric illness only. Where feasible we performed subgroup analyses by AP drug class.ResultsFrom 7008 articles, we included 29 relevant observational studies, 19 on stroke and 10 on MI. Results of cohort studies that included a general population indicated a more than two-fold increased risk of stroke, albeit with substantial heterogeneity (pooled HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.13, 4.74, I-2=83.2%). However, the risk among patients with dementia was much lower, with no heterogeneity (pooled HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00, 1.33, I-2=0%) and there was no clear association among studies of psychiatric populations (pooled HR 1.44, 95% CI 0.90, 2.30; substantial heterogeneity [I-2=78.8])). Associations generally persisted when stratifying by AP class, but few studies reported on first generation AP drugs. We found no association between AP drug use and MI risk (pooled HR for cohort studies: 1.29, 95% CI 0.88, 1.90 and case-control studies: 1.07, 95% CI 0.94, 1.23), but substantial methodological and statistical heterogeneity among a relatively small number of studies limits firm conclusions.ConclusionsAPdrug use may be associated with an increased risk of stroke, but there is no clear evidence that this risk is further elevated in patients with dementia. Further studies are need to clarify the effect of AP drug use on MI and stroke risk in different sub-populations and should control for confounding by indication and stratify by AP drug class.

AB  - A successful integrated ocean acidification (OA) observing network must include (1) scientists and technicians from a range of disciplines from physics to chemistry to biology to technology development; (2) government, private, and intergovernmental support; (3) regional cohorts working together on regionally specific issues; (4) publicly accessible data from the open ocean to coastal to estuarine systems; (5) close integration with other networks focusing on related measurements or issues including the social and economic consequences of OA; and (6) observation-based informational products useful for decision making such as management of fisheries and aquaculture. The Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON), a key player in this vision, seeks to expand and enhance geographic extent and availability of coastal and open ocean observing data to ultimately inform adaptive measures and policy action, especially in support of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. GOA-ON works to empower and support regional collaborative networks such as the Latin American Ocean Acidification Network, supports new scientists entering the field with training, mentorship, and equipment, refines approaches for tracking biological impacts, and stimulates development of lower-cost methodology and technologies allowing for wider participation of scientists. GOA-ON seeks to collaborate with and complement work done by other observing networks such as those focused on carbon flux into the ocean, tracking of carbon and oxygen in the ocean, observing biological diversity, and determining short-and long-term variability in these and other ocean parameters through space and time.

AB  - The oceans take up over 1 million tons of anthropogenic CO2 per hour, increasing dissolved pCO(2) and decreasing seawater pH in a process called ocean acidification (OA). At the same time greenhouse warming of the surface ocean results in enhanced stratification and shoaling of upper mixed layers, exposing photosynthetic organisms dwelling there to increased visible and UV radiation as well as to a decreased nutrient supply. In addition, ocean warming and anthropogenic eutrophication reduce the concentration of dissolved O-2 in seawater, contributing to the spread of hypoxic zones. All of these global changes interact to affect marine primary producers. Such interactions have been documented, but to a much smaller extent compared to the responses to each single driver. The combined effects could be synergistic, neutral, or antagonistic depending on species or the physiological processes involved as well as experimental setups. For most calcifying algae, the combined impacts of acidification, solar UV, and/or elevated temperature clearly reduce their calcification; for diatoms, elevated CO2 and light levels interact to enhance their growth at low levels of sunlight but inhibit it at high levels. For most photosynthetic nitrogen fixers (diazotrophs), acidification associated with elevated CO2 may enhance their N-2 fixation activity, but interactions with other environmental variables such as trace metal availability may neutralize or even reverse these effects. Macroalgae, on the other hand, either as juveniles or adults, appear to benefit from elevated CO2 with enhanced growth rates and tolerance to lowered pH. There has been little documentation of deoxygenation effects on primary producers, although theoretically elevated CO2 and decreased O-2 concentrations could selectively enhance carboxylation over oxygenation catalyzed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and thereby benefit autotrophs. Overall, most ocean-based global change biology studies have used single and/or double stressors in laboratory tests. This overview examines the combined effects of OA with other features such as warming, solar UV radiation, and deoxygenation, focusing on primary producers.

AB  - Dopamine is primarily produced in the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmentum area (VTA) in the brain. It plays a well-established role in the motor control, reward, mood regulation and addiction behaviour. Dopamine release has been shown to be regulated by the circadian clock and hence, plays a regulatory role in the sleep-wake cycle. Clinically, dopaminergic agents have been widely used to modulate alertness. The following review offers a demonstration of the heterogeneous dopamine system in the brain and the various studies investigating the circadian rhythmicity of the dopamine system and its regulation of sleep-wake behaviour. Additionally, it suggests a potential link between the circadian clock and the sleep-wake cycle in mood regulation through the dopaminergic system.

AB  - Background
   Mental health services lack a strong evidence base on the most effective interventions to reduce compulsory admissions. However, some research suggests a positive impact of crisis-planning interventions in which patients are involved in planning for their future care during a mental health crisis.
   Aims
   This review aimed to synthesise randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence on the effectiveness of crisis-planning interventions (for example advance statements and joint crisis plans) in reducing rates of compulsory hospital admissions for people with psychotic illness or bipolar disorder, compared with usual care (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018084808).
   Method
   Six online databases were searched in October 2018. The primary outcome was compulsory psychiatric admissions and secondary outcomes included other psychiatric admissions, therapeutic alliance, perceived coercion and cost-effectiveness. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane collaboration tool.
   Results
   The search identified 1428 studies and 5 RCTs were eligible. One study had high risk of bias because of incomplete primary outcome data. Random-effects meta-analysis showed a 25% reduction in compulsory admissions for those receiving crisis-planning interventions compared with usual care (risk ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.93, P = 0.008; from five studies). There was no statistical evidence that the intervention reduced the risk of voluntary or combined voluntary and compulsory psychiatric admissions. Few studies assessed other secondary outcomes.
   Conclusions
   Our meta-analysis suggests that crisis-planning interventions substantially reduce the risk of compulsory admissions among individuals with psychotic illness or bipolar disorder. Despite common components, interventions varied in their content and intensity across the trials. The optimal models and implementation of these interventions require further investigation.

AB  - Global inequity in access to and availability of essential mental health services is well recognized. The mental health treatment gap is approximately 50% in all countries, with up to 90% of people in the lowest-income countries lacking access to required mental health services. Increased investment in global mental health (GMH) has increased innovation in mental health service delivery in LMICs. Situational analyses in areas where mental health services and systems are poorly developed and resourced are essential when planning for research and implementation, however, little guidance is available to inform methodological approaches to conducting these types of studies. This scoping review provides an analysis of methodological approaches to situational analysis in GMH, including an assessment of the extent to which situational analyses include equity in study designs. It is intended as a resource that identifies current gaps and areas for future development in GMH. Formative research, including situational analysis, is an essential first step in conducting robust implementation research, an essential area of study in GMH that will help to promote improved availability of, access to and reach of mental health services for people living with mental illness in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While strong leadership in this field exists, there remain significant opportunities for enhanced research representing different LMICs and regions.

AB  - Transient potassium current channels (I-A channels), which are expressed in most brain areas, have a central role in modulating feedforward and feedback inhibition along the dendroaxonic axis. Loss of the modulatory channels is tightly associated with a number of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, fragile X syndrome (FXS), Parkinson's disease, chronic pain, tinnitus, and ataxia. However, the functional significance of I-A channels in these diseases has so far been underestimated. In this review, we discuss the distribution and function of I-A channels. Particularly, we posit that downregulation of I-A channels results in neuronal (mostly dendritic) hyperexcitability accompanied by the imbalanced excitation and inhibition ratio in the brain's networks, eventually causing the brain diseases. Finally, we propose a potential therapeutic target: the enhanced action of I-A channels to counteract Ca2+-permeable channels including NMDA receptors could be harnessed to restore dendritic excitability, leading to a balanced neuronal state.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are chronic, progressive, and age-associated neurological disorders characterized by neuronal deterioration in specific brain regions. Although the specific pathological mechanisms underlying these disorders have remained elusive, ion channel dysfunction has become increasingly accepted as a potential mechanism for neurodegenerative diseases. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are encoded by the HCN1-4 gene family and conduct the hyperpolarization-activated current (I-h). These channels play important roles in modulating cellular excitability, rhythmic activity, dendritic integration, and synaptic transmission. In the present review, we first provide a comprehensive picture of the role of HCN channels in PD by summarizing their role in the regulation of neuronal activity in PD-related brain regions. Dysfunction of I-h may participate in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced toxicity and represent a pathogenic mechanism in PD. Given current reports of the critical role of HCN channels in neuroinflammation and depression, we also discussed the putative contribution of HCN channels in inflammatory processes and non-motor symptoms in PD. In the second section, we summarize how HCN channels regulate the formation of ii-amyloid peptide in AD and the role of these channels in learning and memory. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of HCN channels in ALS and SMA based on existing discoveries.

AB  - Data obtained from several studies have shown that mitochondria are involved and play a central role in the progression of several distinct pathological conditions. Morphological alterations and disruptions on the functionality of mitochondria may be related to metabolic and energy deficiency in neurons in a neurodegenerative disorder. Several recent studies demonstrate the linkage between neurodegeneration and mitochondrial dynamics in the spectrum of a promising era called precision mitochondrial medicine. In this review paper, an analysis of the correlation between mitochondria, Alzheimer's disease, and other central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders like the Parkinson's disease and the autism spectrum disorder is under discussion. The role of GTPases like the mfn1, mfn2, opa1, and dlp1 in mitochondrial fission and fusion is also under investigation, influencing mitochondrial population and leading to oxidative stress and neuronal damage.

AB  - Most research in cognitive neuroscience explores how external stimuli are processed by the brain. However, the brain also receives input from the internal body. We discuss here how the heart and gastrointestinal (GI) tract intrinsically generate their own electrical activity, thereby continuously sending information to the brain. These ongoing ascending signals actively shape brain dynamics at rest, complementing canonical resting-state networks (RSNs). Cardiac signals also influence the processing of external sensory information and the production of spontaneous, internal cognition. These findings are discussed in relation to interpretative frameworks regarding the functional role of visceral inputs. This active field of research offers a unique opportunity to draw new theories blurring the border between cognition, emotion, and consciousness, as well as between mind and body.

AB  - Spontaneous future cognitions refer to mental representations about the future that enter consciousness with no immediately preceding attempt of bringing them to mind. They are studied under different terms in several areas of psychology, but with little interdisciplinary exchange of findings and theoretical developments. Different conceptions of spontaneous future cognition derive from separate literatures and are rarely considered together, leaving their potential conceptual overlaps as well as their unique features unclarified. In this article, I review research on spontaneous future cognitions in relation to mind wandering, involuntary episodic future thoughts, and intrusive future imagery in cravings and clinical disorders. I conclude that more research is needed to clarify the potential functions served by spontaneous future cognitions in everyday life, under which conditions they may become dysfunctional, how they are triggered by situational cues, and how their content may be constrained by motivational factors and beliefs. The burgeoning field of spontaneous future cognitions forms a promising novel approach to the cognitive and motivational regulation of behavior in everyday life.

AB  - Empathy, which is the ability to feel concern for and to understand others' feelings, is thought to develop in high quality relationships with parent and peers, but also to facilitate the quality of these relationships. While a wide literature has addressed this aspect, the heterogeneity of primary studies, in which different indicators of relationship quality (e.g., support, conflict) and empathy (i.e., affective and cognitive) have been examined, makes it difficult to draw conclusive answers. Therefore, it remained ambiguous how parent-child and peer relationship quality are associated with adolescents' empathy. In order to increase the understanding of these associations, a multilevel meta-analysis was performed, which allowed for including multiple effect sizes from each study. By a systematic literate search, 70 eligible studies were found that provided 390 effect sizes from 75 independent samples. The results showed a small positive correlation between parent-child relationship quality and empathy, and a small-to-moderate positive correlation between peer relationship quality and empathy, which was significantly stronger than the correlation with parent-child relationship quality. Hence, the meta-analytic results indicate that adolescents with higher quality relationships, especially with peers, indeed tend to show more concern for and understanding of others' emotions than adolescents with lower quality relationships. Moreover, the moderation analyses showed stronger correlations for the positive dimension of relationship quality than for the negative dimension, and stronger correlations for composite scores of affective and cognitive empathy than for separate scores of the empathy dimensions. However, no differences in correlations were found between the affective and cognitive empathy dimension, and no moderation effects were found for gender and age. Thus, this meta-analysis demonstrates robust positive associations between parent-child and peer relationship quality and empathy in adolescence, implying that good empathic abilities may be a protective factor for experiencing poor relationships.

AB  - Background
   Preventing suicide and self-harm is a global health priority. Although there is a growing evidence base for the effectiveness of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapies for a range of disorders, to date there has been no systematic review of its effectiveness in reducing suicidal and self-harming behaviours.
   Aims
   To systematically review randomised controlled trials of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapies for suicidal attempts and self-harm.
   Method
   We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Psycharticles, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomise controlled trials of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapies for reducing suicide attempts and self-harm.
   Results
   Twelve trials (17 articles) were included in the meta-analyses. Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapies were effective in reducing the number of patients attempting suicide (pooled odds ratio, 0.469; 95% CI 0.274-0.804). We found some evidence for significantly reduced repetition of self-harm at 6-month but not 12-month follow-up. Significant treatment effects were also found for improvements in psychosocial functioning and reduction in number of hospital admissions.
   Conclusions
   Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapies are indicated to be effective in reducing suicidal behaviour and to have short-term effectiveness in reducing self-harm. They can also be beneficial in improving psychosocial well-being. However, the small number of trials and moderate quality of the evidence means further high-quality trials are needed to confirm our findings and to identity which specific components of the psychotherapies are effective.

AB  - Background: In contrast to over 30 studies reporting neurotoxicity associated with the first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), several published studies have repotted multiple neuroprotective effects associated with the second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). This prompted us to conduct a review of the reported neuroprotective mechanisms of the SGA class of antipsychotics compared to the FGAs.
   Methods: A PubMed search was conducted using the keywords antipsychotic, neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, neuro toxicity, toxicity, brain volume, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, myelin, and oligodendrocyte. No restrictions were placed on the date of the articles or language. Studies with a clearly described methodology were included.
   Results: Animal, cell culture, and human clinical studies were identified. Twenty-four reports met the criteria for the search. All studies included at least one SGA (aripiprazole, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, perospirone, quetiapine, risperidone, and/or ziprasidone). A few also included FGAs as a comparator (predominantly haloperidol). All studies demonstrated at least one neuroprotective mechanism of one or more SGAs, while some studies also showed that FGAs ranged from having no neuroprotective effects to actually exerting neurotoxic effects leading to neuronal death.
   Conclusions: A review of the literature suggests that in addition to their antipsychotic efficacy and low motoric side effects, SGAs exert measurable neuroprotective effects mediated via multiple molecular mechanisms and often in a dose-dependent manner. The neuroprotective effects of SGAs range from preventative to restorative and may play a salutary role in ameliorating the neurodegenerative effects of psychosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over the past few decades, a considerable scientific progress has been achieved in the area of fish welfare at all stages-farming, transportation, various pre-slaughter manipulations, stunning/killing procedures, etc. The increasing scientific interest is mainly due to the serious need of developing and implementing specific fish welfare requirements across the whole chain for both ethical (welfare) and commercial (meat quality) reasons. Since there has been substantial evidence that fish are able to experience pain and suffering, the provoked stress response could be a major cause of altered post-mortem metabolism and impaired meat quality. The present review was aimed to present the relationship between ante-mortem stress, course of post-mortem metabolic processes and the potential alterations in some quality traits of fish for human consumption.

AB  - In recent years, several studies have examined the potential associations between mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In MS, neurological disability results from inflammation, demyelination, and ultimately, axonal damage within the central nervous system. The sustained inflammatory phase of the disease leads to ion channel changes and chronic oxidative stress. Several independent investigations have demonstrated mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in MS, as well as abnormalities in mitochondrial transport. These processes create an energy imbalance and contribute to a parallel process of progressive neurodegeneration and irreversible disability. The potential roles of mitochondria in neurodegeneration are reviewed. An overview of mitochondrial diseases that may overlap with MS are also discussed, as well as possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of MS and other neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - The aging process includes impairment in mitochondrial function, a reduction in anti-oxidant activity, and an increase in oxidative stress, marked by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Oxidative damage to macromolecules including DNA and electron transport proteins likely increases ROS production resulting in further damage. This oxidative theory of cell aging is supported by the fact that diseases associated with the aging process are marked by increased oxidative stress. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ(10)) levels fall with aging in the human but this is not seen in all species or all tissues. It is unknown whether lower CoQ(10) levels have a part to play in aging and disease or whether it is an inconsequential cellular response to aging. Despite the current lay public interest in supplementing with CoQ(10), there is currently not enough evidence to recommend CoQ(10) supplementation as an anti-aging anti-oxidant therapy.

AB  - Neurons are highly polarized cells that consist of three main structural and functional domains: a cell body or soma, an axon, and dendrites. These domains contain smaller compartments with essential roles for proper neuronal function, such as the axonal presynaptic boutons and the dendritic postsynaptic spines. The structure and function of these compartments have now been characterized in great detail. Intriguingly, however, in the last decade additional levels of compartmentalization within the axon and the dendrites have been identified, revealing that these structures are much more complex than previously thought. Herein we examine several types of structural and functional sub-compartmentalization found in neurons of both vertebrates and invertebrates. For example, in mammalian neurons the axonal initial segment functions as a sub-compartment to initiate the action potential, to select molecules passing into the axon, and to maintain neuronal polarization. Moreover, work in Drosophila melanogaster has shown that two distinct axonal guidance receptors are precisely clustered in adjacent segments of the commissural axons both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a cell-intrinsic mechanism underlying the compartmentalized receptor localization. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a subset of interneurons exhibits calcium dynamics that are localized to specific sections of the axon and control the gait of navigation, demonstrating a regulatory role of compartmentalized neuronal activity in behaviour. These findings have led to a number of new questions, which are important for our understanding of neuronal development and function. How are these sub-compartments established and maintained? What molecular machinery and cellular events are involved? What is their functional significance for the neuron? Here, we reflect on these and other key questions that remain to be addressed in this expanding field of biology.

AB  - Objective: The goal of this study was to systematically review risk factors for workplace bullying. Methods: The search was carried out in two databases. Studies with estimates of risk factors for workplace bullying were included in the review. We assessed the quality of the selected studies using an adapted version of the Downs and Black checklist. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were used for reporting papers. Results: Fifty-one papers were included, and 70.6% were from European countries. Women were reported to be at higher risk of being bullied in most studies (odds ratio (OR) from 1.17 to 2.77). Authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles were positively associated with bullying. Several psychosocial factors, such as stress (OR from 1.37 to 4.96), and occupational risks related to work organization, such as flexible work methods, role conflict, role ambiguity, monotonous or rotating tasks, high demands, pressure of work, and unclarity of duties were strongly associated with bullying. Discussion: The findings highlight the central role of organizational factors in bullying. Policies to prevent bullying must address the culture of organizations, facing the challenge of developing a new management and leadership framework.

AB  - Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder can be an important source of distress and disfunctionality to affected individuals. Its treatment is mainly pharmacological and psychotherapeutic (namely exposure with response prevention). The inference-based model appeared in the decade of 90, aiming to solve some of the limitations of the existing cognitive-behavioral formulations of obsessive-compulsive-disorder.
   Aims: To present a review of the inference-based model and inference-based therapy applied to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Methods: Non-systematic review of articles searched in PubMed and Medline, and scientific literature of reference.
   Results: The core element of the conceptualization of obsessive-compulsive disorder according to the inference-based model is inferential confusion, that is, confusion between possibility and reality. A narrative is constructed that is distant from the events of the here and now and from common sense,supported by specific inductive reasoning processes that are believed to be altered in OCD. From here will arise the first thought with the characteristics of obsessive thought, called primary inference, followed by anticipated consequences called secondary inferences, which result in anxiety and consequently compulsions. The inference-based therapy was outlined from this formulation of the obsessive-compulsive dyad. This therapy aims to invalidate the reasoning processes that lead to the doubt or primary inference and return the person to the world of senses and common sense. It showed efficacy in empirical studies, namely when compared to classic cognitive-behavioral therapy in two randomized controlled trials, with more efficacy in patients with over-investment in the obsessions or poor insight.
   Conclusions: Regarding its efficacy, inference-based therapy appears promising. It could be a hypothesis to consider in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as in other disorders such as dysmorphophobia, eating disorders and hoarding disorder.

AB  - Protein folding is a complex, multisystem process characterized by heavy molecular and cellular footprints. Chaperone machinery enables proper protein folding and stable conformation. Other pathways concomitant with the protein folding process include transcription, translation, post-translational modifications, degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and autophagy. As such, the folding process can go awry in several different ways. The pathogenic basis behind most neurodegenerative diseases is that the disruption of protein homeostasis (i.e. proteostasis) at any level will eventually lead to protein misfolding. Misfolded proteins often aggregate and accumulate to trigger neurotoxicity through cellular stress pathways and consequently cause neurodegenerative diseases. The manifestation of a disease is usually dependent on the specific brain region that the neurotoxicity affects. Neurodegenerative diseases are age-associated, and their incidence is expected to rise as humans continue to live longer and pursue a greater life expectancy. We presently review the sequelae of protein misfolding and aggregation, as well as the role of these phenomena in several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and spinocerebellar ataxia. Strategies for treatment and therapy are also conferred with respect to impairing, inhibiting, or reversing protein misfolding.

AB  - New discoveries providing insights into mitochondrial bioenergetics, their dynamic interactions as well as their role in cellular homeostasis have dramatically advanced our understanding of the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's disease (PD). Respiratory chain impairment is a key feature in sporadic PD patients and there is growing evidence that links proteins encoded by PD-associated genes to disturbances in mitochondrial function. Against the backdrop of latest advances in the development of PD treatments that target mitochondria, we aim to give an overview of the literature published in the last three decades on the significance of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of PD. We describe the contribution of mitochondrial genome alterations and PD-associated genes to mitochondrial maintenance. We highlight mitophagy as a key mechanism in neurodegeneration. Moreover, we focus on the reciprocal interaction between alpha-synuclein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We discuss a novel trafficking pathway involving mitochondrial-derived vesicles within the context of PD and provide a synopsis of the most recently emerging topics in PD research with respect to mitochondria. This includes the relationship between mitochondria and cell-mediated immunity, the ER-mitochondria axis, sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial stress response and the role of micro RNAs in the aetiology of PD. In addition, recent studies have challenged the neuro-centric view of PD pathology, moving microglia and astrocytes into the research spotlight. Greater insights into these mechanisms may hold the key for the development of novel targeted therapies, addressing the need for a disease-modifying treatment, which has remained elusive to date.

AB  - Our ability to represent temporal, spatial, and numerical information is critical for understanding the world around us. Given the prominence of quantitative representations in the natural world, numerous cognitive, neurobiological, and developmental models have been proposed as a means of describing how we track quantity. One prominent theory posits that time, space, and number are represented by a common magnitude system, or a common neural locus (i.e., Bonn & Cantlon in Cognitive Neuropsychology, 29(1/2), 149-173, 2012; Cantlon, Platt, & Brannon in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 13(2), 83-91, 2009; Meck & Church in Animal Behavior Processes, 9(3), 320, 1983; Walsh in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(11), 483-488, 2003). Despite numerous similarities in representations of time, space, and number, an increasing body of literature reveals striking dissociations in how each quantity is processed, particularly later in development. These findings have led many researchers to consider the possibility that separate systems may be responsible for processing each quantity. This review will analyze evidence in favor of a common magnitude system, particularly in infancy, which will be tempered by counter evidence, the majority of which comes from experiments with children and adult participants. After reviewing the current data, we argue that although the common magnitude system may account for quantity representations in infancy, the data do not provide support for this system throughout the life span. We also identify future directions for the field and discuss the likelihood of the developmental divergence model of quantity representation, like that of Newcombe (Ecological Psychology, 2, 147-157, 2014), as a more plausible account of quantity development.

AB  - Clinical trials applying growth factors to alleviate symptoms of patients with neurological disorders have largely been unsuccessful in the past. As an alternative approach, growth factor receptors or components of their signal transduction machinery may be targeted directly. In recent years, the search for intracellular signaling integrator downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases provided valuable novel substrates. Among them are the Sprouty proteins which mainly act as inhibitors of growth factor-dependent neuronal and glial signaling pathways. In this review, we summarize the role of Sprouties in the lesioned central and peripheral nervous system with particular reference to Sprouty2 that is upregulated in various experimental models of neuronal degeneration and regeneration. Increased synthesis under pathological conditions makes Sprouty2 an attractive pharmacological target to enhance intracellular signaling activities, notably the ERK pathway, in affected neurons or activated astrocytes. Interestingly, high Sprouty2 levels are also found in malignant glioma cells. We recently demonstrated that abrogating Sprouty2 function strongly inhibits intracranial tumor growth and leads to significantly prolonged survival of glioblastoma bearing mice by induction of ERK-dependent DNA replication stress. On the contrary, knockdown of Sprouty proteins increases proliferation of activated astrocytes and, consequently, reduces secondary brain damage in neuronal lesion models such as kainic acid-induced epilepsy or endothelin-induced ischemia. Furthermore, downregulation of Sprouty2 improves nerve regeneration in the lesioned peripheral nervous system. Taken together, targeting Sprouties as intracellular inhibitors of the ERK pathway holds great promise for the treatment of various neurological disorders including gliomas. Since the protein lacks enzymatic activities, it will be difficult to develop chemical compounds capable to directly and specifically modulate Sprouty functions. However, interfering with Sprouty expression by gene therapy or siRNA treatment provides a realistic approach to evaluate the therapeutic potential of indirectly stimulating ERK activities in neurological disease.

AB  - Humans can simultaneously combine automatic/habitual and voluntary/goal-directed aspects of behavioral control. Habitual routines permit us to perform well practiced task-components with minimal or no voluntary attention. Evidence from animal and human investigations indicates that dopaminergic neurons in lateral substantia nigra, which innervate the sensorimotor striatum, are engaged during the acquisition and performance of automatized skills and habits. Typically, in Parkinson disease (PD), there is a differential loss of dopamine, which occurs earliest and most severely in the caudal sensorimotor striatum, a subdivision of the striatum implicated in habitual control. We suggest that frequent reliance on habitual performance may be a critical functional stressor, which, when combined with other more general risk factors, could explain the selective neuro-degeneration of the nigrostriatal motor projection in PD.

AB  - The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic mapping review of the literature that explored associations of pregnancy intentions with health-related lifestyle behaviours and psychological wellbeing before and during pregnancy. Six databases were searched (May 2017) for papers relating to pregnancy intentions, health-related lifestyle behaviours, and psychological wellbeing. The literature was mapped according to the preconception or pregnancy period; prospective or retrospective variable assessment; and reported lifestyle behaviours and psychological wellbeing outcomes. Of 19,430 retrieved records, 303 studies were eligible. Pregnancy intentions were considered during the preconception period in 103 studies (only 23 assessed prospectively), and during the pregnancy period in 208 studies (141 prospectively). Associations between pregnancy intention and preconception behaviours/psychological wellbeing were primarily reported for supplement use (n = 58) and were lacking for diet/exercise, and psychological factors. For behaviours/psychological wellbeing during pregnancy, associations with pregnancy intention were focused on prenatal care (n = 79), depression (n = 61), and smoking (n = 56) and were lacking for diet/exercise. Only 7 studies assessed pregnancy intentions with a validated tool. Despite a large body of literature, there were several methodological limitations identified, namely assessment of pregnancy intentions with non-validated measures and the reliance on retrospective assessment. Future primary studies are needed to fill gaps in our understanding regarding energy-balance-related behaviours. Future studies (including reviews/meta-analyses) should take care to address the noted limitations to provide a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the relationships between pregnancy intentions and health-related lifestyle behaviours and psychological wellbeing before and during pregnancy.

Despite a well-established evidence-base, implementation and access to these interventions in clinical practice for people with severe mental illness in the Asia-Pacific region is low. We therefore aimed to evaluate prominent themes impacting on clinical practice, policy, and the implementation of psychiatric rehabilitation across the Asia-Pacific region. Methods A comprehensive review of relevant literature on psychiatric rehabilitation of three regions within the Asia-Pacific was conducted using a structured search of PubMed and other databases. Eligible articles were selected which focussed on how psychiatric rehabilitation is defined and implemented across the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the associated successes and challenges. Common themes were generated. Results Six themes emerged: the impact of policy, legislation, and human rights; access difficulties; the important role of family; the significance of culture, religion, and spiritual beliefs; the widespread impact of stigma; and the indigenous models of excellence being developed. Discussion Consideration of the six themes and their implications should help raise awareness of the issues involved in the provision of psychiatric rehabilitation in the Asia-Pacific region and may improve outcomes for people living with severe mental illness. Suggested strategies include: developing a shared understanding of psychiatric rehabilitation; establishing quality legislation that's well implemented; adapting evidence-based models to develop culturally appropriate services; implementing stigma reduction and empowerment-based interventions; and, ensuring coordinated action among all stakeholders, combined with effective leadership.

AB  - Background The built environment exerts one of the strongest directly measurable effects on physical and mental health, yet the evidence base underpinning the design of healthy urban planning is not fully developed.
   Method This study provides a systematic review of quantitative studies assessing the impact of buildings on health. In total, 7127 studies were identified from a structured search of eight databases combined with manual searching for grey literature. Only quantitative studies conducted between January 2000 and November 2016 were eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed using the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies.
   Results In total, 39 studies were included in this review. Findings showed consistently that housing refurbishment and modifications, provision of adequate heating, improvements to ventilation and water supply were associated with improved respiratory outcomes, quality of life and mental health. Prioritization of housing for vulnerable groups led to improved wellbeing. However, the quality of the underpinning evidence and lack of methodological rigour in most of the studies makes it difficult to draw causal links.
   Conclusion This review identified evidence to demonstrate the strong association between certain features of housing and wellbeing such as adequate heating and ventilation. Our findings highlight the need for strengthening of the evidence base in order for meaningful conclusions to be drawn.

AB  - PurposeMedical students appear to be a high-risk group to develop psychological problems including eating disorders (ED). The prevalence estimates of ED risk vary greatly between studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis was done to estimate the prevalence of ED risk among medical students.MethodsAn electronic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, ProQuest and Google Scholar was conducted. Studies that reported the prevalence of ED risk among medical students and were published in English peer-reviewed journals between 1982 and 2017 were included. Information about study characteristics and the prevalence of ED risk were extracted by four investigators. Each article was reviewed independently by at least two investigators. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis using the DerSimonian-Laird method. The main outcome of interest was the prevalence of ED risk in medical students.ResultsThe prevalence of ED risk among medical students was extracted from nineteen cross-sectional studies across nine countries (total participants n=5722). The overall pooled prevalence rate of ED risk was 10.4% (497/5722 students, 95% CI 7.8-13.0%), with statistically significant evidence between-study heterogeneity (Q=295, 2=0.003, I2=94.0%, P<0.001). Prevalence estimates between studies ranged from 2.2 to 29.1%.ConclusionIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, the summary prevalence of ED risk among medical students was 10.4%. Further research is needed to identify and prevent ED in this population. Studies are also needed to investigate concurrent pathologies associated with ED risk.Level of evidenceLevel I, systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - Parabens are ubiquitous substances commonly used as preservatives because of their antibacterial activity. The estrogenic activity of parabens may cause undesirable health effects and adverse birth outcomes. The objective of the present systematic review was to investigate the association between prenatal exposure to parabens and anthropometric birth outcomes. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases were systematically searched until April 18, 2018. Of 326 records that remained after removing duplicates, 6 original articles were included in the final analysis after excluding irrelevant articles. The included studies indicated that most of the pregnant mothers were exposed to parabens, especially methyl and propyl parabens. However, no definitive association was found between the prenatal urinary concentration of parabens and birth weight or head circumference. In addition, a positive but non-significant association was detected between birth length and maternal exposure to parabens. The present systematic review revealed that assessment of significant associations in current epidemiological studies is impermissible due to methodological limitations and absence of inter-study consistency. Furthermore, because of the complexity of the effect of environmental factors on health, future large-scale studies with proper study design are required to investigate the effect of parabens exposure on birth outcomes.

AB  - This study used a meta-analysis to gain a clearer understanding of the relationships between behavioral job search self-efficacy (JSSE) and its relevant variables. Study variables were selected based on the career self-management model of the social cognitive career theory, which comprehensively includes sources and outcomes of JSSE. In addition, moderators that reflect various sample characteristics and the studies' research designs were included to clarify the hitherto inconsistent results between JSSE and related variables. Based on the analysis on 80 independent samples from 74 articles, results showed that supports and proactive personality (the antecedent variables) and emotional wellbeing (the consequence variable) had consistently strong relations with JSSE. Moderator analyses showed that sample type (undergraduates, laidoff), cultural value (individualism, collectivism), length of unemployment (over 6 months, under 6 months), and research design (cross-sectional, longitudinal) moderated the links between JSSE and two consequence variables, job search action, and job-search-related outcome. These results indicate that it is important to consider the agents of job search, their job search contexts, and methodological issues in conducting future research and interventions. Implications of the results are discussed and future research and practice are considered.

AB  - Background: Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), an ambient air pollutant with mass-based standards promulgated under the Clean Air Act, and black carbon (BC), a common component of PM2.5, are both associated with cardiovascular health effects.
   Objectives: To elucidate whether BC is associated with distinct, or stronger, cardiovascular responses compared to PM2.5, we conducted a systematic review. We evaluated the associations of short-and long-term BC, or the related component elemental carbon (EC), with cardiovascular endpoints including heart rate variability, heart rhythm, blood pressure and vascular function, ST segment depression, repolarization abnormalities, atherosclerosis and heart function, in the context of what is already known about PM2.5.
   Data sources: We conducted a stepwise systematic literature search of the PubMed, Web of Science and TOXLINE databases and applied Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting our results.
   Study eligibility criteria: Studies reporting effect estimates for the association of quantitative measurements of ambient BC (or EC) and PM2.5, with relevant cardiovascular endpoints (i.e. meeting inclusion criteria) were included in the review. Included studies were evaluated for risk of bias in study design and results. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Risk of bias evaluations assessed aspects of internal validity of study findings based on study design, conduct, and reporting to identify potential issues related to confounding or other biases. Study results are presented to facilitate comparison of the consistency of associations with PM2.5 and BC within and across studies.
   Results: Our results demonstrate similar associations for BC (or EC) and PM2.5 with the cardiovascular endpoints examined. Across studies, associations for BC and PM2.5 varied in their magnitude and precision, and confidence intervals were generally overlapping within studies. Where differences in the magnitude of the association between BC or EC and PM2.5 within a study could be discerned, no consistent pattern across the studies examined was apparent.
   Limitations: We were unable to assess the independence of the effect of BC, relative the effect of PM2.5, on the cardiovascular system, nor was information available to understand the impact of differential exposure mis-classification.
   Conclusions: Overall, the evidence indicates that both BC (or EC) and PM2.5 are associated with cardiovascular effects but the available evidence is not sufficient to distinguish the effect of BC (or EC) from that of PM2.5 mass.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) has gradually become a global environmental pollution problem and may harm human and animal health. In recent years, a large number of studies had shown that MPs had various toxicological effects on different organisms. At the same time, a number of studies had also shown that gut microbiota was closely related to host health and as a toxicity target for certain environmental pollutants including MPs. The fact is that more and more studies proved that MPs not only could interact with microorganism directly but also serve as a carrier for other pollutants and interacted with microorganism indirectly. In this review, we summarized the interactions between MPs and microorganisms as well as gut microbiota, and considered the possible impacts of MPs on environmental animal and human health, suggesting that the environmental microorganisms and the gut microbiota of animals were also the very important target for MPs. We hope that more studies pay more attention to focus on the relationship between MPs, gut microbiota, and environmental animals and human health in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim A background of migration is an established risk factor for psychosis. At the same time, over the last 25 years, many countries have developed specialized services for the assessment and care of people with early psychosis. Evaluation of these services often focuses on the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP). Methods We conducted a systematic review with an electronic search of key words in 3 databases to determine the extent to which studies measuring DUP consider transcultural variables, including migration status, national origin, ethnicity and language. Results We identified 18 studies that included transcultural variables and measured DUP. They differed in their design, aims and methodology, and could not be directly compared. Common themes nonetheless appeared. Conclusions Most of the studies exploring DUP took little account of transcultural variables. Definitions of transcultural indicators were heterogeneous and often vague. Lack of language proficiency was often an exclusion criterion, and none of the studies used interpreters. We propose some basic transcultural variable and recommendations to include in future studies and recommendations to improve their internal and external validity.

AB  - Visualizing the highly compartmentalized distribution of metals in the brain has grown from a handful of analytical method development laboratories to now being an integral part of contemporary neuroscience and medical research. The burgeoning interest in mapping metals in the brain has been spurred on by an increasing appreciation of the role minor and trace elements play in normal neural function, ageing, neuroinflammation, and as a potential causative factor in a range of neurological disorders. Advances in technology, development of versatile imaging protocols, and an array of data analysis resources have all contributed to the current status of quantitative metal imaging as an invaluable, and often envied tool in the modern neuroscience laboratory. Atomic mass spectrometry and emission spectroscopy methods cover a broad range of applications that span macro, micro, and nanoscale imaging. Most importantly, increasing awareness of the capabilities of metal imaging has gradually captured the attention of neuroscientists, resulting in a shift in focus from traditional method development and optimization to use as a routine analytical technique in broader studies of brain function and disease. We reflect on the history and growth of metal imaging within the neurosciences, discuss how it has contributed to recent advances in our understanding of the brain and neurological disorders, appraise the challenges and limitations that remain unaddressed, and speculate on the future roles metal imaging will have in neuroscience research over the next decade.

We present a summary of the existing literature on this topic, consisting of 21 cases, and then report a case performed at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Notably, with appropriate safety precautions and careful patient selection, there were no adverse events reported in the literature that were related to the presence of the deep brain stimulation device in any of the cases. Based on our review of the literature and the case we present, we have found no evidence so far to indicate that electroconvulsive therapy in patients with an implanted deep brain stimulator is unsafe.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is commonly associated with comorbidities, especially substance use disorders. In light of this, the present review aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical correlates of cannabis use in BD. Studies evaluating the prevalence of cannabis use among patients with BD and studies reporting a dichotomous sample of patients with cannabis use compared to those without the use were included. Meta-analyses using random-effects models were performed, and sources of heterogeneity were explored using meta-regression. The search resulted in 2918 publications, of which 53 were included. The prevalence of cannabis use was 24% (95%CI:18-29; k = 35; n = 51,756). Cannabis use was significantly associated with being younger, male, and single; having fewer years of education and an earlier onset of affective symptoms; and lifetime psychotic symptoms, suicide attempts, and use of tobacco, alcohol, and other substances. In conclusion, cannabis use present in almost one-quarter of patients with BD and is associated with factors that are highly relevant for both clinical practice and public health.

AB  - Objective Parents and siblings of children with chronic illnesses are at increased risk for experiencing psychosocial difficulties. Therapeutic recreation camps have become increasingly popular among these families. The current systematic literature review provides a synthesis of research on how these camps impact the parents and siblings of children facing a variety of chronic health conditions. Methods Databases searched: PubMed, PsycInfo, SportDISCUS, and Health Source Nursing/Academic Edition. Inclusion criteria included publication in a peer-reviewed journal between January 2000 and May 2018, written in the English language, and assessment of parent, sibling, or family outcomes. Results Twenty-one studies were included. Results indicated that camp attendance relates to positive changes in parent and sibling psychosocial outcomes. Additionally, parents report camp to be a place of social support and respite from daily life, and siblings find camp to be enjoyable and a place of belonging. Given the limited number of methodologically sound studies examining family functioning, it is not yet clear the extent to which camp influences family-level outcomes. Conclusion Overall, camp appears to have a positive impact on parents and siblings across chronic illness populations. Future research should specifically assess family outcomes, including communication and family functioning, and the impact of incorporating well-defined interventions and education programming into the traditional therapeutic recreation camp experience.

AB  - Background Nursing is characterized by a working articulation in shifts to ensure continuity of care throughout the 24 h. However, shift work and the resulting desynchronization of circadian rhythms may have adverse effects on nurses' health.
   Aims To describe the effects of shift work and desynchronization of circadian rhythms on nurse's health.
   Methods Databases: PubMed, Cinahl, Scopus, Embase and Ilisi. Search terms (free terms, MeSH): 'nurses', 'shiftwork', 'nightwork', 'sleep disorder, circadian rhythm', 'work schedule tolerance', 'breast neoplasm', 'metabolic syndrome X', 'metabolic cardiovascular syndrome', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'stress', 'diabetes'. We included all randomized controlled trials, observational studies, reviews and papers studying nurses' shift work. Quality assessment of the retrieved papers was verified according to Dixon-Woods checklist.
   Results Twenty-four articles were analyzed. Literature review has shown that shift work involves an alteration in psychophysical homeostasis, with a decrease in performance. It is an obstacle for social and family relationships, as well as a risk factor for stress, sleep disorders, metabolic disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders and breast cancer.
   Conclusions An organized ergonomic turnaround can be less detrimental to the health of nurses and more beneficial for the healthcare providers. Therefore, we suggest organizing studies to assess whether improving nurses' health would lead to a reduction in miscarriages, absenteeism and work-related stress.

The review aims: (a) to summarize all self-report measures of pain self-efficacy that have been used with children and adolescents; (b) to rate the quality of these measures; (c) to summarize associations between pain self-efficacy and other constructs. Methods To identify studies for inclusion, we searched Medline, PsycINFO, and relevant literature. We identified self-report measures of pain self-efficacy in studies with children and adolescents and extracted information on content, use and psychometric properties of these measures. All identified measures were rated according to the criteria for evidence-based assessment of the Society of Pediatric Psychology. For studies that used measures that were rated "well-established" or "approaching well-established," data were extracted on associations of pain self-efficacy with other constructs. Results Thirty-nine articles were included that described 12 different pain self-efficacy measures. Two of these measures were rated "well-established," one assessing self-efficacy for functioning despite pain and one assessing self-efficacy for impacting abdominal pain. Two measures were rated "approaching well-established." Higher pain self-efficacy was associated with less pain intensity, less pain-related disability, less catastrophizing, and less depressive and somatic symptoms and with more pain acceptance and more positive self-instructions. Boys reported higher self-efficacy scores than girls. Conclusions Currently, there is no standard assessment of pain self-efficacy in children and adolescents. Two "well-established" measures are available, each with a slightly different focus. Overall, results are in line with the understanding of pain self-efficacy as a resilience factor for coping with pain.

AB  - Background
   In-patients in crisis report poor experiences of mental healthcare not conducive to recovery. Concerns include coercion by staff, fear of assault from other patients, lack of therapeutic opportunities and limited support. There is little high-quality evidence on what is important to patients to inform recovery-focused care.
   Aims
   To conduct a systematic review of published literature, identifying key themes for improving experiences of in-patient mental healthcare.
   Method
   A systematic search of online databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL) for primary research published between January 2000 and January 2016. All study designs from all countries were eligible. A qualitative analysis was undertaken and study quality was appraised. A patient and public reference group contributed to the review.
   Results
   Studies (72) from 16 countries found four dimensions were consistently related to significantly influencing in-patients' experiences of crisis and recovery-focused care: the importance of high-quality relationships; averting negative experiences of coercion; a healthy, safe and enabling physical and social environment; and authentic experiences of patient-centred care. Critical elements for patients were trust, respect, safe wards, information and explanation about clinical decisions, therapeutic activities, and family inclusion in care.
   Conclusions
   A number of experiences hinder recovery-focused care and must be addressed with the involvement of staff to provide high-quality in-patient services. Future evaluations of service quality and development of practice guidance should embed these four dimensions.

AB  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) methodology in creativity research has been remarkably fruitful, establishing the potential of EEG to illuminate complex and transient creativity-related neural processes. Here we synthesize recent advances in the field, highlighting empirical work on creativity as divergent thinking, remote associations, musical creativity, and visual imagery. There is a general consensus that alpha-band activity plays a key role in the creative process, though other frequency bands, such as theta and gamma also serve critical functions. We further discuss evidence for electrical stimulation (tDCS and tACS) as a tool for improvements in creative thinking. EEG's high temporal resolution is supremely suitable for studying creative cognition, and studies continuing to yield new and exciting evidence regarding the local and global neural processes underlying creativity.

KW  - LEVEL
AB  - Background: Social exclusion (SE), or the inability to participate fully in society, is considered one of the driving forces of health inequalities. Systematic evidence on this subject is pertinent but scarce. This review aims to systematically summarise peer reviewed studies examining the association between the multidimensional concepts of SE and social inclusion (SI) and health among adults in EU and OECD countries. Methods: The protocol was registered on Prospero (CRD42017052718). Three major medical databases were searched to identify studies published before January 2018, supplemented by reference and citation tracking. Articles were included if they investigated SE or SI as a multidimensional concept with at least two out of the four dimensions of SE/SI, i.e. economic, social, political and cultural. A qualitative synthesis was conducted. Results: Twenty-two observational studies were included. In the general population, high SE/low SI was associated with adverse mental and general health. For physical health, the evidence was inconclusive. In groups at high risk of SE, support was found for the association between high SE/low SI and adverse mental health but no conclusions could be drawn for physical and general health. Conclusions: This review found evidence for the association between high SE/low SI and adverse health outcomes, particularly mental health outcomes. The evidence is mainly based on cross-sectional studies using simple and often ad hoc indicators of SE/SI. The development and use of validated measures of SE/SI and more longitudinal research is needed to further substantiate the evidence base and gain better understanding of the causal pathways.

AB  - With the remarkable development in the field of nanotechnology, carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) have been widely used for numerous applications in different areas of the plant system. The current understanding about the CNMs' accumulation, translocation, plant growth responses, and stress modulations in the plant system is far from complete. There have been relentless efforts by the researchers worldwide in order to acquire newer insights into the plant-CNMs interactions and the consequences. The present review intends to update the reader with the status of the impacts of the different CNMs on plant growth. Research reports from the plant biotechnologists have documented mixed effects (which are dependent on CNMs' concentration) of the CNMs' exposure on plants ranging from enhanced crop yield to acute cytotoxicity. The growth and yield pattern vary from species to species and are dependent on the dosage of the CNMs applied. Studies found an increase in vegetative growth and yield of fruit/seed at lower concentration of CNMs, but a decrease in these observables were also noted when higher concentrations of CNMs were used. In general, at lower concentrations, CNMs were found to be effective in enhancing (water uptake, water transport, seed germination, nitrogenase, photosystemand antioxidant activities), activating (water channels proteins) and promoting (nutrition absorption); all these change when concentrations are raised. All these aspects have been reviewed thoroughly in this article, with a focus on the recent updates on the role of the CNMs in augmenting or retarding plant growth. Sections have been devoted to the various features of the CNMs and their roles in inducing plant growth, phytotoxic responses of the plants and overall crop improvement. Concluding remarks have been added to propose future directions of research on the CNMs-plant interactions and also to sound a warning on the use of CNMs in agriculture. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a devastating developmental disability that has profound effects on cognition, behavior, and seizure susceptibility. There are currently no treatments that target the underlying cause of the disorder, and recent clinical trials have been unsuccessful. In 2007, seminal work demonstrated that amyloid-beta protein precursor (APP) is dysregulated in Fmr1(KO) mice through a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR(5))-dependent pathway. These findings raise the hypotheses that: (1) APP and/or APP metabolites are potential therapeutic targets as well as biomarkers for FXS and (2) mGluR(5) inhibitors may be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, advances in the field over the past decade that have reproduced and greatly expanded upon these original findings are reviewed, and required experimentation to validate APP metabolites as potential disease biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets for FXS are discussed.

AB  - Accumulation of misfolded proteins is a central paradigm in neurodegeneration. Because of the key role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in regulating protein homeostasis, in the last decade multiple reports implicated this organelle in the progression of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative illnesses. In PD, dopaminergic neuron loss or more broadly neurodegeneration has been improved by overexpression of genes involved in the ER stress response. In addition, toxic alpha-synuclein (alpha S), the main constituent of proteinaceous aggregates found in tissue samples of PD patients, has been shown to cause ER stress by altering intracellular protein traffic, synaptic vesicles transport, and Ca2+ homeostasis. In this review, we will be summarizing evidence correlating impaired ER functionality to PD pathogenesis, focusing our attention on how toxic, aggregated alpha S can promote ER stress and cell death.

AB  - Background: Latent class analysis (LCA) can be used to identify subgroups of children with similar patterns of mental health symptoms and/or strengths. The method is becoming more commonly used in child mental health research, but there are reservations about the replicability, reliability, and validity of findings.
   Objective: A systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the extent to which LCA has been used to study population mental health in children, and whether replicable, reliable and valid findings have been demonstrated.
   Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. A search of literature, published between January 1998 and December 2017, was carried out using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psyclnfo, Scopus, ERIC, ASSIA, and Google Scholar. A total of 2,748 studies were initially identified, of which 23 were eligible for review. The review examined the methods which studies had used to choose the number of mental health classes, the classes that they found, and whether there was evidence for the validity and reliability of the classes.
   Results: Reviewed studies used LCA to investigate both disparate mental health symptoms, and those associated with specific disorders. The corpus of studies using similar indicators was small. Differences in the criteria used to select the final LCA model were found between studies. All studies found meaningful or useful subgroups, but there were differences in the extent to which the validity and reliability of classes were explicitly demonstrated.
   Conclusions : LCA is a useful tool for studying and classifying child mental health at the population level. Recommendations are made to improve the application and reporting of LCA and to increase confidence in findings in the future, including use of a range of indices and criteria when enumerating classes, clear reporting of methods for replicability, and making efforts to establish the validity and reliability of identified classes.

AB  - Autophagy is a vital lysosomal degradation and recycling pathway in the eukaryotic cell, responsible for maintaining an intricate balance between cell survival and cell death, necessary for neuronal survival and function. This dual role played by autophagy raises the question whether this process is a protective or a destructive pathway, the contributor of neuronal cell death or a failed attempt to repair aberrant processes? Deregulated autophagy at different steps of the pathway, whether excessive or downregulated, has been proposed to be associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's-, Huntington's-, and Parkinson's-disease, known for their intracellular accumulation of protein aggregates. Recent observations of impaired autophagy also appeared in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggesting an additional contribution to the pathophysiology of mental illness. Here we review the current understanding of autophagy's role in various neuropsychiatric disorders and, hitherto, the prevailing new potential autophagy-related therapeutic strategies for their treatment.

AB  - Although most humans will experience some type of traumatic event in their lifetime only a small set of individuals will go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Differences in sex, age, trauma type, and comorbidity, along with many other elements, contribute to the heterogenous manifestation of this disorder. Nonetheless, aberrant hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, especially in terms of cortisol and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) alterations, has been postulated as a tenable factor in the etiology and pathophysiology of PTSD. Moreover, emerging data suggests that the harmful effects of traumatic stress to the HPA axis in PTSD can also propagate into future generations, making offspring more prone to psychopathologies. Predator stress models provide an ethical and ethologically relevant way to investigate tentative mechanisms that are thought to underlie this phenomenon. In this review article, we discuss findings from human and laboratory predator stress studies that suggest changes to DNA methylation germane to GRs may underlie the generational effects of trauma transmission. Understanding mechanisms that promote stress-induced psychopathology will represent a major advance in the field and may lead to novel treatments for such devastating, and often treatment-resistant trauma and stress-disorders.

AB  - Effective ocean literacy requires appropriate individual behavior, but achieving this-based on behavior change-is extremely difficult. Social-psychological research shows that even generating knowledge and awareness toward protecting the environment-including the oceans-very rarely produces behavior change. The correlation between knowledge and behavior change is demonstrably surprisingly low. Based upon a systematic interdisciplinary literature review, this article evaluates the factors constituting behavior that are important for ocean literacy. Furthermore, it includes an analysis of options for individual behavior change. The literature review covers research and theories from behavioral sciences such as social, environmental, and emotional psychology, as well as from other social sciences. Specifically, research on pro-environmental behavior is evaluated and applied to the specific case of ocean-related behaviors and ocean literacy. As a result, the model of pro-environmental behavior by Kollmuss and Agyeman has successfully been transferred to increase the effectiveness of ocean literacy because it considers internal (e.g., emotions and values) and external factors (e.g., politico-economic and socio-cultural), which are crucial to achieve behavior change. Further results show that the theoretical analysis of different influence factors of ocean related behavior help to identify options to enhance ocean literacy, partially not yet broadly applied in this field, such as reputation-based incentives, social marketing, and successfully diffusing social change, which is illustrated within two examples of success stories. Nevertheless, improvements remain challenging due to barriers identified on the individual level (e.g., cognitive dissonance and moral disengagement) and adverse political and economic power relations in light of rapidly increasing environmental problems in our oceans.

AB  - Pollutant emissions in river basins may be subject to change. How can we succeed in predicting future pollutant emissions and risks? The approach presented here is based on the hypothesis that the existing scenarios on developments in society may provide useful indications on future pollutants. To begin with, the results of four societal scenario-based analyses showed that some developments are directly connected to consumption and the emission of specific substances. Second, it appeared that the effects of other development scenarios are more complex, such as those associated with climate change. Quantitative statements with regard to the implications of such scenarios on future pollutants can be particularly difficult. A third important group of changes are technological developments. Frequently observed changes in this respect are substitutions of problematic substances by substances with a similar structure. When the pollutant consequences of future development scenarios are taken together it will be possible to explore political, societal, or technical mitigation efforts which can be undertaken now or in the near future to counteract the effects of developments that are considered as extremely hazardous for man and the environment. Thereby, a careful monitoring of developments in society can help to develop appropriate strategies which should include preemptive emission and impact reduction efforts. Finally, we developed recommendations how to manage future emerging pollutants in river basins.

AB  - The majority of research on sexual minority individuals relies on nonprobability community venue samples. These samples are prone to selection bias; however, empirical syntheses of evidence of these biases are not available. We conducted, therefore, a systematic review of published sexual minority health research to summarize methods used to identify characteristics and health outcomes found to differ in nonprobability samples. We searched five health and social science databases to identify observational studies that included a nonprobability sexual minority community sample and applied an empirical method to infer selection bias. We extracted data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, behaviors, and health outcomes and examined whether the nonprobability sample was found to differ disproportionately (over- or underrepresenting the characteristic) based on appropriate statistical tests (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). A total of 21 studies were included. Nineteen studies used a cross-sample comparison, one used time/location sampling weights, and one used frequency of venue attendance adjustment to assess differences. The evidence was mostly consistent, that is, associations were in the same direction in >50% of studies examined, for nine variables. Nonprobability community venue samples tended to overrepresent sexual minority individuals with the following characteristics: higher income, current employment, lesbian/gay-identified, greater number of sex partners, past-year sexually transmitted infection diagnosis, suicidal ideation, alcohol use, and substance use; nonprobability community venue samples tended to underrepresent married/partnered sexual minority individuals. This review provides a nuanced empirical picture of aggregate differences in sample characteristics presumed to threaten the validity of nonprobability sexual minority community venue studies, and highlights feasible methods that can be applied to future studies to add specificity to researchers' description of selection biases.

AB  - Overwhelming evidence suggests that negative urgency is robustly associated with rash, ill-advised behavior, and this trait may hamper attempts to treat patients with substance use disorder. Research applying negative urgency to clinical treatment settings has been limited, in part, due to the absence of an objective, behavioral, and translational model of negative urgency. We suggest that development of such a model will allow for determination of prime neurological and physiological treatment targets, the testing of treatment effectiveness in the preclinical and the clinical laboratory, and, ultimately, improvement in negative-urgency-related treatment response and effectiveness. In the current paper, we review the literature on measurement of negative urgency and discuss limitations of current attempts to assess this trait in human models. Then, we review the limited research on animal models of negative urgency and make suggestions for some promising models that could lead to a translational measurement model. Finally, we discuss the importance of applying objective, behavioral, and translational models of negative urgency, especially those that are easily administered in both animals and humans, to treatment development and testing and make suggestions on necessary future work in this field. Given that negative urgency is a transdiagnostic risk factor that impedes treatment success, the impact of this work could be large in reducing client suffering and societal costs.

AB  - Crosstalk in the pathophysiological processes underpinning metabolic diseases and neurodegenerative disorders have been the subject of extensive investigation, in which insulin signaling and autophagy impairment demonstrate to be a common factor in both conditions. Although it is still somewhat conflicting, pharmacological and genetic strategies that regulate these pathways may be a promising approach for aggregate protein clearancing and consequently the delaying of onset or progression of the disease. However, as the response due to this modulation seems to be time-dependent, finding the right regulation of autophagy may be a potential target for drug development for neurodegenerative diseases. In this way, this review focuses on the role of insulin signaling/resistance and autophagy in some neurodegenerative diseases, discussing pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in these diseases.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy among indigenous women approaches 50% and is associated with sudden infant death, pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and anatomical deformity. This study aims to synthesise qualitative studies by reporting experiences, perceptions, and values of smoking cessation among pregnant indigenous women to inform potential interventions.
   Method: A highly-sensitive search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, and CINAHL, in conjunction with analysis of Google Scholar and reference lists of related studies was conducted in March 2018. We utilised two methods (thematic synthesis and an indigenous Mori analytical framework) in parallel to analyse data. Completeness of reporting in studies was evaluated using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ) framework.
   Results: We included seven studies from Australia and New Zealand involving 250 indigenous women. Three themes were identified. Realising well-being and creating agency included giving the best start to baby, pride in being a healthy mum, female role models, and family support. Understanding the drivers for smoking included the impact of stress and chaos that hindered prioritisation of self-care, the social acceptability of smoking, guilt and feeling judged, and inadequate information about the risks of smoking. Indigenous women strongly preferred culturally responsive approaches to smoking cessation, placing value on programs designed specifically for and by indigenous people, that were accessible, and provided an alternative to smoking.
   Conclusion: Future interventions and smoking cessation programmes might be more effective and acceptable to indigenous women and families when they harness self-agency and the desire for a healthy baby, recognise the high value of indigenous peer involvement, and embed a social focus in place of smoking as a way to maintain community support and relationships. Development and evaluation of smoking cessation programs for pregnant indigenous women and families is warranted.

AB  - Background: The Clinical High Risk state for Psychosis (CHR-P) has become the cornerstone of modern preventive psychiatry. The next stage of clinical advancements rests on the ability to formulate a more accurate prognostic estimate at the individual subject level. Individual Participant Data Meta-Analyses (IPD-MA) are robust evidence synthesis methods that can also offer powerful approaches to the development and validation of personalized prognostic models. The aim of the study was to develop and validate an individualized, clinically based prognostic model for forecasting transition to psychosis from a CHR-P stage.
   Methods: A literature search was performed between January 30, 2016, and February 6, 2016, consulting PubMed, Psychinfo, Picarta, Embase, and ISI Web of Science, using search terms ("ultra high risk" OR "clinical high risk" OR "at risk mental state") AND [(conver* OR transition* OR onset OR emerg* OR develop*) AND psychosis] for both longitudinal and intervention CHR-P studies. Clinical knowledge was used to a priori select predictors: age, gender, CHR-P subgroup, the severity of attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, the severity of attenuated negative psychotic symptoms, and level of functioning at baseline. The model, thus, developed was validated with an extended form of internal validation.
   Results: Fifteen of the 43 studies identified agreed to share IPD, for a total sample size of 1,676. There was a high level of heterogeneity between the CHR-P studies with regard to inclusion criteria, type of assessment instruments, transition criteria, preventive treatment offered. The internally validated prognostic performance of the model was higher than chance but only moderate [Harrell's C-statistic 0.655, 95% confidence interval (CIs), 0.627-0.682].
   Conclusion: This is the first IPD-MA conducted in the largest samples of CHR-P ever collected to date. An individualized prognostic model based on clinical predictors available in clinical routine was developed and internally validated, reaching only moderate prognostic performance. Although personalized risk prediction is of great value in the clinical practice, future developments are essential, including the refinement of the prognostic model and its external validation. However, because of the current high diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic heterogeneity of CHR-P studies, IPD-MAs in this population may have an limited intrinsic power to deliver robust prognostic models.

AB  - Personality disorders (PD) are common and burdensome mental disorders. The treatment of individuals with PD represents one of the more challenging areas in the field of mental health and health care providers need evidence-based recommendations to best support patients with PDs. Clinical guidelines serve this purpose and are formulated by expert consensus and/or systematic reviews of the current evidence. In this review, European guidelines for the treatment of PDs are summarized and evaluated. To date, eight countries in Europe have developed and published guidelines that differ in quality with regard to recency and completeness, transparency of methods, combination of expert knowledge with empirical data, and patient/service user involvement. Five of the guidelines are about Borderline personality disorder (BPD), one is about antisocial personality disorder and three concern PD in general. After evaluating the methodological quality of the nine European guidelines from eight countries, results in the domains of diagnosis, psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment of PD are discussed. Our comparison of guidelines reveals important contradictions between recommendations in relation to diagnosis, length and setting of treatment, as well as the use of pharmacological treatment. All the guidelines recommend psychotherapy as the treatment of first choice. Future guidelines should rigorously follow internationally accepted methodology and should more systematically include the views of patients and users.

AB  - A systematic review was conducted to investigate event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to food and non-food stimuli among individuals with eating and weight disorders. Limiting the search to studies that have analysed ERPs relating to motivated attention and inhibitory control, 19 research papers were extracted from a systematic search in PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science (2000-2018). An enhanced attentional bias towards food over non-food images (as indexed by P3(00) and LPP amplitudes) was evident for all populations. Individuals with binge eating disorder showed an enhanced attentional response to food cues compared to healthy controls. Inhibitory control-related ERP components (N2(00) and P3a) increased during food-specific no-go trials, but did not differentiate overweight from healthy' weight groups. The N2 amplitude to food pictures were positively correlated with caloric intake and food craving among individuals with obesity and binge eating disorder, respectively, while P3(00) was sensitive to hunger levels among overweight and obese females. The heterogeneity of stimuli/paradigms adopted, component timescales extracted, ERPs analysed, and data presented has challenged this review's ability to produce a robust synthesis of results. Some recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Social media has taken an important place in the routine life of people. Every single second, users from all over the world are sharing interests, emotions, and other useful information that leads to the generation of huge volumes of user-generated data. Profiling users by extracting attribute information from social media data has been gaining importance with the increasing user-generated content over social media platforms. Meeting the user's satisfaction level for information collection is becoming more challenging and difficult. This is because of too much noise generated, which affects the process of information collection due to explosively increasing online data. Social profiling is an emerging approach to overcome the challenges faced in meeting user's demands by introducing the concept of personalized search while keeping in consideration user profiles generated using social network data. This study reviews and classifies research inferring users social profile attributes from social media data as individual and group profiling. The existing techniques along with utilized data sources, the limitations, and challenges are highlighted. The prominent approaches adopted include Machine Learning, Ontology, and Fuzzy logic. Social media data from Twitter and Facebook have been used by most of the studies to infer the social attributes of users. The studies show that user social attributes, including age, gender, home location, wellness, emotion, opinion, relation, influence, and so on, still need to be explored. This review gives researchers insights of the current state of literature and challenges for inferring user profile attributes using social media data.

AB  - Despite decades of research, current therapeutic interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) are insufficient as they fail to modify disease progression by ameliorating the underlying pathology. Cellular proteostasis (protein homeostasis) is an essential factor in maintaining a persistent environment for neuronal activity. Proteostasis is ensured by mechanisms including regulation of protein translation, chaperone-assisted protein folding and protein degradation pathways. It is generally accepted that deficits in proteostasis are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases including PD. While the proteasome fails to degrade large protein aggregates, particularly alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN) in PD, drug-induced activation of autophagy can efficiently remove aggregates and prevent degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Therefore, maintenance of these mechanisms is essential to preserve all cellular functions relying on a correctly folded proteome. The correlations between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) that aims to restore proteostasis within the secretory pathway are well-established. However, while mild insults increase the activity of chaperones, prolonged cell stress, or insufficient adaptive response causes cell death. Modulating the activity of molecular chaperones, such as protein disulfide isomerase which assists refolding and contributes to the removal of unfolded proteins, and their associated pathways may offer a new approach for disease-modifying treatment. Here, we summarize some of the key concepts and emerging ideas on the relation of protein aggregation and imbalanced proteostasis with an emphasis on PD as our area of main expertise. Furthermore, we discuss recent insights into the strategies for reducing the toxic effects of protein unfolding in PD by targeting the ER UPR pathway.

AB  - The mesocorticolimbic pathway is canonically known as the "reward pathway.'' Embedded within the center of this circuit is the striatum, a massive and complex network hub that synthesizes motivation, affect, learning, cognition, stress, and sensorimotor information. Although striatal subregions collectively share many anatomical and functional similarities, it has become increasingly clear that it is an extraordinarily heterogeneous region. In particular, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) medial shell has repeatedly demonstrated that the rules dictated by more dorsal aspects of the striatum do not apply or are even reversed in functional logic. These discrepancies are perhaps most easily captured when isolating the functions of various neuromodulatory peptide systems within the striatum. Endogenous peptides are thought to play a critical role in modulating striatal signals to either amplify or dampen evoked behaviors. Here we describe the anatomical-functional backdrop upon which several neuropeptides act within the NAc to modulate behavior, with a specific emphasis on nucleus accumbens medial shell and stress responsivity. Additionally, we propose that, as the field continues to dissect fast neurotransmitter systems within the NAc, we must also provide considerable contextual weight to the roles local peptides play in modulating these circuits to more comprehensively understand how this important subregion gates motivated behaviors.

AB  - BackgroundThe current study aims to systematically assess and compare the antidepressant outcomes of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with the figure-of-eight (F8)-coil and deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) with the H1-coil in studies matched on stimulation frequency in unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD).MethodsElectronic search of Medline and PsycInfo identified 19 studies with stimulation frequency of 18-20Hz using F8-coil (k=8 randomised sham-controlled trials, RCTs, k=3 open-label; n=168 patients) or H1-coil (k=1 RCT, k=7 open-label; n=200). Depression severity (the primary outcome) and response/remission rates (the secondary outcomes) were assessed at session 10.ResultsEffects pooled with random-effects meta-analysis showed a large reduction in depression severity, 29% response, and 15% remission rates after 10 sessions of active stimulation with either coil relative to baseline. Reduction in depression severity was greater in studies with younger patients using either coil. The comparison between coils showed a larger reduction in depression severity in H1-coil vs. F8-coil studies (independent of the study design or the concurrent pharmacotherapy) and a trend towards higher remission rates in F8-coil vs. H1-coils studies. These effects are based on a low volume of studies, are not controlled for placebo, and may not be clinically-relevant. The stimulation protocols differed systematically because stimulation was more focal but less intense (80-110% of the resting motor threshold, MT) in the F8-coil studies and less focal but more intense (120% MT) in the H1-coil studies. Two seizures occurred in the H1-coil studies relative to none in the F8-coil studies.ConclusionWhen matched on frequency, the higher-intensity and less focal stimulation with the H1-coil reduces depression more than the lower-intensity and more focal stimulation with the F8-coil. Head-to-head trials should compare the antidepressant outcomes of F8-coil and H1-coil to identify the most optimal stimulation protocols for acute and longer-lasting efficacy.

AB  - Purpose Team formulation, used to understand patient problems and plan care, is a growing practice in adult mental health and learning disability services. The purpose of this paper is to explore definitions applied to team formulation (as distinct to therapy formulation), its underpinning theories, and the inter-relationship between the team and the process of formulation. Design/methodology/approach A database search (main search term of team formulation) of peer-reviewed studies was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. A main and second reviewer conducted quality appraisals and thematic analysis. Data were analysed by convergent qualitative synthesis design using thematic analysis to transform evidence from quantitative and qualitative studies into qualitative findings. Findings Initial searching produced 4,532 papers, 10 of which were eligible for inclusion. Team formulation has no distinct definition. Theories underpinning the practice of therapy formulation emanating from general psychological theory underpin team formulation. Seven studies applied psychological theories to the examination of team formulation. No studies examined the impact of the team on the formulation. Six themes were generated regarding the impact of team formulation on the team; "increased knowledge and understanding", "altered perceptions, leading to altered relationships, feelings and behaviours", "space to reflect", "useful when stuck or challenged", "perceived increase in effectiveness" and "improved team working". Originality/value This is the first review to examine team formulation through the context of the team. The authors argue that a conceptual framework to encompass team inputs, processes and outputs in team formulation practice should guide future research.

AB  - Regular physical activity has been demonstrated to contribute to physical and psychological health. Nevertheless, pregnant women generally exhibit low levels of physical activity. Implementation of interventions that enhance the self-efficacy of pregnant women on increasing physical activity is required. This paper provides an in-depth review of studies reporting the effect of various physical activity interventions dedicated for pregnant women on pregnancy-related issues, including gestational weight gain, pain and depression, physical activity level, and quality of life among these individuals. Five databases were used in searching the literature. Findings of the included studies were presented narratively, and appraisal of their methodological quality was conducted using the quality assessment tool developed by Effective Public Health Practice Project. Review findings demonstrated that physical activity interventions are effective in enhancing physical activity levels of pregnant women. Further, they are potentially useful in alleviating pregnancy-related pain and psychological symptoms, reducing gestational weight gain, and increasing self-efficacy in enhancing physical activity levels among these individuals. Nevertheless, inconsistencies in findings between studies hamper the drawing of firm conclusions on these latter outcomes. Overall, studies demonstrated a positive effect of physical activity interventions on the well-being and physical and psychological health of pregnant women.

AB  - Groundwater depth is an important environmental factor affecting vegetation growth and landscape dynamics in arid environments. This study applied a science mapping approach to visualize the development of groundwater-vegetation-related research, synthesized the vegetation response to changes in groundwater depth, and analyzed the change rate of the response curve to identify the groundwater threshold that is essential to conserve the groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems. These ecosystems emerged as a research hotspot due to climate change, groundwater overexploitation, and the recognition of these ecosystems' importance for sustainable development. There are two main types of response functions of vegetation to changes in groundwater depthmonotone and bell-shaped functionsamong which the monotone function includes linear, curvilinear, and stepwise response. The shape of a response curve is mainly determined by the combined effects of oxygen stress, salinization, and water stress; oxygen stress and salinization dominate in shallow groundwater depth, while water stress dominates in deep groundwater depth. On a non-linear vegetation metricgroundwater depth response curve, the change rate analysis method is effective to identify the breakpoint that can be taken as a candidate threshold of groundwater depth. The results will add insight into the intellectual structure of the groundwater-vegetation interactions and provide practical reference for groundwater resource management, ecological conservation, and sustainable development in arid environments.

AB  - The increase of chronic diseases worldwide impact quality of life, cause economic and medical costs, and make it necessary to look for strategies and solutions that allow people with chronic diseases (PwCDs) to lead an active working life. As part of the CHRODIS Plus Joint European Action project, a systematic review was conducted to identify studies of interventions that support the maintenance of work and return to work (RTW) among workers with chronic illnesses. These interventions should target employees with the following conditions: diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic vascular syndrome, respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders, and neurological disorders. An extensive search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for English language studies. Included in this review were 15 randomized controlled trials (RCT) for adult employees (aged 18+). We found that workplace-oriented and multidisciplinary programs are the most supportive to RTW and reducing the absence due to illness. In addition, cognitive behavioral therapies achieve positive results on RTW and sick leave. Finally, coaching is effective for the self-management of chronic disease and significantly improved perceptions of working capacity and fatigue.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent amongst pregnant women and is linked to a range of adverse complications, including gestational diabetes. However, there is no consensus among researchers regarding the impact of vitamin D supplementation in alleviating adverse effects in gestational diabetes. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether supplementation of vitamin D given to women with gestational diabetes can promote glycaemic control. EMBASE and PubMed were searched up to November, 2018. The selection criteria included randomised controlled trials of the effect of vitamin D supplementation (1000-4762 IU/day) on pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Study data and outcome measures (fasting blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin and serum insulin) were extracted from included studies. Random-effects models were used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity tests, and analysis of the risk of bias were conducted. Most of the studies were graded as having either low risk or moderate risk of bias although two studies had a high risk of bias in the areas of blinding of participants and personnel, and incomplete outcome data. On the other hand, the heterogeneity statistic (I-2) ranged from 0-41% in the studies included. Five randomised controlled trials were selected for this review and meta-analysis (involving a total of 173 participants supplemented with vitamin D and 153 participants as control drawn from the studies). Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a decrease in fasting blood glucose by a mean of 0.46 mmol/L (-0.68, -0.25) (p < 0.001), glycated haemoglobin by a mean of 0.37% (-0.65, -0.08) (p < 0.01) and serum insulin concentration by mean of 4.10 mu IU/mL (-5.50, -2.71) (p < 0.001) compared to controls. This review shows evidence that vitamin D supplementation has the potential to promote glycaemic control in women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). However, due to the limited number of studies in the meta-analysis, the conclusion should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are needed to fully understand the exact mechanism by which vitamin D influences glucose metabolism.

AB  - Despite the extensive research effort that has been made in the field, motor neuron diseases, namely, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophies, still represent an overwhelming cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Exogenous neural stem cell-based transplantation approaches have been investigated as multifaceted strategies to both protect and repair upper and lower motor neurons from degeneration and inflammation. Transplanted neural stem cells (NSCs) exert their beneficial effects not only through the replacement of damaged cells but also via bystander immunomodulatory and neurotrophic actions. Notwithstanding these promising findings, the clinical translatability of such techniques is jeopardized by the limited engraftment success and survival of transplanted cells within the hostile disease microenvironment. To overcome this obstacle, different methods to enhance graft survival, stability, and therapeutic potential have been developed, including environmental stress preconditioning, biopolymers scaffolds, and genetic engineering. In this review, we discuss current engineering techniques aimed at the exploitation of the migratory, proliferative, and secretive capacity of NSCs and their relevance for the therapeutic arsenal against motor neuron disorders and other neurological disorders.

AB  - Background Homelessness is associated with poor health. A policy approach aiming to end homelessness across Europe and North America, the 'Housing First' (HF) model, provides rapid housing, not conditional on abstinence from substance use. We aimed to systematically review the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the effects of HF on health and wellbeing. Methods We searched seven databases for randomised controlled trials of interventions providing rapid access to non-abstinence-contingent, permanent housing. We extracted data on the following outcomes: mental health; self-reported health and quality of life; substance use; non-routine use of healthcare services; housing stability. We assessed risk of bias and calculated standardised effect sizes. Results We included four studies, all with ' high' risk of bias. The impact of HF on most short-term health outcomes was imprecisely estimated, with varying effect directions. No clear difference in substance use was seen. Intervention groups experienced fewer emergency department visits (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.63; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82), fewer hospitalisations (IRR=0.76; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.83) and less time spent hospitalised (standardised mean difference (SMD)=-0.14; 95% CI -0.41 to 0.14) than control groups. In all studies intervention participants spent more days housed (SMD=1.24; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.62) and were more likely to be housed at 18-24 months (risk ratio=2.46; 95% CI 1.58 to 3.84). Conclusion HF approaches successfully improve housing stability and may improve some aspects of health. Implementation of HF would likely reduce homelessness and non-routine health service use without an increase in problematic substance use. Impacts on long-term health outcomes require further investigation.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure results in an array of developmental abnormalities known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Despite the high prevalence of FASDs, therapeutic interventions against accidental or intended exposure of developing fetuses to alcohol are limited. This review outlines current knowledge about mitochondria in cerebral blood vessels as a potential target for anti-FASDs intervention. First, it describes the multifaceted role of mitochondria in maintaining the cerebral artery diameter as shown in adult tissue. Second, current literature on alcohol-driven damage of mitochondrial morphology and function in several fetal tissues, including liver, heart, and brain is summarized. The functional consequences of alcohol exposure in these organs include morphological enlargement of mitochondria, increased oxidative stress, and alteration of cellular respiration. These studies point to a tissue-specific effect of alcohol on mitochondrial function and a particular vulnerability of fetal mitochondria to alcohol exposure when compared to adult counterparts. Third, recent work from our group describing persistent changes in fetal baboon cerebral artery proteome following three episodes of prenatal alcohol exposure is reviewed. In conclusion, the consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure on cerebral artery mitochondria constitute an open field of investigation and, eventually, a point of therapeutic intervention against FASDs.

AB  - Objective: Recent reports have shown a considerable number of couples received infertility treatment, raising new concerns about the association between infertility treatment and perinatal depressive symptoms. However, the conclusions of existing studies were inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether infertility treatment increase the risk of developing perinatal depressive symptoms.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in several databases up to July 2018 for relevant articles. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore possible sources of heterogeneity.
   Results: Twenty-two studies with a total of 69,201 individuals were included in this study. The pooled OR of the association between infertility treatment and perinatal depressive symptoms was 1.01(95% CI: 0.83, 1.23), with substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 63%, P < .001). However, in subgroup analyses, a significantly positive association between infertility treatment and depressive symptoms was observed only in some Asian countries (six studies), and the pooled OR was 1.73 (95% CI:1.07, 2.81). An inverse association was found in 6-12 months after delivery (OR = 0.56, 95% CI:0.33, 0.96). Sensitivity analyses validated evidence of the robustness of the findings.
   Conclusion: The results show that women who receive infertility treatment do not appear to be at increased risk of significant perinatal depressive symptoms compared with those after spontaneous conception.

AB  - Objective: Hypothyroidism is a well-documented consequence of lithium treatment. Less well known is a possible association between lithium therapy and hyperthyroidism. This may have clinical implications as rapid changes in thyroid hormones may worsen a person's affective state, while symptoms of hyperthyroidism can mimic those of mania. We therefore systematically reviewed the published literature for evidence of lithium-induced hyperthyroidism. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and CINAHL for articles where individuals developed biochemically confirmed hyperthyroidism (with or without clinical symptoms), while on lithium therapy for an affective illness. We included case reports, case series, cross-sectional, case control and cohort studies. Results: We included 52 studies, 39 of which were individual case reports and 3 were case series. There were 10 cross-sectional or case control or cohort studies. All the research designs suggested an association between the prescription of lithium and hyperthyroidism. However, these findings were limited by the quality of the included studies, small number of participants and the general lack of either a clear temporal relationship or dose response. Conclusion: Hyperthyroidism is an uncommon side-effect of lithium compared to hypothyroidism but may have clinical implications. However, large prospective studies are required to clarify this association and to further inform the management of patients treated with lithium where hyperthyroidism occurs.

AB  - Although primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is clinically typified by linguistic impairments, emerging evidence highlights the presence of early deficits in social cognition. This review systematically describes the latter patterns, specifying their relation to the characteristic linguistic dysfunctions and atrophy patterns of non-fluent, semantic, and logopenic variants of the disease (nfvPPA, svPPA, and lvPPA, respectively), relative to closely related dementia types. Whereas the evidence on lvPPA proves scant, studies on nfvPPA and svPPA patients show consistent deficits in emotion recognition, theory of mind, and empathy. Notably, these seem to be intertwined with language impairments in nfvPPA, but they prove primary and independent of language disturbances in svPPA. Also, only the profile of svPPA resembles that of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, probably reflecting the overlap of fronto-temporal disruptions in both conditions. In short, the neurocognitive relationship between linguistic and socio-cognitive deficits cannot be precisely predicated for PPA as a whole; instead, specific links must be acknowledged in each variant. These emergent patterns pave the way for fruitful dimensional research in the field.

   Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder are severe mental disorders, both placing a significant burden on individuals' wellbeing and global health generally. The complex interaction of multiple mechanisms, underlying these disorders, still needs further elucidation. Increased activation of components of the immune system may be involved, including alterations in intestinal permeability and gut microbiome. Probiotics, defined as living microorganisms conferring health benefits to the host when administered in adequate amounts, seem to have supportive therapeutic effect in psychiatric disorders. The authors in this review provide an overview of this emerging research field and summarize both the publicated microbiome studies in SCZ and bipolar disorder and the current clinical research using probiotic supplementation in patients diagnosed with these disorders.
   Recent findings
   The current data indicate that there are differences in the microbiome in SCZ and bipolar disorder patients as compared with healthy controls. Part of these differences may be induced by medication use, others by smoking and other lifestyle factors. Correlations between microbiome quantification and symptom severity have been observed in cross-sectional studies, but unfortunately, no replicated findings so far. Probiotic supplementation was shown not only to alleviate gastrointestinal complaints but also reduce symptom severity, rehospitalization rates and cognitive improvement. Replication of improvement of cognition is needed.
   Summary
   Differences in microbiome have been shown in both SCZ and bipolar disorder in comparison to healthy controls. Evidence that probiotics can improve psychiatric functioning is still very limited.

However, a leading group medical doctors defines empathy as 'the act of correctly acknowledging the emotional state of another without experiencing that state oneself'. Beyond the field of medicine, empathy is an approach to understanding that precisely involves emotional resonance. However, mentioned definition of empathy primarily gives emphasis to an intellectual component rather than emotional form. Medical educationist and medical professional bodies increasingly recognise the importance of empathy because there are a lot report published regarding poor empathy level among medical doctors. This article will try to discuss emphasising on educational intervention which improves empathy level and its influence on healthcare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a widespread condition that is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. It is considered one of the leading causes of death in the world. Individuals with CVD and major depressive disorder have greater morbidity and mortality. Subthreshold depression (SubD) is a form of affective disorder that shares similar characteristics with major depressive disorder.
   METHODS: This systemic review of the literature was derived from Medline and PubMed searches. Our search yielded more than 30 articles. We narrowed them down to 11 studies based on the quality of the research done. Our main emphasis was on the assessment of the prevalence of and risk association between SubD and CVD.
   RESULTS: We should consider SubD as a variant of depressive disorder. Health care providers need to be taught to identify such patients in order to treat them appropriately, using both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.
   CONCLUSIONS: SubD can significantly impact quality of life and is a decrement on the health of patients with CVD.

AB  - Background: Injuries are the leading cause of death among younger Canadians and represent a large economic burden on the Canadian population. Although immigrants comprise more than 20% of the Canadian population, the research landscape on injury in this group is unclear. We conducted a scoping review to summarize existing research regarding injuries among Canadian immigrants to identify research gaps and future research opportunities.
   Methods: Relevant electronic databases of peer-reviewed articles and grey literature were systematically searched. Original articles were selected based on predefined criteria. Relevant information from the articles was extracted and reported in the review.
   Results: After a comprehensive search, screening and full-text evaluation, 28 articles were selected for the synthesis. Of the injuries that have been studied among Canadian immigrants, the majority focused on occupational injuries, followed by road traffic accidents. Of the 28 studies, 16 were quantitative and 12 were qualitative. The research themes among occupational injury papers centred on factors leading to injury, factors leading to delayed reporting and compensation of injury and post-occupational injury experiences. Language barriers, informal training and the mismatch between education and occupation among immigrants were found to be the most frequent determinants of injury risk.
   Conclusions: The synthesized knowledge in this scoping review offers an understanding of the current research landscape on injury among immigrants that can be used to assist policymakers, service providers, employers and researchers regarding injuries in this population.

AB  - Global ecosystems and their constituent flora and fauna are experiencing a decline of biodiversity due to destruction of habitats, climate change, pollution, and invasive species. Of late, the number of species that have become critically endangered has increased extremely, and these species need to be protected from extinction in the wild. The conservation efforts should involve both in situ, and ex situ conservation and management of populations. Conservation physiology, an emerging multidisciplinary field, helps conservationists understand the physiological responses of endangered species due to the changes in the environment and thereby look for possible options of intervention to save them from extinction. This review summarizes various non-invasive hormone methods and endocrine studies involved in the conservation of endangered animals. The non-invasive hormone method has been successfully used in understanding basic reproductive biology, pregnancy diagnostics and welfare of a wide range of animals in captivity and in free-ranging habitats. This technique would directly or indirectly help in the conservation of endangered animals. This review also sheds light on non-invasive hormone monitoring in effective management and conservation of the endangered species.

AB  - The term proteostasis reflects the fine-tuned balance of cellular protein levels, mediated through a vast network of biochemical pathways. This requires the regulated control of protein folding, post-translational modification, and protein degradation. Due to the complex interactions and intersection of proteostasis pathways, exposure to stress conditions may lead to a disruption of the entire network. Incorrect protein folding and/or modifications during protein synthesis results in inactive or toxic proteins, which may overload degradation mechanisms. Further, a disruption of autophagy and the endoplasmic reticulum degradation pathway may result in additional cellular stress which could ultimately lead to cell death. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis all share common risk factors such as oxidative stress, aging, environmental stress, and protein dysfunction; all of which alter cellular proteostasis. The differing pathologies observed in neurodegenerative diseases are determined by factors such as location-specific neuronal death, source of protein dysfunction, and the cell's ability to counter proteotoxicity. In this review, we discuss how the disruption in cellular proteostasis contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background: Bereavement is associated with impaired mental health, increases in adverse health behaviors, and heightened risk of suicidal ideation, attempts, and death by suicide. The purpose of this literature review was to explore associations between cause of death and suicidal thoughts among bereaved individuals. Our aim was to compare incidence of suicidal ideation by cause of death and identify gaps in this literature to guide future research and clinical intervention. Methods: PRISMA-P guidelines were used to structure an electronic literature search in the PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases. The search focused on English language studies that were published before February 2019 and sought to compare rates of suicidal ideation among bereaved people who lost a loved one to suicide, accidental overdose, cancer, dementia, cardiovascular disease, and HIV/AIDs. Results: Nine articles were identified with suicide as cause of death, zero articles for accidental overdose, zero articles for cardiovascular disease, seven articles for cancer, one article for dementia, and one article for HIV/AIDs. Given the limited number of articles generated by our search, a formal meta-analysis was not appropriate. However, a comparison of results did suggest that suicide bereavement was associated with the highest rates of suicide ideation (14.1% to 49%). Stigma, isolation, avoidance behaviors, and psychological distress were associated with suicidal thoughts among bereaved individuals, regardless of the deceased's cause of death. Conclusions: Findings of this literature search revealed significant gaps in the literature, especially regarding thoughts of suicide in bereaved survivors of accidental overdose and cardiovascular disease. Results suggest that multiple causes of death are associated with suicidal ideation in bereavement, but that suicide bereavement may be the cause of death associated with the highest risk of suicidal ideation. More research is needed to understand the ways in which cause of death influences prevalence, risk, and protective factors associated with suicidal thoughts among bereaved individuals.

AB  - Objectives Due to their small size, ultrafine particles (UFP) are believed to exert higher toxicity than larger particles. As numerous studies on health effects of UFP have been published since the last systematic review in 2013, we aim to systematically review the new literature.
   Methods We searched MEDLINE and the specialized LUDOK database for studies published between 01.01.2011 and 11.05.2017 investigating health effects of ambient air pollution-related UFP. We included epidemiologic studies containing UFP measures and quantifiable measures of associations. Relevant data were extracted on the basis of previously developed evaluation criteria.
   Results We identified 85 original studies, conducting short-term (n = 75) and long-term (n = 10) investigations. Panel (n = 32), scripted exposure with predefined settings (n = 16) or time series studies (n = 11) were most frequent. Thirty-four studies adjusted for at least one other pollutant. Most consistent associations were identified for short-term effects on pulmonary/systemic inflammation, heart rate variability and blood pressure.
   Conclusions The evidence suggests adverse short-term associations with inflammatory and cardiovascular changes, which may be at least partly independent of other pollutants. For the other studied health outcomes, the evidence on independent health effects of UFP remains inconclusive or insufficient.

AB  - Context: Depression is common among breast cancer (BC) patients. Several studies have evaluated the prevalence of depression among BC patients in Iran. Hence, in order to have more in-depth knowledge regarding its prevalence, all available studies were systematically reviewed and their data were analyzed using a meta-analysis.
   Evidence Acquisition: A systematic search was conducted to find all published studies on the prevalence of depression in BC patients in the international databases (Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, and Web of Sciences), and Iranian databases (Scientific Information Database, MagIran, IranMedex, and IranDoc) until February 2016. This systematic review was done according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
   Results: In total, nine eligible papers (out of 240) were entered into the analysis. The overall prevalence of depression in BC patients was 44% (95% CI: 35% - 52%). The results of Cochran's test showed the heterogeneity of the studies (Q = 1678.2, df = 8, I-2 = 89.4%, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: BC patients are at risk of depression; hence, its detection is of utmost importance in clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Asia and Africa are experiencing rapid urbanization and rural growth. This review focuses on the impact of urbanization on preventive and treatment mental health service provision with attention to the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa economic bloc and sub-Saharan Africa.
   Recent findings
   A search of the PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, and Global Health databases, and use of Google Scholar yielded relevant health, environmental, and urban planning research articles from sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil, India, China, and South Africa. Preventive services are ineffective in addressing violence exposure, substance use, poor quality housing, and spatial segregation, with differing trajectories in the various countries. Similarly, the impact of urbanization on social capital and green infrastructure is variable. Although Brazil appears to have a well-developed mental health system, it is unable to meet the care demand. Integrated country-wide and district-based analyses in China indicate planning is underway.
   Summary
   In general, existing mental and general health services in low and middle-income countries are grossly inadequate in terms of prevention, coverage, and quality to withstand population transitions lying ahead. People with mental disability, as a vulnerable and stigmatized subpopulation, are at high risk of neglect as urbanization progresses, particularly in India and sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often associated with alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Previous findings are inconsistent, possibly due to trauma exposure of controls or different hormone measurement methods. We investigated cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEA-S) in adults with clinical PTSD under basal or challenged conditions (Prospero registration no. CRD42016041690). A search of PubMed, Scopus, Medlin, PsycINFO, Pilots/ProQuest, and Web of Science resulted in 108 included studies (N = 6484). Morning and 24 h cortisol were significantly lower in PTSD than in controls (g = - 0.21; 95% CI: -0.42-( - 0.01); g= -0.31; CI: - 0.60-( - 0.03)). Significant cortisol increases occurred after awakening in PTSD (g = 0.40; CI: 0.13-0.67) and in non-exposed controls (g = 0.96; CI: 0.59-1.33). Evening DHEA was significantly higher in PTSD than in non-exposed controls (g = 0.58; CI: 0.17-0.99). All groups showed large cortisol suppression effects after dexamethasone administration. Overall, the potential moderators investigated did not reveal a consistent pattern of HPA alterations.

AB  - Background Approximately 35% of people with depression do not respond to 2 courses of antidepressant medications of adequate dosage, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is still a major clinical concern with a great impact on patients, their families, society and the health system. The present meta-analysis evaluates antidepressant efficacy of unilateral and bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with unipolar TRD. Methods We searched for randomized controlled trials that compared rTMS with sham treatment and were published by Apr. 3, 2017. The primary outcome was improvement in depression scores measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The secondary outcomes were remission and response rates. Two independent review authors screened the studies and extracted the data. Results Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the depression scores showed a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 3.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.85-4.88) between unilateral rTMS and sham treatment. Stratified data showed that the effect was relatively higher when rTMS was used as an add-on to antidepressant medications (WMD 3.64, 95% CI 1.52-5.76) than when it was used as a stand-alone treatment (WMD 2.47, 95% CI 0.90-4.05). The WMD between bilateral rTMS and sham was 2.67 (95% CI 0.83-4.51), and all studies that contributed to this outcome used rTMS while participants were taking antidepressant medications. The pooled remission and response rates for unilateral rTMS versus sham treatment were 16.0% and 25.1% for rTMS and 5.7% and 11.0% for sham treatment, respectively. The pooled remission and response rates for bilateral rTMS versus sham treatment were 16.6% and 25.4% for rTMS and 2.0% and 6.8% for sham treatment, respectively. Conclusion This study suggests that rTMS has moderate antidepressant effects and appears to be promising in the short-term treatment of patients with unipolar TRD.

AB  - Environmental contamination is one of the major factors or cofactors affecting amphibian populations. Since 2000, the number of studies conducted in laboratory conditions to understand impacts of chemical exposures increased. They aimed to characterize biological effects on amphibians. This review proposes an overview of biological responses reported after exposures to metals, phytopharmaceuticals or emerging organic contaminants and focuses on endpoints relating to reproduction and development. Due to amphibian peculiar features, these periods of their life cycle are especially critical to pollutant exposures.
   Despite the large range of tested compounds, the same model species are often used as biological models and morphological alterations are the most studied observations. From the results, the laboratory-to-field extrapolation remained uneasy and exposure designs have to be more elaborated to be closer to environmental conditions. Few studies proposed such experimental approaches. Lastly, gametes, embryos and larvae constitute key stages of amphibian life cycle that can be harmed by exposures to freshwater pollutants. Specific efforts have to be intensified on the earliest stages and notably germ cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The effectiveness of interventions for people with severe mental illness delivered by informal community care providers in low and lower middle-income countries is not known. The aim was to conduct a systematic review of the impact of community-based interventions implemented by the informal sector for people with severe mental illness in these settings. Methods: Five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for English-language publications using both keywords and MeSH terms. All study designs were included. Results: Five papers, reporting data from five studies conducted in four low and lower middle-income countries in 2017, met the inclusion criteria for the review. Of the five included studies, three had a before and after design, one was a randomized controlled trial, and one a qualitative investigation. Most interventions with a low-moderate quality of evidence used informal community care providers to deliver either self-help groups, traditional healing treatments, and/or a rehabilitation program. The investigators reported data about improvements in the outcomes of intervention participants (psychosocial functioning, psychotic symptoms, and social inclusion) and positive impacts on their families (family's knowledge and skills of mental illness management, caregiving burden, social exclusion/stigma against people with severe mental illness, and financial burden). Cost-effectiveness of the intervention (in one study) found that it had a higher financial cost but greater effectiveness than the usual standard of care. Conclusion: Although only a small number of studies were identified, the review provides promising evidence of the professionally developed interventions for people with severe mental illness, delivered by the informal community workforce in low and lower middle-income settings. Training and supportive supervision for informal community care providers are crucial components of effective interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy, defined as being prescribed 5 or more medications, has been shown to be associated with a decline in mental and physical functioning in elderly patients. Despite this, elderly patients are currently being prescribed a median of 7 medications, which often causes more harm than benefit, and emphasizes the importance of deprescribing.
   METHODS: Five classes of potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly population, especially for the aging brain, are discussed, including anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, opioids, and proton pump inhibitors. Recommendations regarding these medications were collected from the 2015 Beer's Criteria, the Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria, the Screening Tool to Alert doctors to the Right Treatment (START) criteria, and the Fit fOR The Aged (FORTA) list. The PubMed database was also searched for the most recent evidence regarding prescription patterns, adverse effects, and recommendations regarding discontinuation of these medications in older adults.
   RESULTS: Anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and opioids were all found to have significant adverse effects in the elderly population. All of the discussed medication classes have been shown to be successfully deprescribable.
   CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy increases the risk of adverse drug reactions and hospitalizations in geriatric patients. Rational deprescribing of anti-cholinergics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, opioids, and proton pump inhibitors in selected patients may be a good first step to reducing this risk.

AB  - Autophagy represents a conserved self-digestion program, which allows regulated degradation of cellular material. Autophagy is activated by cellular stress, serum starvation and nutrient deprivation. Several autophagic pathways have been uncovered, which either non-selectively or selectively target the cellular cargo for lysosomal degradation. Autophagy engages the coordinated action of various key regulators involved in the steps of autophagosome formation, cargo targeting and lysosomal fusion. While non-selective (macro) autophagy is required for removal of bulk material or recycling of nutrients, selective autophagy mediates specific targeting of damaged organelles or protein aggregates. By proper action of the autophagic machinery, cellular homeostasis is maintained. In contrast, failure of this fundamental process is accompanied by severe pathophysiological conditions. Hallmarks of neuropathological disorders are for instance accumulated, mis-folded protein aggregates and damaged mitochondria. The nucleolus has been recognized as central hub in the cellular stress response. It represents a sub-nuclear organelle essential for ribosome biogenesis and also functions as stress sensor by mediating cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Thus, proper nucleolar function is mandatory for cell growth and survival. Here, I highlight the emerging role of nucleolar factors in the regulation of autophagy. Moreover, I discuss the nucleolar stress response as a novel signaling pathway in the context of autophagy, health and disease.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI), caused by a sudden blow or jolt to the brain that disrupts normal function, is an emerging health epidemic with similar to 2.5 million cases occurring annually in the United States that are severe enough to cause hospitalization or death. Most common causes of TBI include contact sports, vehicle crashes and domestic violence or war injuries. Injury to the central nervous system is one of the most consistent candidates for initiating the molecular and cellular cascades that result in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Not every TBI event is alike with effects varying from person to person. The majority of people recover from mild TBI within a short period of time, but repeated incidents can have deleterious long-lasting effects which depend on factors such as the number of TBIs sustained, time till medical attention, age, gender and genetics of the individual. Despite extensive research, many questions still remain regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of long-term effects from TBI as well as recovery of brain function. In this review, we present an overview of TBI pathology, discuss mammalian models for TBI and focus on current methods using Drosophila melanogaster as a model for TBI study. The relatively small brain size (similar to 100,000 neurons and glia), conserved neurotransmitter signaling mechanisms and sophisticated genetics of Drosophila allows for cell biological, molecular and genetic analyses that are impractical in mammalian models of TBI.

AB  - Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-termdisability worldwide. However, effective therapeutic approaches are still limited. The disruption of blood supply triggers complicated temporal and spatial events involving hemodynamic, biochemical, and neurophysiologic changes, eventually leading to pathological disturbance and diverse clinical symptoms. Ginseng (Panax ginseng), a popular herb distributed in East Asia, has been extensively used as medicinal and nutritional supplements for a variety of disorders worldwide. In recent years, ginseng has displayed attractive beneficial effects in distinct neurological disorders including stroke, involving multiple protective mechanisms. In this article, we reviewed the literature on ginseng studies in the experimental stroke field, particularly focusing on the in vivo evidence on the preventive or therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of ginseng and ginsenosides in various stroke models of mice and rats. We also summarized the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of ginseng and ginsenosides on short-and long-term stroke outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: We conducted the first systematic literature review and analysis of psychiatric manifestations in Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) to describe: (1) time of occurrence of psychiatric manifestations relative to other disease manifestations; and (2) frequent combinations of psychiatric, neurological and visceral disease manifestations. Methods: A systematic EMBase literature search was conducted to identify, collate and analyze published data from patients with NPC associated with psychiatric symptoms, published between January 1967 and November 2015. Results: Of 152 identified publications 40 were included after screening that contained useable data from 58 NPC patients (mean [SD] age at diagnosis of NPC 27.8 [15.1] years). Among patients with available data, cognitive, memory and instrumental impairments were most frequent (90% of patients), followed by psychosis (62%), altered behavior (52%) and mood disorders (38%). Psychiatric manifestations were reported before or at neurological disease onset in 41 (76%) patients; organic signs (e.g., hepatosplenomegaly, hearing problems) were reported before psychiatric manifestations in 12 (22%). Substantial delays to diagnosis were observed (5-6 years between psychiatric presentation and NPC diagnosis). Conclusions: NPC should be considered as a possible cause of psychiatric manifestations in patients with an atypical disease course, acute-onset psychosis, treatment failure, and/or certain combinations of psychiatric/neurological/visceral symptoms.

AB  - Objectives: To examine whether chronic physical aggression (CPA) in adulthood can be epigenetically programmed early in life due to exposure to early-life adversity. Methods: Literature search of public databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus. Results: Children/adolescents susceptible for CPA and exposed to early-life abuse fail to efficiently cope with stress that in turn results in the development of CPA later in life. This phenomenon was observed in humans and animal models of aggression. The susceptibility to aggression is a complex trait that is regulated by the interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Epigenetic mechanisms mediate this interaction. Subjects exposed to stress early in life exhibited long-term epigenetic programming that can influence their behaviour in adulthood. This programming affects expression of many genes not only in the brain but also in other systems such as neuroendocrine and immune. Conclusions: The propensity to adult CPA behaviour in subjects experienced to early-life adversity is mediated by epigenetic programming that involves long-term systemic epigenetic alterations in a whole genome.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Although the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is not entirely clear, the aberrant aggregation of alpha-synuclein has long been considered as an important risk factor. Elucidating the mechanisms that influence the aggregation of alpha-synuclein is essential for developing an effective diagnostic, preventative and therapeutic strategy to treat this devastating disease. The aggregation of alpha-synuclein is influenced by several post-translational modifications. Here, we summarized the major post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, truncation, nitration, O-GlcNAcylation) of alpha-synuclein and the effect of these modifications on alpha-synuclein aggregation, which may provide potential targets for future therapeutics.

AB  - Health care professionals are paramount to the prevention and management of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Confidence in caring for people at risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is influenced by knowledge of and attitudes towards suicide. This systematic review aimed to explore health care professionals' knowledge of and attitudes towards suicide, as well as, their confidence in caring for people at risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. A systematic search of 4 electronic databases over 10 years was conducted. Following retrieval of 1,723 abstracts, 46 primary research publications were included, involving both cross-sectional (n = 27) and intervention study designs (n = 19). Knowledge of, attitudes towards, and confidence in caring for people at risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors were explored among primary health care professionals, specialists, and health care students. The influence of training and education, type of health care professional, country of practice, and prior experience with suicide were highlighted among included studies. Health care professionals' knowledge of, attitudes towards and confidence in caring for people at risk of suicide are complex, interrelated constructs that shape their behaviors and may impact patient outcomes. Suicide training and education is necessary within health care curricula and as part of health care professionals' continuing professional development.

AB  - Individuals diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often find it difficult to attribute mental states to others and to understand their own and others' behaviour (Theory of Mind, [ToM]/social cognition). These difficulties can affect their moral judgements. The present article focuses on evidence on moral reasoning and ToM, with the aim of analysing theoretical and review research into autism. The weight intention has in moral reasoning and the causal relation between mental states, actions and outcomes is an essential part of this study. Evidence in the field of autism reports how autistic people would not be able to make moral judgements based on the agent's intention. Instead, they would reason based on the outcomes of the action. For example, this can be translated into misunderstandings, malicious judgements or 'over-blaming' in accidental situations (ambiguous valences). These impairments can confirm the association between ToM and moral reasoning.

AB  - Objective: Understanding of the factors that predict emotional distress in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is limited. This systematic review critically appraised and synthesised the findings of longitudinal studies into baseline clinical, demographic, social, and psychological predictors of later emotional distress in people with ALS. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO and CINAHL Plus were searched for relevant published literature from their inception until April 2018. Inclusion criteria were prospective or retrospective peer-reviewed studies, written in English, assessing baseline clinical, demographic, psychological or social predictors of emotional distress or psychological quality of life >= 1 month later in adults with ALS. Results: Eight studies were included in this review. Demographic or clinical factors were investigated in seven studies, social factors in two studies, and psychological factors in three studies. There was scarce evidence that any baseline demographic or clinical factors predicted emotional distress. The only factor that consistently predicted emotional distress across multiple studies was lower social support. Mindfulness and psychological quality of life each predicted emotional distress but were only evaluated in single studies. Conclusions: Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying emotional distress, particularly modifiable factors such as psychological factors, to reduce emotional distress in people with ALS.

AB  - Humanoid robots, unmanned rovers, entertainment pets, drones, and so on are great examples of mobile robots. They can be distinguished from other robots by their ability to move autonomously, with enough intelligence to react and make decisions based on the perception they receive from the environment. Mobile robots must have some source of input data, some way of decoding that input, and a way of taking actions (including its own motion) to respond to a changing world. The need to sense and adapt to an unknown environment requires a powerful cognition system. Nowadays, there are mobile robots that can walk, run, jump, and so on like their biological counterparts. Several fields of robotics have arisen, such as wheeled mobile robots, legged robots, flying robots, robot vision, artificial intelligence, and so on, which involve different technological areas such as mechanics, electronics, and computer science. In this article, the world of mobile robots is explored including the new trends. These new trends are led by artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, network communication, cooperative work, nanorobotics, friendly human-robot interfaces, safe human-robot interaction, and emotion expression and perception. Furthermore, these news trends are applied to different fields such as medicine, health care, sports, ergonomics, industry, distribution of goods, and service robotics. These tendencies will keep going their evolution in the coming years.

AB  - Background: Case management is a client-centered approach to improve the coordination and continuity of service delivery, especially for persons with substance use disorders (SUD) and multiple and complex support needs. This intervention supports individuals by helping them identify needed services, facilitate linkage with services, and promote participation and retention in services. However, it is questionable whether case management is equally effective in promoting recovery and aspects of personal functioning. The objective was to conduct an updated meta-analysis and to assess whether case management was more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) among persons with SUD for improving treatment-related (e.g., successful linkage with and retention in treatment) as well as personal functioning outcomes (e.g., substance use).
   Methods: This meta-analysis focuses on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included persons with alcohol or drug use disorders and compared case management with TAU. To be eligible, interventions had to meet core case management functions as defined in the literature. We conducted searches of the following databases to May 2017: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Specialized Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Also, reference lists of retrieved publications were scanned for relevant (un) published studies.
   Results: The overall effect size for case management compared to TAU across all outcome categories and moments was small and positive (SMD = 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.28), but statistically significant. Effects were considerably larger for treatment tasks (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI 0.18-0.48) than for personal functioning outcomes (SMD = 0.06, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.15). The largest effect sizes were found for retention in substance abuse treatment and linkage with substance abuse services. Moderator effects of case management models and conditions were assessed, but no significant differences were observed.
   Conclusions: The primary results from earlier meta-analyses were supported: case management is more effective than TAU conditions for improving outcomes, but this effect is significantly larger for treatment-related tasks than for personal functioning outcomes. Case management can be an important supplement to available services for improving linkage and retention, although further research is needed to assess its potential for supporting recovery from a longitudinal perspective.

AB  - The relaxation of discriminatory policies against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) service personnel has led to increased diversity among military populations. Given this increase, it is important to assess sexual and gender minority groups' health and well-being in the context of military service. This narrative review assessed these outcomes in LGBTQ military personnel. The electronic databases OVID Medline, PsycInfo, and Embase were searched for papers published between January 2000 and July 2018. Thirty papers were included. In line with life course model, studies aligned with four themes: (1) mental health and well-being; (2) stigma and healthcare utilization; (3) sexual trauma; and (4) physical health. These themes highlighted that LGBTQ military personnel and veterans have poorer mental health and well-being; report more stigma and barriers to mental healthcare, which reduces uptake of accessed healthcare services; experience more sexual trauma; and have poorer physical health than heterosexual military personnel and veterans. However, there are substantial gaps in the current evidence for this population. Future research should aim to address limitations of the literature, and to ensure that data on LGBTQ personnel and veterans is collected as standard.

AB  - Huntington's chorea (Huntington's disease, HD) is a genetic disorder caused by autosomal dominant mutation, leading to progressive neurodegenerative changes in the central nervous system. Involuntary movements such as chorea occur typically in HD patients, accompanied by progressive cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. Other common symptoms of HD are circadian and sleep abnormalities, which are observed from the earliest stages of the disease or even before the occurrence of clinical symptoms. The most common sleep problems reported by HD patients include insomnia, difficulties in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Also, specific changes in sleep architecture have been identified in HD. In this paper, we review studies on sleep and circadian rhythm disorders in HD. We outline findings concerning sleep patterns and disturbances of circadian rhythms in HD patients, as well as the role of psychiatric disorders and motor disorders in HD patients' sleep problems. We also discuss problems related to the different methods of diagnosing sleep disorders in HD. Furthermore, the adverse effects of medication used for the treatment of core HD symptoms as one of the sources of sleep disturbances in HD are emphasized. In conclusion, the diversity and complexity of the determinants of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders in HD are highlighted. Finally, the relevance of effective treatment to improve patients' functioning and quality of life as well as the potential relief of their cognitive and emotional symptoms is addressed.

AB  - Despite significant public health efforts, girls and young women still face gender-specific barriers to achieving optimal physical and mental health. Public health interventions have historically addressed the health needs of girls and young women using risk-focused, or deficit-based, approaches. Emerging research in public health and prevention provides an alternative approach, focusing instead on strengths and resilience. However, evidence remains limited regarding strength-based interventions to improve health outcomes for young women, including outcomes within the critically important areas of sexual and reproductive health. To address this gap in evidence, this review analyses the evidence base for intervention research using a strength-based resilience-focused approach to reduce HIV and sexual risk for girls and young women globally. A systematic search of published literature identified 35 articles, representing 25 unique interventions (N = 25). These interventions employed in-person, and other engaging methods, to deliver intervention content aimed at fostering resilience and changing sexual risk behaviours. Results also highlight gaps in measurement and study design, as well as variation in geographic setting and level of behaviour change. This review draws attention to the potential growth of strength-based intervention research, and offers future directions for developing and expanding research on resilience as an urgent global public health priority.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder next to Alzheimer's disease. Most PD cases are considered to be sporadic and despite considerable scientific effort, the underlying cause(s) still remain(s) enigmatic. In particular, it is unknown to which extent epigenetic alterations contribute to the pathophysiology of this devastating disorder. This is partly due to the fact that appropriate PD models are not yet available. Moreover, epigenetic patterns and mechanisms are species specific and murine systems reflect only a few of the idiosyncrasies of human neurons. For several years now, patient-specific stem cell-derived neural and non-neural cells have been employed to overcome this limitation allowing the analysis and establishment of humanized disease models for PD. Thus, several studies tried to dissect epigenetic alterations such as aberrant DNA methylation or microRNA patterns using lund human mesencephalic cell lines or neurons derived from (patient-specific) induced pluripotent stem cells. These studies demonstrate that human neurons have the potential to be used as model systems for the study of epigenetic modifications in PD such as characterizing epigenetic changes, correlating epigenetic changes to gene expression alterations and hopefully using these insights for the development of novel therapeutics. However, more research is required to define the epigenetic (age-associated) landscape of human in vitro neurons and compare these to native neurons before they can be established as suitable models for epigenetic studies in PD. In this review, we summarize the knowledge about epigenetic studies performed on human neuronal PD models, and we discuss advantages and current limitations of these (stem cell-derived) neuronal models for the study of epigenetic alterations in PD.

AB  - The impostor phenomenon is a pervasive psychological experience of perceived intellectual and professional fraudulence. It is not a diagnosable condition yet observed in clinical and normal populations. Increasingly, impostorism research has expanded beyond clinical and into applied settings. However, to date, a systematic review examining the methodological quality of impostorism measures used to conduct such research has yet to be carried out. This systematic review examines trait impostor phenomenon measures and evaluates their psychometric properties against a quality assessment framework. Systematic searches were carried out on six electronic databases, seeking original empirical studies examining the conceptualization, development, or validation of self-report impostor phenomenon scales. A subsequent review of reference lists also included two full-text dissertations. Predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified to select the final 18 studies in the review sample. Of the studies included, four measures of the impostor phenomenon were identified and their psychometric properties assessed against the quality appraisal tool-Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, Harvey Impostor Scale, Perceived Fraudulence Scale, and Leary Impostor Scale. The findings often highlighted that studies did not necessarily report poor psychometric properties; rather an absence of data and stringent assessment criteria resulted in lower methodological ratings. Recommendations for future research are made to address the conceptual clarification of the construct's dimensionality, to improve future study quality and to enable better discrimination between measures.

AB  - BackgroundParental attachment was defined as: series of inner behaviors that would cause the infant to develop an intimate relation with his/her parents. This emotional relationship is formed long before birth during the pregnancy and has been associated with psychosocial outcomes for women and children. This relationship is known as one of the major components of the child's social and emotional development. Parents' relationship with their fetus could be strengthened using various strategies, but efforts to augment the maternal-fetal relationship have not always been successful. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and a meta-analysis survey of the effects of attachment-based interventions on prenatal attachment.
   Methods: A comprehensive search of relevant randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials will be performed in EMBASE (via Scopus), ProQuest, Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid and Web of Science, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SID, MagIran, Irandoc, Barakat Knowledge Network System and Iranian registry of clinical trials website as Iranian databases using English and Persian keywords such as prenatal attachment, relationship, maternal attachment. Only randomized controlled clinical trials conducted between 2000 and 2016 will be included in this review. The study will be selected if their participants were expectant mothers, their partners or both. Our primary outcome will be the effect size of intervention. The quality of experimental studies will be evaluated using CONSORT checklist and Study Quality Guide by Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group.
   Two authors will independently assess the eligibility of the studies. Any disagreements will be resolved through a third reviewer. The risk of bias will be independently determined using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The quality of the papers will be assessed based on the CONSORT checklist. If possible quantitative data will be pooled in statistical meta-analyzing with random effect model.
   Discussion: In this review the current state of knowledge on prenatal attachment is examined. Effectiveness of attachment-based interventions during pregnancy is analyzed. Finally, practice and research implications based on analysis of the current status of maternal-fetal attachment are identified. The expected findings will help healthcare providers to develop pregnant women and infants' health when offering prenatal care.

AB  - Background: Cotard syndrome is a rare condition whose main feature is a nihilistic delusion ranging from the denial of body parts to that of the existence of one's own life or even the entire universe. Objectives: The aim of this article is to review the nosological significance of Cotard syndrome and to explore the disorder among patients with dementia. Methods: Medline and Google Scholar searches were conducted for relevant articles, chapters and books published before 2018. Search terms used included Cotard delusion, Cotard syndrome and dementia, nihilistic delusion. Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed for further relevant references. Results and conclusion: In this narrative review we emphasise the fact that cases of Cotard syndrome involving patients with dementia are reported quite infrequently. Published studies are limited to very short series or isolated cases. Clinicians are obliged to treat the disorder. They should be alert to the potential high risk inherent in this condition.Keypoints Cotard syndrome is a rare condition characterised by nihilistic delusions that may range from negation of existence of parts of the body to delusion of being dead. The prevalence and incidence of this rare syndrome are not known. Since Cotard's syndrome is conceptualised as part of an underlying disorder, several psychiatric and somatic diseases have been associated with the syndrome. The syndrome may occur in patients suffering from dementia.

AB  - Background: Increasing attention to palliative care for the general population has led to the development of various evidence-based or consensus-based tools and interventions. However, specific tools and interventions are needed for people with severe mental illness (SMI) who have a life-threatening illness. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the scientific evidence on tools and interventions in palliative care for this group.
   Methods: Systematic searches were done in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase databases, supplemented by reference tracking, searches on the internet with free text terms, and consultations with experts to identify relevant literature. Empirical studies with qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods designs concerning tools and interventions for use in palliative care for people with SMI were included. Methodological quality was assessed using a critical appraisal instrument for heterogeneous study designs. Stepwise study selection and the assessment of methodological quality were done independently by two review authors.
   Results: Four studies were included, reporting on a total of two tools and one multi-component intervention. One study concerned a tool to identify the palliative phase in patients with SMI. This tool appeared to be usable only in people with SMI with a cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, two related studies focused on a tool to involve people with SMI in discussions about medical decisions at the end of life. This tool was assessed as feasible and usable in the target group. One other study concerned the Dutch national Care Standard for palliative care, including a multi-component intervention. The Palliative Care Standard also appeared to be feasible and usable in a mental healthcare setting, but required further tailoring to suit this specific setting. None of the included studies investigated the effects of the tools and interventions on quality of life or quality of care.
   Conclusions: Studies of palliative care tools and interventions for people with SMI are scarce. The existent tools and intervention need further development and should be tailored to the care needs and settings of these people. Further research is needed on the feasibility, usability and effects of tools and interventions for palliative care for people with SMI.

The articles were exported to a bibliographic database for further screening process. Two reviewers worked independently to screen results and extract data from the included studies. Any discrepancies were resolved and confirmed by the consensus of all authors.
   Results: There were three screening approaches for detecting MCI and dementia - screening by a healthcare provider, screening by a self-administered questionnaire and caretaker informant screening. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was the most common and preferable tool for MCI screening (sensitivity [Sn]: 81-97%; specificity [Sp]: 60 -86%), whereas Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) was the preferable tool for dementia screening (Sn: 79-100%; Sp: 86%).
   Conclusion: This systematic review found that there are three screening approaches for detecting early dementia and MCI at primary health care. ACE and MoCA are recommended tools for screening of dementia and MCI, respectively. (c) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species have been linked with the commencement of a variety of chronic human diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic inflammation, neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of cancer. The exigency of components with antioxidant efficacy is growing as it is recognized. The antioxidant effects of these components are mainly assigned to scavenging efficacy against hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, quenching singlet, triplet oxygen, chelating ability, and reducing power. There are various artificial antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), Propylgallate (PG) and butylated hydroxyquinone (TBHQ) are commercially obtainable and actually applied. However, the use of these artificial antioxidants for medicine or food components has been bounded by the toxicity and safety that can develop to the problems of the potential health in human. Therefore, many investigators have owing interest to many types of innate antioxidants that can be used without toxicity in human. Marine algae are known to be a wealthy source of these components. Antioxidant efficiency has been announced in a great kind of marine algae, including green, brown and red algae. Natural antioxidants from algae are known to play a significant function against various diseases. The discovered antioxidant components in algae from taxa related to these groups have effort anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, dietary, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antimalarial, anti-proliferative, and anticancer properties. Therefore, the present overview was summarized in the recent research on the antioxidant efficacy of marine algae, methods, and components.

AB  - Incarcerated pregnant women experience psychosocial conditions that put them at risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. To examine perinatal outcomes including maternal mental health well-being, birth weight, and preterm birth, an integrated search of the literature was conducted. Findings indicate that time in prison, especially during the first trimester, results in improved birth weight and longer gestation. Findings related to maternal mental health well-being were inconclusive but suggest significant risk to maternal role development when mother and infant are separated. Limited findings demonstrate that prenatal care, a safe environment, and food stability, along with reduced or eliminated substance abuse and violence, can positively influence perinatal outcomes. Rigorous, systematic research is vital for developing policies related to incarcerated women and perinatal outcomes.

AB  - Background Evidence suggests that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups have an increased risk of involuntary psychiatric care. However, to our knowledge, there is no published meta-analysis that brings together both international and UK literature and allows for comparison of the two. This study examined compulsory detention in BAME and migrant groups in the UK and internationally, and aimed to expand upon existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the rates of detention for BAME populations.
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched five databases (PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, Embase, and CINAHL) for quantitative studies comparing involuntary admission, readmission, and inpatient bed days between BAME or migrant groups and majority or native groups, published between inception and Dec 3, 2018. We extracted data on study characteristics, patient-level data on diagnosis, age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, and occupational status, and our outcomes of interest (involuntary admission to hospital, readmission to hospital, and inpatient bed days) for meta-analysis. We used a random-effects model to compare disparate outcome measures. We assessed explanations offered for the differences between minority and majority groups for the strength of the evidence supporting them. This study is prospectively registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017078137.
   Findings Our search identified 9511 studies for title and abstract screening, from which we identified 296 potentially relevant full-text articles. Of these, 67 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in depth. We added four studies after reference and citation searches, meaning 71 studies in total were included. 1 953 135 participants were included in the studies. Black Caribbean patients were significantly more likely to be compulsorily admitted to hospital compared with those in white ethnic groups (odds ratio 2.53, 95% CI 2.03-3.16, p<0.0001). Black African patients also had significantly increased odds of being compulsorily admitted to hospital compared with white ethnic groups (2.27, 1.62-3.19, p<0.0001), as did, to a lesser extent, south Asian patients (1.33, 1.07-1.65, p=0.0091). Black Caribbean patients were also significantly more likely to be readmitted to hospital compared with white ethnic groups (2.30, 1.22-4.34, p=0.0102). Migrant groups were significantly more likely to be compulsorily admitted to hospital compared with native groups (1.50, 1.21-1.87, p=0.0003). The most common explanations for the increased risk of detainment in BAME populations included increased prevalence of psychosis, increased perceived risk of violence, increased police contact, absence of or mistrust of general practitioners, and ethnic disadvantages.
   Interpretation BAME and migrant groups are at a greater risk of psychiatric detention than are majority groups, although there is variation across ethnic groups. Attempts to explain increased detention in ethnic groups should avoid amalgamation and instead carry out culturally-specific, hypothesis-driven studies to examine the numerous contributors to varying rates of detention.

KW  - TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: Mobile device use is a rapidly growing, socially acceptable interactional habit. The impact of mobile device use on social interactions, including between parents and young children, is uncertain. The aim was to describe, synthesise and evaluate the evidence about parents' mobile device use, caregiving and children's social and emotional development. Methods: Seven medical and social sciences databases were searched using keywords and subject headings. Screening for eligibility used PRISMA guidelines and scientific and reporting quality were assessed with standardised checklists. Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria (four surveys, three qualitative and one mixed-method investigation). This small group of studies is of diverse quality, but there is evidence of associations between parents' mobile device use, attention to caregiving and changes in child behaviour. Use of mobile devices during parenting activities may be infrequent and brief, but it can be a potent distraction that reduces caregiver responsiveness to children. Conclusions: An emerging body of research suggests mobile devices are associated with altered attention and responsivity to children by their caregivers and may change caregiver/child interactions. The evidence precludes questions about causality or discussion of impacts on child development. Knowledge gaps have been identified and they require future targeted research.

AB  - Introduction: The Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis (OPD-2) is an operational multiaxial diagnostic assessment and treatment planning tool. This systematic review sought to analyze empirical studies that used the OPD as an instrument. In addition to identifying the studies, we analyzed the topics covered and the results of research that used the OPD empirically.
   Method: Articles, dissertations and empirical theses that mentioned or used the OPD instrument in the last five years (2012-2017) were included in this review. The strategy included searching with combinations of the descriptors "Operationalized and psychodynamic and diagnosis" from the Portal de Periodicos CAPES on the PubMed, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate databases for work published in English, Portuguese or Spanish in the last five years.
   Results: The search returned a total of 189 papers, but only 20 were included. The studies selected discussed the validity and reliability of the instrument, the therapeutic process and analysis of outcomes, assessment of different mental disorders, and also included studies comparing different instruments and techniques. Considerable scientific effort has evidently been dedicated to accumulating more consistent data on psychodynamic diagnosis.
   Conclusion: It was demonstrated that the OPD is an essential clinical tool for dimensional comprehension of the subject and for scientific research. However, the number of publications on the subject is not yet significant and the methods employed are diverse. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of data on topics such as applicability in different contexts and to different pathologies, promoting greater visibility and with greater representativeness of professionals who have experience with the instrument.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson and Alzheimer, are among the main public health issues in the world due to their effects on life quality and high mortality rates. Although neuronal death is the main cause of disruption in the central nervous system (CNS) elicited by these pathologies, other cells such as astrocytes are also affected. There is no treatment for preventing the cellular death during neurodegenerative processes, and current drug therapy is focused on decreasing the associated motor symptoms. For these reasons, it has been necessary to seek new therapeutical procedures, including the use of growth factors to reduce -synuclein toxicity and misfolding in order to recover neuronal cells and astrocytes. Additionally, it has been shown that some growth factors are able to reduce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are associated with neuronal death through activation of antioxidative enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and neuroglobin. In the present review, we discuss the use of growth factors such as PDGF-BB, VEGF, BDNF, and the antioxidative enzyme neuroglobin in the protection of astrocytes and neurons during the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - In most communities in sub-Saharan Africa, the definition of a child is culturally, politically, and socially unspecific and varied. The variance in meanings ascribed to a child is evident in legislative definitions, especially on the issue of child marriage. Child marriage, a human rights violation is a legal or customary union in which one or both spouses are below the age of 18. This practice is prevalent in most communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Arguably, it robs children of the opportunity to enjoy childhood and experience dependence, protection, and care. Rather, it turns them into protectors, nurturers, and providers. Children are shoved with the responsibility of being parents through child marriage. Thus, creating no demarcation between the role and responsibility of an adult and a child. Given that children are ill-prepared for marriage and its concomitant elements such as sex, psychological, emotional and physical maturity to be spouses and possibly parents, this paper argues that the journey to self-discovery and identity is at the intersection of culture, law, and religion. The clash between religious and cultural autonomy is a pervasive problem for national and international laws, one that arises because of claims of immunity from child protection and marriage provisions on the grounds of cultural or religious autonomy. Informed by observation during fieldwork in Southern African countries and literature on cultural relativism, this paper suggests that the clash between cultural autonomy and child marriage prohibition is best addressed through a legal pluralist perspective. This perspective seeks to bridge the gap between customary law, national laws, and international treaties, and requires sensitivity to the economic and socio-cultural factors behind the persistence of child marriage.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewWe review the search for genetic variants that affect the risk for alcohol dependence and alcohol consumption.Recent FindingsVariations in genes affecting alcohol metabolism (ADH1B, ALDH2) are protective against both alcohol dependence and excessive consumption, but different variants are found in different populations. There are different patterns of risk variants for alcohol dependence vs. consumption. Variants for alcohol dependence, but not consumption, are associated with risk for other psychiatric illnesses.SummaryADH1B and ALDH2 strongly affect both consumption and dependence. Variations in many other genes affect both consumption and dependenceor one or the other of these traitsbut individual effect sizes are small. Evidence for other specific genes that affect dependence is not yet strong. Most current knowledge derives from studies of European-ancestry populations, and large studies of carefully phenotyped subjects from different populations are needed to understand the genetic contributions to alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders.

AB  - Objective: This review aimed to evaluate the current evidence for what impact different Liaison Psychiatry (LP) services are having on Emergency Departments (ED). Mental Health (MH) problems contribute to 12 million annual US ED attendances and 5% in the UK.
   Methods: Databases were searched for articles describing LP services for adult MH patients attending EDs which reported ED care-related outcomes, published since 2000. Articles were screened and relevant articles quality assessed and narratively synthesized.
   Results: 3653 articles were identified and 17 included in the review. Study designs were overall of poor-moderate quality, using retrospective before-and-after study designs. LP services were categorized into four models. Models with MH personnel integrated into the ED team or triage reduced patient waiting time to be seen, may reduce patients leaving without being seen and have high staff satisfaction. Co-located MH space or personnel reduced patient waiting times. Care agreements with existing psychiatry teams don't affect waiting times or ED length of stay. Transferring patients to external services reduces patients' time in the ED. There is insufficient evidence about patient satisfaction, costs, and onward care.
   Conclusions: Waiting times are shortened by MH personnel integrated into the ED and are more satisfactory to staff than other LP models. The involvement of a psychiatrist in the LP team improves the care quality. All models may improve safety for patients but most evaluations are of poor quality and therefore there is still insufficient evidence to recommend one service model over another and further robust research is required.

AB  - Objective: Schizophrenia is associated with an increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. Patients receiving antipsychotic medications, including olanzapine, are at further risk. Ghrelin is an appetite-stimulating peptide hormone, although whether blood levels are altered by antipsychotic treatment, remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing blood ghrelin levels in patients with schizophrenia before and after treatment with olanzapine.
   Method: Two authors independently searched major electronic databases from inception until February 2018 for studies measuring blood ghrelin levels among patients with schizophrenia before and after olanzapine therapy. Random effects meta-analysis calculating standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and meta-regression analyses were performed.
   Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Across these studies, there were 111 patients with schizophrenia (mean age 40, 85% male, baseline BMI 22, and endpoint BMI 23). Olanzapine treatment (mean [standard deviation] duration = 12.3 [7.6] weeks) was associated with a significant decrease in blood ghrelin levels with a medium effect size (SMD = -0.48, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.08, p = 0.018). Age, sex, baseline BMI, geography, olanzapine dose and duration, year of publication, study quality, inpatient status, and antipsychotic washout did not moderate this association.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that in patients with schizophrenia, olanzapine therapy is associated with decreased blood ghrelin levels, a paradoxical phenomenon known to occur in obesity. Future studies should investigate the contribution of dietary factors (e.g., caloric intake) and physical activity to this association, as well as the effects of other antipsychotics on ghrelin levels.

AB  - Objective To review the available literature on obsessive-compulsive symptom (OCS)/obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in patients with schizophrenia. Methodology Electronic searches were carried out to locate studies reporting various aspects of OCS/OCD in patients with schizophrenia. Results Available evidence suggests that prevalence of OCS/OCD in patients with schizophrenia is much higher than prevalence in general population and it is seen in all the stages of schizophrenia, starting from at risk mental state to chronic/stabilisation/deficit phases. Symptom profile of OCS/OCD in schizophrenia is similar to that seen in patients with OCD only. Presence of OCS/OCD is associated with higher severity of symptoms of schizophrenia and more negative outcome. At present there is very limited data on the efficacy/effectiveness of various pharmacological measures and psychological interventions, for management of OCS/OCD in patients with schizophrenia. There is some evidence pointing towards beneficial effect of certain antipsychotics, antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy. Management of OCS/OCD in patients with schizophrenia involves proper assessment. If the OCS/OCD is related to use of particular antipsychotic use, initial attempt must be made to reduce the dose of antipsychotics, however, if this is not effective, than addition of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) must be considered. If the OCS/OCD is not related to the use of antipsychotic medication, than depending up on the severity of psychotic symptoms, addition of SSRIs must be considered. Conclusion This review suggests that OCS/OCD is highly prevalent among patients with schizophrenia and there is limited good quality evidence to make any specific recommendations for management.

Here, on the basis of experimental and theoretical knowledge acquired in the field of expert memory, we propose an alternative accountnamed the expertise accountthat explains both effects through the acquisition and use of knowledge structures (a generalization of chunks, retrieval structures, and templates), which havebeen used extensively in expert memory theory. These knowledge structures can be of two types: nonslotted or slotted schemas. We suggest that the SNARC effect can be explained via the use of nonslotted schemas, and the SPoARC effect via slotted schemas. We conclude our article by presenting the broader implications of our framework for working memory in general, when considering knowledge structures.

TI  - REALITY, ARTIFICE, AND CHANGING LANDSCAPES IN THE HOUSE OF MARCUS LUCRETIUS IN POMPEII
AB  - In the 1855 edition of his guide to Pompeii, the French artist and archaeologist Ernest Breton begins a chapter on the city's houses and shops with a print showing tourists in a grand Pompeian residence (figure 1). At the rear of an atrium with an enormous impluvium, a man contemplates a raised garden while a well-dressed couple approaches from the right. Behind them, in the roofless remains of the house, the garden's ancient sculptural display remains in situ; animals and deities inhabit a landscape dominated by a shrine-like niche, a pool, and pillars painted with trees. Deep shadows and encroaching vegetation set a romantic, melancholic mood. This is the House of Marcus Lucretius (IX.3.5), excavated less than a decade prior and, at the time, one of the ancient city's most famous sights. As is typical of nineteenth-century illustrations of Pompeii, the size of the house is exaggerated: while the decorative scheme and arrangement of the rooms is accurate, the garden is too highly elevated and too large in proportion to the figures. The atrium's disproportionate impluvium is a complete fabrication, the actual impluvium having been dismantled in antiquity. Despite the artistic licence, Breton and his imagined tourists follow the same path as ancient visitors to the house, drawn toward the garden and its sculptures by the manipulation of space and decoration.

AB  - Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA) 2017 was gazetted on April 7, 2017. It repeals the Mental Health Act, 1987, and it can be implemented only after the state rules are formed. The central government has already published three sets of rules. This article was written with an objective to review how to make rules and regulations for the state as per MHCA, 2017. All sections of MHCA 2017 and the mental health rules previously made by different states according to the Mental Health Act 1987 were reviewed. Google and PubMed searches were done to review the implementation of their respective mental health acts by different countries and states in the past. Go through Central/State Mental Health Rules, 2018, framed by the central government. Try to adapt it for the state. A meeting on MHCA 2017 should be conducted, including all stakeholders who will give their suggestions about changes to be made. Frame an initial draft and discuss it with the stakeholders and finalize the draft. Discuss the draft in state mental health authority meetings and submit the draft to the government. The Department of Legislation and Parliamentary Affairs can be consulted. The draft should be sent to the central government's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for approval. According to MHCA 2017, state rules can be formed in relation to the aspects mentioned under Sections 121 and 123. The state government should make notification of the rules and then implement them.

AB  - Background: Injuries have become a major public health concern. Recent data show that globally over 5 million people lose their life due to injury every year. Especially in low- and middle-income countries, people living below the poverty line are drastically scathed due to injuries. Objective: The objective of this paper is to find the magnitude and risk factors of fall among the elderly in India. Materials and Methods: A systematic search was done by using Google Scholar and PubMed. Results: The selected studies revealed that the prevalence of fall ranges from 26% to 37% across various regions, fall injuries are associated with poor vision, vertigo, imbalance, fear of falling, history of fall, presence of osteoarthritis, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and depression. This study has shown the risk of fall was higher among female elderly population. Conclusion: The major contributing factors for fall injuries arc aging, visual impairment, previous history of fall, depression, and gait problem. Females have a higher risk of fall comparatively to males.

AB  - Nanotechnology holds huge potentials in several fields and is envisaged as a technology to lead the way toward sustainable environment-friendly development in the coming years. The basic theme of nanotechnology is to use particles having size in nanometer range for various applications in medical fields, cosmetics industry, and agriculture and food technologies. The benefits associated with nanotechnology include among others increase in yield and quality of produce in agriculture, improved cosmetic products, directed delivery of medicines and sensor applications. Advancement in the development of nanosensors has made recognition of disease causing elements, toxins and nutrients in foods, and elements in environmental samples, easier and cost effective. However, immense focus on nanotechnology in past few decades has led to its unrestricted development and consequently enormous use of nanoparticles (NPs). It is considered that NPs may pose risks to the environment and biological systems. It is also becoming evident that the size, structure and type of nanomaterials, such as graphene/graphene oxide with gold NPs, carbon and carbon nitride nanotubes, have different effects on plants and environment. Hence, long-term life cycle analyses are needed to assess impacts of NPs. This review presents a brief overview of applications of nanomaterials in agriculture and discusses its positive and negative aspects in agricultural field. The review emphasizes that future development of nanotechnology must be based on scientific evaluations of benefits and risks associated to it in long term.

AB  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to identify whether mixed states in bipolar disorder (BD) are associated with more frequent suicidal behavior when compared to manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes.
   Method: We performed a systematic search of the scientific literature on the subject using the PubMed, ISI Web Of Science, PsycINFO and SciELO databases. The terms chosen for the search were (bipolar) AND (suicid*) AND (mixed). We selected original studies comparing suicidal behavior of patients in mixed states and suicidal behavior of patients in other BD phases.
   Results: Sixteen papers fit the selection criteria. Twelve of the original 16 studies compared suicidal behavior in mixed states and pure mania, and the majority of these studies (n = 11) revealed that suicidal behavior was more frequent among individuals in mixed states. Five of the papers compared suicidal behavior between depressive and mixed phases of BD. One of these five papers reported more severe suicidal behavior in patients in mixed states and another described more frequent suicidal behavior in patients with pure depression. There were no significant statistical differences between groups in the remaining three of these five studies.
   Conclusion: During acute BD episodes, suicidal behavior is more strongly associated with mixed states than with pure mania or hypomania. However, it was not possible to demonstrate that the association between suicidal behavior and mixed states is stronger than the association between suicidal behavior and depressive phases. The results hereby presented are worth considering in clinical practice to better evaluate suicide risk and to prevent suicide.

AB  - Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a disorder with a dramatic impact on both the individual and society. Besides severe weight loss, excessive physical exercise and cognitive disturbances can be present in patients with AN as primary symptoms of the pathology or as secondary effects induced by physical and metabolic alterations. Mechanistic research in this field has taken advantage of a well characterized animal model, the activity-based anorexia model (ABA). ABA rodents and subjects with AN show clear behavioral and physiological similarities, but a throughout neurocognitive assessment of the model is still missing. Here, we review the available literature in the ABA field, highlighting similarities between ABA and AN at the behavioral, neurophysiological and cognitive level. Furthermore, based on availability, feasibility and adaptability of rodent behavioral protocols, we propose a set of neurocognitive assays that can be performed on the ABA. The proposed assessment represents an important step forward in the validation and extension of the ABA model, opening several routes of investigation related to AN and other eating disorders.

AB  - Dispersal is ubiquitous throughout the tree of life: factors selecting for dispersal include kin competition, inbreeding avoidance and spatiotemporal variation in resources or habitat suitability. These factors differ in whether they promote male and female dispersal equally strongly, and often selection on dispersal of one sex depends on how much the other disperses. For example, for inbreeding avoidance it can be sufficient that one sex disperses away from the natal site. Attempts to understand sex-specific dispersal evolution have created a rich body of theoretical literature, which we review here. We highlight an interesting gap between empirical and theoretical literature. The former associates different patterns of sex-biased dispersal with mating systems, such as female-biased dispersal in monogamous birds and male-biased dispersal in polygynous mammals. The predominant explanation is traceable back to Greenwood's () ideas of how successful philopatric or dispersing individuals are at gaining mates or the resources required to attract them. Theory, however, has developed surprisingly independently of these ideas: models typically track how immigration and emigration change relatedness patterns and alter competition for limiting resources. The limiting resources are often considered sexually distinct, with breeding sites and fertilizable females limiting reproductive success for females and males, respectively. We show that the link between mating system and sex-biased dispersal is far from resolved: there are studies showing that mating systems matter, but the oft-stated association between polygyny and male-biased dispersal is not a straightforward theoretical expectation. Here, an important understudied factor is the extent to which movement is interpretable as an extension of mate-searching (e.g. are matings possible en route or do they only happen after settling in new habitat - or can females perhaps move with stored sperm). We also point out other new directions for bridging the gap between empirical and theoretical studies: there is a need to build Greenwood's influential yet verbal explanation into formal models, which also includes the possibility that an individual benefits from mobility as it leads to fitness gains in more than one final breeding location (a possibility not present in models with a very rigid deme structure). The order of life-cycle events is likewise important, as this impacts whether a departing individual leaves behind important resources for its female or male kin, or perhaps both, in the case of partially overlapping resource use.

AB  - Sleep quality has been suggested to play an important role in development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the results have been inconsistent. A systematic review of observational studies aimed to evaluate the association between sleep quality and MetS. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models. The construction of funnel plot was used to explore publication bias, with further application of Egger's test. 22 studies were included. The pooled finding showed that overall sleep quality had a significant positive association with MetS (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.15-1.64), with substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 62.4%, P < 0.1). Similarly, the complaints of sleep, including difficulty in falling sleep (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.33), difficulty in maintaining sleep (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.30) and sleep inefficiency (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04-1.89) were proved to be associated with the risk of MetS. Our results indicated the overall sleep quality as well as sleep complaints have significant positive associations with MetS. Further studies based on a longitudinal design using validated tools that measure both objective and subjective components of sleep quality are needed to explore the causal relationship between sleep quality and MetS.

The aim of this work is to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence and the practice of physical activity. Through a systematic review in databases such as the Web of Science and Scopus that contain the terms of emotional intelligence along with the parameters of physical activity and sport. Twenty-four articles comprised the sample for further analysis. By way of conclusion it can be said that the main field of study of emotional intelligence related to the practice of physical activity is educational. Likewise, emotional intelligence is a determining factor in the improvement of sports competences.

AB  - Both gender and employment are critical and intersecting social determinants of mental and physical health. This paper describes the protocol used to conduct a systematic literature review of the relationship between gendered working environments and mental health. Gendered working environments (GWE) are conceptualised as involving: (1) differences in selection into work, and more specifically, occupations; (2) variation in employment arrangements and working hours; (3) disparities in psychosocial exposures at work, and; (4) differences in selection out of work. Methods/design: The review will adhere to a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search procedure. Key words will be identified that are specific to each of the four domains of GWE. The databases used for the search will be Scopus, Pubmed, Proquest, and Web of Science. Keywords will be adapted for the specific requirements of each electronic database. Inclusion criteria are: Using a validated scale to measure mental health (outcome); including exposures related to the four domains of GWE; reporting estimates for both men and women; and use of a cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional design. Studies will be excluded if they were published more than 10 years ago, are not in English or do not present extractable data on the relationship between GWE and mental health. Discussion: The proposed review will provide evidence about the numerous and complex ways in which employment and gender intersect (and are reinforced) to influence mental health over the life course.

AB  - Background: Trace elements play a pivotal role in Colorectal Cancer (CRC) inhibition and development process. This systematic review provides the basic comparison of case-control studies focusing on concentration of trace elements between those with CRC and controls
   Methods: The systematic review searched through two databases of Medline and Cochrane up to 24th June 2017. The search strategy focused on Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO). We searched the role of trace elements in cancer and focusing on case-control studies in CRC to obtain an insight into the differences in trace element concentrations between those with and without cancer.
   Results: The serum concentrations of Ca, Cu, Mg, Mn, Se, Si, and Zn were lower in CRC patients but for Co and S the levels were higher in CRC patients. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn, Pb, and Zn were increased in patients with metastasis, but not in Se. As for colon tissue specimens, inconsistent levels were reported between studies, notably in Cu, Se, and Zn. No changes were reported for B and Ca levels. Most of the trace elements in the tissue specimens showed higher concentrations of Cr, Fe, K, Mg, P, Rb, S, and Si compared to Br.
   Conclusion: With the growing interest to understand the link between trace elements in carcinogenesis and the possible interactions, multi assessment analysis of a larger cohort of samples is necessary.

AB  - Background: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is first choice of treatment for depressive symptoms and disorders in adolescents, however improvements are necessary because overall efficacy is low. Insights on CBT components and contextual and structural characteristics might increase the efficacy. The aim of our approach is to evaluate the efficacy of CBT for youth with depression and investigate the influence of specific components, contextual and structural factors that could improve effects.
   Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted, searches were undertaken in CINAHL, CENTRAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed and PsycINFO. Outcomes were meta-analyzed and confidence in results was assessed using the GRADE-method. Meta-regression was used to pinpoint components or other factors that were associated with an in-or decrease of effects of CBT.
   Results: We included 31 trials with 4335 participants. Moderate-quality evidence was found for CBT reducing depressive symptoms at the end of treatment and at follow-up, and CBT as indicated prevention resulted in 63% less risk of being depressed at follow-up. CBT containing a combination of behavioral activation and challenging thoughts component (as part of cognitive restructuring) or the involvement of caregiver(s) in intervention were associated with better outcomes for youth on the long term.
   Conclusions: There is evidence that CBT is effective for youth with a (subclinical) depression. Our analyses show that effects might improve when CBT contains the components behavioral activation and challenging thoughts and also when the caregiver(s) are involved. However, the influential effects of these three moderators should be further tested in RCTs. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The extensive use of rare earth elements (REEs) in a number of technologies is expected to impact on human health, including occupational and environmental REE exposures. A body of experimental evidence on REE-associated toxicity has been accumulated in recent decades, thus providing extensive background information on the adverse effects of REE exposures. Unlike experimental studies, the consequences of REE exposures to human health have been subjected to relatively fewer investigations. Geographical studies have been conducted on residents in REE mining districts, reporting on REE bioaccumulation, and associations between REE residential exposures and adverse health effects. A recent line of studies has associated tobacco smoking and indoor smoke with increased levels of some REEs in exposed residents. A body of literature has been focused on occupational REE exposures, with the observation of respiratory tract damage. The occupations related to REE mining and processing have shown REE bioaccumulation in scalp hair, excess REE urine levels, and defective gene expression. As for other REE occupational exposures, mention should be made of: a) jobs exposing to REE aerosol, such as movie operator; b) e-waste processing and, c) diesel engine repair and maintenance, with exposures to exhaust microparticulate (containing nanoCeO(2) as a catalytic additive). Diesel exhaust microparticulate has been studied in animal models, leading to evidence of several pathological effects in animals exposed by respiratory or systemic routes. A working hypothesis for REE occupational exposures is raised on REE-based supermagnet production and manufacture, by reviewing experimental studies that suggest several pathological effects of static magnetic fields, and warrant further investigations.

AB  - The use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to determine the elemental composition of bacterial cells has been described in the peer-reviewed literature since 2003. Fifteen years on, significant accomplishments have been reported that have served to clarify and underscore the areas of bacteriological investigation that LIBS is well-suited for as well as the challenges that yet remain to be faced. This review will attempt to summarize the state of the field by surveying the available body of knowledge. The early days of these experiments, roughly from 2003 to 2007, in which many of the most fundamental experiments were initially conducted will be described. The more in-depth investigations that followed in the subsequent decade will then be detailed. Many important aspects of performing LIBS on bacterial cells were reported on and are summarized here including: the use of chemometric algorithms for statistical classification of unknown spectra; the influence of the mounting substrate on classification; the effect of the testing gas atmosphere and the choice of bacterial cell growth nutrient medium on the measured LIBS spectrum; the efficacy of a LIBS-based test as a genus-level or strain-level discrimination test; the ability of LIBS to determine the cell titer or concentration of cells in the initial sample; the effects that possible contaminations or interferents within the sample would have on the LIBS spectrum; the influence that environmental stresses the cells may be exposed to during growth and the state of reproductive health of the cells could have on the LIBS spectrum; the use of standoff or remote apparatus to minimize the risk to the operators during bacteriological identification of unknown specimens; and the combination of other optical modalities with LIBS to enhance the sensitivity or specificity of identification. Lastly, tables are provided which summarize both every species of bacteria ever tested with LIBS as well as the major lessons learned by the community through 15 years of careful investigation.

   Method: We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to quantify the effect of ADHD on vagally-mediated heart rate variability (HRV). PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, were searched for case-control or cohort studies reporting measures of vagally-mediated HRV, after a task demand, among individuals with ADHD relative to healthy subjects.
   Results: Thirteen articles comprising a total of 869 patients with ADHD and 909 healthy participants were included. As compared to controls, ADHD patients had reduced vagally-mediated HRV, corresponding to a small effect size (Hedge's g = 0.20; CI 95% 0.01 to 0.40). Heterogeneity was high (Q (18) = 76.59, p < 0.001; I-2 = 77%). There was some evidence of small study effects. Task type, respiration rate assessment and associated comorbid disorders were statistically significant moderators.
   Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for the associations between ADHD and autonomic dysregulation. Future studies addressing HRV reactivity are needed.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major public health problem affecting 10-57% of adolescent mothers which can affect not only adolescent mothers but also their infants. Thus, there is a need for interventions to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers. However, recent systematic reviews have been focused on effective interventions to prevent PPD in adult mothers. These interventions may not necessarily be applicable for adolescent mothers. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of the existing interventions to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SCOPUS databases between January 2000 and March 2017 with English language and studies involving human subjects. Studies reporting on the outcomes of intervention to prevent PPD particularly in adolescent mothers were selected. Non-comparative studies were excluded. From 2002 identified records, 13 studies were included, reporting on 2236 adolescent pregnant women. The evidence from this systematic review suggests that 6 of 13 studies from both psychological and psychosocial interventions including (1) home-visiting intervention, (2) prenatal antenatal and postnatal educational program, (3) CBT psycho-educational, (4) the REACH program based on interpersonal therapy, and (5) infant massage training is successful in reducing rates of PPD symptoms in adolescent mothers in the intervention group than those mothers in the control group. These interventions might be considered for incorporation in antenatal care interventions for adolescent pregnant women. However, this review did not find evidence identifying the most effective intervention for preventing postpartum depression symptoms in adolescent mothers.

AB  - Educational neuroscience is an interdisciplinary research field that seeks to translate research findings on neural mechanisms of learning to educational practice and policy and to understand the effects of education on the brain. Neuroscience and education can interact directly, by virtue of considering the brain as a biological organ that needs to be in the optimal condition to learn ('brain health'); or indirectly, as neuroscience shapes psychological theory and psychology influences education. In this article, we trace the origins of educational neuroscience, its main areas of research activity and the principal challenges it faces as a translational field. We consider how a pure psychology approach that ignores neuroscience is at risk of being misleading for educators. We address the major criticisms of the field comprising, respectively, a priori arguments against the relevance of neuroscience to education, reservations with the current practical operation of the field and doubts about the viability of neuroscience methods for diagnosing disorders or predicting individual differences. We consider future prospects of the field and ethical issues it raises. Finally, we discuss the challenge of responding to the (welcome) desire of education policymakers to include neuroscience evidence in their policymaking, while ensuring recommendations do not exceed the limitations of current basic science.

TI  - A partnership for transforming mental health globally
KW  - BURDEN
AB  - The large and increasing burden of mental and substance use disorders, its association with social disadvantage and decreased economic output, and the substantial treatment gaps across country-income levels, are propelling mental health into the global spotlight. The inclusion of targets related to mental health and wellbeing in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, as well as several national and global initiatives that formed during the past 5 years, signal an increasing momentum toward providing appropriate financing for global mental health. Drawing on the organisational and financial architecture of two successful global health scale-up efforts (the fight against HIV/AIDS and the improvement of maternal and child health) and the organisational models that have emerged to finance these and other global health initiatives, we propose a multi-sectoral and multi-organisational Partnership for Global Mental Health to serve two main functions. First is the mobilisation of funds, including raising, pooling, disbursing, and allocating. Second is stewardship, including supporting countries to use funds effectively, evaluate results, and hold stakeholders accountable. Such a partnership would necessarily involve stakeholders from the mental health field, civil society, donors, development agencies, and country-level stakeholders, organised into hubs responsible for financing, scale-up, and accountability.

AB  - Cognitive screening instruments are influenced by education and/or culture. In Brazil, as illiteracy and low education rates are high, it is necessary to identify the screening tools with the highest diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objective: To identify the cognitive screening instruments applied in the Brazilian population with greater accuracy, to detect AD in individuals with a low educational level or who are illiterate. Methods: Systematic search in SciELO, PubMed and LILACS databases of studies that used cognitive screening tests to detect AD in older Brazilian adults with low or no education. Results: We found 328 articles and nine met the inclusion criteria. The identified instruments showed adequate or high diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: For valid cognitive screening it is important to consider sociocultural and educational factors in the interpretation of results. The construction of specific instruments for the low educated or illiterate elderly should better reflect the difficulties of the Brazilian elderly in different regions of the country.

AB  - Scientists have developed evidence-based interventions that improve the symptoms and functioning of youth with psychiatric disorders; however, these interventions are rarely used in community settings. Eliminating this research-to-practice gap is the purview of implementation science, the discipline devoted to the study of methods to promote the use of evidence-based practices in routine care. Methods: We review studies that have tested factors associated with implementation in child psychology and psychiatry, explore applications of social science theories to implementation, and conclude with recommendations to advance implementation science through the development and testing of novel, multilevel, causal theories. Results: During its brief history, implementation science in child psychology and psychiatry has documented the implementation gap in routine care, tested training approaches and found them to be insufficient for behavior change, explored the relationships between variables and implementation outcomes, and initiated randomized controlled trials to test implementation strategies. This research has identified targets related to implementation (e.g., clinician motivation, organizational culture) and demonstrated the feasibility of activating these targets through implementation strategies. However, the dominant methodological approach has been a theoretical and predictive, relying heavily on a set of variables from heuristic frameworks. Conclusions: Optimizing the implementation of effective treatments in community care for youth with psychiatric disorders is a defining challenge of our time. This review proposes a new direction focused on developing and testing integrated causal theories. We recommend implementation scientists: (a) move from observational studies of implementation barriers and facilitators to trials that include causal theory; (b) identify a core set of implementation determinants; (c) conduct trials of implementation strategies with clear targets, mechanisms, and outcomes; (d) ensure that behaviors that are core to EBPs are clearly defined; and (e) agree upon standard measures. This agenda will help fulfill the promise of evidence-based practice for improving youth behavioral health.

AB  - The number of biosafety evaluation studies of nanoparticles (NPs) using different biological models is increasing with the rapid development of nanotechnology. Thus far, nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), as a complete model organism, has become an important in vivo alternative assay system to assess the risk of NPs, especially at the environmental level. According to results of qualitative and quantitative analyses, it can be concluded that studies of nanoscientific research using C. elegans is persistently growing. However, the comprehensive conclusion and analysis of toxic effects of NPs in C. elegans are limited and chaotic. This review focused on the effects, especially sublethal ones, induced by NPs in C. elegans, including the development, intestinal function, immune response, neuronal function, and reproduction, as well as the underlying mechanisms of NPs causing these effects, including oxidative stress and alterations of several signaling pathways. Furthermore, we presented some factors that influence the toxic effects of NPs in C. elegans. The advantages and limitations of using nematodes in the nanotoxicology study were also discussed. Finally, we predicted that the application of C. elegans to assess long-term impacts of metal oxide NPs in the ecosystem would become a vital part of the nanoscientific research field, which provided an insight for further study.

AB  - Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that progresses with age, with an increasing number of symptoms. Some of the efforts to understand PD progression have been focusing on the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms, that generally include small molecular modifications to the DNA and histones that are essential for regulating gene activity. Here, we have pointed out difficulties to untangle genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and reviewed several studies that have aimed for untangling. Some of those have enabled more solid claims on independent roles for epigenetic mechanisms. Hereby, evidence that specific DNA hydroxymethylation, global hyperacetylation, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) dependent regulation of SNCA, one of the hallmark genes involved in PD, have become more prominent from the current perspective, than mechanisms that directly involve DNA methylation. In the absence of current epigenetic clinical targets to counteract PD progression, we also hypothesize how several mechanisms may affect local and global epigenetics in PD neurons, including inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy and DNA repair mechanisms which may lead to future therapeutic targets.

AB  - Available evidence suggests that individuals can enhance their ability to modulate brain activity in target regions, within the Emotion Regulation network, using fMRI-based neurofeedback. However, there is no systematic review that investigates the effectiveness of this method on amygdala modulation, a core region within this network. The major goal of this study was to systematically review and analyze the effects of real-time fMRI-Neurofeedback concerning the neuromodulation of the amygdala during Emotion Regulation training. A search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science with the following key terms: <<("neurofeedback" or "neuro feedback" or "neuro-feedback") and ("emotion regulation") and (fMRI OR "functional magnetic resonance"),>> and afterwards two additional searches were performed, replacing the term "emotion regulation" for "amygdala" and "neurofeedback" for "feedback." Of the 531 identified articles, only 19 articles reported results of amygdala modulation during Emotional Regulation training through rtfMRI-NF, using healthy participants or patients, in original research articles. The results, systematically reviewed here, provide evidence for amygdala's modulation during rtfMRI-NF training, although studies' heterogeneity precluded a quantitative meta-analysis-the included studies relied on different outcome measures to infer the success of neurofeedback intervention. Thus, a qualitative analysis was done instead. We identified critical features influencing inference on the quality of the intervention as: the inclusion of a Practice Run, a Transfer Run and a Control Group in the protocol, and to choose adequate Emotion Regulation strategies-in particular, the effective recall of autobiographic memories. Surprisingly, the Regulated vs. Control Condition was lacking in most of the studies, precluding valid inference of amygdala neuromodulation within Session. The best controlled studies nevertheless showed positive effects. The type of stimulus/interface did not seem critical for amygdala modulation. We also identified potential effects of lateralization of amygdala responses following Up-or Down-Regulation, and the impact of fMRI parameters for data acquisition and analysis. Despite qualitative evidence for amygdala modulation during rtfMRI-NF, there are still important limitations in the design of a clear conceptual framework of NF-training research. Future studies should focus on more homogeneous guidelines concerning design, protocol structure and, particularly, harmonized outcome measures to provide quantitative estimates of neuromodulatory effects in the amygdala.

AB  - To date, there is no cure or disease-modifying agents available for most well-known neurological disorders. Current therapy is typically focused on relieving symptoms and supportive care in improving the quality of life of affected patients. Furthermore, the traditional de novo drug discovery technique is more challenging, particularly for neurological disorders. Therefore, the repurposing of existing drugs for these conditions is believed to be an efficient and dynamic approach that can substantially reduce the investments spent on drug development. Currently, there is emerging evidence that suggests the potential effect of a beta-lactam antibiotic, ceftriaxone (CEF), to alleviate the symptoms of different experimentally-induced neurological disorders: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epileptic-seizure, brain ischemia, traumatic brain injuries, and neuropathic pain. CEF also affects the markers of oxidative status and neuroinflammation, glutamatergic systems as well as various aggregated toxic proteins involved in the pathogenesis of different neurological disorders. Moreover, it was found that CEF administration to drug dependent animal models improved the withdrawal symptoms upon drug discontinuation. Thus, this review aimed to describe the effects of CEF against multiple models of neurological illnesses, drug dependency, and withdrawal. It also emphasizes the possible mechanisms of neuroprotective actions of CEF with respective neurological maladies.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The causes of PD in humans are still unknown, although metabolic characteristics of the neurons affected by the disease have been implicated in their selective susceptibility. Mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostatic stress are recognized to be important in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic PD, and they both culminate in bioenergetic deficits. Exposure to calcium overload has recently emerged as a key determinant, and pharmacological treatment that inhibits Ca2+ entry diminishes neuronal damage in chemical models of PD. In this review, we first introduce general concepts on neuronal Ca2+ signaling and then summarize the current knowledge on fundamental properties of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons, on the role of the interplay between Ca2+ and dopamine signaling in neuronal activity and susceptibility to cell death. We also discuss the possible involvement of a "neglected" player, the Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS-1), which has been shown to participate to dopaminergic signaling by regulating dopamine dependent receptor desensitization in normal brain but, data supporting a direct role in PD pathogenesis are still missing. However, it is intriguing to speculate that the Ca2+-dependent modulation of NCS-1 activity could eventually counteract dopaminergic neurons degeneration.

AB  - Prosodic cues in speech are indispensable for comprehending a speaker's message, recognizing emphasis and emotion, parsing segmental units, and disambiguating syntactic structures. While it is commonly accepted that prosody provides a fundamental service to higher-level features of speech, the neural underpinnings of prosody processing are not clearly defined in the cognitive neuroscience literature. Many recent electrophysiological studies have examined speech comprehension by measuring neural entrainment to the speech amplitude envelope, using a variety of methods including phase-locking algorithms and stimulus reconstruction. Here we review recent evidence for neural tracking of the speech envelope and demonstrate the importance of prosodic contributions to the neural tracking of speech. Prosodic cues may offer a foundation for supporting neural synchronization to the speech envelope, which scaffolds linguistic processing. We argue that prosody has an inherent role in speech perception, and future research should fill the gap in our knowledge of how prosody contributes to speech envelope entrainment.

AB  - Hypoxia, triggered in large part by eutrophication, exerts widespread and expanding stress on coastal ecosystems. Hypoxia is often specifically defined as water having dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations < 2 mg L-1. However, DO concentration alone is insufficient to categorize hypoxic stress or predict impacts of hypoxia on zooplankton and fish. Hypoxic stress depends on the oxygen supply relative to metabolic demand. Water temperature controls both oxygen solubility and the metabolic demand of aquatic ectotherms. Accordingly, to assess impacts of hypoxia requires consideration of effects of temperature on both oxygen availability and animal metabolism. Temperature differences across ecosystems or across seasons or years within an ecosystem can dramatically impact the severity of hypoxia even at similar DO concentrations. Living under sub-optimum DO can reduce temperature-dependent metabolic efficiencies, prey capture efficiency, growth and reproductive potential, thus impacting production and individual zooplankton and fish fitness. Avoidance of hypoxic bottom water can reduce or eliminate low-temperature thermal refuges for organisms and increase energy demands and respiration rates, and potentially reduce overall fitness if alternative habitats are sub-optimal. Moreover, differential habitat shifts among species can shift predator-prey abundance ratios or interactions and thus modify food webs. For example, more tolerant zooplankton prey may use hypoxic waters as a refuge from fish predation. In contrast, zooplankton avoidance of hypoxic bottom waters can result in prey aggregations at oxyclines sought out by fish predators. Hypoxic conditions that affect spatial ecology can drive taxonomic and size shifts in the zooplankton community, affecting foraging, consumption and growth of fish. Advances in understanding the ecological effects of low DO waters on pelagic zooplankton and fish and comparisons among ecosystems will require development of generic models that estimate the oxygen demand of organisms in relation to oxygen supply which depends on both DO and temperature. We provide preliminary analysis of a metric (Oxygen Stress Level) which integrates oxygen demand in relation to oxygen availability for a coastal copepod and compare the prediction of oxygen stress to actual copepod distributions in areas with hypoxic bottom waters.

AB  - Recent studies clearly indicate that the endocrine function of the skeletal muscle is essential for a long and healthy life. Regular exercise, which has been shown to stimulate the release of myokines, lowers the risk of many diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, emphasizing the role of skeletal muscle in proper functioning of other tissues. In addition, exercise increases insulin sensitivity, which may also impact iron metabolism. Even though the role of iron in neurodegeneration is well established, the exact mechanisms of iron toxicity are not known. Interestingly, exercise has been shown to modulate iron metabolism, mainly by reducing body iron stores. Insulin signaling and iron metabolism are interconnected, as high tissue iron stores are associated with insulin resistance, and conversely, impaired insulin signaling may lead to iron accumulation in an affected tissue. Excess iron accumulation in tissue triggers iron-dependent oxidative stress. Further, iron overload in the skeletal muscle not only negatively affects muscle contractility but also might impact its endocrine function, thus possibly affecting the clinical outcome of diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss possible mechanisms of iron dependent oxidative stress in skeletal muscle, its impact on muscle mass and endocrine function, as well as on neurodegeneration processes.

AB  - Beginning in the first decade of the 21st centruy, there was a growing disregard for the benefits of the German medical system concerning the junior obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYN) job situation. As in other fields of medicine, numerous colleagues left Germany to work in other countries such as the United Kingdom, Noway, Sweden, or Switzerland. According to studies, financial factors represent one of the reasons for the discontent. We here present a practical descriptive approach to assess/review the actual compensation of single work tasks of OB/GYNs on the basis of previously published, existing data. Using the workflow data from the Medical work Assessment in German hospitals (MAGRO) platform of twenty junior OB/GYNs with an average workday of 9:24:35h (SD=01:05:07h), a large scale data analysis of 2,325,556 different time points was performed to calculate the financial valuation of single work tasks. In order to assess the evolution over the past years, different modern and historic (e.g. AiP) pay scales were used and analysed in relation to the actual work on a weekly, monthly and per annum basis. Our review shows that there has been a dramatic increase in the financial reward of the practical work tasks of junior OB/GYN physicians in German hospitals in comparison to the situation of the early 2000s years. In this respect, it can not be further argued that the German system has large disadvantages concerning the payment of junior doctors in comparison to other European countries.

AB  - Statins, which are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia, have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. These are thought to be responsible for the potential effects of statins on various psychiatric disorders. In this study, we comprehensively review the literature to investigate the effects of statins on various psychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and dementia. In addition, we review adverse effects and drug interactions of statins to give clinically useful information guiding statin use in the psychiatric field. Statins seem useful in reducing depression, particularly in patients with physical disorders such as cardiovascular disease. In patients with schizophrenia, negative symptoms may be reduced by adjuvant statin therapy. Studies on cohorts at risk for dementia have generally shown protective effects of statins, while those on treatment for dementia show inconsistent results. In conclusion, statins used in combination with conventional psychotropic medications may be effective for various psychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and dementia. Further study is required to determine optimal doses and duration of statin use for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: Mental State Examination (MSE) is compared with physical examination as a reliable method of objective data investigation. There is a growing concern with psychiatric clinics, nosology, and the reliability of diagnostic interview methods as a source of valid diagnostic strategy. Efforts to achieve an international diagnosis protocol have been unsuccessful or polemical. This paper focuses on psychopathology, MSE, and mental function development within Brazilian psychiatry over the last few decades.
   Methods: Searches, interviews, and narrative reviews were done to look for systematic ways in which to conduct MSE, mental functions, symptom clusters, orientations about data observation and records. Brazilian psychopathology textbooks were examined, if they provided access to consolidated knowledge on psychopathology examination.
   Results: Sixteen textbooks were selected from a 49 year span. Descriptive psychopathology with phenomenological orientation was the primary trend in the MSE. Concepts derived fromdifferent traditions, most lacking common terminology, suggested some divergence among authors. Recommendations for patient observation and how to collect objective data was clear, but MSE standardization efforts were missing. A detailed description of mental function abnormalities was the main MSE record strategy, without consensus about ways to summarize and record this data. In an examination summary, mental strata was divided into "mental functions," and MSE subsets were frequent. All authors considered the following mental functions: consciousness, perception, thought, memory, attention, orientation, and volition.
   Discussion: Psychiatric competence demands MSE proficiency. Official documents are not clear about performance and recording standards. MSE data was usually recorded through descriptive psychopathology. A shift from detailed descriptive findings, to an array of observed pathological elements, described through a mental function checklist was observed over time. Clinical practice and research guidelines should consider the development of reliable MSE practices; however, it has been neglected by modern psychiatry/neuroscience through the excessive emphasis on interview protocols. Better MSE practices, and the improvement of bedside skill in psychiatry are necessary and depend on the recovery of psychopathological debates and semiological reasoning, which will allow the return of phenomenology-oriented "observational" techniques.

AB  - In reviewing the preceding articles, I emphasize the predominance of relational theories in the study of development as a way of demonstrating the evolutionary and relational extremity of reactive attachment disorder (RAD). The lack (or distortion?) of mutuality, RAD's defining feature, has implications for all aspects of development, not least of which is self-regulation. I review each article in this special issue, emphasizing important features, integrating across studies, expanding their links to attachment theory, and recommending future directions. Finally, I conduct two meta-analyses of the samples in this special issue, one meta-analysis addressing convergent validity of RAD assessment instrumentation developed by authors represented here and the other addressing the links between RAD and internalizing and externalizing behaviors. This special issue exploits the disaggregation of reactive attachment and disinhibited social engagement disorders to move the field forward in remarkable ways, both methodologically and substantively.

AB  - Background: Recent models of eating disorders (EDs) have proposed social and emotional difficulties as key factors in the development and maintenance of the illness. While a number of studies have demonstrated difficulties in theory of mind and emotion recognition, little is known about empathic abilities in those with EDs. Further, few studies have examined the cognitive-affective empathy profile in EDs. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide a synthesis of empathy studies in EDs, and examine whether those with EDs differ from healthy controls (HC) on self-reported total, cognitive, and affective empathy.
   Methods: Electronic databases were systematically searched for studies using self-report measures of empathy in ED populations. In total, 17 studies were identified, 14 of which could be included in the total empathy meta-analysis. Eight of the 14 studies were included in the cognitive and affective empathy meta-analyses.
   Results: Meta-analyses showed that while total empathy and affective empathy scores did not differ between those with anorexia nervosa (AN) and HC, those with AN had significantly lower cognitive empathy scores compared to HCs (small effect size). Meta-analyses of Interpersonal Reactivity Index sub-scores revealed that AN had significantly lower Fantasy scores than HC (small effect size), indicating that those with AN have more difficulty in identifying themselves with fictional characters. Only 3 studies examined empathy in those with bulimia nervosa (BN) or binge eating disorder (BED).
   Conclusions: The lowered cognitive empathy and intact affective empathy profile found in AN is similar to that found in other psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These findings add to the literature characterizing the socio-emotional phenotype in EDs. Future research should examine the influence of comorbid psychopathology on empathy in EDs.

KW  - SEXUAL ASSAULT
AB  - This exploratory systematic literature review aimed to characterise the current evidence on psychological management intervention guidelines for use with rape survivors with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. For the data searches we accessed the following electronic databases: Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, and PsychInfo. We utilised search terms with variations of the following key words: psychological management guidelines of PTSD*, rape survivors*. Inclusion criteria were guidelines for rape survivors with PTSD that consider referral, treatment, and preventive and health promotion in an international setting. We excluded guidelines that did not address PTSD resulting from rape in an international setting. We employed a narrative synthesis data analysis approach to integrate the evidence from across studies. Findings suggest prevalent guidelines for rape survivors with PTSD focus on cognitive behavioural therapy and other psychological management interventions in highly specialised areas and Primary Health Care (PHC) settings in international countries, but not in other countries such as South Africa. Emerging guidelines are needed for PTSD psychological management interventions in rape care clinics situated in South Africa.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) has been identified as one of the most toxic nonradioactive materials known to man. Although mercury is a naturally occurring element, anthropogenic mercury is now a major worldwide concern and is an international priority toxic pollutant. It also comprises one of the primary constituents of dental amalgam fillings. Even though dental mercury amalgams have been used for almost two centuries, its safety has never been tested or proven in the United States by any regulatory agency. There has been an ongoing debate regarding the safety of its use since 1845, and many studies conclude that its use exposes patients to troublesome toxicity. In this review, we present in an objective way the danger of dental amalgam to human health based on current knowledge. This dilemma is addressed in terms of an integrated toxicological approach by focusing on four mayor issues to show how these interrelate to create the whole picture: (1) the irrefutable constant release of mercury vapor from dental amalgams which is responsible for individual chronic exposure, (2) the evidence of organic mercury formation from dental amalgam in the oral cavity, (3) the effect of mercury exposure on gene regulation in human cells which supports the intrinsic genetic susceptibility to toxicant and, finally, (4) the availability of recent epidemiological data supporting the link of dental amalgams to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson.

The aim of this review is to examine the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation at reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents. Medline, Cinahl +, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Embase were searched for trials investigating the effects of omega-3 supplementation in children and adolescents with ADHD. The primary outcome measure was a mean difference in Conners' rating scale (CRS) between the intervention and placebo group. Search terms used include ADHD, omega-3, fish oils, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acids, alpha-linolenic acid and Conners' rating scale. Randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation in children and adolescents as measured by CRS were included. Studies using a combination of polyunsaturated fatty acids or any other rating scale were excluded. Seven trials were included in this review, totalling 926 participants. We found no evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity between trials. Overall, there was a slightly greater reduction in CRS score in favour of the experiment group. One study found a greater reduction in score in favour of the placebo group. Neither findings were statistically significant. There is little supportive evidence to validate the claim of omega-3 supplementation to reduce the degree of ADHD symptoms experienced by children and adolescents. Both experiment and control groups saw similar reductions in Conners rating scale score.

AB  - The nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2) is a master transcription factor that regulates oxidative stress-related genes containing the antioxidant response element (ARE) in their promoters. The damaged function and altered localization of NRF2 are found in most neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurodegenerative diseases developed from various risk factors such as accumulated oxidative stress and genetic and environmental elements. NRF2 activation protects our bodies from detrimental stress by upregulating antioxidative defense pathway, inhibiting inflammation, and maintaining protein homeostasis. NRF2 has emerged as a new therapeutic target in AD. Indeed, recent studies revealed that NRF2 activators have therapeutic effects in AD animal models and in cultured human cells that express AD pathology. This review will focus on the NRF2 pathway and the role of NRF2 in AD and suggest some NRF2 inducers as therapeutic agents for AD.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons from substantia nigra pars compacta of basal ganglia caused due to gene mutation, misfolded protein aggregation, reactive oxygen species generation and inflammatory stress. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons results in muscle stiffness, uncoordinated body movements, sleep disturbance, fatigue, amnesia and impaired voice. Currently, levodopa (L-DOPA) administration is the most widely used therapy for PD. But prolonged administration of L-DOPA is associated with the symptoms of dyskinesia. However, emerging evidences suggest the role of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) in curtailing the progression of PD by activating neuroprotective pathways. Hence, cannabinoid therapy could be a promising alternative to combat PD in future. In the present review we have discussed the potential role of CBRs in attenuating the key mechanisms of PD and how the existing research gaps needs to be bridged in order to understand the molecular mechanism of CBRs in detail.

AB  - Background. Ahistory of childhood abusemay affect people's health and criminal justice system involvement. Understanding the prevalence of childhood abuse among individuals in prison is important to inform effective and appropriate correctional services.
   Objectives. To review and summarize data on the prevalence of childhood abuse among people experiencing imprisonment in Canada.
   Search Methods. We searched for studies in bibliographic indexes, reference lists, and gray literature, and we consulted experts.
   Selection Criteria. We included studies published since 1987 that reported data on prevalence of a history of abuse before the age of 18 years among people in Canadian prisons, including any abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect.
   Data Collection and Analysis. Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts for eligibility and reviewed full texts for eligibility. Analyses included summary estimates and meta-regression with random effects.
   Main Results. The search identified 1429 records. Weincluded 34 unique studies in our review and 29 nonoverlapping studies in our meta-analysis. The summary prevalence for any type of childhood abuse was 65.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 52.6, 77.7; range = 56.2% to 75.0%) among women; only one study reported the prevalence among men (35.5%). The summary prevalence of sexual abuse was 50.4% (95% CI = 33.5, 67.2; range = 9.9% to 77.3%) among women and 21.9% (95% CI = 15.7, 28.8; range = 8.3% to 55.6%) among men. The prevalence of neglect was 51.5% (95% CI = 43.1, 59.7; range = 45.5% to 65.1%) among women and 42.0% (95% CI = 12.7, 74.6; range = 6.8% to 99.0%) among men. The prevalence of physical abuse was 47.7% (95% CI = 41.3, 54.0; range = 16.3% to 83.0%), and the prevalence of emotional abuse was 51.5% (95% CI = 34.8, 67.9; range = 8.7% to 96.0%); we did not find differences according to gender. Prevalence estimates for all types of abuse showed high and unexplained variability across studies.
   Conclusions. Half of people in prisons in Canada experienced abuse in childhood.
   Public Health Implications. Prisons should incorporate traumainformed approaches. Research is required to understand the association between a history of childhood abuse and criminal justice system involvement and to prevent childhood abuse and mitigate its adverse effects.

AB  - Objectives: Repetitive transcranialmagnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an innovative therapeutic option in major depressive disorder (MDD). A complete description of the procedure in reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is a prerequisite for implementation of rTMS in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the completeness of descriptions of the intervention in RCTs assessing rTMS in MDD.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review of RCTs evaluating rTMS in MDD and published until August 2016. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane library, and PsycINFO to identify eligible trials. The completeness of the intervention description was evaluated by the use of an adapted-to-rTMS version of the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist. We defined core items that are the most essential to be reported. Missing information was then sought from additional sources and by e-mailing authors.
   Results: We identified 98 trials reporting 134 interventions. None of the interventions were completely described in the full text of the articles, even after searching additional sources. After contacting the authors, 14 (10.4%) of 134 interventions were completely described. The core items were completely described in 74 (55.2%) of 134 interventions after contacting the authors.
   Conclusions: We found that rTMS interventions delivered in RCTs are incompletely reported, which prevents their adequate implementation in clinical practice and accurate interpretation of their efficacy. We encourage authors, editors, and reviewers to use the existing reporting guidelines and specifically the TIDieR checklist when describing the intervention. We provide an adapted-to-rTMS TIDieR checklist that could help in the reporting of future trials.

AB  - Given the moderate efficacy of the currently available antidepressants (ADs) in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), the identification of agents that are both able to enhance the effectiveness of ADs and have a good safety profile is a reasonable task for current psychopharmacology. In addition to the well-known drugs (second-generation antipsychotics, levothyroxine, dopaminergic agents, etc.) for augmentation, investigations suggest that several nutraceuticals and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs may be effective and safe as adjunct therapeutic agents to conventional ADs. To identify such active ingredients we first performed a systematic literature search using PubMed and then conducted both backward and forward citation searches. For the PubMed search, we used the following combinations of keywords: 1) "adjunctive" + "therapy" + "antidepressant"; 2) "add-on" + "therapy" + "antidepressant"; 3) "supplementation" + "therapy" + "antidepressant". As a result of those efforts, we found more than 20 agents (e.g. S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine; folate; omega-3 fatty acids; curcumin; N-acetylcysteine; saffron; 5-hydroxytryptophan; NSAIDs) that are supposedly effective in the augmentation of standard AD treatment. We discussed the possible mechanisms of the antidepressant actions of those agents, as well as the preclinical and clinical evidence for their efficacy as stand-alone and adjunct treatments for MDD.

AB  - The idea of family homes (FH) was that to create an alternative to orphanages. FH are now seen as a solution to the care problems of children whose parents are unable, unwilling, or judged by the legal system as unfit to care for them. Their aim is to help children regain hope and faith in life. Ideally, FH should help children rebuild a healthy relationship with their biological families or, when not possible, they should make the process of adoption as smooth as possible. FH should be a place of transit, a kind of "parking" of foster care temporarily on hold.

AB  - Objectives: (1) To explore stressors affecting midlife adults and understand their impact on health behaviors and the development of chronic medical conditions; (2) To identify midlife-specific interventions that mitigate the impact of stressors on the health of this population. Methods: We searched the PubMed database from inception to December 2017 using the search terms [mid-life] and [midlife] paired with related behaviors and conditions. Eligible articles provided data on: (1) sources of stress and effects on health behaviors, (2) development of chronic medical conditions, or (3) midlife interventions targeting health-related stressors or behaviors. We also reviewed the references of articles found in the initial search to identify additional articles. We included studies not focused on midlife for comparison. Results: This review revealed that interpersonal stress (e.g., caregiving and loneliness), occupational stress, and financial stress are highly prevalent in midlife and have a substantial impact on the health and health behaviors of this population. Many of these stressors converge, intensifying associated distress and health impact. Although not always targeted specifically to this population, interventions focused on diminishing these stressors have showed promising results, particularly group interventions and those focused on positive psychological well-being and mindfulness. Conclusion: Midlife is a large and growing population at high risk for chronic medical conditions. Specific stressors during this period are negatively associated with health outcomes. Further research is needed on midlife-specific interventions focused on mitigating these stressors, as such interventions have the potential to improve quality of life and promote health in this significant and vulnerable segment of society.

AB  - Background Over the past two decades new and key randomized controlled trials have reported the efficacy, clinical and cost effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments for adolescents with major depression. Methods The literature was searched through pubmed, psychinfo, scopus and web of science for randomized controlled trials of current major depression together with meta-analyses and systematic reviews of trials between 2000 and 2017. Those specific to the adolescent years (11-18 years) were taken as the primary source for this narrative review. Additional selected studies in adults were used to illustrate methodological issues. Results Manualized psychological therapies and the SSRI fluoxetine are more effective than active placebo in the treatment of major depressions. Mild to moderate illnesses attending community-based services are likely to benefit from psychological treatment alone. Moderately to severely ill patients attending clinic and hospital services are likely to benefit from monotherapies or combining psychological and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants carry a small but significant side-effect risk including increased suicidality. Side effects from psychotherapies are somewhat lower but specific negative consequences remain less well characterized. There is some evidence that CBT-based approaches prevent onset of major depression episode in well adolescents at high-risk. Other psychological interventions have not been adequately studied. There has been only limited identification of treatment moderators and no clear understanding of therapeutic mechanisms. Conclusions There is now a range of clinically effective treatments for depressed adolescents. Future research needs to reveal moderators of and mechanisms for individual differences to treatment response, determine psychotherapies of value for milder depressions, enhance our understanding of safety and side-effects for all treatments, and consider how to reduce and treat treatment-resistant cases.

AB  - Burgeoning research on the well-being of young people in recent years has made it difficult to identify conceptual gaps in the literature. We conducted a review of South African research in this area to better understand the use and measurement of the construct, as well as factors associated with it. The search of multiple databases identified 28 studies published in academic journals between 2000 and 2016. Within this period, studies that referred to well-being and its related subjective components varied significantly in terms of how they defined and operationalised these constructs, resulting in a fragmented body of work. The review highlights the need for a coherent research agenda in this area given the centrality of well-being research in promoting optimal outcomes in young people. Recommendations for strengthening South African research in this area are provided.

AB  - Aims To systematically review studies from Irish prisons that estimate the prevalence of major mental illness, alcohol and substance misuse, and homelessness at the time of committal. Methods Healthcare databases were searched for studies quantifying the point prevalence for each outcome of interest. Searches were augmented by scanning of bibliographies and searches of governmental and non-governmental websites. Proportional meta-analyses were completed for each outcome. Results We found eight, six and five studies quantifying the point prevalence of major mental illness, substance misuse, and homelessness respectively. Considerable heterogeneity was found for each subgroup (except psychosis where substantial heterogeneity was observed) and random effects models were used to calculate pooled percentages. The pooled percentage for psychotic disorder was 3.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-4.2%], for affective disorder 4.3% (95% CI 2.1-7.1%), for alcohol use disorder 28.3% (95% CI 19.9-37.4%), for substance use disorder 50.9% (95% CI 37.6-64.2%) and for those who were homeless on committal 17.4% (95% CI 8.7-28.4%). Conclusions Estimates for the prevalence of psychotic illness and substance abuse amongst Irish prisoners are in keeping with international estimates of morbidity in prisons, whilst those for affective disorders are lower. The prevalence of homelessness in committal to Irish prisons is higher than some international estimates. Rates for psychoses, alcohol and substance misuse as well as homelessness in Irish prisons are significantly higher than the general population prevalence of these vulnerabilities. A need for service development is discussed.

AB  - In the last decade, the field of consumer neuroscience, or neuromarketing, has been flourishing, with numerous publications, academic programs, initiatives, and companies. The demand for objective neural measures to quantify consumers' preferences and predict responses to marketing campaigns is ever on the rise, particularly due to the limitations of traditional marketing techniques, such as questionnaires, focus groups, and interviews. However, research has yet to converge on a unified methodology or conclusive results that can be applied in the industry. In this review, we present the potential of electroencephalography (EEG)-based preference prediction. We summarize previous EEG research and propose features which have shown promise in capturing the consumers' evaluation process, including components acquired from an event-related potential design, inter-subject correlations, hemispheric asymmetry, and various spectral band powers. Next, we review the latest findings on attempts to predict preferences based on various features of the EEG signal. Finally, we conclude with several recommended guidelines for prediction. Chiefly, we stress the need to demonstrate that neural measures contribute to preference prediction beyond what traditional measures already provide. Second, prediction studies in neuromarketing should adopt the standard practices and methodology used in data science and prediction modeling that is common in other fields such as computer science and engineering.

AB  - Understanding factors that contribute towards physical activity and diet outcomes are important for health improvement in people with severe mental illness. Cross-sectional findings on factors associated with diet and physical activity outcomes provide limited information on what predicts changes or long-term outcomes in lifestyle behaviours in people with severe mental illness. A systematic review was therefore conducted to identify prospective studies with quantitative data on baseline factors associated with follow-up diet or physical activity related outcomes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus and grey literature databases were searched from inception to March 2018. From 6921 studies, 5 were eligible for physical activity related outcomes and 2 for diet related outcomes. The follow-up duration was 4 weeks to 24 months and participants were mostly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Older age was commonly related to better physical activity related outcomes, whilst higher negative symptoms were related to poorer-related outcomes. Physical activity intentions and gender were unrelated to physical activity outcomes. There was a lack of data on factors influencing dietary outcomes. Although there were some common factors predictive of physical activity including older age and negative symptoms, more high-quality research is needed to determine the effect of sociodemographic, mental health, social, clinical, lifestyle and other factors on both physical activity and dietary outcomes.

AB  - Groundwater in arid/semiarid regions plays crucial roles in providing drinking water supply, supporting irrigated agriculture, and sustaining important native terrestrial ecosystems. Groundwater depth controls water availability to vegetation and is essential for conserving groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems. Environmental groundwater depth can be defined as a mean depth or a range of depths, satisfying the growth of natural vegetation that is not under stress, either due to lack of water or anoxia or soil salinization. Five methodologies have been reported to estimate environmental groundwater depth: the direct ones rely on response functions that relate vegetation condition, e.g., physiological parameters, appearance frequency, community structure, and remotely sensed physical indexes, to changes in groundwater depth; the indirect one estimates environmental groundwater depth based on the threshold of soil moisture content. To fill a knowledge gap of unique recognized methodology, a conceptual framework was proposed, which involves initial estimation (data collection, response assessment, and estimation) and feedback adjustment (implementation and modification). A key component of the framework is to quantify the linkage between ecological conditions and geohydrological features. This review may provide references for groundwater resources management, ecological conservation, and sustainable development in arid/semiarid regions.

AB  - Objective Young adulthood is an important transitional life phase where careers are established. Young adults with chronic disabling health conditions are underrepresented in the labour market. Our study aims to examine the effectiveness of work-focused interventions that support the labour market transition of young adults with chronic disabling health conditions; and to examine whether the effectiveness of work-focused interventions differ across work transition phase (eg, preparation, entry and sustaining work, employment advancement) and disability type.
   Methods A systematic review of articles published between January 1990 and July 2018 was conducted. Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo were searched, and titles/abstracts and full texts of articles were reviewed for eligibility. Relevant articles were appraised for methodological quality. A best evidence synthesis was applied to medium-quality/high-quality studies to develop recommendations.
   Results 5816 articles were identified; 10 articles were relevant and of moderate-high methodological quality. Six intervention categories were identified which focused on young adults with mental health or intellectual/learning disabilities (n=3) and addressed employment preparation (n=10) and/or work entry (n=9). No interventions addressed at-work issues or career advancement. Strong evidence existed for tailored supported employment (SE) interventions having a positive impact on preparation and entry into competitive employment. Also, moderate evidence existed for the positive impact of SE on preparation and entry into competitive employment for young adults with mental health conditions.
   Conclusions Tailored SE is recommended to foster preparation and entry into the labour market. Evidence-based interventions are needed to facilitate sustained work and career advancement of young adults living with different disabling health conditions.

AB  - Introduction Experimental studies and clinical observations have shown that stress can damage hepatic tissue both directly and indirectly. Many studies have partially revealed the contributors of stress-induced liver injury; however, the whole process has not yet been uncovered. This review aims to summarize the mechanisms that have been proposed to be involved. Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMed () in its entirety up to March 2018, and analyzed the animal-derived mechanistic studies on stress-induced liver injury. Results The liver is the organ that meets and filters a mass of alien material, and then maintains immune tolerance under physiological conditions. Under stress conditions, however, immune tolerance is interrupted, which results in the induction of inflammation in the liver. Contributors to this process can be categorized as follows: hypoxia-reoxygenation, over-activation of Kupffer cells and oxidative stress, influx of gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and norepinephrine, and over-production of stress hormones and activation of the sympathetic nerve. Conclusions Psychological stress is associated with a variety of pathological conditions resulting in liver injury through multiple systems, including the sympathetic nervous and adrenocortical system. Mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon is important for the clinical practice of managing patients with hepatic disorders and should be explored further in the future.

AB  - The Sudbury region of northeastern Ontario, Canada, provides one of the world's best examples of the resilience of aquatic ecosystems after reductions in atmospheric contaminant deposition. Thousands of lakes around the Sudbury metal smelters were badly damaged by acid deposition. Lakes closest to the smelters were also contaminated by metal particulates. However, large reductions in atmospheric SO2 and metal emissions starting in the early 1970s have led to widespread chemical improvements in these lakes, and recovery has been observed for various aquatic biota. Studies of Sudbury-area lakes are advancing our understanding of chemical and biological lake recovery; however, recovery is a complicated process and much remains to be learned. Biological recovery has often been slow to follow chemical recovery, and it has become apparent that the recovery of lakes from acidification is closely linked to interactions with other large-scale environmental stressors like climate change and Ca declines. Thus, in our multiple-stressor world, recovery may not bring individual lakes back to their exact former state. However, with time, substantial natural biological recovery toward typical lake communities can be reasonably expected for most but not necessarily all biota. For organisms with limited dispersal ability, particularly fish, human assistance may be necessary to re-establish typical communities. In lakes where food webs have been severely altered, re-establishment of typical diverse fish communities may in fact be an important element aiding the recovery of other important components of aquatic ecosystems including zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates. In the lakes closest to the smelters, where historically watersheds as well as lakes were severely damaged, the recovery of aquatic systems will be closely linked to ongoing terrestrial recovery and rehabilitation, particularly through the benefits of increased inputs of terrestrially derived organic matter. The dramatic lake recovery observed in the Sudbury area points to a brighter future for these lakes. However, continued monitoring will be needed to determine future changes and help guide the management and protection of Sudbury-area lakes in this multiple-stressor age.

AB  - ObjectivesTo review the empirical evidence of a potential association between parental trauma and parental child abuse.MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, 4645 publications were identified through a systematic search in PubMed, PsycINFO and Cochrane. The final number of publications included was 15. Results The prevalence of child abuse was found to be consistently higher in populations exposed to traumatic events (prevalence range 36.0-97.5%) compared with non-exposed groups. Parents exposed to trauma were more likely to abuse their children in all studies, and trauma severity, including a PTSD diagnosis in parents, was associated with perpetration of child abuse in most studies. Such associations appeared to be independent of the type of traumatic event. The findings underscore that trauma does not only affect the individual, but also the family.ConclusionsParental trauma seems to be associated with perpetration of child abuse within the family. Abusive behavior against children could be a potential trauma reaction, which should be considered in preventive strategies aimed at reducing harm in traumatized families.

AB  - Background Engaging in public health activities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, also known as North Korea) offers a means to improve population health for its citizens and the wider region. Such an engagement requires an understanding of current and future needs.
   Methods We conducted a systematic search of five English and eight Korean language databases to identify available literature published between 1988 and 2017. A narrative review of evidence was conducted for five major categories (health systems, communicable diseases (CDs), non-communicable diseases (NCDs), injuries, and reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) and nutrition).
   Findings We found 465 publications on the DPRK and public health. Of the 253 articles that addressed major disease categories, we found under-representation of publications relative to proportion of disease burden for the two most significant causes: NCDs (54.5% publications vs 72.6% disability adjusted life years (DALYs)) and injuries (0.4% publications vs 12.1% DALYs), in comparison to publications on the third and fourth largest disease burdens, RMNCH and nutrition (30.4% publications vs 8.6% DALYs) and CDs (14.6% publications vs 6.7% DALYs) which were over-represented. Although most disease category articles were on NCDs, the majority of NCD articles addressed mental health of refugees. Only 165 articles addressed populations within the DPRK and among these, we found publication gaps on social and environmental determinants of health, CDs, and NCDs.
   Conclusion There are gaps in the public health literature on the DPRK. Future research should focus on understudied, significant burdens of disease. Moreover, establishing more precise estimates of disease burden and their distribution, as well as analysis on health systems responses aimed at addressing them, can result in improvements in population health.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a multi-system neurodegenerative disease where approximately 90% of cases are idiopathic. The remaining 10% of the cases can be traced to a genetic origin and research has largely focused on these associated genes to gain a better understanding of the molecular and cellular pathogenesis for PD. The gene encoding vacuolar protein sorting protein 35 (VPS35) has been definitively linked to late onset familial PD following the identification of a point mutation (D620N) as the causal agent in a Swiss family. Since its discovery, numerous studies have been undertaken to characterize the role of VPS35 in cellular processes and efforts have been directed toward understanding the perturbations caused by the D620N mutation. In this review, we examine what is currently known about VPS35, which has pleiotropic effects, as well as proposed mechanisms of pathogenesis by the D620N mutation. A brief survey of other VPS35 polymorphisms is also provided. Lastly, model systems that are being utilized for these investigations and possible directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - After its discovery in 2000, the notion grew that neuroglobin, a neuronal specific heme protein, is involved in cytoprotection. To date, neuroglobin levels have been positively correlated with a beneficial outcome in a plethora of neurotoxic insults, e.g., ischemic and traumatic brain injuries and Alzheimer's disease. The first part of this review goes further into these changes of neuroglobin expression upon different neuronal insults as well as the underlying regulation. In the second part, we shed light on the mechanisms by which neuroglobin contributes to neuroprotection, being (i) the scavenging and detoxification of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, (ii) the augmentation of the threshold for apoptosis initiation, (iii) its contribution to an anti-inflammatory milieu, and (iv) tissue regeneration. We also consider different neuroglobin models to address as yet unanswered questions. Based on the recent findings and progress in the field, we invigorate the avenues of neuroglobin in neurological ailments to increase in the coming years.

AB  - Introduction Patients with schizophrenia have an elevated mortality risk compared to the general population, with cardiovascular-related deaths being the leading cause. The role of clozapine use in the long-term mortality risk is unclear. While clozapine treatment may increase the risk for cardiovascular mortality, it may have protective effects regarding suicidal behavior.
   Methods We systematically searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO and reviewed studies that used a long-term follow-up (ie, >52 weeks) and reported on mortality in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who had received clozapine treatment.
   Results Altogether, 24 studies reported on 1327 deaths from any causes during 217691 patient years in patients treated with clozapine. The unadjusted mortality rate in 22 unique samples during a follow-up of 1.1-12.5 (median = 5.4) years was 6.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.4-7.9) per 1000 patient years. Long-term, crude mortality rate ratios were not significantly lower in patients ever treated with clozapine during follow-up, but significantly lower in patients continuously treated with clozapine compared to patients with other antipsychotics (mortality rate ratio = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.36-0.85, P-value = .007). Few studies reported on rates of long-term cause-specific mortality (suicide and ischemic heart disease), which showed no significant difference in patients using clozapine compared to patients using other antipsychotics. Statistical heterogeneity was high in all analyses.
   Discussion Continuous clozapine treatment in schizophrenia patients was associated with a significantly lower long-term all-cause mortality rate compared to other antipsychotic use. These findings, combined with the known efficacy of clozapine, give reason to re-evaluate the hesitancy to prescribe clozapine in regular care settings.

AB  - The market for direct-to-consumer brain health products-including brain-training games, neurostimulation devices, and consumer electroencephalography (EEG) devices-is expected to top $3 billion by 2020. While many direct-to-consumer neurotechnology products have come under scrutiny from scientists and regulators, one set of products-consumer EEG devices-have largely escaped scholarly and regulatory critique. While these products do not present overt safety risks, by claiming to provide individuals with "snapshots" of their own mental states, they present a subtle, and arguably more complex, set of ethical issues. In addition, consumer EEG companies often explicitly or implicitly rely on studies conducted in the field of neurofeedback, a domain in which almost all adequately controlled studies point to little more than an interesting placebo effect. This paper presents an initial critique of consumer EEG devices, focusing only on devices that are marketed directly to consumers for improving their well-being. We categorize the behavioral and wellness-related marketing claims made by consumer EEG companies, analyze the evidence base for such claims, and argue that the ethical and legal issues wrought by these devices deserve greater attention.

AB  - Attending and receiving a result from screening can be an anxious process. Using an appropriate method to deliver screening results could improve communication and reduce negative outcomes for screening attendees. Screening programmes are increasingly communicating results by letter or telephone rather than in-person. We investigated the impact of communication methods on attendees.
   We systematically reviewed the literature on the communication methods used to deliver results in cancer screening programmes for women, focusing on screening attendee anxiety, understanding of results and preferences for results communication. We included qualitative and quantitative research. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Embase. Results were analysed using framework synthesis. 10,558 papers were identified with seven studies meeting the inclusion criteria.
   Several key ideas emerged from the synthesis including speed, accuracy of results, visual support, ability to ask questions, privacy of results location and managing expectations.
   Verbal communication methods (telephone and in-person) were preferred and facilitated greater understanding than written methods, although there was considerable variability in attendee preferences. Findings for anxiety were mixed, with no clear consensus on which method of communication might minimise attendee anxiety.
   The low number of identified studies and generally low quality evidence suggest we do not know the most appropriate communication methods in the delivery of cancer screening results. More research is needed to directly compare methods of results communication, focusing on what impact each method may have on screening attendees.

AB  - The knowledge of the level density is necessary for understanding nuclear reactions involving excited nuclear states. In particular, it is an important element in description of astrophysical processes and in technological applications. This review article explains main ideas of physics forming the level density in complex nuclei that grows very fast due to combinatorial complexity of total excitation energy shared by many constituents. This can be translated into a language of statistical physics by the Darwin-Fowler method. We briefly go through the historical development from the nuclear Fermi-gas model to the self-consistent mean field including the pairing effects. At the next step we introduce the ideas of thermalization in a closed mesoscopic system and quantum chaos with very complicated eigenfunctions. This is supported by the experience of the shell model in a limited orbital space that either provides an exact solution or uses the Monte Carlo approach. The statistical method of moments allows one to avoid the exact diagonalization keeping intact the quality of the results. We discuss the popular "constant temperature model" that describes well available data and the shell-model results; it is shown that its success cannot be explained by the phase transition from superfluid to a normal phase. The interpretation is suggested, supported by the numerical studies, in terms of dynamical chaotization including the collective enhancement of the level density. The role of incoherent collision-like interactions is stressed as a necessary element of the thermalization process. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Clusterin (CLU) or APOJ is a multifunctional glycoprotein that has been implicated in several physiological and pathological states, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). With a prominent extracellular chaperone function, additional roles have been discussed for clusterin, including lipid transport and immune modulation, and it is involved in pathways common to several diseases such as cell death and survival, oxidative stress, and proteotoxic stress. Although clusterin is normally a secreted protein, it has also been found intracellularly under certain stress conditions. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed regarding the origin of intracellular clusterin, including specific biogenic processes leading to alternative transcripts and protein isoforms, but these lines of research are incomplete and contradictory. Current consensus is that intracellular clusterin is most likely to have exited the secretory pathway at some point or to have re-entered the cell after secretion. Clusterin's relationship with amyloid beta (A beta) has been of great interest to the AD field, including clusterin's apparent role in altering A beta aggregation and/or clearance. Additionally, clusterin has been more recently identified as a mediator of A beta toxicity, as evidenced by the neuroprotective effect of CLU knockdown and knockout in rodent and human iPSC-derived neurons. CLU is also the third most significant genetic risk factor for late onset AD and several variants have been identified in CLU. Although the exact contribution of these variants to altered AD risk is unclear, some have been linked to altered CLU expression at both mRNA and protein levels, altered cognitive and memory function, and altered brain structure. The apparent complexity of clusterin's biogenesis, the lack of clarity over the origin of the intracellular clusterin species, and the number of pathophysiological functions attributed to clusterin have all contributed to the challenge of understanding the role of clusterin in AD pathophysiology. Here, we highlight clusterin's relevance to AD by discussing the evidence linking clusterin to AD, as well as drawing parallels on how the role of clusterin in other diseases and pathways may help us understand its biological function(s) in association with AD.

AB  - Hypertension is the single greatest contributor to human disease and mortality affecting over 75 million people in the United States alone. Hypertension is defined according to the American College of Cardiology as systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above 80 mm Hg measured on two separate occasions. While there are multiple medication classes available for blood pressure control, fewer than 50% of hypertensive patients maintain appropriate control. In fact, 0.5% of patients are refractory to medical treatment which is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure despite treatment with five classes of antihypertensive agents. With new guidelines to define hypertension that will increase the incidence of hypertension world-wide, the prevalence of refractory hypertension is expected to increase. Thus, investigation into alternative methods of blood pressure control will be crucial to reduce comorbidities such as higher risk of myocardial infarction, cardiovascular accident, aneurysm formation, heart failure, coronary artery disease, end stage renal disease, arrhythmia, left ventricular hypertrophy, intracerebral hemorrhage, hypertensive enchaphelopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, glomerulosclerosis, limb loss due to arterial occlusion, and sudden death. Recently, studies demonstrated efficacious treatment of neurological diseases with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Tourette's, depression, intermittent explosive disorder, epilepsy, chronic pain, and headache as these diseases have defined neurophysiology with anatomical targets. Currently, clinical applications of DBS is limited to neurological conditions as such conditions have well-defined neurophysiology and anatomy. However, rapidly expanding knowledge about neuroanatomical controls of systemic conditions such as hypertension are expanding the possibilities for DBS neuromodulation. Within the central autonomic network (CAN), multiple regions play a role in homeostasis and blood pressure control that could be DBS targets. While the best defined autonomic target is the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter, other targets including the subcallosal neocortex, subthalamic nucleus (STN), posterior hypothalamus, rostrocaudal cingulate gyrus, orbitofrontal gyrus, and insular cortex are being further characterized as potential targets. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding neurologic contribution to the pathophysiology of hypertension, delineate the complex interactions between neuroanatomic structures involved in blood pressure homeostasis, and then discuss the potential for using DBS as a treatment for refractory hypertension.

AB  - Hypoxia in aquatic ecosystems is often a result of anthropogenic activities, such as increased nutrient loading, originating from agriculture or urbanization, as well as global warming. Aquatic invertebrates are especially important in ecosystems due to their central role in secondary production and in dynamics of food webs. To better understand impacts of oxygen availability on key physiological processes in invertebrates, we conducted a literature search and synthesized the findings of published studies. We found 55 studies that quantified impacts of hypoxia on feeding, growth, reproduction and respiration rates in 54 different aquatic invertebrate species. We applied non-linear regression models which took into account phylogenetic correlation in the data set. Fitting Michaelis-Menten models, we found that there were differences in how different processes responded to a decline in oxygen availability. Respiration rates were halved at highest oxygen concentration (6.44 mg O-2/L), followed by reproductive (3.66 mg O-2/L), growth (1.77 mg O-2/L) and, finally, feeding rates (0.77 mg O-2/L). Our findings confirm observations that reproduction is highly sensitive as organisms quickly reduce their reproductive output when exposed to stressful conditions. As long as they have sufficient reserves, organisms continue growing even under stressful conditions, and we confirmed that growth was not very sensitive to a decline in oxygen availability. We discuss potential impacts of global warming on oxygen availability and demand for aquatic macroinvertebrates. Given that oxygen availability is declining in many ecosystems, we can expect that organismal responses will be increasingly compromised with potential consequences for ecosystems and the services they deliver.

AB  - The aim of this meta-analysis was to review studies that applied musical instrument playing as an intervention to improve cognitive functioning of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. English-language articles published between 1990 and 2018 were searched using electronic databases. Music therapy journals were also hand searched for relevant research. Inclusion criteria for participants were older adults, ages 60 years and older, and any clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment had to be due to aging. Searches used combinations of the following keywords: older adults, instrument playing, and cognitive outcomes measures. A total of 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis: five studies with healthy older adults, two with older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), two studies with older adults with dementia, and one study with both healthy older adults and older adults with MCI. The results of this meta-analysis demonstrated that different types of cognitive involvement were demanded from instrument playing. Furthermore, depending on the type of involvement, a target cognitive domain was found to be differentially impacted by the instrument playing intervention. This study supports using different types of instrument playing for interventions targeting specific cognitive domains of older adults with varying levels of cognitive aging.

AB  - Iron is a crucial cofactor for several physiological functions in the brain including transport of oxygen, DNA synthesis, mitochondrial respiration, synthesis of myelin, and neurotransmitter metabolism. If iron concentration exceeds the capacity of cellular sequestration, excessive labile iron will be harmful by generating oxidative stress that leads to cell death. In patients suffering from Parkinson disease, the total amount of iron in the substantia nigra was reported to increase with disease severity. High concentrations of iron were also found in the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of human Alzheimer disease brains. Besides iron, nitric oxide (NO) produced in high concentration has been associated with neurodegeneration. NO is produced as a co-product when the enzyme NO synthase converts L-arginine to citrulline, and NO has a role to support normal physiological functions. When NO is produced in a high concentration under pathological conditions such as inflammation, aberrantly S-nitrosylated proteins can initiate neurodegeneration. Interestingly, NO is closely related with iron homeostasis. Firstly, it regulates iron-related gene expression through a system involving iron regulatory protein and its cognate iron responsive element (IRP-IRE). Secondly, it modified the function of iron-related protein directly via S-nitrosylation. In this review, we examine the recent advances about the potential role of dysregulated iron homeostasis in neurodegeneration, with an emphasis on AD and PD, and we discuss iron chelation as a potential therapy. This review also highlights the changes in iron homeostasis caused by NO. An understanding of these mechanisms will help us formulate strategies to reverse or ameliorate iron-related neurodegeneration in diseases such as AD and PD.

AB  - This opinion paper focuses on the role of eco-toxicological tools in the assessment of possible impacts of emerging contaminants on the aquatic ecosystem, hence, on human health. Indeed, organic trace pollutants present in raw and treated wastewater are the pivot targets: a multidisciplinary approach allows defining the basic principles for managing this issue, from setting a proper monitoring campaign up to evaluating the optimal process treatment. Giving hints on trace pollutants fate and behaviour, attention is focused on the choice of the bioassay(s), by analysing the meaning of possible biological answers. Data interpretation and exploitation are detailed with the final goal of providing criteria in order to be able to select the best targeted treatment options.
   The manuscript dealswith conventional and innovative analytical approaches for assessing toxicity, by reviewing laboratory and field assays; illustrative real scale and laboratory applications integrate and exemplify the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The treatment of psychiatric patients presents significant challenges to the clinical community, and a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management is essential to facilitate optimal care. In particular, the neurosurgical treatment of psychiatric disorders, or "psychosurgery," has held fascination throughout human history as a potential method of influencing behavior and consciousness. Early evidence of such procedures can be traced to prehistory, and interest flourished in the nineteenth and early twentieth century with greater insight into cerebral functional and anatomic localization. However, any discussion of psychosurgery invariably invokes controversy, as the widespread and indiscriminate use of the transorbital lobotomy in the mid-twentieth century resulted in profound ethical ramifications that persist to this day. The concurrent development of effective psychopharmacological treatments virtually eliminated the need and desire for psychosurgical procedures, and accordingly the research and practice of psychosurgery was dormant, but not forgotten. There has been a recent resurgence of interest for non-ablative therapies, due in part to modern advances in functional and structural neuroimaging and neuromodulation technology. In particular, deep brain stimulation is a promising treatment paradigm with the potential to modulate abnormal pathways and networks implicated in psychiatric disease states. Although there is enthusiasm regarding these recent advancements, it is important to reflect on the scientific, social, and ethical considerations of this controversial field.

While the majority of ALS cases (90-95%) are sporadic (sALS), among familial ALS cases 5-10% involve the inheritance of mutations in the TARDBP gene and the remaining (90-95%) are due to mutations in other genes such as: C9ORF72, SOD1, FUS, and NEK1 etc. Strikingly however, the majority of sporadic ALS patients (up to 97%) also contain the TDP-43 protein deposited in the neuronal inclusions, which suggests of its pivotal role in the ALS pathology. Thus, unraveling the molecular mechanisms of the TDP-43 pathology seems central to the ALS therapeutics, hence, we comprehensively review the current understanding of the TDP-43' s pathology in ALS. We discuss the roles of TDP-43' s mutations, its cytoplasmic mis-localization and aberrant post-translational modifications in ALS. Also, we evaluate TDP-43' s amyloid-like in vitro aggregation, its physiological vs. pathological oligomerization in vivo, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and potential prion-like propagation propensity of the TDP-43 inclusions. Finally, we describe the various evolving TDP-43-induced toxicity mechanisms, such as the impairment of endocytosis and mitotoxicity etc. and also discuss the emerging strategies toward TDP-43 disaggregation and ALS therapeutics.

AB  - Background: Recently, many case-control studies have reported the association between 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and autismrisk. However, the results are inconclusive and conflicting. To investigate the genetic association of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and autism risk, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis based on previous case-control studies.
   Methods: Literature search was performed through PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge and CNKI databases until June 27, 2018. The strength of the association was assessed by relative risk (RR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Fixed or random effect model was selected based on the results of heterogeneity test. Further, subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the association of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and autism risk in different population.
   Results: Eleven studies with 930 cases and 1234 controls were identified. Although there was a significant association between 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and autism risk under the dominant model after removing the studies causing heterogeneity, the significance did not exist after Bonferroni's correction. Subgroup analyses also showed similar results after Bonferroni's correction. In addition, there was no obvious publication bias in our meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: Our present meta-analysis does not support a direct effect of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on autism risk according to present results. Further analyses of the effect of genetic networks and more well designed studies with larger sample size are required.

AB  - Calcium is one of the most important signaling factors in mammalian cells. Specific temporal and spatial calcium signals underlie fundamental processes such as cell growth, development, circadian rhythms, neurotransmission, hormonal actions and apoptosis. In order to translate calcium signals into cellular processes a vast number of proteins bind this ion with affinities from the nanomolar to millimolar range. Using classical biochemical methods an impressing number of calcium binding proteins (CBPs) have been discovered since the late 1960s, some of which are expressed ubiquitously, others are more restricted to specific cell types. In the nervous system expression patterns of different CBPs have been used to discern different neuronal cell populations, especially before advanced methods like single-cell transcriptomics and activity recording were available to define neuronal identity. However, understanding CBPs and their interacting proteins is still of central interest. The post-genomic era has coined the term "calciomics," to describe a whole new research field, that engages in the identification and characterization of CBPs and their interactome. Secretagogin is a CBP, that was discovered 20 years ago in the pancreas. Consecutively it was found also in other organs including the nervous system, with characteristic expression patterns mostly forming cell clusters. Its regional expression and subcellular location together with the identification of protein interaction partners implicated, that secretagogin has a central role in hormone secretion. Meanwhile, with the help of modern proteomics a large number of actual and putative interacting proteins has been identified, that allow to anticipate a much more complex role of secretagogin in developing and adult neuronal cells. Here, we review recent findings that appear like puzzle stones of a greater picture.

AB  - Iron and calcium share the common feature of being essential for normal neuronal function. Iron is required for mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, and the development of cognitive functions whereas cellular calcium signals mediate neurotransmitter exocytosis, axonal growth and synaptic plasticity, and control the expression of genes involved in learning and memory processes. Recent studies have revealed that cellular iron stimulates calcium signaling, leading to downstream activation of kinase cascades engaged in synaptic plasticity. The relationship between calcium and iron is Janus-faced, however. While under physiological conditions iron-mediated reactive oxygen species generation boosts normal calcium-dependent signaling pathways, excessive iron levels promote oxidative stress leading to the upsurge of unrestrained calcium signals that damage mitochondrial function, among other downstream targets. Similarly, increases in mitochondrial calcium to non-physiological levels result in mitochondrial dysfunction and a predicted loss of iron homeostasis. Hence, if uncontrolled, the iron/calcium self-feeding cycle becomes deleterious to neuronal function, leading eventually to neuronal death. Here, we review the multiple cell-damaging responses generated by the unregulated iron/calcium self-feeding cycle, such as excitotoxicity, free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation, and the oxidative modification of crucial components of iron and calcium homeostasis/signaling: the iron transporter DMT1, plasma membrane, and intracellular calcium channels and pumps. We discuss also how iron-induced dysregulation of mitochondrial calcium contributes to the generation of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

AB  - The role of auditory information on perceptual-motor processes has gained increased interest in sports and psychology research in recent years. Numerous neurobiological and behavioral studies have demonstrated the close interaction between auditory and motor areas of the brain, and the importance of auditory information for movement execution, control, and learning. In applied research, artificially produced acoustic information and real-time auditory information have been implemented in sports and rehabilitation to improve motor performance in athletes, healthy individuals, and patients affected by neurological or movement disorders. However, this research is scattered both across time and scientific disciplines. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview about the interaction between movement and sound and review the current literature regarding the effect of natural movement sounds, movement sonification, and rhythmic auditory information in sports and motor rehabilitation. The focus here is threefold: firstly, we provide an overview of empirical studies using natural movement sounds and movement sonification in sports. Secondly, we review recent clinical and applied studies using rhythmic auditory information and sonification in rehabilitation, addressing in particular studies on Parkinson's disease and stroke. Thirdly, we summarize current evidence regarding the cognitive mechanisms and neural correlates underlying the processing of auditory information during movement execution and its mental representation. The current state of knowledge here reviewed provides evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of auditory information to improve movement execution, control, and (re)learning in sports and motor rehabilitation. Findings also corroborate the critical role of auditory information in auditory-motor coupling during motor (re)learning and performance, suggesting that this area of clinical and applied research has a large potential that is yet to be fully explored.

AB  - In the last decade, the number of investigations of the beliefs in conspiracy theories has begun to increase in the fields of social, differential, and experimental psychology. A considerable number of variables have been suggested as predictors of conspiracy beliefs, amongst them personality factors such as low agreeableness (as disagreeableness is associated with suspicion and antagonism) and high openness to experience (due to its positive association to seek out unusual and novel ideas). The association between agreeableness, openness to experience and conspiracy beliefs remains unclear in the literature. The present study reviews the literature of psychological studies investigating conspiracy beliefs. Additionally, the association between Big Five personality factors and conspiracy beliefs is analyzed meta-analytically using random-effects models. Ninety-six studies were identified for the systematic review. A comprehensive account of predictors, consequences, operationalization, questionnaires, and most prominent conspiracy theories is presented. For meta-analysis, 74 effect sizes from 13 studies were extracted. The psychological literature on predictors of conspiracy beliefs can be divided in approaches either with a pathological (e.g., paranoia) or socio-political focus (e.g., perceived powerlessness). Generally, there is a lack of theoretical frameworks in this young area of research. Meta-analysis revealed that agreeableness, openness to experience, and the remaining Big Five personality factors were not significantly associated with conspiracy beliefs if effect sizes are aggregated. Considerable heterogeneity in designs and operationalization characterizes the field. This article provides an overview of instrumentation, study designs, and current state of knowledge in an effort toward advancement and consensus in the study of conspiracy beliefs.

AB  - Rice is the foremost staple food in the world, safeguarding the global food and nutritional security. Rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and water deficits are threatening global rice productivity and sustainability. Under real field conditions these climatic factors often interact with each other resulting in impacts that are remarkably different compared to individual factor exposure. Rice soils exposed to drought and elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) alters the biomass, diversity and activity of soil microorganisms affecting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission dynamics. In this review we have discussed the impacts of eCO(2) and water deficit on agronomic, biochemical and physiological responses of rice and GHGs emissions fromrice soils. Drought usually results in oxidative stress due to stomatal closure, dry weight reduction, formation of reactive oxygen species, decrease in relative water content and increase in electrolyte leakage at almost all growth and developmental phases of rice. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration reduces the negative effects of drought by improving plant water relations, reducing stomatal opening, decreasing transpiration, increasing canopy photosynthesis, shortening crop growth period and increasing the antioxidant metabolite activities in rice. Increased scientific understanding of the effects of drought and eCO(2) on rice agronomy, physiology and GHG emission dynamics of rice soil is essential for devising adaptation options. Integration of novel agronomic practices viz., crop establishment methods and alternate cropping systems with improved water and nutrient management are important steps to help rice farmers cope with drought and eCO(2). The review summarizes future research needs for ensuring sustained global food security under future warmer, drier and high CO2 conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study discusses importance of assessing environmental sustainability of fruits and vegetable (F&V) production sector in future climate change (CC) scenarios. For the current production scenario, life cycle environmental footprints of F&V supply chain are discussed considering the influences of: agro-climates, production systems, raw material inputs, post-harvest managements to the products' yield and quality. Potential risks of CC to the sector are discussed in the context of elevated global temperature and carbon dioxide level, ozone depletion and changes in precipitation patterns. Potential risks due to CC are on the productivity and the quality of F&V products, such as texture, color, maturity and nutrients. Increased risk of failure of the current crop protection strategies, e.g. due to pest infestations and different crop-water and nutrient stresses are among the short and long-term risks. It also discusses potential adaptation and mitigation measures to CC, and therefrom argues on the related environmental consequences in the supply chain. From the LCA studies, it was revealed that environmental impacts of F&V supply chain varied as per agro-ecological characteristics and farming systems, e.g. greenhouse vs open-field, organic vs conventional, and grown in different agro-climatic conditions. The nexus among the climatic stresses, potential adaptation and mitigation measures, hence were in the form of potential changes in the raw material inputs and resource flows depending on the preferred future agro-management strategies and farming practices. Adaptation and other management options, included are, changes in: crop calendar, nutrient and pest management strategies, post-harvest handling and improved preservation of F&V products. These are argued eventually being determining factors leading to different environmental footprints compared to the existing management scenarios. Prospective life cycle environmental evaluation of F&V supply chain considering the relationship among product yield and qualities, CC stresses and potential adaptation and mitigation measures is thus a new thrust and direction.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that represents a common cause of intellectual disability and is a variant of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies that have searched for similarities in syndromic and non-syndromic forms of ASD have paid special attention to alterations of maturation and function of glutamatergic synapses. Copy number variations (CNVs) in the loci containing genes encoding alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) subunits are associated with ASD in genetic studies. In FXS, dysregulated AMPAR subunit expression and trafficking affect neural progenitor differentiation and synapse formation and neuronal plasticity in the mature brain. Decreased expression of GluA2, the AMPAR subunit that critically controls Ca2+-permeability, and a concomitant increase in Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) in human and mouse FXS neural progenitors parallels changes in expression of GluA2-targeting microRNAs (miRNAs). Thus, posttranscriptional regulation of GluA2 by miRNAs and subsequent alterations in calcium signaling may contribute to abnormal synaptic function in FXS and, by implication, in some forms of ASD.

AB  - Background: The overweight and obesity among military personnel, as an occupational group, beside the health issues, might affect their military performance. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the pool prevalence of overweight and obesity among Iranian military personnel.
   Methods: The national databases including Science Information Database, MagIran, and the following international databases; Web of Science, Medline via PubMed, and Scopus were searched, up to December 2017, for relevant published studies without time limitation.
   Results: Totally, 1431 studies were reterived and 10 studies included in meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of overweight and obesity were 41% (95% CI: 26, 57%) and 13% (95% CI: 10, 17%), respectively. In the subgroup analyses, a lower and higher prevalence of overweight was reported in the ground (12%) and Navy (69%) forces military, recpectively. For the obesity, the air forces had the lowest prevalence (11%) and the ground and Navy forces military had highest prevalence (15%). The prevalence of overweight and obesity were slightly higher in studies conducted after 2014.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in the military personnel as a high-risk occupational group. Owing to the high observed heterogeneity among the included studies, large representative studies are needed to estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the military personnel.

AB  - Arousal plays a central role in a wide variety of phenomena, including wakefulness, autonomic function, affect and emotion. Despite its importance, it remains unclear as to how the neural mechanisms for arousal are organized across them. In this article, we review neuroscience findings for three of the most common origins of arousal: wakeful arousal, autonomic arousal, and affective arousal. Our review makes two overarching points. First, research conducted primarily in non-human animals underscores the importance of several subcortical nuclei that contribute to various sources of arousal, motivating the need for an integrative framework. Thus, we outline an integrative neural reference space as a key first step in developing a more systematic understanding of central nervous system contributions to arousal. Second, there is a translational gap between research on non-human animals, which emphasizes subcortical nuclei, and research on humans using non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, which focuses more on gross anatomical characterizations of cortical (e.g. network architectures including the default mode network) and subcortical structures. We forecast the importance of high-field neuroimaging in bridging this gap to examine how the various networks within the neural reference space for arousal operate across varieties of arousal-related phenomena.

AB  - Background and methods: Aggression in psychosis is clinically important. We systematically compiled the evidence on functional correlates of aggression in psychosis searching PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO until September 2017. We included studies reporting functional brain imaging correlates of aggression comparing: (1) affective or non-affective psychosis groups with a history of violence or with aggression operationalized using questionnaires, (2) affective or non-affective psychosis groups with a history of violence or with aggression operationalized using questionnaires to controls, (3) affective or non-affective psychosis groups with a history of violence or with aggression operationalized using questionnaires to controls with diagnoses other than affective or non-affective psychoses. We applied no language restriction and required patients to have a DSM or ICD diagnosis of affective or non-affective psychosis.
   Results: Our sample consisted of 12 studies with 334 patients and 113 controls. During n-back tasks, violent (VS) as opposed to non-violent persons with schizophrenia (NVS) hypoactivated their inferior parietal lobe. When anticipating shock, VS vs. NVS hyperactivated their medial prefrontal gyrus, cuneus, middle temporal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. When viewing negative emotional pictures, VS vs. NVS hyperactivated the middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, lingual gyrus, precentral gyrus, globus pallidus, mid-cingulate, and precuneus.
   Limitations: Due to the small number of available studies, sample overlap, and insufficient reporting of relevant moderators we could not conduct a meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: We found non-systematic functional correlates of aggression in schizophrenia. Only few studies using varied paradigms and often overlapping samples have been conducted. There have been no attempts to replicate any of the observed findings in the published literature. Focusing on future directions, we recommend that authors adhere to clear definitions of aggression, measurements of psychopathology, comorbidities, and medication. In particular, replication studies would allow for a better synthesis of the findings.

AB  - There has been a limited number of systematic reviews conducted to summarize the overview of the relationship between DNA methylation and depression, and to critically appraise the roles of major study characteristics in the accuracy of study findings. This systematic review aims to critically appraise the impact of study characteristics on the association between DNA methylation and depression, and summarize the overview of this association. Electronic databases and gray literatures until December 2017 were searched for English-language studies with standard diagnostic criteria of depression. A total of 67 studies were included in this review along with a summary of their study characteristics. We grouped the findings into etiological and treatment studies. Majority of these selected studies were recently published and from developed countries. Whole blood samples were the most studied common tissues. Bisulfite conversion, along with pyrosequencing, was widely used to test the DNA methylation level across all the studies. High heterogeneity existed among the studies in terms of experimental and statistical methodologies and study designs. As recommended by the Cochrane guideline, a systematic review without meta-analysis should be undertaken. This review has, in general, found that DNA methylation modifications were associated with depression. Subgroup analyses showed that most studies found BDNF and SLC6A4 hypermethylations to be associated with MDD or depression in general. In contrast, studies on NR3C1, OXTR, and other genes, which were tested by only few studies, reported mixed findings. More longitudinal studies using standardized experimental and laboratory methodologies are needed in future studies to enable more systematical comparisons and quantitative synthesis.

AB  - BackgroundClinically operated community-based residential rehabilitation units (Community Rehabilitation Units) are resource intensive services supporting a small proportion of the people with severe and persisting mental illness who experience difficulties living in the community. Most consumers who engage with these services will be diagnosed with schizophrenia or a related disorder. This review seeks to: generate a typology of service models, describe the characteristics of the consumers accessing these services, and synthesise available evidence about consumers' service experiences and outcomes.MethodA systematic review was undertaken to identify studies describing Community Rehabilitation Units in Australia, consumer characteristics, and evidence about consumer experiences and outcomes. Search strings were applied to multiple databases; additional records were identified through snowballing. Records presenting unique empirical research were subject to quality appraisal.ResultsThe typology defined two service types, Community-Based Residential Care (C-BRC), which emerged in the context of de-institutionalisation, and the more recent Transitional Residential Rehabilitation (TRR) approach. Key differentiating features were the focus on transitional care and recovery' under TRR. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders were the most common primary diagnosis under both service types. TRR consumers were more likely to be male, referred from community settings, and less likely to be subject to involuntary treatment. Regarding outcomes, the limited quantitative evidence (4 records, 2 poor quality) indicated C-BRC was successful in supporting the majority of consumers transferred from long-term inpatient care to remain out of hospital. All qualitative research conducted in C-BRC settings was assessed to be of poor quality (3 records). No methodologically sound quantitative evidence on the outcomes of TRR was identified. Qualitative research undertaken in these settings was of mixed quality (9 records), and the four records exploring consumer perspectives identified them as valuing the service provided.ConclusionsWhile there is qualitative evidence to suggest consumers value the support provided by Community Rehabilitation Units, there is an absence of methodologically sound quantitative research about the consumer outcomes achieved by these services. Given the ongoing and increasing investment in these facilities within the Australian context, there is an urgent need for high-quality research examining their efficiency and effectiveness.Trial registrationPROSPERO (CRD42018097326).

   Results: The results show that 12 RCTs investigating 1,255 young people were included in themeta-analysis. The proportion of adolescents not completing four ormore sessions in SPT was significantly lower (28.4%, 179/630) than TAU (45.9%, 287/625), RR = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.51 -0.79), p < 0.0001. There were significantly more adolescents engaged with SPT than TAU.
   Conclusions: Specific psychological treatments should be offered to adolescents with self-harm to maximize treatment engagement. Engaging adolescents with psychological treatment is necessary although not sufficient to achieve treatment goals.

AB  - Mitochondria are the double membrane organelles providing most of the energy for cells. In addition, mitochondria also play essential roles in various cellular biological processes such as calcium signaling, apoptosis, ROS generation, cell growth, and cell cycle. Mitochondrial dysfunction is observed in various neurological disorders which harbor acute and chronic neural injury such as neurodegenerative diseases and ischemia, hypoxia-induced brain injury. In this review, we describe how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders which manifest chronic or acute neural injury.

AB  - Little is known about how romantic relationships enhance long-term attachment security. Change is likely to involve revising deep-seated beliefs and expectations regarding one's self as being unworthy and others as untrustworthy (insecure internal working models). When individuals become anxious, partners can provide immediate reassurance, but the path to long-term security may hinge on addressing the individual's insecure self-perceptions; when individuals become avoidant, partners can 'soften' interactions that involve relational give-and-take, but long-term security may hinge on instilling positive associations with interdependence and trust. As described in the Attachment Security Enhancement Model (ASEM), relationships can afford optimal interactions that involve two processes working in tandem: mitigating momentary insecurity, and fostering secure working models over the long-term.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1-2% of the total global population. Despite its high prevalence and publication of several studies focused on understanding its pathology, an effective treatment that stops and/or reverses the damage to dopaminergic neurons is unavailable. Similar to other neurodegenerative disorders, PD etiology may be linked to several factors, including genetic susceptibility and environmental elements. Regarding environmental factors, several neurotoxic pollutants, including 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), have been identified. Moreover, some pesticides/herbicides, such as rotenone, paraquat (PQ), maneb (MB), and mancozeb (MZ), cause neurotoxicity and induce a PD-like pathology. Based on these findings, several in vitro and in vivo PD-like models have been developed to understand the pathophysiology of PD and evaluate different therapeutic strategies to fight dopaminergic neurodegeneration. 6-OHDA and MPTP are common models used in PD research, and pesticide-based approaches have become secondary models of study. However, some herbicides, such as PQ, are commonly used by farming laborers in developing countries. Thus, the present review summarizes the relevant scientific background regarding the use and effects of chronic exposure to PQ in the context of PD. Similarly, we discuss the relevance of PD-like models developed using this agrochemical compound.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Two percent of the population above the age of 60 is affected by the disease. The pathological hallmarks of PD include loss of dopaminergic neurons and the presence of Lewy bodies. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are thought to play a pivotal role in both sporadic and familial forms of the disease. In this review we focus on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC) models of PD.We also provide an overview of therapeutics that have been tested and some possible new therapeutics that can be tested in IPSC models of PD.

AB  - Widespread agricultural use of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides has resulted in the unintended contamination of aquatic environments. Water quality surveys regularly detect neonicotinoids in rivers and waterways at concentrations that could impact aquaculture stock. The toxicity of neonicotinoids to non-target aquatic insect and crustacean species has been recognised, however, there is a paucity of information on their effect on commercial shrimp aquaculture. Here, we show that commercially produced shrimp are likely to be exposed to dietary, sediment and waterborne sources of neonicotinoids; increasing the risks of disease and accidental human consumption. This review examines indicators of sublethal neonicotinoid exposure in non-target species and analyses their potential usefulness for eco-toxicology assessment in shrimp. The identification of rapid, reliable responses to neonicotinoid exposure in shrimp will result in better decision making in aquaculture management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mindfulness-based meditation practices have received substantial scientific attention in recent years. Mindfulness has been shown to bring many psychological benefits to the individual, but much less is known about whether these benefits extend to others. This meta-analysis reviewed the link between mindfulness - as both a personality variable and an intervention - and prosocial behaviour. A literature search produced 31 eligible studies (N = 17,241) and 73 effect sizes. Meta-analyses were conducted using mixed-effects structural equation models to examine pooled effects and potential moderators of these effects. We found a positive pooled effect between mindfulness and prosocial behaviour for both correlational (d = .73 CI 95% [0.51 to 0.96]) and intervention studies (d = .51 CI 95% [0.37 to 0.66]). For the latter, medium-sized effects were obtained across varying meditation types and intensities, and across gender and age categories. Preliminary evidence is presented regarding potential mediators of these effects. Although we found that mindfulness is positively related to prosociality, further research is needed to examine the mediators of this link and the contexts in which it is most pronounced.

AB  - Optimizing performance of individuals in acutely stressful work-related situations requires a deeper understanding of the interaction between the demands of the stimuli and an individual's associated physiological response. Identifying these responses is particularly germane for healthcare professionals, who experience episodes of acute stress on a regular basis. The purpose of this review was to examine and synthesize empirical literature to identify studies assessing physiological responses to acute stress, determine common methods for measuring acute stress in near real-time, and identify common research designs employed across industries. A modified PRISMA approach was followed. Systematic searches were conducted of four databases (PsycINFO, Medline, PubMed, and Turning Research into Practice [TRIP]) to access eligibility. Reference list searches and a hand search were also conducted to identify other articles suitable for inclusion. Studies selected examined an acute physiological response while participants were engaged in a stress-inducing task. Twenty-two articles were included. Fifteen (68.2%) were centered on the human service industry while only three (13.6%) focused on healthcare professionals. Half of the studies incorporated a simulation into the research design while only two (9.1%) articles looked at physiological responses in real-world settings. Heart rate and cortisol emerged as the most common physiological measures collected. This review demonstrates that acute stress is primarily assessed retrospectively, and that there is a pragmatic gap in methodological approach, with many data collection methods inappropriate for the healthcare environment. Future research should capitalize on advancements in sensor technology to passively examine acute stress in healthcare professionals.

AB  - Objective: To date, although there have been several systematic reviews about the relationship between overweight/obesity and academic performance, none of the reviews were conducted quantitatively, thus the extent overweight/obesity is related to academic performance still remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to quantitatively review the scientific evidence on the association between body mass index (BMI) and academic performance.
   Study design: A systematic review of articles examining such relationship was undertaken using four databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. The search period covered the research literature up to July 2017.
   Methods: Data from 60 selected studies (involving 164,049 participants) were extracted and analysed following procedures for meta-analysis.
   Results: Sixty studies met all inclusion criteria and were included. Using a random-effects meta-analysis model, a weak negative correlation between BMI and academic achievement (r = -.111; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -.155 to -.067; P<.01) was revealed. After conducting a series of moderator analyses, such a relationship was found to be significantly moderated by regions and students' study grades.
   Conclusions: BMI is weakly and negatively associated with academic achievement. For a better understanding of such a relationship, future studies are needed to explore whether there is a causal relationship and also explore whether there are other factors that potentially moderate such a relationship.

AB  - The field of couple therapy - one of the most widely sought and practiced modality of therapy - has been revolutionized by the emergence of attachment science in the 21st century. We now understand not only the centrality of close relationships for human health and wellbeing, but also that the key to a healthy happy relationship is a secure attachment bond. Emotionally Focused Therapy is an attachment-based approach that aims to help couples create a secure attachment bond. Several outcome studies have shown that EFT helps to not only alleviate relationship distress but individual co-morbidities as well, with positive follow-up effects. EFT appears to help couples not only improve their relationships but also access the optimal resilience and wellbeing secure attachment allows.

AB  - Trust pervades nearly every social aspect of our daily lives, and its disruption is a significant factor in mental illness. Research in the field of neuroeconomics has gained a deeper understanding of the neuropsychoeconomic (NPE) underpinnings of trust by combining complementary methodologies from neuroscience, psychology, and economics. However, a coherent model of trust that integrates separate findings under a conceptual framework is still lacking. Here, we sketch out an integrative NPE model that explains how the interactions of psychoeconomic components engage domain-general large-scale brain networks in shaping trust behavior over time. We also point out caveats of current research approaches and outline open questions that can help guide future transdisciplinary investigations for a better understanding of the neuropsychology of trust.

AB  - Protein homeostasis or proteostasis is critical for proper cellular function and survival. It relies on the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Lysosomes play an important role in degrading and recycling intracellular components via autophagy. Among the three types of lysosome-based autophagy pathways, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) selectively degrades cellular proteins with KFERQ-like motif by unique machinery. During the past several years, significant advances have been made in our understanding of how CMA itself is modulated and what physiological and pathological processes it may be involved in. One particularly exciting discovery is how other cellular stress organelles such as ER signal to CMA. As more proteins are identified as CMA substrates, CMA function has been associated with an increasing number of important cellular processes, organelles, and diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. Here we will summarize the recent advances in CMA biology, highlight ER stress-induced CMA, and discuss the role of CMA in diseases.

AB  - Over the last five decades, the Athabasca River Basin in Alberta, Canada, has been subjected to a wide range of environmental stressors from diverse human developments. This has resulted in an escalation of government, academic, industry and community-based monitoring and research efforts. However, despite all the attention received, a comprehensive synthesis of what has been studied is lacking, in particular, in relation to the efforts examining single versus multiple stressors. Based on a systematic literature review, we found 386 publications from 1969 to 2018 on the Athabasca River focusing on single stressors (68.4%) compared to multiple stressors (31.6%). There was a significant shift in the focus of studies between the 1990s and present from assessing threats of pulp and paper developments to those related to oil sands activities, with studies most predominantly addressing chemical stressors. Despite these efforts, there remain significant knowledge gaps regarding the cumulative effects of multiple stressors, particularly on biological and ecological endpoints. Correspondingly, a wide range of contradictory conclusions were reported regarding the ecological, regulatory and societal significance of the reported environmental impacts, highlighting both the complexity and often lack of standardization of approaches used. This emphasizes the need for improved integration of monitoring and research activities that are hypothesis driven, have clear objectives, and are better aligned with environmental management processes and decisions.

AB  - Objectives: Herpes zoster (HZ) is an important cause of morbidity around the world, especially among the adult population aged >50 years.
   Study design: A systematic review of the literature (up to October 31, 2016) was performed to identify available evidence on incidence of HZ in the general population and in a specific subpopulation in Spain.
   Methods: PubMed and Embase databases were searched, combining the following search terms: 'herpes zoster ', 'diabetes mellitus (DM)', 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)', 'chronic heart failure ', 'mental disorders ' and 'immunocompromised '. Supplements for local scientific congresses, non-indexed Spanish journals and official epidemiological reports, potentially HZ related, were also manually searched. The inclusion criteria were the following: English or Spanish publications reporting incidence of HZ in the Spanish general population and/or specific subpopulations. No restrictions were applied on the study design or population age.
   Results: Among 269 references retrieved (48 PubMed, 148 Embase and 73 manual searching), 34 were finally included. Incidence of HZ in the general population ranged from 2.1 to 5.5/1000 person-years. HZ incidence ranged from 9.4 to 15.3/1000 patients with DM and from 11.0 to 11.4/1000 population with COPD or cardiovascular disease. In asthmatic patients, 6.9 HZ cases/1000 subjects were reported. The highest HZ incidence (1.3-400.0/1000 person-years) was in immunocompromised persons (10.0/1000 patients with cancer, 12.5/1000 patients with AIDS, from 5.0 to 240.0/1000 transplanted patients and from 6.6 to 27.0/1000 population with rheumatic diseases). Three studies estimated an increased risk of HZ in comparison with general population, for patients with DM (24%), COPD (39%) and COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids (61%).
   Conclusions: The results suggest a high risk of HZ in certain age groups and specific subpopulations. This study could contribute to identify target age populations and at-risk groups if implementation of HZ vaccination programmes in Spain would be considered. (c) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.

AB  - Chlorine is considered the most used chemical agent for water disinfection worldwide. However, water chlorination can lead to by-product generation which can be toxic to humans. The present study aimed to perform a systematic review on the toxicity of trihalomethanes (THMs) through bioindicators of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and mutagenicity. The results showed that studies on the effects of THMs on DNA are a current research concern for evaluating the toxicity of the pure compounds and real samples involving several types including water for recreational use, reused water, and drinking water. THMs deleterious effects have been assessed using several biosystems, where the Ames test along with experimental animal models were the most cited. A wide range of THM concentrations have been tested. Nevertheless, DNA damage was demonstrated, highlighting the potential human health risk. Among the studied THMs, chloroform presented a different action mechanism when compared with brominated THMs, with the former being cytotoxic while brominated THMs (bromodichloromethane, bromoform, and dibromochloromethane) were cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic. The described evidence in this research highlights the relevance of this topic as a human health issue. Nevertheless, research aimed to represent THMs current exposure conditions in a more accurate way would be needed to understand the real impact on human health.

In this paper, two inceptive models are reviewed, followed by consideration of the emerging literature in this field, stimulated by emerging physiological and neurobiological evidence. Although implications for treatment are available, treatment protocols and outcome studies are rare. Further research is needed to develop a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the links between insecure attachment and chronic conditions with a view to developing and implementing treatment protocols. These emerging interventions must recognize the complex personal and social/physical environmental contexts within which chronic conditions manifest.

Method: A systematic literature search was conducted using the electronic databases Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and ERIC to analyze the efficacy of different types of exercise interventions in children and adolescents with ADHD. Seven studies examining the acute and 14 studies examining the long-term effects were included. Results: The largest effects were reported for mixed exercise programs on ADHD symptomatology and fine motor precision. However, because of the large differences in the study designs, the comparability is limited. Conclusion: At this time, no evidence-based recommendation can be formulated regarding frequency, intensity, or duration of exercise. Nevertheless, some first trends regarding the effects of certain types of exercise can be identified. When focusing on long-term health benefits in children and adolescents with ADHD, qualitative exercise characteristics might play an important role.

AB  - The discovery of genetic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) has highlighted the importance of the autophagy/lysosomal and mitochondrial/oxidative stress pathways in disease pathogenesis. However, recently identified PD-linked genes, including DNAJC6 (auxilin), SYNJ1 (synaptojanin 1), and the PD risk gene SH3GL2 (endophilin A1), have also highlighted disruptions in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) as a significant contributor to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the roles of other PD genes such as LRRK2, PRKN, and VPS35 in the regulation of SVE are beginning to emerge. Here we discuss the recent work on the contribution of dysfunctional SVE to midbrain dopaminergic neurons' selective vulnerability and highlight pathways that demonstrate the interplay of synaptic, mitochondrial, and lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of PD.

AB  - The presence of sport in the media has grown exponentially over the last few decades. As a result, the influence of the media on the concept of physical activity within society and the collective and individual values it purports is indisputable. The mass media tends to follow a specific pattern when representing sport, this includes broadcasting of sport competitions and presentation of elite athletes as contemporary legends. A broad range of teaching and research opportunities are available in the field of media education. For this reason, we conducted a systematic review of international studies (Web of Science and Scopus) published between 2007 and 2018, focusing on the effects and influence of sports content on the audience. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement provided a framework for the analysis of included papers. The study incorporated an initial sample of 313 research articles that discussed the importance of emotional factors with regards to perceptual processes. Furthermore, links with various behavioral indicators were identified, such as competitiveness, violence, self-improvement linked to effort, stereotypes of beauty and health care.

AB  - Child abuse is a major public health concern and a strong predictor of adult psychopathology. However, a consensus on how best to measure child abuse is not evident. This review aimed to critically appraise the methodological quality and measurement properties of published child abuse measures, examined the strength of evidence of these instruments for research use using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement InstrumeNts (COSMIN) checklist and determined which measures were capable of providing information on the developmental timing of abuse. Systematic search of electronic databases identified 52 eligible instruments from 2095 studies. Only 15% (n = 8) of the instruments had strong to moderate levels of evidence for three or more of the nine COSMIN criteria. No instrument had adequate levels of evidence for all criteria, and no criteria were met by all instruments. Our results indicate there is no single instrument that is superior to all others across settings and populations. The availability of measures capable of capturing the effects of child abuse on brain development and associated behavioral phenotypes are limited. Refined instruments with a focus on capturing abuse events during development are warranted in addition to further evaluation of the psychometric properties of these instruments.

AB  - Maternal adversity and fetal glucocorticoid exposure has long-term effects on cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioral systems in offspring that can persist throughout the lifespan. These data, along with other environmental exposure data, implicate epigenetic modifications as potential mechanisms for long-term effects of maternal exposures on adverse health outcomes in offspring. Advances in microarray, sequencing and bioinformatic approaches have enabled recent studies to examine the genome-wide epigenetic response to maternal adversity. Studies of maternal exposures to xenobiotics such as arsenic and smoking have been performed at birth to examine fetal epigenomic signatures in cord blood relating to adult health outcomes. However, there have been no epigenomic studies examining these effects in animal models. On the other hand, to date, only a few studies of the effects of maternal psychosocial stress have been performed in human infants, and the majority of animal studies have examined epigenomic outcomes in adulthood. In terms of maternal exposure to excess glucocorticoids by synthetic glucocorticoid treatment, there has been no epigenetic study performed in humans and only a few studies undertaken in animal models. This review emphasizes the importance of examining biomarkers of exposure to adversity throughout development to identify individuals at risk and to target interventions. Thus, research performed at birth will be reviewed. In addition, potential subject characteristics associated with epigenetic modifications, technical considerations, the selection of target tissues and combining human studies with animal models will be discussed in relation to the design of experiments in this field of study.

AB  - We generalize the circular 2D diffusion model of Smith (Psychological Review, 123, 425-451: 2016) to provide a new model of speeded decision-making in multielement visual displays. We model decision-making in tasks with multielement displays as evidence accumulation by a vector-valued diffusion process in a hypersphere, whose radius represents the decision criterion for the task. We show that the methods used to derive response time and accuracy predictions for the 2D model can be applied, with only minor changes, to predict performance in higher-dimensional spaces as well. We apply the model to the double-target deficit paradigm of Duncan (Psychological Review, 87, 272-300: 1980) in which participants judge whether briefly presented four-element displays contain one- or two-digit targets among letter distractors. A 4D version of the hyperspherical diffusion model correctly predicted distributions of response times and response accuracy as a function of task difficulty in single-target and double-target versions of the task. The estimated drift rate parameters from the model imply that the mental representation of the decision alternatives, which we term the "decision template" for the task, encodes configural stimulus properties that reflect the number of targets in the display. Along with its application to multielement decision-making, the model has the potential to characterize the speed and accuracy of multiattribute decisions in studies of cognitive categorization, visual attention, and other areas.

AB  - Fatigue is common in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders including depression and often continues unabated even after primary symptoms of disease are treated. Its high estimated prevalence combined with the lack of effective medicines has engaged the preclinical research community to search for fatigue models. The present review briefly summarizes the most common animal models that have been brought forward along with some of the associated pharmacological validation data. Like all preclinical models, these models have issues that need to be appreciated in the generation and interpretation of data for the purposes of translation to human disease; specifically, there are deficiencies in construct validity, a lack of medicines that effectively address residual fatigue symptoms, and difficulties in defining specificity with respect to drug effects on fatigue per se. Nonetheless, existing animal models of fatigue arguably serve the valuable purpose of encouraging research in this large area of unmet medical need. Data from these models are predicted to engender human experimentation and the further development of improved model systems.

AB  - Negative urgency is a personality trait reflecting the tendency to act rashly in response to extreme negative emotions and is considered a transdiagnostic endophenotype for problematic levels of addictive behaviors. Recent research has begun to identify the neural correlates of negative urgency, many of which appear to overlap with neural circuitry underlying addictive disorders associated with negative urgency. The goal of this qualitative review is to summarize the extant literature concerning the neural correlates of negative urgency, to compare these correlates with those implicated with addictive disorders, and to propose new ways to begin to leverage such findings in treatment and intervention approaches. We also address current limitations in the field and make recommendations for areas for future growth in this research domain. Patterns of structure and function in the ventral striatum, frontal regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and amygdala are common across addictive disorders and are related to both real-world risky behaviors and self-report measures of negative urgency. We propose that the time has come to move past considering this trait and these disorders as completely separate entities, and instead for the field to consider how general patterns of convergence across these disorders can lead to a more transdiagnostic approach to treatment and intervention. We suggest future work utilize these convergent patterns in the development of animal models of negative urgency, in the identification and testing of prime pharmacological and physiological interventions, and as objective biomarkers to be used when testing behavioral, pharmacological, and physiological intervention effectiveness. Little empirical work has been done to date in these areas and advances in these nascent fields would advance understanding and applications of the neuroscience of negative urgency.

AB  - Attachment is transmitted from one generation to the next. Adult attachment has been shown to predict the security or insecurity of children's attachment relationship with their parents. In search for the mechanism of intergenerational transmission of attachment sensitive parenting has been the main focus of research during the past four decades. Meta-analytic work confirmed the role of sensitive parenting, but a large explanatory gap remains to be explained. Parental mentalization has not yet fulfilled its promise as a bridge across the transmission gap. Here we suggest a model of intergenerational transmission that includes context and differential susceptibility, and we argue that the concept of parenting should be broadened to include autonomy support, limit-setting, protective parenting, parental warmth, and repair of mismatches.

AB  - Accurately diagnosing autism spectrum disorders in adulthood can be challenging. Structured questionnaires and diagnostic measures are frequently used to assist case recognition and diagnosis. This study reviewed research evidence on structured questionnaires and diagnostic measures published since the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence evidence update. The Cochrane library, Medline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched. In all, 20 studies met inclusion criteria. Sensitivity and specificity of structured questionnaires were best for individuals with previously confirmed autism spectrum disorder diagnoses and reduced in participants referred for diagnostic assessments, with discrimination of autism spectrum disorder from mental health conditions especially limited. For adults with intellectual disability, diagnostic accuracy increased when a combination of structured questionnaires were used. Evidence suggests some utility of diagnostic measures in identifying autism spectrum disorder among clinic referrals, although specificity for diagnosis was relatively low. In mental health settings, the use of a single structured questionnaire is unlikely to accurately identify adults without autism spectrum disorder or differentiate autism spectrum disorder from mental health conditions. This is important as adults seeking an autism spectrum disorder diagnostic assessment are likely to have co-existing mental health conditions. Robust autism spectrum disorder assessment tools specifically for use in adult diagnostic health services in the presence of co-occurring mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders are a research priority.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Recent research has highlighted that psychotic experiences are far more prevalent than psychotic disorders and associated with the full range of mental disorders. A particularly strong association between psychotic experiences and suicidal behavior has recently been noted.
   OBJECTIVE To provide a quantitative synthesis of the literature examining the longitudinal association between psychotic experiences and subsequent suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide deaths in the general population.
   DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycINFO from their inception until September 2017 for longitudinal population studies on psychotic experiences and subsequent suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide death.
   STUDY SELECTION Two authors searched for original articles that reported a prospective assessment of psychotic experiences and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or suicide death in general population samples, with at least 1 follow-up point.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors conducted independent data extraction. Authors of included studies were contacted for information where necessary. We assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. We calculated pooled odds ratios using a random-effects model. A secondary analysis assessed the mediating role of co-occurring psychopathology.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Psychotic experiences and subsequent suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide death.
   RESULTS Of a total of 2540 studies retrieved, 10 met inclusion criteria. These 10 studies reported on 84 285 participants from 12 different samples and 23 countries. Follow-up periods ranged from 1 month to 27 years. Individuals who reported psychotic experiences had an increase in the odds of future suicidal ideation (5 articles; n = 56 191; odds ratio [OR], 2.39 [95% CI, 1.62-3.51]), future suicide attempt (8 articles; n = 66 967; OR, 3.15 [95% CI, 2.23-4.45]), and future suicide death (1 article; n = 15 049; OR, 4.39 [95% CI, 1.63-11.78]). Risk was increased in excess of that explained by co-occurring psychopathology: suicidal ideation (adjusted OR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.09-2.32]) and suicide attempt (adjusted OR, 2.68 [95% CI, 1.71-4.21]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Individuals with psychotic experiences are at increased risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide death. Psychotic experiences are important clinical markers of risk for future suicidal behavior.

AB  - Background: Executive functions (EFs) are involved in the control of basic psychological processes such as attention and memory and also contribute to emotion regulation. Research on the presence of EFs impairments in insomnia yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of the literature on three EFs: inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility in adults with insomnia in order to investigate the presence and magnitude of insomnia-related EFs impairments.
   Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched. Risk of bias assessment of included studies was performed by two independent researchers. Findings were summarised using both a narrative approach and meta-analysis. Cohen's d was calculated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as effect size of between groups differences.
   Results: Twenty-eight studies comparing adult individuals with a diagnosis of insomnia and healthy controls on neuropsychological measures of EFs were included. Narrative synthesis revealed substantial variability across study findings. Factors that were primarily hypothesised to account for this variability are: objective sleep impairments and test sensitivity. Exploratorymeta-analysis showed impaired performance of small to moderate magnitude in individuals with insomnia as compared to controls in reaction times, but not accuracy rates, of inhibitory control (d = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.52 to -0.13) and cognitive flexibility tasks (d = -0.30, 95% CI: -0.59 to -0.01). Performance in working memory tasks was also significantly impacted (d = -0.19, 95%CI: -0.38 to -0.00). Effects sizes were larger when insomnia was associated with objective sleep impairments, rather than normal sleep.
   Conclusions: We gathered evidence supporting small to moderate deficits in EFs in individuals with insomnia. Due to the small sample size results should be considered preliminary and interpreted carefully.

AB  - All three extant right whales [Eubalaena australis (Southern; SRW), glacialis (North Atlantic; NARW), and japonica (North Pacific; NPRW)] were heavily exploited, and the status of the two northern hemisphere species remains precarious. Recently, limited gains made by the NARW have been reversed and urgent changes to management approaches are needed if extinction is to be averted. By contrast, some SRW populations are recovering. Given their close phylogenetic relationship, morphological, demographic, and ecological similarities, the contrasting recovery rates between populations and species provide an opportunity to apply a comparative approach to inform the differences in recovery as follows. (1) Recovery: All right whale species were internationally protected in 1931, but NARW, eastern NPRW and some SRW populations have barely recovered from whaling, while others are doing so at maximal rates. Are these differences a legacy of extreme depletion (e.g., loss of genetic diversity and cultural knowledge) or primarily due to anthropogenic factors (e.g., high mortality from ship strike and fisheries entanglement)? If modern anthropogenic threats are not affecting remote SRW populations, can these serve as baseline populations for comparison with NARW and NPRW? (2) Linking individuals to population-level responses: In wild mammals, strong links exist between reproductive indices and environmental conditions within the context of life-history strategies. Individual identification of whales provides the ability to track survival, reproduction and other demographic parameters, and their population-level consequences, providing the tools with which to uncover these links. Robust life-history analyses are now available for NARW and several SRW populations, linking demography with environmental conditions, providing the potential for teasing out important influencing factors. (3) Adapting to shifting resources: Recent reproductive declines in NARW appear linked to changing food resources. While we know some large-scale movement patterns for NARW and a few SRW populations, we know little of mesoscale movements. For NPRW and some SRW populations, even broad-scale movements are poorly understood. In the face of climate change, can methodological advances help identify Eubalaena distributional and migratory responses? (4) Emergent diseases and the vulnerability of populations under stress: Marine mammals are vulnerable to infectious diseases,

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to determine the optimal rTMS parameters, such as the intensity, frequency and the delivered pattern of rTMS stimulation.
   Methods: EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Cochrane data bases were researched for papers published before March 12, 2018. Studies investigating the anti-depression effects of rTMS over PFC in patients with PD were considered. The main outcomes of pre- and post-rTMS treatment as well as score changes were all extracted. The mean effect size was estimated by calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) by using fixed or random effect models as appropriate.
   Results: Nine studies containing 137 PD patients with depression were included. The pooled results showed significant pre-post anti-depressive effects of rTMS over PFC in PD patients with depression (SMD = -0.80, P < 0.00001). The subgroup analyses of stimulation intensity, frequencies, and models also revealed significant effects (Intensities: 90% RMT: SMD = -1.16, P = 0.0006; > 100% RMT: SMD = -0.82, P < 0.0001. Frequencies: < 1.0 Hz: SMD = -0.83, P = 0.03; 5.0 Hz: SMD = -1.10, P < 0.0001; >= 10.0 Hz: SMD = -0.55, P = 0.02. Models: Continuous: SMD = -0.79, P < 0.0001; Discontinuous: SMD = -0.84, P = 0.02). But the results of the studies with place-controlled designs were not significant (Overall: SMD = -0.27, P = 0.54. Intensities: 90% RMT: SMD = 0.27, P = 0.68; 100% RMT: SMD = -0.32, P = 0.33. Frequencies: 5.0 Hz: SMD = -0.87, P = 0.10; >= 10.0 Hz: SMD = 0.27, P = 0.66. Models: Continuous: SMD = -0.28, P = 0.68; Discontinuous: SMD = -0.32, P = 0.33). The greater effect sizes of rTMS with 90% RMT, 5.0Hz in discontinuous days can be observed rather than the other parameters in both kinds of analyses across study design.
   Conclusions: rTMS may have a significant positive pre-post anti-depressive effect over PFC on patients with depression, especially by using 5.0Hz frequency with 90% RMT intensity in discontinuous days, which may produce better effects than other parameters. The real effect, though, was not different from that of the placebo. Future studies with larger sample sizes and high-quality studies are needed to further corroborate our results and to identify the optimal rTMS protocols.

AB  - BackgroundDog-assisted therapy (DAT) is a non-pharmacological intervention based on the interaction between patients and dogs, which has been proposed to help adults with dementia. However, evidence to support it is lacking. Thus, we aim to evaluate the effects of DAT on this population and to assess the certainty of the evidence of the RCTs estimates.MethodsA systematic search was performed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental (QE) controlled studies published up to March 2018, which evaluated the beneficial and deleterious effects of DAT in adults with dementia. Mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated and random effects meta-analyses were performed. Certainty of evidence was assessed for RCTs estimates using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The study protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018090434).ResultsTen studies (six RCTs and four QE controlled studies) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis of RCTs showed no effect of DAT in daily life activities (SMD: 0.16; 95% CI: -0.80 to 1.12), depression (SMD: -0.45; 95% CI: -2.81 to 1.91), agitation (SDM: -1.12; 95% CI: -2.67 to 0.43), quality of life (SDM: 0.16; 95% CI: -0.41 to 0.73), and cognitive impairment (SDM: -0.52; 95% CI: -1.33 to 0.30), but it found a beneficial effect in apathy (1 study, n=37, MD: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.36). All outcomes had a very low certainty of evidence according to GRADE methodology.ConclusionsRCTs evidence of very low certainty suggests that, in adults with dementia, DAT has no effect in daily life activities, depression, agitation, quality of life, and cognitive impairment, although one small study found an apparent beneficial effect in apathy. More well-designed and correctly reported studies are needed in order to provide a conclusion.Trial registrationCRD42018090434 (PROSPERO).

AB  - Based on the concept of the tripartite synapse, we have reviewed the role of glucose-derived compounds in glycolytic pathways in astroglial cells. Glucose provides energy and substrate replenishment for brain activity, such as glutamate and lipid synthesis. In addition, glucose metabolism in the astroglial cytoplasm results in products such as lactate, methylglyoxal, and glutathione, which modulate receptors and channels in neurons. Glucose has four potential destinations in neural cells, and it is possible to propose a crossroads in "X" that can be used to describe these four destinations. Glucose-6P can be used either for glycogen synthesis or the pentose phosphate pathway on the left and right arms of the X, respectively. Fructose-6P continues through the glycolysis pathway until pyruvate is formed but can also act as the initial compound in the hexosamine pathway, representing the left and right legs of the X, respectively. We describe each glucose destination and its regulation, indicating the products of these pathways and how they can affect synaptic communication. Extracellular L-lactate, either generated from glucose or from glycogen, binds to HCAR1, a specific receptor that is abundantly localized in perivascular and post-synaptic membranes and regulates synaptic plasticity. Methylglyoxal, a product of a deviation of glycolysis, and its derivative D-lactate are also released by astrocytes and bind to GABA(A) receptors and HCAR1, respectively. Glutathione, in addition to its antioxidant role, also binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors in the synaptic cleft. Finally, we examined the hexosamine pathway and evaluated the effect of GlcNAc-modification on key proteins that regulate the other glucose destinations.

AB  - The homeostasis of iron is of fundamental importance in the central nervous system (CNS) to ensure biological processes such as oxygen transport, mitochondrial respiration or myelin synthesis. Dyshomeostasis and accumulation of iron can be observed during aging and both are shared characteristics of several neurodegenerative diseases. Iron-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may lead to protein aggregation and cellular toxicity. The process of misfolding and aggregation of neuronal proteins such as alpha-synuclein, Tau, amyloid beta (A beta), TDP-43 or SOD1 is a common hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders and iron has been shown to facilitate protein aggregation. Thus, both, iron and aggregating proteins are proposed to amplify their detrimental effects in the disease state. In this review, we give an overview on effects of iron on aggregation of different proteins involved in neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we discuss the proposed mechanisms of iron-mediated toxicity and protein aggregation emphasizing the red-ox chemistry and protein-binding properties of iron. Finally, we address current therapeutic approaches harnessing iron chelation as a disease-modifying intervention in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - Secondary freshwater salinization, a common anthropogenic alteration, has detrimental, lethal and sub-lethal effects on aquatic biota. Ions fromsecondary salinization can become toxic to terrestrial and aquatic organisms when exposed to salinized runoff that causes periodic high-concentration pulses. Gradual, low-level (less than 1000 ppmsalinity) increases in salt concentrations are also commonly documented in regionswith urbanization, agriculture, drilling and mining. Despite widespread low-level salt increases, little is known about the biological and ecological consequences in coupled riparian-stream systems. Recent research indicates lethal and even sub-lethal levels of ions can subsidize or stress microbial decomposer and macroinvertebrate detritivores that could lead to alterations of three riparian-stream pathways: (i) salinized runoff that changes microbial decomposer and macroinvertebrate detritivore and algae performance leading to changes in composition and processing of detrital pools; (ii) riparian plant salt uptake and altered litter chemistry, and litterfall for riparian and aquatic detritivores and their subsequent enrichment, stimulating decomposition rates and production of dissolved and fine organic matter; and (iii) salt consumption in salinized soils could increase riparian detritivore growth, decomposition and dissolved organic matter production. Subsidy-stress and reciprocal flows in coupled riparian-stream connections provide frameworks to identify the extent and magnitude of changes in detrital processing from salinization.

AB  - Under global change, the ion concentration of aquatic ecosystems is changing worldwide. Many freshwater ecosystems are being salinized by anthropogenic salt inputs, whereas many naturally saline ones are being diluted by agricultural drainages. This occurs concomitantly with changes in other stressors, which can result in additive, antagonistic or synergistic effects on organisms. We reviewed experimental studies that manipulated salinity and other abiotic stressors, on inland and transitional aquatic habitats, to (i) synthesize their main effects on organisms' performance, (ii) quantify the frequency of joint effect types across studies and (iii) determine the overall individual and joint effects and their variation among salinity-stressor pairs and organism groups using meta-analyses. Additive effects were slightly more frequent (54%) than non-additive ones (46%) across all the studies (n = 105 responses). However, antagonistic effects were dominant for the stressor pair salinity and toxicants (44%, n = 43), transitional habitats (48%, n = 31) and vertebrates (71%, n = 21). Meta-analyses showed detrimental additive joint effects of salinity and other stressors on organism performance and a greater individual impact of salinity than the other stressors. These results were consistent across stressor pairs and organism types. These findings suggest that strategies to mitigate multiple stressor impacts on aquatic ecosystems should prioritize restoring natural salinity concentrations.

AB  - Microbial plankton respiration is the key determinant in the balance between the storage of organic carbon in the oceans or its conversion to carbon dioxide with accompanying consumption of dissolved oxygen. Over the past 50 years, dissolved oxygen concentrations have decreased in many parts of the world's oceans, and this trend of ocean deoxygenation is predicted to continue. Yet despite its pivotal role in ocean deoxygenation, microbial respiration remains one of the least constrained microbial metabolic processes. Improved understanding of the magnitude and variability of respiration, including attribution to component plankton groups, and quantification of the respiratory quotient, would enable better predictions, and projections of the intensity and extent of ocean deoxygenation and of the integrative impact of ocean deoxygenation, ocean acidification, warming, and changes in nutrient concentration and stoichiometry on marine carbon storage. This study will synthesize current knowledge of respiration in relation to deoxygenation, including the drivers of its variability, identify key unknowns in our ability to project future scenarios and suggest an approach to move the field forward.

AB  - Natural and effective interaction with humanoid robots should involve social cognitive mechanisms of the human brain that normally facilitate social interaction between humans. Recent research has indicated that the presence and efficiency of these mechanisms in human-robot interaction (HRI) might be contingent on the adoption of a set of attitudes, mindsets, and beliefs concerning the robot's inner machinery. Current research is investigating the factors that influence these mindsets, and how they affect HRI. This review focuses on a specific mindset, namely the "intentional mindset" in which intentionality is attributed to another agent. More specifically, we focus on the concept of adopting the intentional stance toward robots, i.e., the tendency to predict and explain the robots' behavior with reference to mental states. We discuss the relationship between adoption of intentional stance and lower-level mechanisms of social cognition, and we provide a critical evaluation of research methods currently employed in this field, highlighting common pitfalls in the measurement of attitudes and mindsets.

AB  - Background: Spatial ability is vital for human survival and development. However, the relationship between large-scale and small-scale spatial ability remains poorly understood. To address this issue from a novel perspective, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies to determine the shared and distinct neural bases of these two forms of spatial ability.
   Methods: We searched Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar for studies regarding "spatial ability" published within the last 20 years (January 1988 through June 2018). A final total of 103 studies (Table 1) involving 2,085 participants (male = 1,116) and 2,586 foci were incorporated into the meta-analysis.
   Results: Large-scale spatial ability was associated with activation in the limbic lobe, posterior lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, right anterior lobe, frontal lobe, and right sub-lobar area. Small-scale spatial ability was associated with activation in the parietal lobe, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, right posterior lobe, and left sub-lobar area. Furthermore, conjunction analysis revealed overlapping regions in the sub-gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, right superior parietal lobule, right middle occipital gyrus, right superior occipital gyrus, left inferior occipital gyrus, and precuneus. The contrast analysis demonstrated that the parahippocampal gyrus, left lingual gyrus, culmen, right middle temporal gyrus, left declive, left superior occipital gyrus, and right lentiform nucleus were more strongly activated during large-scale spatial tasks. In contrast, the precuneus, right inferior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, left supramarginal gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, right inferior occipital gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus were more strongly activated during small-scale spatial tasks. Our results further indicated that there is no absolute difference in the cognitive strategies associated with the two forms of spatial ability (egocentric/allocentric).
   Conclusion: The results of the present study verify and expand upon the theoretical model of spatial ability proposed by Hegarty et al. Our analysis revealed a shared neural basis between large- and small-scale spatial abilities, as well as specific yet independent neural bases underlying each. Based on these findings, we proposed a more comprehensive version of the behavioral model.

AB  - BackgroundThe clinical efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in treatment resistant patients (at least 4 medication trials) appears to be well accepted and forms the coverage policies and rTMS's use in many of the largest US payers. However, less is known about rTMS's use in patients who have undergone 1 failed medication trial. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the clinical efficacy of rTMS in patients after 1 medication trials.MethodsA systematic review of the literature was undertaken to identify all articles which addressed the use of rTMS in 1 medication trial. All types of study designs were included and assessed for quality and strength of evidence using: GRADE and CEBM. Searches of peer reviewed articles were undertaken for the year 2000 to the present. All languages were considered. Electronic databases were searched and included: PubMed and EBSCO. Evidence assessment websites were also searched and included: Cochrane, NICE, AHRQ, and ICER. Additionally, the clinical guidelines for specialty societies which use rTMS was searched. Hand searches of the reference sections of identified articles was also undertaken.ResultsElectronic and other sources identified 165 after duplicates were removed. Twenty two articles were assessed for eligibility and ultimately 10 articles were included in the systematic review and graded. Six articles were graded high quality (CEBM/GRADE: 1c/B) demonstrating that the use of rTMS was clinically efficacious in patients after 1 medication trial. Four additional trials demonstrated a positive effect of rTMS in patients after 1 medication trial but were of a lower quality.ConclusionThe use of rTMS in patients after 1 medication trial should be considered. US payers should consider revising their coverage policies to include the use of rTMS in these patients.

AB  - BackgroundSocioeconomic disadvantage is a fundamental cause of morbidity and mortality. One of the most important ways that governments buffer the adverse consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage is through the provision of social assistance. We conducted a systematic review of research examining the health impact of social assistance programs in high-income countries.MethodsWe systematically searched Embase, Medline, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to December 2017 for peer-reviewed studies published in English-language journals. We identified empirical patterns through a qualitative synthesis of the evidence. We also evaluated the empirical rigour of the selected literature.ResultsSeventeen studies met our inclusion criteria. Thirteen descriptive studies rated as weak (n=7), moderate (n=4), and strong (n=2) found that social assistance is associated with adverse health outcomes and that social assistance recipients exhibit worse health outcomes relative to non-recipients. Four experimental and quasi-experimental studies, all rated as strong (n=4), found that efforts to limit the receipt of social assistance or reduce its generosity (also known as welfare reform) were associated with adverse health trends.ConclusionsEvidence from the existing literature suggests that social assistance programs in high-income countries are failing to maintain the health of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. These findings may in part reflect the influence of residual confounding due to unobserved characteristics that distinguish recipients from non-recipients. They may also indicate that the scope and generosity of existing programs are insufficient to offset the negative health consequences of severe socioeconomic disadvantage.

AB  - Background: In the last decade there has been a progressive increase in the use of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) that are not yet under international control. In particular, novel synthetic opioids (NSOs) have reappeared on the recreational drug market in the last few years. As a result, the use of NSOs has increased rapidly. This poses an emerging and demanding challenge to public health. Aim: To raise awareness among clinicians and other professionals about NPSs, especially NSOs, to summarize current knowledge about pharmacological properties, forms of NSO on the market, pattern of use, effects and consequences of use. Methods: An electronic search was carried out on the Medline/PubMed and Google Scholar databases to find selected search terms. Results: Some NPSs are already controlled, while others can be legally sold directly on the drug market (mainly via internet, less so by drug dealers) or be used as precursors for the synthesis of other designer drugs that mimic the psychoactive effects of controlled substances. Potential side-effects of NSOs include miosis, sedation, respiratory depression, hypothermia, inhibition of gastrointestinal propulsion, death (from opioid overdose). Conclusions: The severity of the opioid crisis has intensified with the introduction of highly potent NSOs on the drug market. As long as addicts are dying from overdose or similar causes, there is something more constructive to do than waiting for addicts to overdose on heroin at a place located near a remedy, as if to say, within reach of naloxone.

AB  - Objectives: These practice guidelines for the treatment of alcohol use disorders during pregnancy were developed by members of the International Task Force of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry and the International Association for Women's Mental Health. Methods: We performed a systematic review of all available publications and extracted data from national and international guidelines. The Task Force evaluated the data with respect to the strength of evidence for the efficacy and safety of each medication. Results and Discussion: There is no safe level of alcohol use during pregnancy. Abstinence is recommended. Ideally, women should stop alcohol use when pregnancy is planned and, in any case, as soon as pregnancy is known. Detecting patterns of alcohol maternal drinking should be systematically conducted at first antenatal visit and throughout pregnancy. Brief interventions are recommended in the case of low or moderate risk of alcohol use. Low doses of benzodiazepines, for the shortest duration, may be used to prevent alcohol withdrawal symptoms when high and chronic alcohol intake is stopped and hospitalisation is recommended. Due to the low level of evidence and/or to low benefit/risk ratio, pharmacological treatment for maintenance of abstinence should not be used during pregnancy. At birth, foetal alcohol spectrum disorders must be searched for, and alcohol metabolites should be measured in meconium of neonates in any doubt of foetal alcohol exposure.

AB  - Aim: Appraise the evidence on the outcomes of Leg Clubs on ulcer healing, psychosocial outcomes, patient safety, cost and experiences of Leg Club members. Background: The Leg Club is a community-based social model of care in 30 UK locations and nine overseas for treating patients with chronic leg wounds. However, its cumulative effectiveness has not been reviewed to-date. Methods: Systematic review of primary research relating to the impact and quality of care of Leg Clubs treating patients with leg ulcers. Six electronic databases were systematically searched using the MeSH term 'leg ulcer', including other representative terms, in combination with 'Leg Club'. The quality of individual studies was assessed using appraisal tools. The confidence in the quantitative evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE); and the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) assessed the quality of qualitative findings. Findings: A total of 17 relevant publications were identified. Out of the 17 articles, four publications represent findings from randomised controlled trial (RCT). Thus, evidence from 14 independent studies involving at least 532 participants were included in the synthesis of this review. The quality of the evidence varied across the different outcomes and were mostly low or of very low quality. Findings from one underpowered RCT from Australia reporting on clinical, patient-reported outcomes and economic outcomes were evaluated as moderate quality. Studies indicate that the Leg Club model has a positive impact on ulcer healing and recurrence, mood, sleep, quality of life and pain. Moreover, only three studies assessed wound infections and reported no infections had occurred during treatment at the Leg Clubs. Economic evaluations find Leg Clubs to be probably more costeffective than usual care. Both patients and nurses projected positive views about the Leg Clubs, with particular emphasis on improved social interactions and delivery of patient-centred care.

AB  - Rare earth elements (REEs) have recently received particular attention due to their accumulation in the environment. Such heightened recognition prompted our evaluation of the possible occurrence of La-induced plant hormesis in the peer-reviewed literature. This study revealed 703 La-induced hormetic concentration/dose responses in plants, which were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed. The maximum (MAX) biological response to low La concentrations/doses is commonly below 150% of control response, with a geometric mean of 142% at 56 mu M (geometric mean). The geometric mean concentration of the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was 249 mu M. The MAX:NOAEL distance was commonly below 5-fold, with a geometric mean of 4.5-fold. Hormetic concentration/dose responses varied as per the growth substrate pH, number of concentrations/doses below the NOAEL, and time window. These results provide a unique insight into the effects of low doses of La on plant growth, as well as offer means for improving experimental designs to assess low dose effects.

AB  - This article is intended to explain the Pierre Bourdieu's concept of habitus to researchers concerned with patient-nurse interactions, nursing practices and nurses' professional and individual selves and identities. It emphasizes both the field of care work and nurses' personal characteristics. Nursing is a therapeutic interpersonal process that is intended to promote individuals' wellbeing and health. However, very few studies have evaluated how it developed in a systematic way. Pierre Bourdieu's concept of habitus can lead the way for nurses who would like to understand patient-nurse interactions, nursing practices and the field of care work. Habitus affects how nurses approach their patients, how they understand and interpret patient conditions and their needs. Therefore, habitus affects how nurses understand and interpret the status and care needs of patients under the circumstances including their individual characteristics. The field of care work is also a metaphor for a social site where nurses engage in care-related activities. Ultimately, nursing habitus is developed by both individual and structural factors that are complex and diverse. It affects nurses' careers and motivation to provide services. Assessing patient-nurse interactions, nursing practices and nurses' professional and individual self and identities in this way can affect the quality of care positively.

AB  - The basal ganglia (BG), an organized network of nuclei that integrates cortical information, play a crucial role in controlling motor function. In fact, movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD) are caused by the degeneration of specific structures within the BG. There is substantial evidence supporting the idea that cannabinoids may constitute novel promising compounds for the treatment of movement disorders as neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents. This potential therapeutic role of cannabinoids is based, among other qualities, on their capacity to reduce oxidative injury and excitotoxicity, control calcium influx and limit the toxicity of reactive microglia. The mechanisms involved in these effects are related to CB1 and CB2 receptor activation, although some of the effects are CB receptor independent. Thus, taking into account the aforementioned properties, compounds that act on the endocannabinoid system could be useful as a basis for developing disease-modifying therapies for PD and HD.

AB  - The absolute value of the nuclear magnetic shielding tensor, sigma, cannot be directly measured as such, though at the moment experimental devices are available to obtain them by extrapolation to zero-density limit. This is the reason why since the beginning of NMR spectroscopy to obtain the experimental values of this parameter required the interplay between theory and experiments.
   Early this century it was experimentally probed that the Ramsey-Flygare model, largely used to obtain the most accurate semiexperimental values of shieldings, does not work well when heavy-atom containing molecules are considered. Then, the search for a relativistic relationship like Ramsey-Flygare became highly necessary. This search has taken some years for being successful.
   Within the research programme that focused on such a goal, the first important breakthrough was the finding of the relativistic Hamiltonian for spin-rotations interactions. Once this crucial step was overcome it was possible to develop some relativistic models, being the most accurate the so-called M-V. We shall show here some of the most important steps that were given in the search for a relativistic relationship between sigma and the spin-rotation tensor, M. We will describe the bottom-up procedure that make it possible, together with relativistic (four-component) theories of shieldings and spin-rotations that were published recently.
   Why it was important to find that new relationship? There are now experimental developments that permits direct measurements of absolute shieldings in gas-phase NMR spectroscopy, and so, to compare with. It is also possible to accurately calculate them by using four-component methodologies, from which very small effects like nuclear charge distribution, Breit/Gaunt electron-electron interactions and QED effects are included. All of them will be highlighted here in some detail.
   Lastly we shall stress the new understandings that arise from these developments together with some new challenges.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that angry faces do not "pop-out" of crowds, and that the evidence for such effects has tended to arise from methodological issues and stimulus confounds. In contrast, evidence that angry faces exert special influence at later stages of information processing is accumulating. Here we use two common paradigms to show that participants have difficulty disengaging attention from angry faces relative to happy faces. Experiment 1 used a visual search task to show that angry crowds took longer to search. Experiment 2 used an exogenous cueing paradigm to show that brief onset angry faces held attention and delayed responses on a primary task. This suggests that when seen, they engage attention for longer time, but they do not have the preattentive features that would allow them to pop-out. Together, these two different experimental paradigms and realistic stimulus sets suggest that angry faces resist attentional disengagement.

AB  - The cerebellum has a well-established role in controlling motor functions such coordination, balance, posture, and skilled learning. There is mounting evidence that it might also play a critical role in non-motor functions such as cognition and emotion. It is therefore not surprising that cerebellar defects are associated with a wide array of diseases including ataxia, dystonia, tremor, schizophrenia, dyslexia, and autism spectrum disorder. What is intriguing is that a seemingly uniform circuit that is often described as being "simple" should carry out all of these behaviors. Analyses of how cerebellar circuits develop have revealed that such descriptions massively underestimate the complexity of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is in fact highly patterned and organized around a series of parasagittal stripes and transverse zones. This topographic architecture partitions all cerebellar circuits into functional modules that are thought to enhance processing power during cerebellar dependent behaviors. What are arguably the most remarkable features of cerebellar topography are the developmental processes that produce them. This review is concerned with the genetic and cellular mechanisms that orchestrate cerebellar patterning. We place a major focus on how Purkinje cells control multiple aspects of cerebellar circuit assembly. Using this model, we discuss evidence for how "zebra-like" patterns in Purkinje cells sculpt the cerebellum, how specific genetic cues mediate the process, and how activity refines the patterns into an adult map that is capable of executing various functions. We also discuss how defective Purkinje cell patterning might impact the pathogenesis of neurological conditions.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are common and a major source of disability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Primary and secondary insomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RDB), central sleep apnea, restless legs, and nocturnal akinesia are common sleep disturbances in PD. Prodromal presence of RBD is associated with a more severe motor and non-motor PD subtype implying a significant disease-modifying effect of this parasomnia. Other disease-modifying mechanisms of sleep disturbances in PD include impaired glymphatic clearance, endoplasmic reticulum stress, nocturnal brain deoxygenation and inflammatory processes among others. Impairments of neural circuit switching and imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations are likely responsible for episodic sleep disturbances, in particular RBD. As neural circuits may predict patterns of alpha-synuclein propagation in the nervous system, impairments of such circuits are of high relevance for PD pathophysiology. Future research is needed to determine whether appropriate treatment for disturbed sleep might slow progression of PD.

AB  - Glycation is the non-enzymatic reaction between reactive dicarbonyls and amino groups, and gives rise to a variety of different reaction products known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Accumulation of AGEs on proteins is inevitable, and is associated with the aging process. Importantly, glycation is highly relevant in diabetic patients that experience periods of hyperglycemia. AGEs also play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. The resulting expanded polyglutamine stretch in the huntingtin (HTT) protein induces its misfolding and aggregation, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. HD patients exhibit chorea and psychiatric disturbances, along with abnormalities in glucose and energy homeostasis. Interestingly, an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus has been reported in HD and in other CAG triplet repeat disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the connection between glycation and HD progression remain unclear. In this review, we explore the possible connection between glycation and proteostasis imbalances in HD, and posit that it may contribute to disease progression, possibly by accelerating protein aggregation and deposition. Finally, we review therapeutic interventions that might be able to alleviate the negative impact of glycation in HD.

AB  - Increasing evidence points to biological sex as an important factor in the development and phenotypical expression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Risk of developing PD is twice as high in men than women, but women have a higher mortality rate and faster progression of the disease. Moreover, motor and nonmotor symptoms, response to treatments and disease risk factors differ between women and men. Altogether, sex-related differences in PD support the idea that disease development might involve distinct pathogenic mechanisms (or the same mechanism but in a different way) in male and female patients. This review summarizes the most recent knowledge concerning differences between women and men in PD clinical features, risk factors, response to treatments and mechanisms underlying the disease pathophysiology. Unraveling how the pathology differently affect the two sexes might allow the development of tailored interventions and the design of innovative programs that meet the distinct needs of men and women, improving patient care.

AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the potential associations between chronic kidney disease of uncertain or non-traditional etiology (CKDnT) and agrochemicals, heat stress, heavy metals, and other factors identified in the literature in any region of the world and at any time.
   Methods. This was a systematic review of the most frequent exposures suspected to be possible causes of CKDnT. A search was conducted of PubMed, LILACS, World Wide Science electronic databases, among other sources. Only medium- and high-quality studies were included. The synthesis of evidence included a narrative synthesis, meta-analysis, and meta-regression.
   Results. Four systematic reviews and 61 primary studies were included. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that exposure to agrochemicals and working in agriculture increase the risk of CKDnT, but this only reached significance for working in agriculture. When cross-sectional studies were excluded, agrochemical exposure became significant. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in the effect sizes.
   Conclusions. Based on the existing evidence and the precautionary principle, it is important to implement preventive measures to mitigate the damage caused by CKDnT to both agricultural workers and their communities (i.e., improvement of working conditions, cautious management of agrochemicals, etc.). More high-quality research is needed to measure impact and to build the evidence base.

AB  - BackgroundThe opioid epidemic in the United States is a national public health crisis. In recent years, marijuana legalization has been increasingly adopted by state governments as a policy intervention to control the opioid epidemic under the premise that marijuana and opioids are substitutive substances. The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize the empirical evidence regarding the impact of state marijuana laws on opioid overdose mortality and other opioid-related health outcomes.MethodA comprehensive search of the research literature in 18 bibliographic databases returned 6640 records, with 5601 abstracts reviewed, 29 full text articles screened for eligibility, and 16 eligible studies included in the systematic review. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software was used to generate summary estimates, forest plots, funnel plots, and heterogeneity statistics.ResultsOf the 16 eligible studies, 4 assessed the association of state marijuana law status with opioid overdose mortality, 7 with prescription opioids dispensed, and the remaining with nonmedical use and opioid-related hospitalizations. Random effects modeling based on pooled data revealed that legalizing marijuana for medical use was associated with a statistically non-significant 8% reduction in opioid overdose mortality (95% confidence interval: -0.21 to 0.04; p=0.201) and a 7% reduction in prescription opioids dispensed (95% confidence interval: -0.13 to -0.01; p=0.017). Legalizing marijuana for recreational use was associated with an additional 7% reduction in opioid overdose mortality in Colorado and 6% reduction in opioid prescriptions among fee-for-service Medicaid and managed care enrollees.ConclusionsLegalizing marijuana might contribute to a modest reduction in opioid prescriptions. Evidence about the effect of marijuana legalization on opioid overdose mortality is inconsistent and inconclusive. If any, the effectiveness of state marijuana laws in reducing opioid overdose mortality appears to be rather small and limited to states with operational marijuana dispensaries. It remains unclear whether the presumed benefit of legalizing marijuana in reducing opioid-related harms outweighs the policy's externalities, such as its impact on mental health and traffic safety.

In current scenario, emotion recognition is the latest challenge in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and affective computing. An extensive research has been addressed over the past two decades but accuracy and real time analysis are still some challenges in this field. Emotion recognition is useful in various fields such as intelligent automobile systems, medical diagnosis, security, e-tutoring and marketing. This survey paper will review the research works carried out in the fields of human emotion detection from facial images, speech and brain signals. This paper also provides an outline of the areas where emotion recognition is more required.

AB  - Objective: To inform obstetricians and psychiatrists about the safety of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) administration during pregnancy and to reconcile conflicting recommendations concerning this treatment. Methods: A systematically conducted overview was undertaken on the safety of ECT during pregnancy. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, and Ovid were independently searched by 2 of the authors from January 2015 to March 2017 using the following search terms: electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, and electroshock combined with pregnancy and reviews. Articles were reviewed and critically appraised using components of the PRISMA and AMSTAR systematic review assessment tools. Results: Of the 9 articles that were identified, 5 publications of varying methodological quality met inclusion criteria and involved a range of 32 to 339 patients. The most common problems that occurred in association with ECT were fetal arrhythmia, fetal bradycardia, premature birth, developmental delay, abdominal pain, uterine contraction, vaginal bleeding, placental abruption, and threatened abortion. The number of fetal deaths in each of the reviews ranged from 2 to 12. The authors of 1 of the 5 reviews recommended that ECT only be used as a last resort, whereas the authors of the other reviews took the stance that the administration of ECT during pregnancy was relatively safe. Differences in recommendations among reviews were in part due to inclusion criteria and how adverse events were attributed to ECT. Conclusions: Our overview supports the conclusion, which has also been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Psychiatric Association, that administration of ECT during pregnancy is relatively safe. Conclusions about safety, however, will become better established with the availability of more data.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway, which leads to the cardinal motor symptoms of the disease - tremor, rigidity and postural instability. A number of non-motor symptoms are also associated with PD, including cognitive impairment, mood disturbances and dysfunction of gastrointestinal and autonomic systems. Current therapies provide symptomatic relief but do not halt the disease process, so there is an urgent need for preventative strategies. Lifestyle interventions such as aerobic exercise have shown potential to lower the risk of developing PD and to alleviate both motor and non-motor symptoms. However, there is a lack of large-scale randomised clinical trials that have employed exercise in PD patients. This review will focus on the evidence from studies on rodent models of PD, for employing exercise as an intervention for both motor and non-motor symptoms.

AB  - Psychotic disorders often have been linked with violence. However, studies have shown that people with a psychotic disorder are more often victim than perpetrator of violence. The objective of this meta-analysis was to review prevalence rates for different types of victimization and to identify risk factors associated with victimization. Based on a search in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, 27 studies were found with samples consisting of adults with a psychotic disorder and possible victimization occurring during adulthood and data on "violent victimization," "sexual victimization," "non-violent victimization," and/or "victimization not otherwise specified." The median prevalence rate for violent victimization was 20%, for sexual victimization 20%, nonviolent victimization 19%, and for victimization not otherwise specified 19%. Victimization rates were approximately 4-6 times higher than in the general community. Meta-analyses showed the following significant risk factors: delusion (OR = 1.69), hallucinations (OR = 1.70), manic symptoms (OR = 1.66), drugs (OR = 1.90) or alcohol abuse (OR = 2.05), perpetration of a crime (OR = 4.33), unemployment (OR = 1.31), and homelessness (OR = 2.49). Other risk factors like previous victimization, impaired social functioning, personality disorder, and living in a disadvantaged neighborhood were found only in 1 or 2 studies. Based on the results, we conclude that, depending on the examined time period, 1 in 5 (assessment period <= 3 y) or 1 in 3 (assessment period entire adulthood) people with a psychotic disorder was victim of a crime. Clinical, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors were significantly associated with victimization, as well as previous victimization. Prospective research into risk factors is needed to capture causal trajectories of victimization.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to systematically review the literature on the contribution of work and lifestyle factors to socioeconomic inequalities in self-rated health among workers.
   Methods A search for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies assessing the contribution of work and/or lifestyle factors to socioeconomic inequalities in self-rated health among workers was performed in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science in March 2017. Two independent reviewers performed eligibility and risk of bias assessment. The median change in odds ratio between models without and with adjustment for work or lifestyle factors across studies was calculated to quantify the contribution of work and lifestyle factors to health inequalities. A best-evidence synthesis was performed.
   Results Of those reviewed, 3 high-quality longitudinal and 17 cross-sectional studies consistently reported work factors to explain part (about one-third) of the socioeconomic health inequalities among workers (grade: strong evidence). Most studies separately investigated physical and psychosocial work factors. In contrast with the 12 cross-sectional studies, 2 longitudinal studies reported no separate contribution of physical workload and physical work environment to health inequalities. Regarding psychosocial work factors, lack of job resources (eg, less autonomy) seemed to contribute to health inequalities, whereas job demands (eg, job overload) might not. Furthermore, 2 longitudinal and 4 cross-sectional studies showed that lifestyle factors explain part (about one-fifth) of the health inequalities (grade: strong evidence).
   Conclusions The large contribution of work factors to socioeconomic health inequalities emphasizes the need for future longitudinal studies to assess which specific work factors contribute to health inequalities.

AB  - Seeking young people's perspectives is integral to delivering effective mental health care. This systematic review aimed to synthesise the qualitative research exploring the life experiences of young people diagnosed with ADHD. Four electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycInfo and SCOPUS) were searched in February 2017 for peer-reviewed, qualitative English language studies exploring the perspectives of adolescents formally diagnosed with ADHD. Eleven studies were included and appraised for methodological quality and a thematic synthesis was undertaken. Participants' stories highlighted both positives and challenges within five analytical themes: Differing perspectives of the problem, Societal pressures, Sense of self, Feelings about medication, and Maturational shift from passive to active. The findings suggested that interpersonal conflict, stigma, and invalidation have a negative psychological impact upon young people's self-esteem and identity. Support strategies are needed to maximise adolescents' resilience, autonomy and abilities.

There is an association between ambient air pollution (AAP) and GDM. This study aimed to summarize the evidence about the association between AAP and GDM.
   Methods: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched from inception till Oct 2017. Studies about the association between ambient air pollutants levels and GDM were included. Pooled effect estimates and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using R.
   Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria.

AB  - Background: Cancer in all its forms and stages is accompanied by a range of emotional, social and spiritual impacts. Pharmacological interventions have limited success with these issues and a range of interventions are needed to support people with a cancer diagnosis. We seek to understand the benefits of participatory performance-based arts activities, such as music, singing, drama and dance, in the care of people with cancer. We use the emerging Energy Restoration Framework, based on Kaplan's Attention Restoration Theory to explore the potentially energy-enhancing aspects of participation in such activities.
   Methods: An integrative review is used to explore existing research on the use of participatory performance-based arts in cancer care. Existing research is summarized and critically appraised. Results are analysed thematically and mapped to the attributes of the Energy Restoration Framework.
   Results: Eight studies (four qualitative, three quantitative and one mixed-methods study) published between 2001 and 2016 met the search criteria. Findings from the thematic analysis resonated with the attributes of the Energy Restoration Framework.
   Conclusions: Research on the topic is very limited. When examined through the lens of the Energy Restoration Framework, the literature hints at the potential value of participatory performance-based arts activities for enhancing energy in the cancer care context.

AB  - This systematic review integrates the existing literature regarding relationships that students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have with their teachers, in mainstream inclusive primary, secondary and high school settings. Theoretical approaches and methodical choices were considered in understanding the literature and considering possible research areas. The methods used in the reviewed literature show that investigations in this research field have predominantly used quantitative surveys. Several theoretical approaches have been used, with attachment theory the most-prominent. The findings indicate students with ADHD generally feel less close to their teacher than do their non-ADHD peers, which agrees with the teachers' perceptions. Thus, teachers experience less emotional closeness, less co-operation and more conflicts in their relations with their students with ADHD than with other students. Teachers' rejection of ADHD students poses a risk factor for not only school failure, but also peer exclusion and rejection, leading to low self-esteem and loneliness.

TI  - Parent-Infant Interaction during the First Year of Life in Infants at High Risk for Cerebral Palsy: A Systematic Review of the Literature
KW  - POSTNATAL DEPRESSION
KW  - ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Introduction. Perinatal adverse events put neonates at high risk for short and long-term disabilities, including cerebral palsy (CP). The most recent guidelines about early intervention in infants with brain damage have emphasized the importance of family involvement from the very first phases of development. Early parent-infant interactions are pivotal in promoting infant cognitive and social developmental trajectories. However, little is known about the extent to which severe adverse perinatal events can affect the quality of early parent-infant interactions. Patients and Methods. We systematically searched five databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) for the publications assessing parent-infant interactions in infants at high neurological risk within 1 year of age. Articles were selected if they involved direct comparison between high-risk populations and healthy controls or low-risk populations, and if quantitative or semiquantitative tools were used to assess the parent-infant interaction. Measures of parent-infant interaction included infant interactive behaviors, parental interactive behaviors, and dyadic interactive patterns. Results. The search yielded 18 publications that met the inclusion criteria. The articles represent a high level of heterogeneity in terms of infant neurological risk, infant age, and tools assessing interactive behaviors. Both infant and maternal behaviors within the investigated interactive exchanges were reported to be compromised, leading to subsequent overall impairment of the dyadic patterns. Conclusion. While the studies reviewed here provide general and important information, the review did not yield a clear picture of early dyadic interactions in high-risk infant populations. Further observational studies are warranted in order to provide a more accurate knowledge of the early dyadic exchanges between infants at high neurological risk and their parents, as they might provide a critical opportunity for early family centered habilitative interventions.

This study investigated whether patients with polymorphisms in genes related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were less likely to respond to antidepressants.
   Method: EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Inclusionary criteria were: 1) patients with depression, 2) study of HPA axis-related candidate genes, 3) at least four weeks of antidepressants, and 4) assessment of depressive symptoms dividing patients into non-responders and responders.
   Results: Nineteen studies were identified. Non-responders and responders did not differ in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding arginine vasopressin. Findings were equivocal regarding genes encoding the FK506 binding protein 5 and glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Specific SNPs and haplotypes within genes related to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRHBP, CRHR1) and melanocortins (POMC) predicted non-responder status.
   Conclusions: Replication studies and additional investigations exploring gene x environment and drug x environment interactions are necessary before pharmacological treatments may be adjusted based on a patient's genetic profile.

AB  - Functional neurological symptom disorder (FNSD) is characterized by neurological symptoms that are unexplained by other traditional neurological or medical conditions. Both physicians and patients have limited understanding of FNSD, which is often explained as a physical manifestation of psychological distress. Recently, diagnostic criteria have shifted from requiring a preceding stressor to relying on positive symptoms. Given this shift, we have provided a review of the etiology of FNSD. Predisposing factors include trauma or psychiatric symptoms, somatic symptoms, illness exposure, symptom monitoring and neurobiological factors. Neurobiological research has indicated that patients with FNSD have a decreased sense of agency and abnormal attentional focus on the affected area, both of which are modulated by beliefs and expectations about illness. Sick role and secondary gain may reinforce and maintain FNSD. The integrated etiological summary model combines research from various fields and other recent etiological models to represent the current understanding of FNSD etiology. It discusses a potential causal mechanism and informs future research and treatment.

AB  - A five-year close reading of the scientific literature on late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) has prompted the invention of a novel therapeutic method that biomechanistically targets the targetable disease-process targets of AD with one or another mixture of non-toxic pleiotropic natural compounds. The featured mixture herein is comprised of curcumin, resveratrol, and EGCG. The mixture's targets include central pathological elements of AD (including amyloid, tau, synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and aberrant neuroinflammation), modifiable risk factors, comorbidities, and epigenetic elements. The featured mixture and other such mixtures are suitable for long-term use, and may be applied to any stage of AD, including primary and secondary prevention. Such mixtures also would be amenable for use as pre-treatment, co-treatment, and post-treatment applications with certain biopharmaceutical agents. The targeting focus here is the major credible hypotheses of AD. The focus of future such articles will include other AD-related targets, modifiable risk factors and comorbidities, APOE4, epigenetic factors, bioavailability, dose response, and implications for clinical testing. The "universal targeting" method described herein-that is, "targeting the targetable targets" of AD using certain mixtures of natural compounds-is reprogrammable and thus is applicable to other chronic neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, ischemic-stroke prevention and recovery, and sports-related head injuries and sequelae leading to chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

The search strategy included PubMed, B-on, Ebsco, Ebsco Health, Scielo, Eric, Lilacs and Sportdiscus data bases. Only observational, cohort and cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analysis. The central descriptors were elderly-frail, older adults, cognition and geriatric assessment and other additional terms. After applying the additional search criteria, 12 manuscripts were selected from an initial universe of 1,078 identified. When comparing the mean cognitive profile scores of the participants of the pre-frail (n = 11,265) and frail (n = 2,460) groups, significant statistical differences were found (p<0,001), with lower mean scores emerging in frail-group. The results showed that cognitive decline is strongly associated with frailty, being a probable main clinical outcome. In this sense, any strategy aimed at mitigating or reversing the incidence of frailty with ageing should take into account that physical and cognitive frailty seem to have similar temporal trajectories.

AB  - Background: Social inclusion involves objective participatory (e.g. education/employment) and subjective (e.g. sense of belonging/acceptance) elements across multiple domains. It has been associated with enhanced physical and mental wellbeing yet is a novel construct in the empirical literature (i.e. measures have not been sufficiently developed). Aims: Young people with serious mental illness are reported to be socially excluded. It is unclear whether this is reflected in the social inclusion/exclusion literature. The aim of this narrative review is to determine whether such literature permits a comprehensive (i.e. multi-dimensional, objective and subjective) understanding of social inclusion among young people with serious mental illness. Methods: Searches to identify studies related to the social inclusion and/or exclusion of young people with serious mental illness were conducted on 16 February 2016, 24 August 2016, 16 February 2017, 24 August 2017 and 16 February 2018 in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Open Grey, Web of Science, Google and Google Scholar. Results: There is a paucity of research in the explicit social inclusion literature involving young people either with or without serious mental illness as participants. Literatures exist in related independent areas of research (e.g. employment, social networks), but such studies employ heterogeneous methodologies. Conclusion: Multi-dimensional measures of social inclusion incorporating objective and subjective indicators must be developed for young people with and without serious mental illness. This will enable the generation of normative and clinical data. Existing evidence for the social exclusion of young people with serious mental illness comes from objective indicators in isolated domains (e.g. unemployment). Subjective indicators continue to be under-researched. The above-described measures must be employed to further understanding of the apparent discrepancies between young people with serious mental illness and those without serious mental illness. This will elucidate the relationships between objective and subjective elements of social inclusion and the relationships between these elements and the psychological distress that young people with serious mental illness often experience. This has implications for intervention.

AB  - Background. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), which are commonly used as a treatment for acute phases and prevention of relapses in bipolar disorder (BD) and schizoaffective disorder (SAD), have been often associated to adverse outcomes in pregnancy and major congenital malformations (MCM). We aimed to summarize available evidence assessing these outcomes when AEDs are used in pregnant women with BD and/or SAD.
   Methods. We searched four databases from inception to 18 January, 2019. We included peer-reviewed observational studies on the use of AEDs in pregnant women with BD or SAD. We excluded studies not reporting data on BD or SAD, not specifying the AED or not assessing pregnancy outcomes or MCM.
   Results. The pooled records amounted to 2,861. After duplicate removal and inclusion/exclusion criteria application, we included 9 observational studies assessing patients with BD and SAD. The AEDs evaluated were lamotrigine (LTG), valproate (VPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine (OXC), topiramate (TPR), and gabapentin (GBP). VPA and CBZ were the AED most commonly associated to MCM. LTG showed the best safety profile. Higher rates of complications during pregnancy were observed in treated and untreated women with BD compared to healthy controls.
   Conclusions. AEDs may produce adverse outcomes in pregnancy and MCM in children of pregnant women with BD or SAD, showing higher risks at higher doses. LTG could be considered in this type of patients, given the low rate of adverse events. VPA and CBZ use should be avoided during pregnancy.

This theoretical view applies both to emotion research in general and the specific fields of my interest in the emotions of moral judgment and intergroup processes. Methodologically, developments in analyses of large and more naturally occurring data sets will give an opportunity to square psychology's structural models of discrete emotions with the more complicated reality that exists. Both for the field and for individual researchers picking up the study of emotions, my advice is to pay special attention to measures, their assumptions and their context.

AB  - Amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) accumulation and aggregation have been considered for many years the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and therefore have been the principal target of investigation as well as of the proposed therapeutic approaches (Grasso [2011] Mass Spectrom Rev. 30: 347-365). However, the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which considers A beta accumulation the only causative agent of the disease, has proven to be incomplete if not wrong. In recent years, actors such as metal ions, oxidative stress, and other cofactors have been proposed as possible co-agents or, in some cases, main causative factors of AD. In this scenario, MS investigation has proven to be fundamental to design possible diagnostic strategies of this elusive disease, as well as to understand the biomolecular mechanisms involved, in the attempt to find a possible therapeutic solution. We review the current applications of MS in the search for possible A beta biomarkers of AD to help the diagnosis of the disease. Recent examples of the important contributions that MS has given to prove or build theories on the molecular pathways involved with such terrible disease are also reviewed.

AB  - Motor vehicle emissions constitute a mixture of different chemicals: volatile organic solvents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, isocyanates, etc. Drivers working in car cabins are exposed to chemicals deriving from incomplete combustion of fuels, exhaust emissions from working engines and fuel evaporation. Concentrations of these substances are rather low and do not exceed the applicable hygiene standards, but some of them pose, or are suspected to pose, carcinogenic risk. The interaction of chemical substances with human cells and tissues can lead to a number of modifications of metabolic pathways at a cellular level. The first biological mechanism of metabolic modulation is an inflammatory state and oxidative stress generation. The aim of this review is to analyze biomarkers of effect and to assess the hazard of occupational exposure of drivers.

AB  - Background One of the most common problems that the elderly with chronic diseases, especially diabetes, faces is lack or poor medical adherence. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of interventions in increasing medical adherence in the elderly with type 2 diabetes. Methods The databases of Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and web of science were searched until April 2017 free from time and language limitation. In review, only randomized controlled trial (RCT) design studies were investigated. The studies of interest were evaluated from three perspectives: educational intervention with or without theories/models of health education and promotion, educational intervention (individual or group education), and noneducational intervention to increase medical adherence. The qualification of RCTs was evaluated through Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. Results Finally, five studies were considered in this systematic review. Educational interventions were used in all of the studies, and in three of these studies, noneducational interventions such as support group, psychiatric consultation, and phone consultation were implemented along with educational intervention. In all studies, medical adherence in the intervention group increased when compared with the control group or basic conditions (p < .05). All RCTs had high risk of bias. Conclusion This review provides evidence which must be considered in the elderly with diabetes a combination of the educational and noneducational methods to increase medical adherence. It is necessary to conduct studies with higher quality to assess the efficacy of interventions.

KW  - PROFESSIONALISM
AB  - Introduction: Education in medicine faces a number of challenges and dilemmas and the onus is on Medical hodegetics, an important but almost forgotten discipline, to address them effectively. The task and final goal of education in medicine is to coach students into professionals, effective and ethical practitioners of medicine, giving them the best available knowledge, skills and attitudes and providing them with a professional identity so that they are able to think, speak, act and feel like medical doctors. During the life course human beings organize their experiences into a meaningful narrative that involves their personal, private, public and professional selves. The self can be defined as a distinct principle of identity, as a narrative construction and as an experiential dimension.
   Aim: The aim of this paper is to address the actuality and vitality of the hodegetic approach in medical education and professionalism.
   Methods: By cross-sectional study authors of the paper searched on-line scientific data-bases and analyzed references about Medical hodegetics subject.
   Results: Drawing on the literature on psychology of self, identity formation and personality styles as well as on own experience in medical education, the authors stress the increasing importance of medical hodegetics, very useful, but almost completely forgotten discipline. Medical hodegetics which involves all evidence-based medicine, values-based medicine, narrative medicine and person-centered medicine can significantly improve the quality of medical education. The identity of any person in any moment reflects its three domains: individual identity, relational identity, and collective identity, all relevant to medical education. The concept of professional identity formation has recently emerged and attracted great attention in literature on medical education and professionalism. Hodegetics, as a discipline that trains it, seems to us that the essential part of life and what every person should follow.
   Concluson: Medical hodegetics is an important pillar of the triad of medical deontology as well as it could be an important discipline in medical education and professional identity formation.

AB  - Emerging evidence now indicates that mitochondria are central regulators of neural stem cell (NSC) fate decisions and are crucial for both neurodevelopment and adult neurogenesis, which in turn contribute to cognitive processes in the mature brain. Inherited mutations and accumulated damage to mitochondria over the course of ageing serve as key factors underlying cognitive defects in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, respectively. In this Review, we explore the recent findings that implicate mitochondria as crucial regulators of NSC function and cognition. In this respect, mitochondria may serve as targets for stem-cell-based therapies and interventions for cognitive defects.

AB  - Nutrition and diet have been suggested to enhance or inhibit cognitive performance and the risk of several neurodegenerative diseases. We conducted a systematic review to elucidate the relationship between the inflammatory capacity of a person's diet and the risk of incident neurodegenerative diseases. We searched major medical databases for articles published through June 30, 2018. Original, full-text, English-language articles on studies with human participants which investigated the link between dietary inflammatory potential and risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases were included. Duplicate and irrelevant studies were removed, and data were compiled through critical analysis. Initially, 457 articles were collected via the searching method, of which 196 studies remained after removal of duplicates. Fourteen articles were screened and found to be relevant to the scope of the review. After critical analysis, 10 were included in the final review. In all studies but one, a higher dietary inflammatory index (DII) was related to higher risk of developing neurodegenerative disease symptoms, including memory and cognition decline and multiple sclerosis. Of 3 studies that assessed the association of DII with levels of circulating inflammation markers, 2 indicated that DII was positively correlated with inflammatory marker levels. Low literacy, an unhealthy lifestyle, and individual nutritional status were the factors involved in a diet with inflammatory potential. These findings enhance confidence that DII is an appropriate tool for measurement of dietary inflammatory potential and validate the role of diets with inflammatory potential in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. DII may be correlated with levels of circulating inflammatory markers.

Recent research suggests that healthier children learn better and that more educated adults are healthier. School health is a cross-disciplinary field of study and a fundamental strategy that can be used to improve both health and education outcomes. Modern school health programs include 10 interactive components: health education; physical education and physical activity; nutrition environment and services; health services; counseling, psychological, and social services; physical environment; social and emotional climate; family engagement; community involvement; and employee wellness. This review is written for both health and education audiences. It integrates recent research and developments in relationships among health, education, and economic outcomes; health and education systems; the school health program, its components, and their effectiveness; cross-disciplinary collaboration; local, state, national, and international infrastructures and strategies; implementation science; and relevant academic research, training, and service.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a selective loss of the neurons in the midbrain area called the substantia nigra pars compacta and the loss of projecting nerve fibers in the striatum. Predominant pathological hallmarks of PD are the degeneration of discrete neuronal populations and progressive accumulation of alpha-synuclein-containing intracytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies and dystrophic Lewy neuritis. There is currently no therapy to terminate or delay the neurodegenerative process as the exact mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PD require further investigation. The identification and validation of novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD is a great challenge using contemporary approaches and optimizing sampling handling as well as interpretation using bioinformatics analysis. In this review, recent evidences associated with multiomic data-sets and molecular mechanisms underlying PD are examined. A combined mapping of several transcriptional evidences could establish a patient-specific signature for early diagnose of PD though eligible systems biology tools, which can also help develop effective drug-based therapeutic approaches.

This study aimed to analyze the profile of scientific publications between 2000 and 2015, about news reporting public health issues. It included 64 articles, organized in categories such as: subject, data production, methods of analysis and media investigated. The predominant theme was media coverage of diseases, with emphasis on infectious diseases. Qualitative studies, documentary research and both discourse and content analyses were prevalent. Newspapers were the most researched media. In conclusion, important challenges in this field emerge: the low diversity of themes and approaches adopted, as well as the media investigated, and the need to enlarge the scope of methodological strategies.

AB  - Introduction: Emotional intelligence (EI) has been defined as the ability to perceive, understand, use and manage emotions. Studying EI could potentially be useful in understanding addictive behaviors as well as for designing and planning interventions.
   Objectives: To conduct a critical review on EI impairment in addiction disorders.
   Methods: MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, LILACS, and SciELO databases were searched. Articles that used the standardized Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) instrument to assess EI in people with addictions and healthy controls were selected for the review.
   Results: We selected seven articles assessing EI and its associations with addiction disorders, mainly alcohol abuse and cocaine dependence. Most studies reported that individuals with addiction disorders had worse EI scores when compared to controls.
   Conclusion: Overall, the studies reviewed demonstrated that addictions are associated with EI deficits, compared to controls. However, aspects such as the small number of addictive disorders analyzed, methodological issues related to instruments for assessment of IE and the lack of follow-up remain significant limitations.

Two waves of electronic searches of the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane library, IEEE Digital Library and PsycINFO databases were conducted. In total, eight articles from six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. The results of the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), especially agitation and depression, in people with dementia who were treated with PRI. Both individual and group format PRI significantly ameliorated BPSD. However, there were no significant improvements in cognitive function or quality of life. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that PRI may be suitable as a treatment option for BPSD in people with dementia and should be considered as a useful tool in clinical practice.

AB  - The field of epigenetics, which is the study of factors regulating gene transcription, is expanding rapidly. Yet one area that has received little attention is the influence of epigenetic factors on human consciousness. We examine this topic by investigating how transcriptional regulation modulates the development and ongoing functioning of the human brain, mediates interactions between the environment and the genome, and may contribute to the evolution of consciousness. Epigenetics is demonstrated to play an instrumental role in human consciousness throughout the lifespan and over the course of multiple generations. Further research is recommended to broaden and deepen our understanding of the relationship between epigenetics and human consciousness.

AB  - Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common known cause of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD) and sporadic PD (sPD). The clinical presentation of LRRK2 PD is similar to sPD, and except for genetic testing, no biochemical or imaging markers can differentiate LRRK2 PD from sPD. Discovery of such biomarkers could indicate neuropathological mechanisms that are unique to or increased in LRRK2 PD. This review discusses findings in 17 LRRK2 - related CSF studies found on PubMed. Most of these studies compared analyte concentrations between four diagnostic groups: LRRK2 PD patients, sPD patients, asymptomatic control subjects carrying PD-associated LRRK2 mutations (LRRK2 CTL), and healthy control subjects lacking LRRK2 mutations (CTL). Analytes examined in these studies included A beta 1-42, tau, alpha-synuclein, oxidative stress markers, autophagy-related proteins, pteridines, neurotransmitter metabolites, exosomal LRRK2 protein, RNA species, inflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and intermediary metabolites. FINDINGS: Pteridines, alpha-synuclein, mtDNA, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, alpha-D-glucose, lamp2, interleukin-8, and vascular endothelial growth factor were suggested to differentiate LRRK2 PD from sPD patients; 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-isoprostane (8-ISO), 2-hydroxybutyrate, mtDNA, lamp2, and neopterin may differentiate between LRRK2 CTL and LRRK2 PD subjects; and soluble oligomeric alpha-synuclein, 8-OHdG, and 8-ISO might differentiate LRRK2 CTL from CTL subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The low numbers of investigations of each analyte, small sample sizes, and methodological differences limit conclusions that can be drawn from these studies. Further investigations are indicated to determine the validity of the analytes identified in these studies as possible biomarkers for LRRK2 PD patients and/or LRRK2 CTL subjects.

AB  - Many processes in the human body - including brain function - are regulated over the 24-hour cycle, and there are strong associations between disrupted circadian rhythms (for example, sleep-wake cycles) and disorders of the CNS. Brain disorders such as autism, depression and Parkinson disease typically develop at certain stages of life, and circadian rhythms are important during each stage of life for the regulation of processes that may influence the development of these disorders. Here, we describe circadian disruptions observed in various brain disorders throughout the human lifespan and highlight emerging evidence suggesting these disruptions affect the brain. Currently, much of the evidence linking brain disorders and circadian dysfunction is correlational, and so whether and what kind of causal relationships might exist are unclear. We therefore identify remaining questions that may direct future research towards a better understanding of the links between circadian disruption and CNS disorders.

AB  - Fewer than 5% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are demonstrably directly inherited, indicating that environmental factors may be important in initiating and/or promoting the disease. Excess iron is toxic to cells; iron overload in the AD brain may aggressively accelerate AD. Magnetite nanoparticles, capable of catalyzing formation of reactive oxygen species, occur in AD plaques and tangles; they are thought to form in situ, from pathological iron dysfunction. A recent study has identified in frontal cortex samples the abundant presence of magnetite nanoparticles consistent with high-temperature formation; identifying therefore their external, not internal source. These magnetite particles range from similar to 10 to 150 nm in size, and are often associated with other, non-endogenous metals (including platinum, cadmium, cerium). Some display rounded crystal morphologies and fused surface textures, reflecting cooling and crystallization from an initially heated, iron-bearing source material. Precisely-matching magnetite 'nanospheres' occur abundantly in roadside air pollution, arising from vehicle combustion and, especially, frictional brake-wear. Airborne magnetite pollution particles <similar to 200 nm in size can access the brain directly via the olfactory and/or trigeminal nerves, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Given their toxicity, abundance in roadside air, and nanoscale dimensions, traffic-derived magnetite pollution nanoparticles may constitute a chronic and pernicious neurotoxicant, and hence an environmental risk factor for AD, for large population numbers globally. Olfactory nerve damage displays strong association with AD development. Reported links between AD and occupational magnetic fields (e.g., affecting welders, machinists) may instead reflect inhalation exposure to airborne magnetic nanoparticles.

AB  - The Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 is a large population-based birth cohort, which aims to promote health and wellbeing of the population. In this paper, we systematically review the psychiatric research performed in the cohort until today, i.e. at the age of 32 years of the cohort (2018). We conducted a systematic literature search using the databases of PubMed and Scopus and complemented it with a manual search. We found a total of 94 articles, which were classified as examining ADHD, emotional and behavioural problems, psychosis risk or other studies relating to psychiatric subjects. The articles are mainly based on two large comprehensive follow-up studies of the cohort and several substudies. The studies have often used also nationwide register data. The studies have found several early predictors for the aforementioned psychiatric outcomes, such as problems at pregnancy and birth, family factors in childhood, physical inactivity and substance use in adolescence. There are also novel findings relating to brain imaging and cognition, for instance regarding familial risk of psychosis in relation to resting state functional MRI. The Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 has been utilised frequently in psychiatric research and future data collections are likely to lead to new scientifically important findings.

AB  - Telomere length (TL) has been suggested to be a surrogate for cellular ageing, and a record of cumulative inflammation and oxidative stress over life. An emerging body of evidence has associated exposure to air pollution to changes in TL. To date there is no available systematic review of literature on this association. We aimed to systematically review and conduct meta-analysis of published studies on the relationship between air pollution and TL in adults. Electronic databases were systematically searched for available English language studies on the association between air pollution and TL published up to 1 July 2018. Meta-analyses were conducted following MOOSE guidelines. The heterogeneity in the reported associations was assessed using Cochran's Q test and quantified as I-2 index. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression. Our search identified 19 eligible studies including 11 retrospective and eight prospective studies of which, four had excellent quality, ten had good quality and five had fair quality. Meta analysis result of two studies on long-term exposure to PM2.5 showed an inverse association between these exposures and it (for 5 mu g/m(3) PM2.5-0.03 95% CI; -0.05, -0.01). Meta-analysis of short-term exposure to PM2.5 with three studies and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) with two studies revealed a direct association between these exposures and TL, (0.03 95% CI; 0.02, 0.04 and 0.10 95% CI; 0.06, 0.15 respectively). No statistically significant relationship between exposure to PM10 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure and it were observed. We observed suggestive evidence for associations between air pollution and TL with potentially different direction of associations for short- and long-term exposures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the wide variety of factors affecting work-related stress, a work system approach could be adopted in order to better identify factors that impact individual stress.
   OBJECTIVES: To provide a scoping review of the available work-related stress questionnaires and to reclassify their scales on the basis of the five elements included in the work system model using a content analysis method.
   METHODS: The main available work-related stress questionnaires used in previous studies in the time range of 1975 to 2017 were collected through a search in several indexing and citation databases. To reclassify the scales of these questionnaires, a qualitative content analysis was used and then reclassified in accordance with the five components of work system model: job (tasks), organizational condition, individual characteristics, technology and tools, and physical environmental.
   RESULTS: In total, 22 questionnaires met the conditions required to be entered into the final stage of the study. Emphasis of these questionnaires was on measuring job-related factors and organizational condition-related factors. 22.7% of them had considered no scales to measure the individual characteristics-related factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the reclassification can help organizations select areas that encompass their own specific problems. Practical implications are also discussed.

AB  - Objective: A systematic review was performed to study factors of occurrence and improvement methods of presenteeism attributed to diabetes.
   Methods: We set 2 clinical questions; (a) how comorbidities and complications of diabetes induce presenteeism and (b) what interventions or conditions effectively improve presenteeism. Then, we conducted a comprehensive search with MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases and extracted those that met the clinical questions.
   Results: Eighteen papers studied occurrence of presenteeism by comorbidities and complications of diabetes. Most studies were cross-sectional and had a low quality of evidence. However, the associations of hypoglycemia, diabetic neuropathy, and mood disorders with presenteeism were relatively well studied. The papers that discussed effective interventions or conditions for improving presenteeism were very limited.
   Conclusions: Our review suggests that presenteeism attributed to diabetes is mainly caused by hypoglycemia, diabetic neuropathy, and mood disorders. There are very limited evidences, but available information suggests that improving glycemic control, adjusting treatment regimen by evaluating the impact on work, providing psychological support, and developing suitable work accommodations may effectively reduce presenteeism.

AB  - This article presents the results of a workshop held in Stirling, Scotland in June 2018, called to examine critically the effects of low-dose ionising radiation on the ecosphere. The meeting brought together participants from the fields of low- and high-dose radiobiology and those working in radioecology to discuss the effects that low doses of radiation have on non-human biota. In particular, the shape of the low-dose response relationship and the extent to which the effects of low-dose and chronic exposure may be predicted from high dose rate exposures were discussed. It was concluded that high dose effects were not predictive of low dose effects. It followed that the tools presently available were deemed insufficient to reliably predict risk of low dose exposures in ecosystems. The workshop participants agreed on three major recommendations for a path forward. First, as treating radiation as a single or unique stressor was considered insufficient, the development of a multidisciplinary approach is suggested to address key concerns about multiple stressors in the ecosphere. Second, agreed definitions are needed to deal with the multiplicity of factors determining outcome to low dose exposures as a term can have different meanings in different disciplines. Third, appropriate tools need to be developed to deal with the different time, space and organisation level scales. These recommendations permit a more accurate picture of prospective risks.

AB  - BackgroundTo better understand and prevent suicide and homicide, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) in six states in 2002. As of 2018, the NVDRS has been expanded to include all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The purpose of this review was to assess the research utility of the NVDRS based on studies indexed in major bibliographical databases.MethodsWe performed a scoping review of published studies that were based on data from the NVDRS, identified by searching six electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, OVID, Scopus, and Web of Science. We examined the time trend of annual NVDRS-based research output, generated a word cloud using the keywords listed in the publications, and mapped the knowledge domains covered by NVDRS-based studies.ResultsOur review included a total of 150 studies published between 2005 and 2018. There was a marked increase in the annual number of NVDRS-based publications, with 120 (80.0%) of the 150 studies published between 2011 and 2018. Overall, 104 (69.3%) studies focused on suicide and 39 (26.0%) on homicide. Of the included studies, 100 (66.7%) were descriptive epidemiology, 31 (20.7%) were risk factor analyses, 9 (6.0%) were evaluations, 7 (4.7%) were trend analyses, and 4 (2.7%) were data quality assessments. Knowledge domain mapping identified two major clusters of studies, one on suicide and the other on homicide. The cluster on suicide was commonly linked to "circumstance," "alcohol" and "substance abuse" and the cluster on homicide was commonly linked to "firearm," "injury," and "gang." The two clusters were interlinked to overlapping networks of keywords, such as "firearm" and "mental health problem."ConclusionsResearch utility of the NVDRS has increased considerably in recent years. Studies based on data from the NVDRS are clustered in two knowledge domains - suicide and homicide. The vast potential of the NVDRS for violence research and prevention remains to be fully exploited.

AB  - Objective: No international review has been published on the economic burden of high utilizers (HUs) diagnosed with severe mental illness (SMI). In this review, we aimed to identify healthcare costs and service use of HUs diagnosed with SMI on a global basis. Methods: Three separate searches yielded peer-reviewed sources (N = 3051). We used a quality index to determine the rigor of research methods in selected studies. Results: We reduced sources based on inclusion criteria and removal of duplicates (N = 19). Conclusions: Current research fails to quantify global healthcare costs associated with HUs diagnosed with SMI. The most frequent services sought by HUs diagnosed with SMI were for chronic mental health conditions. The most prevalent and costly diagnosis was schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) is an episodic psychiatric disorder that is associated with considerable morbidity. Psychiatrists have found it difficult to treat the disorder owing to the variety of presentation and variety of challenges in clinical decision-making. To guide the clinicians, the concept of predominant polarity (PP) in BPAD has become important. This review was conducted to understand the definition, epidemiology, relationship with sociodemographic and clinical parameters, and implications of PP in BPAD. Methodology: The review was conducted after selecting 17 original research studies from PubMed using appropriate search terms. Results: There is no consensus definition of PP. Epidemiological data showed varied results, although most common PP demonstrated in most studies was depressive polarity. The relation between sociodemographic and clinical parameters also lacked uniformity, although certain patterns could be identified in their relationships. The implications of PP in diagnostics, treatment, and classificatory system are discussed. Conclusion: PP in BPAD conveys clinically important information that aids a clinician in decision-making. Further studies are required so that we can understand the neurobiological underpinning of the concept.

AB  - Introduction: Emotional intelligence (EI) is a theoretical construct postulated by Mayer and Salovey to designate the ability to perceive, understand, use and manage emotions. The study of EI in schizophrenia offers new insights into the disorder's cognitive and functional impacts.
   Objectives: To comprehensively review studies analyzing EI impairment in schizophrenia spectrum disorders using standardized instruments.
   Methods: Searches were run on MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, LILACS, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and SciELO databases. The only validated instrument used was the Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale (MSCEIT). Articles that used all branches of the MSCEIT to assess EI in schizophrenia spectrum disorders and healthy controls were included in the review.
   Results: We found 30 articles on this topic. The studies analyzed showed a significant impairment of MSCEIT total score in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders when compared to healthy controls. In relation to the MSCEIT branches, understanding of emotions and management of emotions are the most impaired branches.
   Conclusion: Since most studies are cross-sectional, it is not possible to establish a cause and effect relationship between EI deficits and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Therefore, longitudinal studies are needed to establish a clearer relationship between these variables. By so doing, we may be able to intervene for prevention and management of these disorders, aiming at better quality of life for patients.

AB  - Objective This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of the effectiveness of health promotion interventions at the workplace on physical and mental health outcomes related to chronic diseases.
   Methods A search for reviews published between 2009 and 2018 was performed in electronic databases. References of the included reviews were checked for additional reviews. Workplace health promotion interventions were included if they studied metabolic risk factors as important predictors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or if they studied mental or musculoskeletal health outcomes. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist.
   Results Of the 23 reviews included, 9 were of high quality. For weight-related outcomes, there was strong evidence for favorable effects of workplace interventions, especially for interventions targeting physical activity and/or diet. For the remaining metabolic risk factors, there was no evidence for a positive effect of workplace health promotion interventions due to the absence of high quality reviews and mixed conclusions between the reviews. There was also strong evidence for a positive, small effect on the prevention of mental health disorders of workplace psychological interventions, especially those that use e- health and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. Furthermore, strong evidence was found for the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders through workplace interventions, especially resistance exercise training.
   Conclusions This review found evidence for the effectiveness of workplace interventions on the prevention of weight-related outcomes as well as mental health and musculoskeletal disorders. Future research is however needed on the factors that contribute to the successful implementation of an intervention.
